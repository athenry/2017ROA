Abstract = {{The branching structures and bifurcation flows in human lung are crucial
   factors for the functioning of the respiratory system. In this paper,
   both steady and unsteady flow in a symmetrical bronchial tree have been
   investigated, and the global and local transport properties are explored
   by fractal geometry and computational fluid dynamics method,
   respectively. Firstly, total flow properties for steady laminar flow and
   pulsatile flow in a fractal tree-like network are derived, and the
   global fluid dynamics behavior under volume constrain is discussed
   accordingly. And then, a mathematical model is developed for the steady
   and unsteady gas flow as well as gas-particle two-phase flow in a
   four-generation bifurcation in order to study the local transport
   characteristics of bronchial tree. The results indicate that the
   critical successive diameter ratio for the first few generations is
   below the prediction of Murray's law while small airways follow Murray's
   law. It has been also shown that the asymmetrical and non-uniform flow
   distribution can be realized through a symmetric branching structure
   with increased Reynolds number. The asymmetric ratio is found to be
   scaled with the Reynolds number as chi similar to Re-0.00124 in the
   steady respiratory condition. The effect of Reynolds number and
   respiratory frequency on the flow distribution and particle deposit
   efficiency are studied for different respiratory conditions, which show
   that the particle deposit efficiency can be increased with increased
   Stokes number. The present work is important for the morphology of the
   bronchial tree and understanding the physical mechanism of the
   bifurcation flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   f(VPBA, 0)=0.10 using dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solvent being most
   effective, as seen by a linear increase in number average molecular
   weight, M-n, versus conversion and low dispersity, (D < 1.40. The
   copolymers were further chain-extended with a second batch of VPBA,
   resulting in a block copolymer with monomodal molecular weight

   composition and polymer solution concentration resulted in decreases in

Abstract = {{Many applications of wheeled robots include operations in unstructured
   environments. Optimizing vehicle mobility is of key importance in these
   cases. Reduced mobility can limit the ability of the robot to achieve
   the mission goals and can even render it immobile in extreme cases. In
   this paper, some aspects of the effect of the wheel-ground interaction
   force distribution on mobility are investigated. A performance index
   based on the normal force distribution is used to compare different
   design layouts and vehicle configurations. The validity of this index
   was assessed using both multibody dynamics simulation and experimental
   results obtained with a six-wheeled rover prototype. Results confirmed
   that modifying the system configuration and employing active suspensions
   to alter the normal force distribution can lead to an increase of
   traction force available at the wheel-terrain interfaces, thus improving
   rover mobility. Finally, the study was extended to consider the change
   of soil properties during operation due to the multipass effect. Optimum
   load distributions were obtained as the solution of a constrained
   maximization problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding soil-geogrid interaction is essential for the analysis and
   design of geogrid-reinforced soil structures. A first step towards
   accurate modeling of this interaction is choosing a suitable material
   model for the geogrid that is capable of simulating tensile test
   results. The model must be able to capture the three-dimensional
   response of the geogrid considering its exact geometry. Modeling geogrid
   inclusion as a continuous sheet has proven to reasonably simulate the
   overall response of soil-geogrid systems; however, it does not explain
   the different sources of interaction between the geogrid layer and the
   surrounding soil. To understand the three-dimensional aspects of this
   complex interaction problem, a two-phase numerical investigation is
   developed in this study. The first phase focuses on the
   three-dimensional modeling of unconfined biaxial geogrid subjected to
   tensile loading. Applicability of the geogrid model in solving
   soil-structure interaction problems is then demonstrated, in the second
   phase, by investigating the response of a reinforced subgrade subjected
   to a square shaped surface loading. It is concluded that modeling the
   three-dimensional geogrid geometry is important to accurately capture
   the true response of geogrid under both confined and unconfined
   conditions. The modeling approach proposed in this study for the
   analysis of unconfined and soil-confined geogrid can be adapted for
   other reinforced soil applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Abstract = {{Graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) are a stack of 5-20 layers of highly
   crystalline graphene sheets having a planar size of approximately 100 by
   100 nm and low defect concentration. They are produced here through
   homogeneous nucleation following the plasma decomposition of a carbon
   source in an inductively coupled thermal plasma reactor. Following
   synthesis within the plasma reactor, the GNFs are functionalized
   downstream in the plasma recombination zone with the addition of oxygen
   to the main plasma stream. Tunable oxygen functionalization is obtained
   and values up to 14.2 atomic percent are reached on the surface of the
   particles. While the non-functionalized GNFs are hydrophobic, the
   oxygen-functionalized GNFs (O-GNFs) show full stability of all the
   produced powders when directly dispersed in water or ethanol without any
   surfactant. The O-GNFs keep their structural integrity even after the
   implementation of the hydrophilic groups on the surface of the
   nanoparticles, and maintain their dispersion stability in water and
   ethanol over a long period of time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An integrated model WHCNS (soil Water Heat Carbon Nitrogen Simulator)
   was developed to assess water and nitrogen (N) management in North
   China. It included five main modules: soil water, soil temperature, soil
   carbon (C), soil N, and crop growth. The model integrated some features
   of several widely used crop and soil models, and some modifications were
   made in order to apply the WHCNS model under the complex conditions of
   intensive cropping systems in North China. The WHCNS model was evaluated
   using an open access dataset from the European International Conference
   on Modeling Soil Water and N Dynamics. WHCNS gave better estimations of
   soil water and N dynamics, dry matter accumulation and N uptake than 14
   other models. The model was tested against data from four experimental
   sites in North China under various soil, crop, climate, and management
   practices. Simulated soil water content, soil nitrate concentrations,
   crop dry matter, leaf area index and grain yields all agreed well with
   measured values. This study indicates that the WHCNS model can be used
   to analyze and evaluate the effects of various field management
   practices on crop yield, fate of N, and water and N use efficiencies in

Abstract = {{Centrifugal concentrators have been widely used to recover fine gold
   over the past few decades, the main drawback being the large volume of
   water required during the operation. As water is an increasingly
   important commodity, investigating dry processing to reduce water usage
   is of great importance. This work investigated using a laboratory scale
   Knelson Concentrator with a dry feed, and air being used to replace
   water as the fluidising medium and size-by-size testing of material. A
   synthetic ore comprised of tungsten and quartz was used to mimic a gold
   ore. Response surface methodology and central composite design were used
   for modelling and optimisation with the experimental variables being the
   motor power (MP) (\%), air fluidizing pressure (AFP) (psi) and solid
   feed rate (SFR) (g/min). The observed results of the three size classes
   indicated that amongst the three variables; the motor power had the
   greatest impact when comparing to the other two variables. Different
   optimum conditions had been found for -425 + 150 mu m, -150 + 53 mu m
   and -53 mu m size fractions and these are 30\% MP, 200 g/min SFR and 10
   psi AFP, 50\% MP, 160 g/min SFR and 11 psi AFP, 65\% MP, 200 g/min SFR
   and 11 psi AFP, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Activated quartz and hematite tracers between 1180 and 1700 gm in
   diameter were tracked in two sections of the first two turns of a spiral
   concentrator to ascertain information on valuable and gangue particle
   motion. The tracking took place while the tracer was flowing in a 20\%
   solids by mass iron ore slurry. The direct activation of mineral
   particles, combined with the use of an adjustable height circular
   assembly of modular positron emission particle tracking detectors, has
   made this tracking possible. The tracer particle trajectories and speeds
   are presented in this paper. An early separation into two streams
   (concentrate or loss to tailings) can be seen for certain runs of the
   hematite tracers. Tracers speeds and radial position from the centre of
   the spiral give more details about the presence of the slurry film's
   secondary flow in the middle zone of the spiral trough. Particle inward
   and outward migration speed in this secondary circulation is presented.
   The speed of this migration is approximately 0.12 m/s inward and 0.15
   m/s outward for the set-up used. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A new analytical method is proposed for the determination of a wide span
   of fluoroalkylated surfactants (PFASs) of various chain lengths and
   polarities in sediments, including newly-identified compounds such as
   zwitterionic and cationic PFASs. Extraction conditions were optimized so
   as to maintain a common preparation procedure for all analytes (recovery
   range: 60-110\%). Instrumental analysis was performed with ultra-high
   performance liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometry
   through polarity-switching electrospray ionization. Calibration curves
   with excellent coefficients of determination (R-2 > 0.994) were
   generally obtained over 0.002-10 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) and limits of
   detection were in the range 0.0006-0.46 ng g(-1) dw. Intra-day precision
   remained < 9\% and inter-day precision < 23\%. While perfluorooctane
   sulfonate (PFOS) generally prevailed over other perfluoroalkyl acids
   (PFAAs) in sediments from mainland France, fluorotelomer sulfonamide
   amines and fluorotelomer sulfonamide betaines were also ubiquitous in
   these samples, especially in the vicinity of airports wherein
   firefighting training activities may occur on a regular basis. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This study explored the ability of coupled machine learning models and

   Basin of Ethiopia. The potential of wavelet transforms coupled with the
   bootstrap and boosting ensemble techniques to develop reliable
   artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR)
   models was explored in this study for drought prediction. Wavelet
   analysis was used as a pre-processing tool and was shown to improve
   drought predictions. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (in this
   case SPI 3, SPI 12 and SPI 24) is a meteorological drought index that
   was forecasted using the aforementioned models and these SPI values
   represent short and long-term drought conditions. The performances of
   all models were compared using RMSE, MAE, and R-2. The prediction
   results indicated that the use of the boosting ensemble technique
   consistently improved the correlation between observed and predicted
   SPIs. In addition, the use of wavelet analysis improved the prediction
   results of all models. Overall, the wavelet boosting ANN (WBS-ANN) and
   wavelet boosting SVR (WBS-SVR) models provided better prediction results
   compared to the other model types evaluated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Detection of trends in days with thunderstorms in Iran over the past
   five decades}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{174-185}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Thunderstorms, which usually occur when there are cumulonimbus (Cb)
   clouds in the sky, can be a natural hazard if they are severe. Most
   previous studies have focused on the physical and dynamic structure of
   thunderstorms, with little focus on exploring the trends of thunderstorm
   occurrence. In this paper, the time series of days with thunderstorms
   were studied at 30 synoptic stations in Iran during the past five
   decades (1961 to 2010). The non-parametric Mann Kendall statistical
   method was the main approach employed since it is very useful in
   hydro-meteorological studies. The results of this study showed that the
   trend of days with thunderstorms in Iran was positive in most parts of
   the country for all months of the year. The largest area with positive
   and significant trends occurred in April and May, especially in the
   northwestern and northern parts of Iran. Based on the annual time
   series, more than 90\% of the country's area had positive (significant
   or non-significant) trends. In addition, no significant negative trends
   were observed in days with thunderstorms for any months of the year in
   the study region. This research supports the hypothesis that climate
   change can have significant effects on extreme atmospheric phenomena.
   Additional research is necessary to explore the climatic and physical
   causes of the trends presented in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{During the intraerythrocytic stage of malaria, the parasite digests
   hemoglobin and aggregates the released heme as an insoluble crystalline
   material called hemozoin. This detoxification step is an excellent drug
   target for developing new antlinalarials which can bind to hemozoin
   surface to inhibit further growth. Although the bulk crystalline
   properties of hemozoin are well-known, the surface properties remain
   poorly defined. Here, we use a combination of spectroscopic and
   adsorption techniques to study the surface of synthetic hemozoin,
   hematin anhydride, produced by two different methods: We show that the
   two Synthetic methods produce crystals with major differences, such as
   the amount of water adsorbed on the surface and surface carboxylate
   groups. These results imply that the methodology to produce hematin
   anhydride affects its surface reactivity; this information needs to be
   considered whenever hematin anhydride is used as a model to study host
   immune response or to design new antimalarials.}},

Abstract = {{This study numerically evaluates the effect of secondary flow on the
   reaction performance in heterogeneous gaseous spiral coiled reactor
   utilizing selective wall coatings. Laminar multispecies gas flow in
   spiral coiled reactor with circular and square cross-section is
   investigated using a validated three-dimensional computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) model. Various selective wall coating strategies are
   evaluated within a range of Reynolds number. The reactor performance is
   measured not only based on the conversion rate but also in terms of
   figure of merit (FoM) defined as reaction throughput per unit pumping
   power and catalyst coating active area. The results indicate that
   secondary flow enhance reaction performance and improve catalyst
   utilization, especially at the outer wall. By maximizing this effect,
   the requirement of expensive catalyst materials can be minimized. This
   study highlight the potential of selective catalyst coating in coiled
   reactor for process intensification and cost reduction in various
   applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Impact assessments on river systems of the combined effect of bed and
   suspended sediment loads from quarries are difficult to find. In this
   study, bed and suspended loads were measured to determine the impact of
   a 20-ha limestone quarry on the river system of its 5,000-ha steep,
   diverse land use/land cover but mostly forested catchment. A network of
   hydrologic and sediment monitoring instruments was deployed over the
   catchment during two separate study periods when sediment loadings were
   measured from captured storms. Results showed that the quarry stood to
   make a disproportionately large contribution to the catchment's
   estimated 2.1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) suspended sediment load. Large storm
   events contributed most of the loadings with five events supplying 92\%
   of total loadings at the outlet. A paired method approach to compare
   suspended sediment loads between two subcatchments showed that during
   eight storm events, the quarry yielded between 2 and 49.2 Mg ha(-1) per
   event, whereas the forest never yielded more than 0.1 Mg ha(-1).
   Furthermore, the contribution of sediments from the quarry to bed load
   was more than 75\% at a section located 1.2 km downstream. Future
   management activities to reduce sediment and bed loads, not only from
   this catchment but also from all others with similar land use/land
   covers, should focus on improving quarry operations. Copyright (C) 2014

Title = {{Exploring the Potential Impact of Serious Games on Social Learning and
   Stakeholder Collaborations for Transboundary Watershed Management of the
   St. Lawrence River Basin}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The meaningful participation of stakeholders in decision-making is now
   widely recognized as a crucial element of effective water resource
   management, particularly with regards to adapting to climate and
   environmental change. Social learning is increasingly being cited as an
   important component of engagement if meaningful participation is to be
   achieved. The exact definition of social learning is still a matter
   under debate, but is taken to be a process in which individuals
   experience a change in understanding that is brought about by social
   interaction. Social learning has been identified as particularly
   important in transboundary contexts, where it is necessary to reframe
   problems from a local to a basin-wide perspective. In this study, social
   learning is explored in the context of transboundary water resource
   management in the St. Lawrence River Basin. The overarching goal of this
   paper is to explore the potential role of serious games to improve
   social learning in the St. Lawrence River. To achieve this end, a
   two-pronged approach is followed: (1) Assessing whether social learning
   is currently occurring and identifying what the barriers to social
   learning are through interviews with the region's water resource
   managers; (2) Undertaking a literature review to understand the
   mechanisms through which serious games enhance social learning to
   understand which barriers serious games can break down. Interview
   questions were designed to explore the relevance of social learning in
   the St. Lawrence River basin context, and to identify the practices
   currently employed that impact on social learning. While examples of
   social learning that is occurring have been identified, preliminary
   results suggest that these examples are exceptions rather than the rule,
   and that on the whole, social learning is not occurring to its full
   potential. The literature review of serious games offers an assessment
   of such collaborative mechanisms in terms of design principles, modes of
   play, and their potential impact on social learning for transboundary
   watershed management. Serious game simulations provide new opportunities
   for multidirectional collaborative processes by bringing diverse
   stakeholders to the table, providing more equal access to a virtual
   negotiation or learning space to develop and share knowledge,
   integrating different knowledge domains, and providing opportunities to
   test and analyze the outcomes of novel management solutions. This paper
   concludes with a discussion of how serious games can address specific
   barriers and weaknesses to social learning in the transboundary
   watershed context of the St. Lawrence River Basin.}},

Volume = {{212}},
Pages = {{230-237}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Microbial transformation of polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) into
   perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) has recently been confirmed to occur
   in activated sludge and soil. However, there lacks quantitative
   information about the half-lives of the PAPs and their significance as
   the precursors to PFCAs. In the present study, the biotransformation of
   6:2 and 8:2 diPAP in aerobic soil was investigated in semi dynamics
   reactors using improved sample preparation methods. To develop an
   efficient extraction method for PAPs, six different extraction solvents
   were compared, and the phenomenon of solvent enhanced hydrolysis was
   investigated. It was found that adding acetic acid could enhance the
   recoveries of the diPAPs and inhibit undesirable hydrolysis during
   solvent extraction of soil. However 6:2 and 8:2 monoPAPs, which are the
   first breakdown products from diPAPs, were found to be unstable in the
   six solvents tested and quickly hydrolyzed to form fluorotelomer
   alcohols. Therefore reliable measurement of the monoPAPs from a live
   soil was not achievable. The apparent DT50 values of 6:2 diPAP and 8:2
   diPAP biotransformation were estimated to be 12 and > 1000 days,
   respectively, using a double first order in parallel model. At the end
   of incubation of day 112, the major degradation products of 6:2 diPAP
   were 5:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (5:3 acid, 9.3\% by mole),
   perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA, 6.4\%) and perfluorohexanoic acid
   (PFHxA, 6.0\%). The primary product of 8:2 diPAP was perfluorooctanoic
   acid (PFOA, 2.1\%). The approximately linear relationship between the
   half-lives of eleven polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFAS5, including 6:2 and 8:2 diPAPs) that biotransform in aerobic soils
   and their molecular weights suggested that the molecular weight is a
   good indicator of the general stability of low-molecular-weight
   PFAS-based compounds in aerobic soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigates the variability in near-road concentrations of
   ultra-fine particles (UFP). Our results are based on a mobile data
   collection campaign conducted in 2012 in Montreal, Canada using
   instrumented bicycles and covering approximately 475 km of unique
   roadways. The spatial extent of the data collected included a diverse
   array of roads and land use patterns. Average concentrations of UFP per
   roadway segment varied greatly across the study area (1411-192,340
   particles/cm(3)) as well as across the different visits to the same
   segment. Mixed effects linear regression models were estimated for UFP
   (R-2 = 43.80\%), incorporating a wide range of predictors including
   land-use, built environment, road characteristics, and meteorology.
   Temperature and wind speed had a large negative effect on near-road
   concentrations of UFP. Both the day of the week and time of day had a
   significant effect with Tuesdays and afternoon periods positively
   associated with UFP. Since UFP are largely associated with traffic
   emissions and considering the wide spatial extent of our data collection
   campaign, it was impossible to collect traffic volume data. For this
   purpose, we used simulated data for traffic volumes and speeds across
   the region and observed a positive effect for volumes and negative
   effect for speed. Finally, proximity to truck routes was also associated
   with higher UFP concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{120-139}},

Abstract = {{The potential for fluid-elastic instability of hanging cantilevered
   pipes subjected to simultaneous internal and external axial flows is
   investigated. Such systems may lose stability by amplified oscillations
   (flutter) or buckling (static divergence). The system of interest is a
   flexible tubular cantilever hanging concentrically within a rigid outer
   tube of larger diameter. Flow inside the cantilever is directed from the
   clamped end to the free end. Upon exiting the cantilever, the fluid
   flows in the opposite direction in the annular region between the outer
   tube and the cantilever. The rigid outer tube is of variable length and
   it can cover part of the length of the cantilever. This system has
   applications in brine production and salt-cavern hydrocarbon storage. A
   linear model is derived based on the work of Paidoussis, Luu and
   Prabhakar; the presence of the shorter outer rigid tube is taken into
   account in a simplified way. Series solutions are obtained using a
   Galerkin method with Euler-Bernoulli beam eigenfunctions as comparison
   functions. Experimental results are presented and compared with the
   theoretical model. Additional computations are performed to quantify the
   effect of confinement (i.e. the narrowness of the annular region) on the
   cantilever stability, as well as the effect of confined-flow length, for
   both the short laboratory-sized system and long brine string-like
   systems. An increase in these parameters gives rise to flutter for short
   systems, or a succession of flutter and divergence for long systems. In
   addition, the effect of the system length is investigated. Increasing
   length results in asymptotic behaviour, with both the critical
   flow-velocity and associated frequency reaching limiting values.
   Sufficiently long systems lose stability by divergence rather than
   flutter. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   many adverse health problems. As the current means of diagnosis are
   obtrusive and ill-suited for real-time m-health applications, we explore
   a convenient and low-cost automatic approach that uses wearable
   microelectromechanical system sensor technology. The proposed system
   introduces the use of motion sensors to detect the changes in the
   anterior-posterior diameter of the chest wall during breathing function
   as well as extracting the informative respiratory features to be used
   for breathing disorders classification. Extensive evaluations are
   provided on six well-known classifiers with novel feature extraction
   techniques to distinguish among eight different pathological breathing
   patterns. The effects of the number of sensors, sensor placement, as
   well as feature selection on the classification performance are
   discussed. The experimental results conducted with ten subjects show the
   best accuracy rates of 97.50\% by support vector machine and 97.37\%
   with decision tree bagging (DTB) with all features and after feature
   selection, correspondingly. Furthermore, a binary classification is
   proposed for distinguishing between healthy people and patients with
   breath problems. The different assessments of classification parameters
   are provided by measuring the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
   F1-score and Mathew correlation coefficient. The accuracy rates above
   98\% suggest superior performance of DTB in binary recognition supported
   by the suggested new features.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional differential chaos-shift-keying systems (DCSK) are not the
   most suitable for supporting continuous-mobility scenarios. Therefore,
   in this paper an improved continuous-mobility differential
   chaos-shift-keying system (CM-DCSK) is presented that provides greater
   agility and improved performance in fast fading channels without
   accurate channel estimation while still being simple compared to a
   conventional DCSK system. A new DCSK frame signal is designed to reach
   this goal. In our new frame design, each reference sample is followed by
   a data carrier sample. This modification of the system design reduces
   the hardware complexity of DCSK because it requires a shorter wideband
   delay line and significantly improves the performance over fast fading
   channels while keeping the non-coherent nature of the transmission
   system. Once the design is explained, the bit error rate performance is
   computed over a multipath fast fading channel and compared to the
   conventional DCSK system. Simulation results confirm the advantages of
   this new noncoherent spread-spectrum design that can support mobility.}},

Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the wiretap channel in which a source node
   communicates with a destination node with the aid of a single helper and
   in the presence of an eavesdropper. The helper can apply either
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying or jamming. The secrecy capacity and
   respective optimal power allocation schemes at the source and the helper
   are investigated under both individual and joint power constraints.
   Given that the links among the nodes might not always be available for
   transmission (e. g., due to heavy shadowing), several network topologies
   are considered for relaying. To deal with the related nonconcave
   optimization problems in solving the optimal power allocation schemes,
   we first propose an analytical approach based on Descartes' rule of
   signs. Using this approach, optimal power allocation strategies are
   derived for some relay topologies and for the jamming system. Insights
   into the proposed schemes for different transmission power ranges and
   comparisons to the optimal information rate power allocations are also
   discussed. Simulation results are finally provided to quantify the
   optimality of the proposed schemes.}},

   Comparing spatially and temporally resolved estimates against long-term
   average exposures at the home location}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution in metropolitan areas is mainly caused by traffic
   emissions. This study presents the development of a model chain
   consisting of a transportation model, an emissions model, and
   atmospheric dispersion model, applied to dynamically evaluate
   individuals' exposure to air pollution by intersecting daily
   trajectories of individuals and hourly spatial variations of air
   pollution across the study domain. This dynamic approach is implemented
   in Montreal, Canada to highlight the advantages of the method for
   exposure analysis. The results for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a marker of
   traffic related air pollution, reveal significant differences when
   relying on spatially and temporally resolved concentrations combined
   with individuals' daily trajectories compared to a long-term average NO2
   concentration at the home location. We observe that NO2 exposures based
   on trips and activity locations visited throughout the day were often
   more elevated than daily NO2 concentrations at the home location. The
   percentage of all individuals with a lower 24-hour daily average at home
   compared to their 24-hour mobility exposure is 89.6\%, of which 31\% of
   individuals increase their exposure by more than 10\% by leaving the
   home. On average, individuals increased their exposure by 23-44\% while
   commuting and conducting activities out of home (compared to the daily
   concentration at home), regardless of air quality at their home
   location. We conclude that our proposed dynamic modelling approach
   significantly improves the results of traditional methods that rely on a
   long-term average concentration at the home location and we shed light
   on the importance of using individual daily trajectories to understand
   exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to evaluate the integrity of a
   composite bonded joint by simulating Lamb wave propagation using finite
   element methods. The structure of interest is composed of two stepped
   carbon fiber reinforced polymer plates bonded together by an adhesive
   film. Two different bonding conditions are examined for the joint:
   undamaged and damaged (with disbond). In the finite element model, an
   antisymmetric guided wave is excited by imposing an out-of-plane
   displacement on the surfaces and a spatial Fourier transform is
   performed before and after the bond line for extraction of reflection
   and transmission coefficients. For validation, experiments are also
   conducted using two colocalized rectangular piezoceramics for plane wave
   generation. A 3D laser Doppler vibrometer is employed for noncontact
   measurement of the in-plane and out-of-plane velocity. The results
   confirm the reflections from the steps' edges, and it is found that the
   level of reflection and transmission of the guided wave mode is
   different for undamaged and damaged joints. The antisymmetric mode in
   the pulse-echo configuration seems to be an efficient mode and strategy
   for disbond detection in composite repairs. The results verify that
   guided wave propagation is very effective for disbond detection in
   composite bonded joints and scarf repairs.}},

Abstract = {{The squeezing of a sample between parallel plates has been used for many
   years to characterize the rheological behavior of soft, purely viscous
   materials, and in recent times, small-amplitude oscillatory squeezing
   has been proposed as a means to determine the linear viscoelastic
   properties of molten polymers and suspensions. The principal advantage
   of squeeze flow rheometer over rotational devices is the simplicity of
   the apparatus. It has no air bearing and is much less expensive and
   easier to use. Accuracy may be somewhat reduced, but for quality control
   purposes, it could be quite useful. It might also find application as
   the central component of a high-throughput rheometer for evaluating
   experimental materials. The deformation is not simple shear, but
   equations have been derived to show that the oscillatory compressive
   (normal) force that is measured can serve as a basis for calculating the
   storage and loss moduli. These theories as well as instruments that have
   been developed to generate the required deformation are described, and
   applications to a variety of materials are described. (C) 2016 The

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{An aircraft demonstrator was manufactured using out-of-autoclave prepreg
   and vacuum-bag-only processing techniques. The demonstrator featured
   flat, double-curvature, joggles, abrupt geometry changes, and honeycomb
   inserts. The scientific literature was used to assess and mitigate the
   processing risks for this demonstrator. Low through-thickness gas
   permeability and ply-bridging in small radii corners were thought to be
   the most significant risks. The through-thickness permeability of the
   target material was undetectable, therefore spiking was used to increase
   gas evacuation. Unfortunately, the available mould had small radii that
   could not be increased, as a result ply bridging was observed in these
   corners.
   Miniature pressure sensors were successfully embedded in the
   demonstrator to monitor the honeycomb core pressure throughout the
   lay-up, including intermittent de-bulking, the pre-cure vacuum hold, and
   the elevated temperature cure. The sensors identified two insightful
   process phenomena: 1) gas evacuation increased with additional plies,
   and 2) non-uniform pressure response was observed in the part during
   cure. Visible part quality was acceptable, excluding small radii
   geometrical features. Internal part quality (voidage) was estimated
   using pulsed infrared thermography non-destructive-evaluation. While
   void contents are not exact, the thermography revealed local voidage can
   vary significantly over the part.}},

Abstract = {{This paper employs a pseudo-panel approach to study vehicle ownership
   evolution in Montreal region, Canada using cross-sectional
   origin-destination survey datasets of 1998, 2003 and 2008. Econometric
   modeling approaches that simultaneously accommodate the influence of
   observed and unobserved attributes on the vehicle ownership decision
   framework are implemented. Specifically, we estimate generalized
   versions of the ordered response model-including the generalized,
   scaled- and mixed-generalized ordered logit models. Socio-demographic
   variables that impact household's decision to own multiple cars include
   number of full and part-time working adults, license holders, middle
   aged adults, retirees, male householders, and presence of children.
   Increased number of bus stops, longer bus and metro lengths within the
   household residential location buffer area decrease vehicle fleet size
   of households. The observed results also varied across years as
   manifested by the significance of the interaction terms of some of the
   variables with the time elapsed since 1998 variable. Moreover, variation
   due to unobserved factors are captured for part-time working adults,
   number of bus stops, and length of metro lines. In terms of the effect
   of location of households, we found that some neighborhoods exhibited
   distinct car ownership temporal dynamics over the years.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of epileptic spikes in MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) requires
   synchronized neuronal activity over a minimum of 4cm2. We previously
   validated the Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM) as a source localization
   able to recover the spatial extent of the epileptic spike generators.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate quantitatively, using
   intracranial EEG (iEEG), the spatial extent recovered from MEG sources
   by estimating iEEG potentials generated by these MEG sources. We
   evaluated five patients with focal epilepsy who had a pre-operative MEG
   acquisition and iEEG with MRI-compatible electrodes. Individual MEG
   epileptic spikes were localized along the cortical surface segmented
   from a pre-operative MRI, which was co-registered with the MRI obtained
   with iEEG electrodes in place for identification of iEEG contacts. An
   iEEG forward model estimated the influence of every dipolar source of
   the cortical surface on each iEEG contact. This iEEG forward model was
   applied to MEG sources to estimate iEEG potentials that would have been
   generated by these sources. MEG-estimated iEEG potentials were compared
   with measured iEEG potentials using four source localization methods:
   two variants of MEM and two standard methods equivalent to minimum norm
   and LORETA estimates. Our results demonstrated an excellent MEG/iEEG
   correspondence in the presumed focus for four out of five patients. In
   one patient, the deep generator identified in iEEG could not be
   localized in MEG. MEG-estimated iEEG potentials is a promising method to
   evaluate which MEG sources could be retrieved and validated with iEEG
   data, providing accurate results especially when applied to MEM
   localizations. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1661-1683, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{The knee point in the B-H curve of a permanent magnet (PM) is considered
   crucial in electric motor applications. In the case of severe fault
   conditions, such as overheating or a short circuit in electric motors,
   the working point might fall below the knee point causing irreversible
   demagnetization of the PM. Hence, the remanence flux decreases and the
   motor operation would be reduced or stalled. In this paper, two
   demagnetization models of PMs are investigated, i.e., a linear model and
   an exponential model. Demagnetization curves for NdFeB were measured at
   temperatures varying from room temperature to 180 degrees C. It was
   found that all the parameters in the exponential model, including Br,
   H-jc, mu(r), and the fitting parameter K-1, are temperature dependent.
   Therefore, an exponential model can be developed as a function of
   temperature which allows a more efficient implementation within electric
   motor applications using PMs. However, comparison of the exponential and
   linear models indicates that the latter has a better accuracy near the
   knee point for the demagnetization curves of NdFeB magnets.}},

Abstract = {{In manufacturing electrical machine cores, the electrical steel
   laminations are often mechanically cut, leading to residual stress and a
   deterioration in magnetic properties. Several cutting techniques are
   used in the industry, such as shear cutting, punching, and laser
   cutting. The influence of shear cutting on the steel microstructure and
   magnetic properties was investigated in this paper. A single sheet
   tester was used for the measurements of two different grades of
   non-oriented electrical steel at different induction levels (0.1-1.5 T)
   and a wide range frequency (3 Hz-1 kHz). A scanning electron microscope
   was used for the characterization of the microstructure (grain size) at
   the cutting edges. The mechanical properties near the edge of the
   lamination were measured using nanoindentation. An increase in magnetic
   loss due to cutting was observed to be similar to 20\% for B35AV1900 and
   similar to 9\% for 35WW300, corresponding to a damaged area extending up
   to a distance of similar to 170 and similar to 140 mu m, from the cut

Abstract = {{There are few systematic methodologies capable of predicting and

   ensuring users' comfort satisfaction. First, the uncertainty associated
   with the instantaneous power consumption of a typical TCL is described
   by a set of random variables and their statistics. TCL statistics are
   then employed to characterize the exploitable flexibility from a large
   population of similar devices. From this, a control strategy and

   provision by the population. In Part II, the proposed analytical
   approach and control strategy are validated for the special case of
   electric water heaters (EWHs). Further, the trade-off between demand
   response capacity and EWH users' comfort satisfaction is investigated
   through several case studies.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical approach and a control strategy are proposed in Part I of
   this two-part paper for leveraging the aggregate demand of a population

   users' comfort satisfaction in response to a control signal. In Part II,
   we address the validation of the concepts put forth in the first part of
   the paper. To do so, we develop an extensive set of case studies based
   upon a population of 10 000 electric water heaters (EWH). Here, a
   physically-based model is first derived for the calculation of EWHs
   on-time statistics. The model is then extended to calculate the
   probability of EWH users' comfort satisfaction. The analytical approach
   and control strategy presented in Part I are validated using the EWH
   model against Monte Carlo simulations. Further, the trade-off between
   demand response capacity and EWH users' comfort satisfaction is

Abstract = {{The contamination of urban soil with sodium (Na) and trace metals can be
   one of the major concerns for groundwater contamination and street tree
   health. The bioavailability of Na, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd),
   and lead (Pb) in urban soil amended with 0, 5, and 10\% w/w compost was
   evaluated at none, medium, and high contamination levels of soil
   mixtures. The relationship between soil properties, compost addition,
   contamination level and metal uptake by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was
   determined using multivariate linear regression and path analysis. The
   results indicated the direct negative effect of compost on metal
   absorption possibly through specific complexation for Cu, Zn, Cd, and
   Pb. Compost can also affect the absorption of Na and Cd indirectly by
   means of cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH. The degree of soil
   contamination with metals can affect the competition of cations for the
   complexing sites of the soil mixtures and, therefore, can induce changes
   in metal availability for plants. Compost addition to the soil also
   increased nutrient availability, except for ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate
   (NO3-). We concluded that in the short term, the addition of compost
   significantly reduced metal bioavailability and improved nutrient
   availability. However, more studies are required to monitor the
   long-term ability of the compost to reduce Na and trace metal
   bioavailability in urban soil.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{536}},
Pages = {{426-446}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of large-scale climate oscillations on hydrological systems
   and their variability have been documented in different parts of the
   world. Since hydroclimatic data are known to exhibit non stationary
   characteristics, spectral analyses such as wavelet transforms are very
   useful in extracting time-frequency information from such data. As
   Canadian studies, particularly those of regions east of the Prairies,
   using wavelet transform-based methods to draw links between relevant
   climate indices {[}e.g., the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the
   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
   (PDO)] and streamflow variability are not common, this study aims to
   analyze such relationships for the southern regions of Quebec and
   Ontario. Monthly and annual streamflow data with a record length of 55
   years were used to capture streamflow variability at intra-annual,
   inter-annual and inter-decadal scales. The continuous wavelet transform
   spectra of monthly streamflow data revealed consistent significant 6-
   and 12-month periodicities, which are likely associated with strong
   seasonality factors. Its annual counterparts showed four different
   significant periodicities: up to 4 years, 4-6 years, 6-8 years, and
   greater than 8 years - all of which occurred after the late 1960s/early
   1970s. Wavelet coherence analyses show that the influence of ENSO and
   NAO at the inter-annual scale occurs at 2-6 year periodicities, and the
   influence of PDO occur at periodicities up to 8 years and exceeding 16
   years. Correlations between these climate indices and streamflow were
   computed to determine the time delay of streamflow response to the
   influence of ENSO, NAO, and PDO. The lag times ranged from 6-48 months
   (for monthly data) and 1-4 years (for annual data). This research
   contributes to our understanding of streamflow variability over the
   southern parts of Quebec and Ontario, and the role of ENSO, NAO, and PDO
   phenomena on this variability. These relationships can be also used to
   improve hydrological forecasting and water resources management in
   Ontario and Quebec. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   master sintering curve (MSC) concept. A pressureless pulsed electric
   current sintering setup was used to heat samples. The temperature at the
   onset of sintering increased as the heating rate increased. The
   formation of a supersolidus liquid fraction was shifted toward higher
   temperatures for increased heating rates. The apparent activation energy
   of sintering was obtained by least squares fitting of the sintering data
   to the MSC and was in good agreement with the lattice diffusion
   activation energy of the alloying elements present in Inconel 718. The
   MSC followed different kinetics for low heating rates (<= 50 K/minute)
   and high heating rates (>= 75 K/minute), and these differences were
   related to liquation kinetics. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials

   wing, and vortex rollup was completed at x/c=0.7. The PIV crossflow
   measurements were also used to compute the lift coefficient. Finally,

Abstract = {{Partially impregnated prepreg are attractive materials for scarf bonded

   Several air evacuation strategies were evaluated for cobonded scarf
   repairs of monolithic composites skins. Various void levels were
   measured in the bondline by digital radiography, and tensile tests were
   performed to assess the repairs strength recovery. Most of the entrapped
   air could be evacuated prior to cure for the method using a textured
   adhesive film. This repair strategy consistently led to a significant
   reduction in bondline porosity and exhibited the highest strength
   recovery. Overall, it was found an average linear reduction in tensile
   strength recovery of 4.5\% per 1\% areal void content in the adhesive.
   Additionally, a change in final failure mode was observed from cohesive
   failure for porous bondlines, to net-section tensile failure in case of

Abstract = {{Static and dynamic responses of a circular cylindrical shell made of
   hyperelastic arterial material are studied. The material is modeled as a
   combination of Neo-Hookean and Fung materials. Two types of pressure
   loads are studied-distributed radial forces and deformation-dependent
   pressure. The static responses of the shell under these two loads differ
   essentially at moderate strains, while the behavior is similar for small
   loads. The principal difference is that the axial displacements are much
   larger for the shell under distributed radial forces, while for actual
   pressure the shell is stretched both in circumferential and axial
   directions. Free and forced vibrations around preloaded configurations
   are analyzed. In both cases, the nonlinearity of the single-mode (driven
   mode) response of the preloaded shell is quite weak, but a resonant
   regime with both driven and companion modes active has been found with
   more complicated nonlinear dynamics.}},

Title = {{Stability of arsenate-bearing Fe(III)/Al(III) co-precipitates in the
   presence of sulfide as reducing agent under anoxic conditions}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},

Volume = {{151}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Currently, the co-precipitation of arsenate with ferric iron at molar
   ratios Fe(III)/As(V) >= 3 by lime neutralization produces tailings
   solids that are stable under oxic conditions. However not much is known
   about the stability of these hazardous co-precipitates under anoxic
   conditions. These can develop in tailings storage sites by the action of
   co-discharged reactive sulfides, organic reagent residuals or bacterial
   activity. The ferric matrix can then undergo reductive dissolution
   reactions, which could release arsenic into the pore water. Co-ions like
   aluminum could provide a redox-immune sink to scavenge any mobilized
   arsenic as a result of reduction of ferric. As such, in this work
   Fe(III)/As(V) = 4 and aluminum substituted Fe(III)/AI(III)/As(V) = 2/2/1
   co-precipitates were produced in a mini continuous co-precipitation
   process circuit and subjected to excess sulfide addition under inert gas
   to evaluate their stability. It was found that the ferric-arsenate
   co-precipitate could retain up to 99\% (30 mg/L in solution) of its
   arsenic content despite the high pH (10.5) and extremely reducing (E-h <
   -200 mV) environment. There was no significant reduction of arsenate and
   only 45\% of ferric iron was reduced. Partial aluminum substitution was
   found to cut the amount of mobilized arsenic by 50\% (down to 15 mg/L)
   hence mixed Fe(III)/Al(III)-arsenate co-precipitates may offer better
   resistance to reductive destabilization over the long term than all iron
   co-precipitates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Depressive symptoms are frequently seen in patients with dementia and
   mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Evidence suggests that there may be a
   link between current depressive symptoms and Alzheimer disease
   (AD)-associated pathological changes, such as an increase in cortical
   amyloid- (A). However, limited in vivo studies have explored the
   relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical A in
   patients with MCI and AD. Our study, using a large sample of 455
   patients with MCI and 153 patients with AD from the Alzheimer's disease
   Neuroimaging Initiatives, investigated whether current depressive
   symptoms are related to cortical A deposition. Depressive symptoms were
   assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and Neuropsychiatric
   Inventory-depression/dysphoria. Cortical A was quantified using positron
   emission tomography with the A probe F-18-florbetapir (AV-45).
   F-18-florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (AV-45 SUVR) from the
   frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal regions was estimated. A
   global AV-45 SUVR, defined as the average of frontal, cingulate,
   precuneus, and parietal cortex, was also used. We observed that current
   depressive symptoms were not related to cortical A, after controlling
   for potential confounds, including history of major depression. We also
   observed that there was no difference in cortical A between matched
   participants with high and low depressive symptoms, as well as no
   difference between matched participants with the presence and absence of
   depressive symptoms. The association between depression and cortical A
   deposition does not exist, but the relationship is highly influenced by
   stressful events in the past, such as previous depressive episodes, and
   complex interactions of different pathways underlying both depression
   and dementia.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE The evolution of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has
   led to improved safety and efficacy, such that overnight observation can
   be avoided in some patients. We sought to provide a narrative review of
   the current literature regarding the outcomes of same-day discharge
   (SDD) PCI and to describe a framework for the development of an SDD
   program.
   OBSERVATIONS A literature search of PubMed was performed for human
   studies on SDD PCI published in English from January 1, 1995, to July
   31, 2015. We reviewed the studies between June and September 2015. After
   literature review, we included reports of randomized clinical trials,
   observational studies, meta-analyses guidelines, and consensus
   statements in a narrative review. Compared with overnight observation,
   there was no increase in adverse events (bleeding, repeat coronary
   procedures, death, or rehospitalization) among patients in these studies
   who were discharged on the same day of their PCI procedure. Same-day
   discharge was associated with significant cost savings and was preferred
   by patients.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The available evidence supports the safety of
   SDD in selected patients after PCI. Specific programmatic features are
   important to the successful implementation of SDD after PCI. Greater
   adoption of SDD programs after PCI has the potential to improve patient
   satisfaction, increase bed availability, and reduce hospital costs
   without increasing adverse patient outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of modern digital signal processing (DSP) systems is
   inherently affected by the variability tolerance of their main
   arithmetic units. As CMOS technology approaches nanometer scales,
   numerous threats for the reliability of DSP designs emerge. A large
   portion of these phenomena are related to threshold voltage variations,
   resulting in timing failures due to an overall increase of the
   arithmetic unit delay. In this work, we employ linear regression
   techniques to accelerate transistor variability estimation using static
   timing analysis (STA) tools. By identifying the variation-critical part
   of an arithmetic circuit, we reduce the transistor inventory that needs
   to be tracked by the STA solver. We substantiate the efficiency of the
   proposed framework for realistic designs. For the main logic blocks of
   the modulo add-multiply (AM) operation, we capture the
   variability-induced degradation of the Modified Booth (MB) encoding
   stage with negligible accuracy losses. We also exploit our methodology
   as a useful aid for variability-aware design techniques and we
   investigate the variability-tolerance of novel MB recoding schemes
   against conventional designs.}},

Abstract = {{Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are pollutants emitted by combustion processes
   during power generation and transportation that are subject to
   increasingly stringent regulations due to their impact on human health
   and the environment. One NOx reduction technology being investigated for
   gas-turbine engines is exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR), either through
   external exhaust-gas recycling or staged combustion. In this study, the
   effects of different percentages of EGR on NOx production will be
   investigated for methane-air and propane-air flames at a selected
   adiabatic flame temperature of 1800 K. The variability and uncertainty
   of the results obtained by the GRI-MECH 3.0 (GRI), San-Diego 2005 (SD),
   and the CSE thermochemical mechanisms are assessed. It was found that
   key parameters associated with postflame NO emissions can vary up to
   192\% for peak CH values, 35\% for thermal NO production rate, and 81\%
   for flame speed, depending on the mechanism used for the simulation. A
   linear uncertainty analysis, including both kinetic and thermodynamic
   parameters, demonstrates that simulated postflame nitric Oxide levels
   have uncertainties on the order of +/- 50-60\%. The high variability of
   model predictions, and their relatively high associated uncertainties,
   motivates future experiments of NOx formation in exhaust-gas-diluted
   flames under engine-relevant conditions to improve and validate
   combustion and NOx design tools.}},

   miscibility or develops co-continuous morphology between the components.
   The analysis of rheometrical, DSC and DMTA results indicated no
   sensitivity of these classical techniques for detecting the miscibility
   or immiscibility of such a system. However, AFM data effectively
   detected dispersed-phase domains corresponding to the PP-g-AA rich
   phase. The results, for the first time, indicated that the start of
   phase separation occurs at a critical copolymer concentration between 2
   and 5 wt\%. Furthermore it was observed that, as the PP-g-AA content
   increases, the size and continuity of the dispersed phase increase and
   reach a highly continuous morphology. Additionally, ToF-SIMS chemical
   imaging was carried out to aid in the interpretation of the AFM data.

Abstract = {{The transport of nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles colloidally
   stabilized with 70,000 Da carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), through sands
   with mean grain diameters of 180, 340 and 1140 gm (referred to as fine,
   intermediate and coarse-sized sand, respectively) was investigated in a
   70-cm long, two-dimensional tank. The effect of NZVI concentrations (1
   and 3 g-Fe L-1) and CMC concentrations (1 and 2 g L-1) and injection
   velocities (0.96 and 0.40 cm min(-1)) on particle transport were also
   evaluated with the intermediate sand. The overall NZVI mass fractions
   eluted from the tank were 36\%, 25\% and 16\% in the coarse,
   intermediate and fine sands, respectively, when injected with 1 g L-1
   NZVI stabilized in 1 g L-1 CMC. However, the mass fraction eluted
   reduced to 2.33\% when the injection velocity was reduced from 0.96 to
   0.40 cm min(-1) in the intermediate-sized sand. Maximum transport
   efficiency (38\% NZVI mass eluted) in the intermediate-sized sand was
   achieved with 3 g L-1 NZVI suspended in 2 g L-1 CMC at an injection
   velocity of 0.96 cm min(-1). The transport efficiency was substantially
   decreased (11\% NZVI mass eluted) when 3 g L-1 NZVI was stabilized with
   only 1 g L-1 CMC. The NZVI mean particle diameters in the porewaters
   remained unchanged at different locations in the tank suggesting that
   straining or gravity settling did not influence NZVI deposition. After
   NZVI injection, the hydraulic conductivity in the tank reduced by
   80\%-96\%, depending on the CMC concentration and injection velocity.

Abstract = {{The system of crystal structure has a major effect on the physical and
   chemical properties of Li-ion silicate cathodes. Hence, the prediction
   of crystal system has a vital importance to estimate many other
   properties of cathodes for applications in batteries. Three major
   crystal systems (monoclinic, orthorhombic and triclinic) of
   silicate-based cathodes with Li-Si-(Mn, Fe, Co)-O compositions were
   predicted using wide range of classification algorithms in machine
   learning. The calculations are based on the results of density
   functional theory calculations from Materials Project. The strong
   correlation between the crystal system and other physical properties of
   the cathodes was confirmed based on the feature evaluation in the
   statistical models. In addition, the parameters of various
   classification methods were optimized to obtain the best accuracy of
   prediction. Ensemble methods including random forests and extremely
   randomized trees provided the highest accuracy of prediction among other
   classification methods in the Monte Carlo cross validation tests. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a novel fusion method based on a multi-task robust sparse
   representation (MRSR) model and spatial context information to address
   the fusion of multi-focus gray-level images with misregistration. First,
   we present a robust sparse representation (RSR) model by replacing the
   conventional least-squared reconstruction error by a sparse
   reconstruction error. We then propose a multi-task version of the RSR
   model, viz., the MRSR model. The latter is then applied to multi-focus
   image fusion by employing the detailed information regarding each image
   patch and its spatial neighbors to collaboratively determine both the
   focused and defocused regions in the input images. To achieve this, we
   formulate the problem of extracting details from multiple image patches
   as a joint multi-task sparsity pursuit based on the MRSR model.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested algorithm is
   competitive with the current state-of-the-art and superior to some
   approaches that use traditional sparse representation methods when input
   images are misregistered.}},

   augmented by in-plane strain, can greatly modify the band structure of
   the 2H phase to induce bandgap transition (either indirect-to-direct or
   direct-to-indirect). Moreover, the effects of strain on the band
   structure can be well understood and predicted within the framework of
   deformation potential theory. The present study provides important

   of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model and found to involve two
   sequential annealing stages, characterized by two different Avrami
   exponents. Stage 1 is associated with recrystallization in the high
   stored energy regions, such as these containing shear bands and twins,
   while stage 2 concerns the recrystallization of some of the low stored
   energy regions. Nevertheless, in the specimens subjected to low
   reductions (<30\%) and annealed at 200 degrees C for long time periods,
   some of the elongated grains remained unrecrystallized. This is
   attributed to the relative lack of formation of twins in these grains
   during rolling, i.e. to the very low stored energies in these regions.
   There was no significant difference in the microstructure evolution and
   recrystallization kinetics of the materials rolled at the two speeds.
   This is interpreted in terms of the Zener-Hollomon parameter, similar
   values of which applied to the two types of rolling and therefore to the
   microstructures produced. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management is critical for safe and reliable operation of
   lithium-ion battery systems. In this study, a one-dimensional
   thermal-electrochemical model of lithium-ion battery interactively
   coupled with a two-dimensional thermal-fluid conjugate model for forced
   convection air cooling of a lithium-ion battery module is presented and
   solved numerically. This coupled approach makes the model more unique
   and detailed as transport inside each cell in the battery module is
   solved for and thus covering multiple length and time scales. The effect
   of certain design and operating parameters of the thermal management
   system on the performance of the battery module is assessed using the
   coupled model. It is found that a lower temperature increase of the
   battery module can be achieved by either increasing the inlet air
   velocity or decreasing the distance between the cells. Higher air inlet
   velocity, staggered cell arrangement or a periodic reversal airflow of
   high reversal frequency results in a more uniform temperature
   distribution in the module. However, doing so increases the parasitic
   load as well as the volume of the battery module whence a trade-off
   should be taken into account between these parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A one-step in-situ route to free standing core-shell silicon carbide in
   graphene nanoparticles on monolayer graphene is presented. The
   core-shell SiC@Graphene nanoparticle growth is realized by a simple
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process where carbon and silica
   precursors are simultaneously introduced into the growth chamber. This
   process permits the synthesis of a monolayer graphene sheet dressed with
   silicon carbide nanoparticles in a single CVD step, with the product
   controlled by growth temperature and the carbon/SiO2 exposure time.
   Growth of a high density SiC@Graphene distribution on a continuous
   graphene layer requires long exposure times (> 1 h) and high temperature
   (1000 degrees C). The growth process proceeds by a carbothermal
   mechanism. The simultaneous growth of graphene and SiC nanoparticles
   enables uniform core-shell SiC@Graphene nanoparticle formation rather
   than SiC/carbon nanofiber growth. As a proof of concept, the
   functionalization of preformed nanoparticle graphene surface with a
   diazonium salt is studied, demonstrating an increase in grafting rate
   with increasing nanoparticle population. This work provides a general
   procedure for one-step synthesis, with further investigation required to
   develop precursors for hybrid core-shell CVD material growth.}},

Abstract = {{The key thermophysical properties of methane hydrate were determined
   using ab initio modelling. Using density functional theory, the
   second-order elastic constants, heat capacity, compressibility, and
   thermal expansion coefficient were calculated. A wide and relevant range
   of pressure-temperature conditions were considered, and the structures
   were assessed for stability using the mean square displacement and
   radial distribution functions. Methane hydrate was found to be
   elastically isotropic with a linear dependence of the bulk modulus on
   pressure. Equally significant, multi-body interactions were found to be
   important in hydrates, and water-water interactions appear to strongly
   influence compressibility like in ice Ih. While the heat capacity of
   hydrate was found to be higher than that of ice, the thermal expansion
   coefficient was significantly lower, most likely due to the lower
   rigidity of hydrates. The mean square displacement gave important
   insight into stability, heat capacity, and elastic moduli, and the
   radial distribution functions further confirmed stability. The presented
   results provide a much needed atomistic thermoelastic characterization
   of methane hydrates and are essential input for the large-scale
   applications of hydrate detection and production.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper reports the results of an experimental study of
   detonation limits for H-2/O-2/Ar mixtures. Two stoichiometric mixtures
   (2H(2) + O-2 + 3Ar and 2H(2) + O-2) in three different diameter round
   tubes (D = 1.8, 4.6 and 10.9 mm) were tested. The choice of the mixture
   represents those considered as ``stable{''} with a regular cellular
   pattern and ``unstable{''} with an irregular cellular pattern.
   Detonation velocity was measured by ionization probes spaced at regular
   intervals along the small tubes. Consistent with previous findings, the
   present results show that well within the limits the detonation wave in
   hydrogen mixtures propagates at a steady velocity close to the
   theoretical Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) value. With decreasing initial
   pressure, the velocity deficit increases. It is found that the
   detonation velocity decreases with decreasing tube diameter, which is a
   result of the wall boundary layer effect being more prominent for
   smaller tubes. At the limiting pressure, the steady velocity deficit for
   both tested mixtures in three different diameter tubes is about 15-18\%.
   Velocity deficits were also estimated theoretically using the Fay model.
   For the mixture of 2H(2) + O-2+ 3Ar, good agreement is found between the
   theoretical prediction and the experimental result of detonation
   velocity. For the mixture of 2H2 + 02, however, the theoretical
   prediction deviates from the experimental measurement. The latter thus
   suggests that, apart from losses due to the flow divergence caused by
   the boundary layer effect, instabilities are also significant for the
   detonation propagation and failure in 2H(2) + O-2 mixture. Lastly, at
   the limits, the value of D/A is found to agree well with that for the
   onset of single-headed spin detonation. Thus, it can be concluded that
   the single-headed spin criterion can also be used for defining the
   detonation limits for hydrogen mixtures. (C) Copyright 2016, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is an emerging imaging technique
   that permits instantaneous capture of a relatively large sample volume.
   However, large volumes usually come at the expense of lower spatial

   demonstrate the use of a Mach-Zehnder dual-beam instrument for imaging
   of labeled and unlabeled bacteria and microalgae. Spatial resolution of
   0.3 mu m is achieved, providing a sampling of several pixels across a
   typical prokaryotic cell. Both cellular motility and morphology are
   readily recorded. The use of dyes provides both amplitude and phase
   contrast improvement and is of use to identify cells in dense samples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the vibration of fiber-steered laminated plates,
   such as those used in the skins of a sandwich panel, manufactured by
   automated fiber placement. We use third-order shear deformation theory,
   hybrid Fourier-Galerkin method, and numerical integration technique to
   predict their vibration responses, and to study the role of
   manufacturing defects, in particular gaps and overlpas, as well as the
   parameters representing the stiffness of the sandwich core. With the aim
   of improving both structural and vibration performance, we first adopt a
   passive approach to search for optimal fiber paths that can concurrently
   maximize the undamped dynamic out-of-plane and in-plane stiffness of
   laminates with gaps and overlaps. To further reduce vibration, we then
   follow an active approach that uses magnetostrictive layers to suppress
   the structural vibration of laminates with optimal vibration
   characteristics. The results of the vibration analysis show that for
   plates with gaps, as opposed to those with overlaps, the dynamic
   out-of-plane deflection has a higher amplitude and a lower frequency
   than that of a defect free plate. In addition, the results show that
   magnetostrictive layers with a higher gain control can lead to a lower
   vibration frequency, and better attenuate the vibration response of the
   panel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been long known that the electrical properties of cellulose are
   greatly influenced by adsorption of water vapor. Incorporating
   conductive nanofibers in a cellulose matrix is an example of an approach
   to tailor their characteristics for use in electronics and sensing
   devices. In this work, we introduce two new nanocomposites comprising
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and conventional or electrosterically stabilized
   nanocrystalline celluloses matrices. While conventional nanocrystalline
   cellulose (NCC) consists of a rigid crystalline backbone,
   electrosterically stabilized cellulose (ENCC) is composed of a rigid
   crystalline backbone with carboxylated polymers protruding from both
   ends. By tuning CNT loading, we can tailor a CNT/NCC composite with
   minimal electrical sensitivity to the ambient relative humidity, despite
   the fact that the composite has a high moisture uptake. The expected
   decrease in CNT conductivity upon water vapor adsorption, due to
   electron donation, is counterbalanced by an increase in the conductivity
   of NCC due to proton hopping at an optimum CNT loading (1-2\%). Contrary
   to the CNT/NCC composite, a CNT/ENCC composite at 1\% CNT loading shows
   insulating behavior for relative humidities up to 75\%, after which the
   composite becomes conductive. This interesting behavior can be ascribed
   to the low moisture uptake of ENCC at low and moderate relative
   humidities due to the limited number of hydroxyl groups and hydrogen
   bond formation between carboxyl groups on ENCC, which endow ENCC with
   limited water molecule adsorption sites.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal properties and thermoelectric performance of one-dimensional
   armchair and zigzag gamma-graphyne nanoribbons (gamma-GYNRs) are
   theoretically investigated in the present study. We found that the

   figure of merit (ZT) than graphene nanorribons. The maximal ZT values
   for the armchair and zigzag gamma-GYNRs are 0.93 and 0.61, respectively.
   By introducing C-14 atoms, the thermoelectric conversion efficiencies of
   gamma-GYNRs are greatly enhanced, thus the isotope effect can
   significantly improve the thermoelectric properties of the systems. More
   importantly, under a relatively low temperature, the maximal ZT of a
   defective zigzag gamma-GYNR is as high as 2.12, indicating that
   gamma-GYNRs are promising materials for constructing excellent

Abstract = {{The shock response of chromium sulfide-chromium, a cermet of potential
   interest as a matrix material for ballistic applications, has been
   investigated at two molar ratios. Using a combustion synthesis technique
   allowed for control of the molar ratio of the material, which was
   investigated under near-stoichiometric (cermet) and excess chromium
   (interpenetrating composite) conditions, representing chromium: sulfur
   molar ratios of 1.15:1 and 4:1, respectively. The compacts were
   investigated via the plate-impact technique, which allowed the material
   to be loaded under a one-dimensional state of strain. Embedded manganin
   stress gauges were employed to monitor the temporal evolution of
   longitudinal and lateral components of stress in both materials.
   Comparison of these two components has allowed assessment of the
   variation of material shear strength both with impact
   pressure/strain-rate and time for the two molar ratio conditions. The
   two materials exhibited identical material strength despite variations
   in their excess chromium contents. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of ice formation and accretion on external surfaces range
   from being mildly annoying to potentially life-threatening. Ice-shedding
   materials, which lower the adhesion strength of ice to its surface, have
   recently received renewed research attention as a means to circumvent
   the problem of icing. In this work, we investigate how surface
   wettability and surface topography influence the ice adhesion strength
   on three different surfaces: (i) superhydrophobic laser-inscribed square
   pillars on copper, (ii) stainless steel 316 Dutch-weave meshes, and
   (iii) multiwalled carbon nanotube-covered steel meshes. The finest
   stainless steel mesh displayed the best performance with a 93\% decrease
   in ice adhesion relative to polished stainless steel, while the
   superhydrophobic square pillars exhibited an increase in ice adhesion by
   up to 67\% relative to polished copper. Comparisons of dynamic contact
   angles revealed little correlation between surface wettability and ice
   adhesion. On the other hand, by considering the ice formation process
   and the fracture mechanics at the ice substrate interface, we found that
   two competing mechanisms governing ice adhesion strength arise on
   nonplanar surfaces: (i) mechanical interlocking of the ice within the
   surface features that enhances adhesion, and (ii) formation of
   microcracks that act as interfacial stress concentrators, which reduce
   adhesion. Our analysis provides insight toward new approaches for the
   design of ice-releasing materials through the use of surface
   topographies that promote interfacial crack propagation.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Argemone mexicana Linn. (Papaveraceae) has been used as
   traditional medicine in India and Taiwan for the treatment of skin
   diseases, inflammations, bilious, fever, etc. Some alkaloids of A.
   mexicana have been screened for their cytotoxicity on different cancer
   cell lines.Objective: The study investigates potential cytotoxic effects
   of alkaloids isolated from aerial part of A. mexicana on SW480 human
   colon cancer cell line.Materials and methods: Six alkaloids,
   13-oxoprotopine, protomexicine, 8-methoxydihydrosanguinarine,
   dehydrocorydalmine, jatrorrhizine, and 8-oxyberberine were isolated from
   the methanol extract of A. mexicana. Cytotoxicity of these alkaloids was
   studied on SW480 human colon cancer cell line at 1, 25, 50, 75, 100,
   125, 150, and 200 mu g/mL for 24 and 48h. Cells were seeded in a 96-well
   micro-plate at a concentration of 2x10(4) cells per well and MTS assay
   was performed to assess cytotoxicity in terms of cell viability.Results:
   At 200 mu g/mL, protomexicine and 13-oxoprotopine showed mild
   cytotoxicity (approximate to 24-28\%) whereas dehydrocorydalmine
   exhibited moderate cytotoxicity (approximate to 48\%). 8-Oxyberberine
   was mildly cytotoxic (approximate to 27\%) at 24h but was more potent
   (approximate to 76\%) at 48h. Jatrorrhizine and
   8-methoxydihydrosanguinarine were most potent (approximate to 95-100\%)
   in inhibiting the human colon cancer cell proliferation showing complete
   reduction in cell viability.Discussion and conclusion: This is the first
   study on the effect of these alkaloids on SW480 human colon cancer cell
   line. This study indicates that some alkaloids of A. mexicana strongly
   inhibit the cell proliferation in human colon cancer cells, and it might
   be a basis for future development of a potent chemotherapeutic drug.}},

Abstract = {{An ecomimetic method is developed as an innovative and transdisciplinary
   design approach rooted in the field of biomimetics. This new method
   emulates the interrelated complexity of the parts of an ecosystem with
   the intent to design buildings that are more efficient, effective and
   holistic. Ecomimetics refers to the design of buildings that mimic
   ecosystem processes and functions. This approach provides potential
   opportunities for climate change adaptation and mitigation by optimizing
   the use of resources in buildings. One challenge to the application of
   ecomimetics in architecture is the lack of systematic methods supported
   by scientific research, which may prevent development in this field. A
   theoretical basis and the initial development of an ecomimetic design
   method is presented, with a description of each step of the design
   process. Ecological systems are selected for functional properties that
   match architectural design goals, and then design tools are used to
   abstract and transfer those properties to architectural systems. The
   design tools integrated in the method are from the fields of ecological
   engineering, systems dynamics and architecture. The case of the Eastgate
   Center in Harare, Zimbabwe, is used to illustrate the method.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive ductal breast carcinomas (IDBCs) are the most frequent and
   aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, affecting a large number of
   Canadian women every year. Part of the diagnostic process includes
   grading the cancerous tissue at the microscopic level according to the
   Nottingham modification of the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson system. Although
   reliable, there exists a growing interest in automating the grading
   process, which will provide consistent care for all patients. This paper
   presents a solution for automatically detecting regions expressing IDBC
   in images of microscopic tissue, or whole digital slides. This
   represents the first stage in a larger solution designed to
   automatically grade IDBC. The detector first tessellated whole digital
   slides, and image features were extracted, such as color information,
   local binary patterns, and histograms of oriented gradients. These were
   presented to a random forest classifier, which was trained and tested
   using a database of 66 cases diagnosed with IDBC. When properly tuned,
   the detector balanced accuracy, F1 score, and Dice's similarity
   coefficient were 88.7\%, 79.5\%, and 0.69, respectively. Overall, the
   results seemed strong enough to integrate our detector into a larger
   solution equipped with components that analyze the cancerous tissue at
   higher magnification, automatically producing the histopathological
   grade. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{Finger millet (Eleusine coracana) is a nutritious, gluten-free, and
   drought resistant cereal containing high amounts of protein,
   carbohydrate, and minerals. However, bio-availability of these nutrients
   is restricted due to the presence of an excessive level of anti-nutrient
   components, mainly phytic acid, tannin, and oxalate. It has been shown
   that a well-designed malting/germination process can significantly
   reduce these anti-nutrients and consequently enhance the nutrient
   availability. In the present study, the effects of two important
   germination factors, duration and temperature, on the enhancement of
   in-vitro protein digestibility of finger millet were thoroughly
   investigated and optimized. Based on a central composite design, the
   grains were germinated for 24, 36, and 48 h at 22, 26, and 30 A degrees
   C. For all factor combinations, protein, peptide, phytic acid, tannin,
   and oxalate contents were evaluated and digestibility was assessed. It
   was shown that during the malting/germinating process, both temperature
   and duration factors significantly influenced the investigated
   quantities. Germination of finger millet for 48 h at 30 A degrees C
   increased protein digestibility from 74 \% (for native grain) up to 91
   \%. Besides, it notably decreased phytic acid, tannin, and oxalate
   contents by 45 \%, 46 \%, and 29 \%, respectively. Linear correlations
   between protein digestibility and these anti-nutrients were observed.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hard biological materials - for example, seashells, bone or wood -fulfil
   critical structural functions and display unique and attractive
   combinations of stiffness, strength and toughness, owing to their
   intricate architectures, which are organized over several length scales.
   The size, shape and arrangement of the `building blocks' of which these
   materials are made are essential for defining their properties and their
   exceptional performance, but there is growing evidence that their
   deformation and toughness are also largely governed by the interfaces
   that join these building blocks. These interfaces channel nonlinear
   deformations and deflect cracks into configurations in which propagation
   is more difficult. In this Review, we discuss comparatively the
   composition, structure and mechanics of a set of representative
   biological interfaces in nacre, bone and wood, and show that these
   interfaces possess unusual mechanical characteristics, which can
   encourage the development of advanced bioinspired composites. Finally,
   we highlight recent examples of synthetic materials inspired from the
   mechanics and architecture of natural interfaces.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the geometry of gears with skew axes is a highly demanding
   task, which can be eased by invoking Study's Principle of Transference.
   By means of this principle, spherical geometry can be readily ported
   into its spatial counterpart using dual algebra. This paper is based on
   Martin Disteli's work and on the authors' previous results, where Camus'
   auxiliary curve is extended to the case of skew gears. We focus on the
   spatial analog of one particular case of cycloid bevel gears: When the
   auxiliary curve is specified as a pole tangent, we obtain
   ``pathologic{''} spherical involute gears; the profiles are always
   interpenetrating at the meshing point because of G(2)-contact. The
   spatial analog of the pole tangent, a skew orthogonal helicoid, leads to
   G(2)-contact at a single point combined with an interpenetration of the
   flanks. However, when instead of a line a plane is attached to the right
   helicoid, the envelopes of this plane under the roll-sliding of the
   auxiliary surface (AS) along the axodes are developable ruled surfaces.
   These serve as conjugate tooth flanks with a permanent line contact. Our
   results show that these flanks are geometrically sound, which should
   lead to a generalization of octoidal bevel gears, or even of bevel gears
   carrying teeth designed with the exact spherical involute, to the
   spatial case, i.e., for gears with skew axes.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As the coupler link of an RCCC linkage moves, its instant screw axis
   (ISA) sweeps a ruled surface on the fixed link; by the same token, the
   ISA describes on the coupler link itself a corresponding ruled surface.
   These two surfaces are the axodes of the linkage, which roll while
   sliding and maintaining line contact. The axodes not only help to
   visualize the motion undergone by the coupler link but also can be
   machined as spatial cams and replace the four-bar linkage, if the need
   arises. Reported in this paper is a procedure that allows the synthesis
   of the axodes of an RCCC linkage. The synthesis of this linkage, in
   turn, is based on dual algebra and the principle of transference, as
   applied to a spherical four-bar linkage with the same input-output
   function as the angular variables of the RCCC linkage. Examples of RCCC
   linkages are included. Moreover, to illustrate the generality of the
   synthesis procedure, it is also applied to a spherical linkage, namely,
   the Hooke joint, and to the Bennett linkage.}},

   children: Assessing accuracy of FreeSurfer and FSL against manual
   segmentation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The volumetric quantification of brain structures is of great interest
   in pediatric populations because it allows the investigation of
   different factors influencing neurodevelopment. FreeSurfer and FSL both
   provide frequently used packages for automatic segmentation of brain
   structures. In this study, we examined the accuracy and consistency of
   those two automated protocols relative to manual segmentation, commonly
   considered as the ``gold standard{''} technique, for estimating
   hippocampus and amygdala volumes in a sample of preadolescent children
   aged between 6 to 11 years. The volumes obtained with FreeSurfer and
   FSL-FIRST were evaluated and compared with manual segmentations with
   respect to volume difference, spatial agreement and between-and
   within-method correlations.
   Results highlighted a tendency for both automated techniques to
   overestimate hippocampus and amygdala volumes, in comparison to manual
   segmentation. This was more pronounced when using FreeSurfer than
   FSL-FIRST and, for both techniques, the over estimation was more marked
   for the amygdala than the hippocampus. Pearson correlations support
   moderate associations between manual tracing and FreeSurfer for
   hippocampus (right r = 0.69, p < 0.001; left r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and
   amygdala (right r = 0.61, p < 0.001; left r = 0.67, p < 0.001) volumes.
   Correlation coefficients between manual segmentation and FSL-FIRST were
   statistically significant (right hippocampus r = 0.59, p < 0.001; left
   hippocampus r = 0.51, p < 0.001; right amygdala r = 0.35, p < 0.001;
   left amygdala r = 0.31, p < 0.001) but were significantly weaker, for
   all investigated structures. When computing intraclass correlation
   coefficients between manual tracing and automatic segmentation, all
   comparisons, except for left hippocampus volume estimated with
   FreeSurfer, failed to reach 0.70. When looking at each method
   separately, correlations between left and right hemispheric volumes
   showed strong associations between bilateral hippocampus and bilateral
   amygdala volumes when assessed using manual segmentation or FreeSurfer.
   These correlations were significantly weaker when volumes were assessed
   with FSL-FIRST. Finally, Bland-Altman plots suggest that the difference
   between manual and automatic segmentation might be influenced by the
   volume of the structure, because smaller volumes were associated with
   larger volume differences between techniques.
   These results demonstrate that, at least in a pediatric population, the
   agreement between amygdala and hippocampus volumes obtained with
   automated FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer protocols and those obtained with
   manual segmentation is not strong. Visual inspection by an informed
   individual and, if necessary, manual correction of automated
   segmentation outputs are important to ensure validity of volumetric
   results and interpretation of related findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Developing human brain: age-related changes in cortical, subcortical,

Abstract = {{IntroductionThis study is the first to characterize normal development
   and sex differences across neuroanatomical structures in cortical,
   subcortical, and cerebellar brain regions in a single large cohort.
   MethodsOne hundred and ninety-two magnetic resonance images were
   examined from 96 typically developing females and 96 age-matched
   typically developing males from 4 to 18years of age. Image segmentation
   of the cortex was conducted with CIVET, while that of the cerebellum,
   hippocampi, thalamus, and basal ganglia were conducted using the MAGeT
   algorithm.
   ResultsCortical thickness analysis revealed that most cortical regions
   decrease linearly, while surface area increases linearly with age.
   Volume relative to total cerebrum followed a quadratic trend with age,
   with only the left supramarginal gyrus showing sexual dimorphism.
   Hippocampal relative volume increased linearly, while the thalamus,
   caudate, and putamen decreased linearly, and the cerebellum did not
   change with age. The relative volumes of several subcortical subregions
   followed inverted U-shaped trends that peaked at similar to 12years of
   age. Many subcortical structures were found to be larger in females than
   in males, independently of age, while others showed a sex-by-age
   interaction.
   ConclusionThis study provides a comprehensive assessment of cortical,
   subcortical, and cerebellar growth patterns during normal development,
   and draws attention to the role of sex on neuroanatomical maturation
   throughout childhood and adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Soil provides ecosystem services, supports human health and habitation,
   stores carbon and regulates emissions of greenhouse gases. Unprecedented
   pressures on soil from degradation and urbanization are threatening
   agro-ecological balances and food security. It is important that we
   learn more about soil to sustainably manage and preserve it for future
   generations. To this end, we developed and analyzed a global soil
   visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectral library. It is currently the
   largest and most diverse database of its kind. We show that the
   information encoded in the spectra can describe soil composition and be
   associated to land cover and its global geographic distribution, which
   acts as a surrogate for global climate variability. We also show the
   usefulness of the global spectra for predicting soil attributes such as
   soil organic and inorganic carbon, clay, silt, sand and iron contents,
   cation exchange capacity, and pH. Using wavelets to treat the spectra,
   which were recorded in different laboratories using different
   spectrometers and methods, helped to improve the spectroscopic
   modelling. We found that modelling a diverse set of spectra with a
   machine leaming algorithm can find the local relationships in the data
   to produce accurate predictions of soil properties. The spectroscopic
   models that we derived are parsimonious and robust, and using them we
   derived a harmonized global soil attribute dataset, which might serve to
   facilitate research on soil at the global scale. This spectroscopic
   approach should help to deal with the shortage of data on soil to better
   understand it and to meet the growing demand for information to assess
   and monitor soil at scales ranging from regional to global. New
   contributions to the library are encouraged so that this work and our
   collaboration might progress to develop a dynamic and easily updatable
   database with better global coverage. We hope that this work will
   reinvigorate our community's discussion towards larger, more coordinated
   collaborations. We also hope that use of the database will deepen our
   understanding of soil so that we might sustainably manage it and extend
   the research outcomes of the soil, earth and environmental sciences
   towards applications that we have not yet dreamed of. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{The subject of this paper is the synthesis of the base curves of
   involute cylindrical gears, for uniform and non-uniform transmission
   ratio, by means of Aronhold's first theorem and the return circle. The
   base curves can be generated in several ways, as reported in the
   literature, but this approach comes from the kinematics fundamentals; it
   is, thus, more straightforward than the alternatives for the case of
   non-uniform transmission ratio, which leads to non-circular gears. The
   base curves of circular and non-circular gears are obtained by
   intersecting, at each pitch point, the corresponding return circle with
   the line of action for a given pressure angle. This is possible for
   involute cylindrical gears since the tooth profile of the rack is
   represented by a line, and the conjugate profiles of the two meshing
   gears can be generated by its envelope.}},

Abstract = {{A gauge based on laser light attenuation has been developed to determine
   the temporal history of particle number density during the explosive
   dispersal of inert particles. The optical scheme of the gauge employs
   narrow band pass and spatial optical filters that protect the optical
   sensors from ambient light and laser light scattered by particles. The
   gauge is used in field experiments to measure particle density at two
   locations in close proximity to spherical metalized explosive charges
   containing a packed bed of either iron, nickel, or glass particles
   saturated with nitromethane. The heavy iron particles penetrate the
   blast wave in the near field, whereas the lighter particles remain
   behind the blast wave. Comparisons with multiphase calculations indicate
   that the particle density field inferred from the light intensity
   signals is consistent with the computations until the point at which the
   combustion products containing soot arrives at the gauge, blocking the
   laser light.}},

Abstract = {{A mesoscale model for droplet dynamics based on a quasi-molecular
   approach is proposed. It considers the interaction between
   quasi-molecules within a single liquid droplet, each quasi molecule
   representing an agglomeration of a large number of actual water
   molecules. The goal is to improve the understanding of the dynamics of
   large droplet collisions over dry or wet surfaces at velocities typical
   of aeronautical applications. This detailed analysis will eventually be
   used to refine the macroscopic Eulerian description of the water
   impingement process by providing numerical correlations for splashing
   and bouncing phenomena relevant for in-flight icing applications. Based
   on the Equipartition Theorem, approaches for extracting macroscopic
   quantities such as temperature and transport coefficients from the
   quasi-molecular method are discussed. A proper choice of the free
   parameters of the model that leads to accurate values of the macroscopic
   properties is also addressed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The standard method of the global quantitative analysis of gene
   expression at the protein level combines high-resolution two-dimensional
   gel electrophoresis (2DE) with mass spectrometric identification of

   the possibility of the technical regulations of gene expression using

   various amounts. Testing the predictability of the developed equation,
   we observed that a new protein could form deceptive expression profiles,
   classified using prevalent tools for the analysis of 2DE results. In
   spite of the theoretically predicted overall reduction of proteins that
   resulted from adding the new protein, the empirical data revealed
   differential amount of proteins when various quantities of the new
   protein were added to the protein sample. The present work emphasize
   that employment of 2DE would not be a reliable approach for biological
   samples with extensive proteome alterations such as the developmental
   and differentiation stages of cells without depletion of high abundant
   proteins. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider energy-efficient adaptive power allocation for three
   incremental multiple-input-multiple-output (IMIMO) systems employing
   automatic repeat request (ARQ), hybrid ARQ (HARQ) with Chase combining
   (CC), and HARQ with incremental redundancy (IR) to minimize their
   rate-outage probability (or equivalently packet drop rate) under a
   constraint on average energy consumption per data packet. We first
   provide the rate-outage probability expressions for the three IMIMO
   systems and then propose methods to convert them into a tractable form
   and formulate the corresponding nonconvex optimization problems that can
   be solved by an interior-point algorithm for finding a local optimum. To
   reduce further the solution complexity, using an asymptotically
   equivalent approximation of the rate-outage probability expressions, we
   approximate the nonconvex optimization problems as a unified geometric
   programming problem (GPP), for which we derive the closed-form solution.
   Illustrative results indicate that the proposed power allocation (PPA)
   offers significant gains in energy savings as compared with the equal
   power allocation (EPA), and the simple closed-form GPP solution can
   provide closer performance to the exact method at lower values of
   rate-outage probability for the three IMIMO systems.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the setting and tensile strength development of
   ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) at a very early age was
   investigated by performing the penetration resistance test (ASTM C403),
   as well as the direct tensile test using the newly developed test
   apparatus, and taking ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) measurements. In
   order to determine the optimum surface treatment method for preventing
   rapid surface drying of UHPC, four different methods were examined:
   plastic sheet, curing cover, membrane-forming compound, and paraffin
   oil. Based on the test results, the use of paraffin oil was found to be
   the best choice for measuring the penetration resistance and the UPV,
   and attaching the plastic sheet to the exposed surface was considered to
   be a simple method for preventing the rapid surface drying of UHPC
   elements. An S-shaped tensile strength development at a very early age
   (before 24 h) was experimentally obtained, and it was predicted by a
   power function of UPV. Lastly, the addition of shrinkage -reducing and
   expansive admixtures resulted in more rapid development of penetration
   resistance and UPV of UHPC.}},

   resistance in a low-cost technology. External capacitive electrodes are
   used for electrostatic tuning of the resonance frequency, relying on the
   electrostatic spring softening effect. The resonator was measured to
   have a resonance frequency of similar to 15 MHz and a quality factor of
   similar to 2000 in atmospheric pressure, increasing to similar to 5000
   in 100-mtorr vacuum. The temperature co-efficient for the frequency of
   the device was also measured to be about -40 ppm/degrees C. The
   resonator requires no dc voltage for operation, but its resonance
   frequency can be tuned by varying the applied dc voltage on the
   capacitive electrodes with a factor of 1 ppb/V-2. {[}2015-0202]}},

Abstract = {{Based on neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and high angle annular dark
   field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), we show
   that calcium ions help eliminate the Fe-antisite defects by controlling
   the nucleation and evolution of the LiFePO4 particles during their
   hydrothermal synthesis. This Ca-regulated formation of LiFePO4 particles
   has an overwhelming impact on the removal of their iron antisite defects
   during the subsequent carbon coating step since (i) almost all the
   Fe-antisite defects aggregate at the surface of the LiFePO4 crystal when
   the crystals are small enough and (ii) the concomitant increase of the
   surface area, which further exposes the Fe-antisite defects. Our results
   not only justify a low-cost, efficient and reliable hydrothermal
   synthesis method for LiFePO4 but also provide a promising alternative
   viewpoint on the mechanism controlling the nanosizing of LiFePO4, which
   leads to improved electrochemical performances.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveVery preterm-born neonates (24-32 weeks of gestation) are
   exposed to stressful and painful procedures during neonatal intensive
   care. Analgesic and sedation therapies are essential, and opiates and
   benzodiazepines are commonly used. These medications may negatively
   impact brain development. The hippocampus may be especially vulnerable
   to the effects of pain and analgesic and/or sedative therapies and
   contribute to adverse outcomes. The effect of invasive procedures and
   analgesic-sedative exposure on hippocampal growth was assessed, as was
   that of hippocampal growth on neurodevelopmental outcome.
   MethodsA total of 138 neonates (51\% male, median gestational age=27.7
   weeks) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) scans, early in life (postmenstrual age {[}PMA]=32.3 weeks) and at
   term-equivalent age (PMA=40.2 weeks). Volumes and DTI measures of axial
   diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity (MD) were obtained
   from the hippocampus. Cognitive, language, and motor abilities were
   assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III at 18.7
   months median corrected age. Models testing the association of invasive
   procedures with hippocampal volumes and DTI measures accounted for birth
   gestational age, sex, PMA, dose of analgesics/sedatives (fentanyl,
   morphine, midazolam), mechanical ventilation, hypotension, and
   surgeries.
   ResultsTotal midazolam dose predicted decreased hippocampal volumes
   (=-1.8, p<0.001) and increased MD (=0.002, p=0.02), whereas invasive
   procedures did not (=0, p>0.5 each). Lower cognitive scores were
   associated with hippocampal growth (=-0.31, p=0.003), midazolam dose
   (=-0.27, p=0.03), and surgery (=-8.32, p=0.04).
   InterpretationMidazolam exposure was associated with macro- and
   microstructural alterations in hippocampal development and poorer
   outcomes consistent with hippocampal dysmaturation. Use of midazolam in
   preterm neonates, particularly those not undergoing surgery, is
   cautioned. Ann Neurol 2016;79:548-559}},

Abstract = {{Mobile sensor networking technology has attracted considerable attention
   in various research communities in recent years due to their widespread
   applications in civilian and military environments. One objective when
   using mobile sensors is to obtain maximum field coverage by properly
   deploying sensor nodes. In many real-world applications, a priori
   knowledge about the best deployment position for the sensors is not
   available. However, the motion capability of the sensors could allow
   each node to adjust its position (i.e., relocate) so that a better (and
   ultimately maximal) coverage is achieved. In this paper, a novel
   autonomous joint sensing range and relocation control algorithm is
   presented that achieves improved coverage and network lifetime at the
   same time. In the proposed algorithm, the sensing range of each sensor
   is adjusted iteratively based on its residual energy. At the same time,
   the sensor is directed to move within its corresponding multiplicatively
   weighted Voronoi region to ultimately increase sensing coverage in the
   field. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of a
   long-range solar powered sensor-enhanced radio frequency identification
   (RFID) tag. The tag antenna is a multiport microstrip patch with an
   overlay of thin-film solar cells for energy harvesting. A second port is
   allocated on the patch antenna for supplementary energy harvesting from
   the RF signal transmitted by the reader. An I-2 C-RFID chip along with a
   microcontroller unit (MCU) and temperature and humidity sensor are
   incorporated into the tag design to implement a low-cost wireless sensor
   using a commercial RFID reader. The measurements of the fabricated
   RFID-tag sensor demonstrate that a maximum sensing/reading range of 27 m
   is achieved when all the circuits are powered using solar cells, while
   it is 7.48m with only the secondary option of energy harvesting. The
   proposed sensor with dual energy harvesting achieves both a longer range
   and a lifetime compared with similar battery-powered sensor-enhanced
   RFID tags. The RFID sensor is also evaluated in a climate chamber and
   the sensor data (temperature/humidity) were remotely recorded with an
   excellent accuracy using a commercial ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID
   reader. In addition, the sensor can be programmed for the
   temperature/humidity surveillance of sensitive items, such as those

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate modulation and Stokes space
   direct-detection (DD) of four orthogonal dimensions or degrees of
   freedom (DOF) of a single laser being the intensity on two orthogonal
   polarizations, the inter-polarization phase and the inter-polarization
   differential phase. At the transmitter, a dual-polarization in-phase
   quadrature-phase (DP-IQ) modulator driven by a 4-channel
   digital-to-analog converter is employed to imprint the transmitted data
   onto the aforementioned four DOF. Transmitted symbols for each
   polarization are drawn from multi-ring/multi-phase constellations, e.g.,
   2-ring/4-ary phase shift keying (PSK) or 2-ring/8PSK, resulting in a
   polarization division multiplexed (PDM) format with intensity,
   inter-polarization phase, and inter-polarization differential phase
   modulation (PDM-IM-IPM-IDPM). At the receiver, a novel DD front-end(1)
   comprising two 2 x 4 90 degrees hybrids, two single-ended photodiodes
   (PDs), four balanced PDs, couplers and polarizing optics, provides six
   photocurrents from which the information on all four modulated DOF is
   retrieved with the aid of subsequent digital signal processing (DSP)
   operating in the Stokes space. Adopting the proposed transceiver, we
   experimentally report transmission of 320 Gb/s over 10 km of single mode
   fiber (SMF) below hard decision-FEC threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3) using 40
   GBd PDM 2-ring/8PSK modulation delivering 8 bits per symbol. In
   addition, we also report transmission of 360 Gb/s over 20 km of SMF

   2-ring/8PSK modulation.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous TiO2 films are employed in solar cells, lithium ion
   batteries, and air and water purification systems, to name a few
   applications. Film fabrication via coating the substrate with an organic
   suspension or paste carrying TiO2 nanoparticles is a common method. To
   lessen the adverse environmental impact, use of water as a solvent and
   nontoxic chemicals is being preferred over commonly used organic
   components. In this research, a water based, nano-TiO2 printable paste
   formulation with polyethylene glycol (MW 20 000) and propylene glycol
   was developed and seamlessly interfaced with TiO2 aqueous synthesis for
   sustainable manufacturing. The innovative combination of propylene
   glycol and polyethylene glycol is demonstrated to lead to improved paste
   rheology and sintered film properties. Dye-sensitized solar cells were
   assembled from the screen-printed films, and the effect of film surface
   area and porosity on photovoltaic performance was studied. The new
   aqueous-based paste yielded comparable power conversion efficiency to
   benchmark organic-based paste made of alpha-terpineol, ethyl cellulose,
   and ethanol, opening the avenue for lower cost, green fabrication of
   mesoporous thin film electrodes.}},

   Arkansas, Delaware and Idaho (USA), the ability of artificial neural
   network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) models to
   forecast/estimate daily suspended sediment concentrations ({[}SS](d))
   was evaluated and compared to that of traditional multiple linear
   regression (MLR) and sediment rating curve (SRC) models. Three different
   ANN model algorithms were tested {[}gradient descent, conjugate gradient
   and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)], along with four different
   SVR model kernels {[}linear, polynomial, sigmoid and Radial Basis
   Function (RBF)]. The reliability of the applied models was evaluated
   based on the statistical performance criteria of root mean square error
   (RMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and Nash-Sutcliffe model
   efficiency coefficient (NSE). Based on RMSE values, and averaged across
   the three hydrometric stations, the ANN and SVR models showed,
   respectively, 23\% and 18\% improvements in forecasting and 18\% and
   15\% improvements in estimation over traditional models. The use of the
   BFGS training algorithm for ANN, and the RBF kernel function for SVR

Abstract = {{The stationarity of annual flood peak records is the traditional
   assumption of flood frequency analysis. In some cases, however, as a
   result of land-use and/or climate change, this assumption is no longer
   valid. Therefore, new statistical models are needed to capture
   dynamically the change of probability density functions over time, in
   order to obtain reliable flood estimation. In this study, an innovative
   method for nonstationary flood frequency analysis was presented. Here,
   the new method is based on detrending the flood series and applying the
   L-moments along with the GEV distribution to the transformed
   ``stationary{''} series (hereafter, this is called the LM-NS). The LM-NS
   method was assessed through a comparative study with the maximum
   likelihood (ML) method for the nonstationary GEV model, as well as with
   the stationary (S) GEV model. The comparative study, based on Monte
   Carlo simulations, was carried out for three nonstationary GEV models: a
   linear dependence of the mean on time (GEV1), a quadratic dependence of
   the mean on time (GEV2), and linear dependence in both the mean and log
   standard deviation on time (GEV11). The simulation results indicated
   that the LM-NS method performs better than the ML method for most of the
   cases studied, whereas the stationary method provides the least accurate
   results. An additional advantage of the LM-NS method is to avoid the
   numerical problems (e.g., convergence problems) that may occur with the
   ML method when estimating parameters for small data samples. (C) 2016

   Statistical analysis of floods in Quebec}},

Abstract = {{This paper, the second of a two-part paper, investigates the
   nonstationary behaviour of flood peaks in Quebec (Canada) by analyzing
   the annual maximum flow series (AMS) available for the common 1966-2001
   period from a network of 32 watersheds. Temporal trends in the mean of
   flood peaks were examined by the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test. The
   significance of the detected trends over the whole province is also
   assessed by a bootstrap test that preserves the cross-correlation
   structure of the network. Furthermore, The LM-NS method (introduced in
   the first part) is used to parametrically model the AMS, investigating
   its applicability to real data, to account for temporal trends in the
   moments of the time series. In this study two probability distributions
   (GEV \& Gumbel) were selected to model four different types of
   time-varying moments of the historical time series considered,
   comprising eight competing models. The selected models are: two
   stationary models (GEV0 \& Gumbel0), two nonstationary models in the
   mean as a linear function of time (GEV1 \& Gumbel1), two nonstationary
   models in the mean as a parabolic function of time (GEV2 \& Gumbel2),
   and two nonstationary models in the mean and the log standard deviation
   as linear functions of time (GEV11 \& Gumbell 1). The eight models were
   applied to flood data available for each watershed and their performance
   was compared to identify the best model for each location. The
   comparative methodology involves two phases: (1) a descriptive ability
   based on likelihood-based optimality criteria such as the Bayesian
   Information Criterion (BIC) and the deviance statistic; and (2) a
   predictive ability based on the residual bootstrap. According to the
   Mann-Kendall test and the LM-NS method, a quarter of the analyzed
   stations show significant trends in the AMS. All of the significant
   trends are negative, indicating decreasing flood magnitudes in Quebec.
   It was found that the LM-NS method could provide accurate flood
   estimates in the context of nonstationarity. The results have indicated
   the importance of taking into consideration the nonstationary behaviour
   of the flood series in order to improve the quality of flood estimation.
   The results also provided a general impression on the possible impacts
   of climate change on flood estimation in the Quebec province. (C) 2016

   study whether the invariance conditions are also necessary for

   after periodate oxidation}},
Journal = {{CELLULOSE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1051-1059}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Periodate oxidation breaks the C2-C3 bond in the glucose repeat units of
   cellulose, forming two vicinal aldehyde groups. When the cellulose is
   partially oxidized, three products were generated after periodate
   oxidation: fibrous cellulose, sterically stabilized nanocrystalline
   cellulose (SNCC) and dialdehyde modified cellulose. Thus, by periodate
   oxidation alone, we can produce nanocellulose. SNCCs were produced after
   26, 42 and 84 h periodate oxidation. Their morphologies were examined by
   transmission electron microscopy, which show that the three SNCCs have
   similar diameters (5-10 nm). In contrast, the average length of SNCC
   decreases with aldehyde content: from approximately 590 nm after 26 h of
   oxidation to 100 nm for an oxidation period of 84 h. It indicates that
   the morphology of SNCC can be well controlled by the degree of periodate
   oxidation, which depends on the amount of periodate and the reaction
   time. Equivalent spherical diameters of SNCCs were also examined by
   dynamic light scattering, and the results correspond closely to the ones
   observed by TEM. The viscosities of SNCCs were measured by an Ubbelohde
   viscometer and compared with theory. Because the length of SNCC
   particles gradually reduces while their diameters remain almost the
   same, we propose that periodate reacts preferentially with the amorphous
   region of cellulose. After most of the amorphous regions have reacted,
   the reaction proceeds at the boundary of amorphous and crystalline
   regions, creating a reaction front that advances towards the crystalline
   regions, thus continually shortening them. Dynamic light scattering
   experiments on SNCC suspensions when adding cosolvents into them proved
   that SNCCs were sterically stabilized in water.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber reinforced cyanate ester composites are of interest for
   space structural applications because of their high specific strength
   and stiffness, but also for their dimensional stability and resistance
   to microcracking. This new type of composite materials is promising, but
   so far experimental data remains scarce. In this work we have
   characterized the microcracking behavior of a cyanate ester composite,
   focusing on the conditions under which microcracking initiates. The
   performance of these composites for space applications was investigated
   by focusing on the accumulation of damage from extreme thermal and
   externally applied stresses. For this purpose, a five-harness satin
   weave in {[}0/45](s) was subjected to micromechanical testing in three
   point bending. Microdamage accumulating during monotonic loading was
   monitored by in-situ imaging, and we also show that cyclic tests of
   increasing amplitude can detect such damage. We also subjected the
   material to cyclic thermal stress using thermomechanical and dynamic
   mechanical analyzers (TMA and DMA) and a fast thermal cycling method.
   For these tests, no variation in the coefficient of thermal expansion
   (CTE) or degradation in modulus from thermal cycling under TMA and DMA,
   and no microcracking could be detected from visual inspection. However,
   faster thermal cycling resulted in the formation of microcracking and a
   significant reduction in modulus. These results suggest a possible
   failure mode for this type of material, which should be taken into
   consideration for aerospace applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor network WSN) technologies and distributed processing are
   essential to develop ubiquitous sensing in the Internet of Things IoT)
   paradigm, wherein sensors pervasively collect data and perform
   information processing and communication tasks to achieve a common
   objective. This paper presents the formulation and analysis of
   distributed estimation algorithms based on the diffusion cooperation
   scheme in the presence of errors due to the unreliable data transfer
   among nodes. In particular, we highlight the impact of transmission
   errors on the least-mean squares LMS) adaptive networks. We develop the
   closed-form expressions for the steady-state mean-square deviation MSD),
   which is helpful to assess the effects of the imperfect information flow
   on the behavior of diffusion LMS algorithms in terms of steady-state
   error. The model is then validated by performing Monte Carlo
   simulations. It is shown that local and global steady-state MSD values
   are not necessarily monotonic increasing functions of the error
   probability. We also assess sufficient conditions that ensure mean and
   mean-square stability of diffusion LMS strategies in the presence of
   transmission errors. We examine a practical scenario where errors occur
   at the medium access control MAC) level. To overcome the problem of
   unreliable data exchange, we implement a random pairwise strategy that
   improves the performance of the estimation algorithm in the presence of
   high transmission error rates. Moreover, issues such as scalability in
   the sense of network size and regressor size, convergence behavior
   during the transient phase, spatially correlated observations, as well
   as the effect of the distribution of the noise variance are studied.}},

Abstract = {{The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) plays an important role in our daily
   activities by enabling us to fixate on objects during head movements.
   Modeling and identification of the VOR improves our insight into the
   system behavior and improves diagnosis of various disorders. However,
   the switching nature of eye movements (nystagmus), including the VOR,
   makes dynamic analysis challenging. The first step in such analysis is
   to segment data into its subsystem responses (here slow and fast segment
   intervals). Misclassification of segments results in biased analysis of
   the system of interest. Here, we develop a novel three-step algorithm to
   classify the VOR data into slow and fast intervals automatically. The
   proposed algorithm is initialized using a K-means clustering method. The
   initial classification is then refined using system identification
   approaches and prediction error statistics. The performance of the
   algorithm is evaluated on simulated and experimental data. It is shown
   that the new algorithm performance is much improved over the previous
   methods, in terms of higher specificity.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{156-170}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the elastic field is studied in a composite cylinder made
   of heterogeneous coatings. The coating layers are such that the
   mechanical properties of the entire composite structure change across
   the radius. Thus, both Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio vary
   continuously in coatings across the radius. The effect of varying
   Young's modulus has been shown to be significant on the elastic field in
   these types of composites. Herein, it is shown that varying Poisson's
   ratio also plays an important role in the stress and strain distribution
   and should be considered in the design process especially in carbon
   coated titanium cylinders, where Poisson's ratio changes between zero
   and a half in the structure. In addition, variation of Poisson's ratio
   across the radius not only changes the elastic field, but also different
   spatial variations of Poisson's ratio lead to distinct hoop stresses and
   radial displacements for a coated cylinder. The effects of Poisson's
   ratio variation on the elastic field in thick composite cylinders are
   also studied. Two closed form expressions are derived for the normalized
   hoop stresses at the inner and outer surfaces of thick-walled coated
   cylinders. It is found that the effect of varying Poisson's ratio on the
   normalized hoop stress in thick-walled coated cylinders is also
   important and the maximum hoop stress changes dramatically for thicker
   cylinders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an investigation of reinforced
   concrete (RC) T-beams retrofitted in shear with near-surface mounted
   (NSM) fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rods. Six full-scale 4,520-mm-long
   RC T-beams were tested to study the effects of important parameters such
   as the presence of NSM FRP rods, the presence of steel stirrups, and the
   steel stirrup ratio. This paper provides an insightful and comprehensive
   description of the behavior of strengthened T-beams under increasing
   load, from the formation of the first crack to ultimate failure. The
   results of this study and those gathered in the presented database show
   that existing steel stirrups and strengthening NSM FRP did not diminish
   each other's effect when failure modes unrelated to shear resistance of
   RC beams were prevented. The experimental results of this study and
   those in the database were used to verify a newly proposed model to
   predict the shear contribution of NSM FRP rods and laminates in RC beams
   strengthened in shear. The proposed model showed an improved accuracy
   compared with the existing models in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study are to simulate the Thornthwaite moisture

   during three 30-year periods in the 21st century and to estimate the
   interactive effect of TMI and simulated freight traffic loads on the

   Highways 1, 2, 7, 15, 16, 102, and 104 connecting the APC are considered
   as the case study. Integration of spatial input-output and
   transportation models simulates freight movements on the selected
   regional highways during the period of 2012-2100. TMI is estimated using
   downscaled average monthly precipitation and temperature at 34 stations
   within the APC. Simulated traffic loads and TMI are applied to
   mechanistic modeling of roughness progression on the pavement structure.
   The findings of this study show that an increase in TMI can cause
   11-68\% increase of roughness progress rate on pavement structure. (C)

Title = {{The pursuit of satisfaction: Variation in satisfaction with bus transit
   service among riders with encumbrances and riders with disabilities
   using a large-scale survey from London, UK}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{To retain and grow ridership, transit agencies continuously survey
   riders to learn how to improve services and understand what leads to
   rider satisfaction. Nevertheless, transit riders are not a homogeneous
   entity and understanding the distinctions between transit riders can
   help transit agencies in their efforts to provide satisfactory service
   to retain existing riders and attract new ones. To uncover how diverse
   aspects of bus services can differentially impact satisfaction of
   different riders, we use data from a large-scale, multiyear bus
   satisfaction survey from London, UK. Specifically, we model satisfaction
   using logistic regressions to learn how encumbered riders and riders
   with physical disabilities value different features of bus services
   compared to other types of riders. For riders traveling with large
   items, shopping bags, or children, we find that satisfaction depends on
   the presence and condition of a bus shelter and the availability of a
   seat. Satisfaction of riders with disabilities depends on information
   availability at the bus stop, as well as trip speed and reliability. Our
   findings indicate that improving waiting area conditions and providing
   information at the stop can increase the satisfaction of riders with
   encumbrances and disabilities, respectively. Findings from this paper
   can be of benefit to transit planners and policy makers as it offers new
   insights about the determinants of satisfaction of two groups of bus
   riders not often considered in the public transport literature. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The concentrations of 17 drugs of abuse, including cocaine, several
   amphetamines, opioid drugs, and 2 metabolites-benzoylecgonine, a
   metabolite of cocaine, and
   2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrolidine, a metabolite of
   methadone-were investigated in an urban watershed that is heavily
   impacted by discharges of municipal wastewater. The artificial sweetener
   sucralose was also monitored as a persistent tracer of contamination
   from municipal wastewater. Monitoring was conducted in a municipal
   wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and at sites upstream and downstream
   of the WWTP discharge, as well as in a drinking water treatment plant
   (DWTP) located 19 km downstream of the WWTP discharge that withdraws raw
   water from the river. Drug concentrations were monitored with polar
   organic chemical integrative samplers deployed for 2 wk in the river and
   in the WWTP and DWTP. Several of the investigated compounds exhibited a
   decrease in concentration with distance downstream from the wastewater
   discharge into the river, but there was little attenuation of sucralose,
   cocaine, benzoylecgonine, morphine, acetylmorphine, acetylcodeine, and
   oxycodone. Heroin and methadone were not detected at any sample
   locations. Amphetamine, methamphetamine,
   3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, and
   2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrolidine were not detected in
   the samples collected at the drinking water intake. Many of the drugs of
   abuse were not removed effectively in the DWTP, including cocaine,
   benzoylecgonine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, ephedrine, and several
   prescription opioids, most probably because the DWTP was operating at or
   above its rated treatment capacity. These data indicate that there can
   be transport of drugs of abuse from wastewater sources into drinking

   Specifically, we consider the probabilistic generative model (PGM) of
   classification, which is specified by class-conditional densities, along
   with the NMF model. The update rules of the NMF are jointly obtained
   with the parameters of the class-conditional densities using the
   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which guarantees convergence.
   Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides better
   performance in speech enhancement than the benchmark algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{An in-depth review on the catalytic transformation of starch to a
   remarkable breadth of products is discussed. The physicochemical
   properties of starches from different varieties are reported to
   influence their functionality. However, the impact of such properties on
   the reaction parameters for the cost-effective production of selective
   chemicals is largely unexplored. With the emergence of ionic liquids as
   the reaction media, water insoluble starch biopolymer can be easily
   dissolved and converted to reaction products simultaneously.
   Furthermore, microwave assisted chemical synthesis is known to enhance
   the reaction rates and optimize the resultant product selectivity.
   Physical and chemical modifications of starch also plays a vital role in
   the production of commodity chemicals. Recently, the potential routes to
   the production of biochemicals from biomass like glucaric acid,
   5-hydroxymethyl furfural, 2,5-diformylfuran, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid,
   2,5-dimethylfuran, levulinic acid and sorbitol have been studied.
   Similar promising routes from inexpensive starches are analyzed in the
   review, as a function of the challenges associated to their chemical
   pathways and scalability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the pull-in characteristics of initially curved
   microelectromechanical resonators actuated by a DC voltage along with an
   AC harmonic voltage. The deformable electrode is modeled by means of a
   clamped-clamped Euler-Bernoulli microarch in which a combination of
   mechanical, electrostatic, and electrodynamic nonlinearities are taken
   into account. A high-dimensional reduced-order Galerkin model is built,
   and the effect of various system parameters on pull-in instabilities is
   investigated numerically. Specifically, the electroelastostatic
   deformation as well as pull-in instabilities are analyzed for the cases
   actuated electrostatically via the DC voltage; the DC voltage deflection
   characteristics due to the simultaneous presence of mechanical and
   electrical nonlinearities are presented. The electroelastodynamic
   deformations are investigated for the system under simultaneous
   actuation of the DC and AC voltages; the AC frequency-motion as well as
   the AC amplitude-motion curves is analyzed to highlight the effect of
   electroelastodynamic nonlinearities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Dry Sliding Wear}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Two cold spray coatings, one pure Cu and the other a Cu-MoS2 composite
   coating, were studied for their tribology performance in dry air. It was
   demonstrated that a small amount of MoS2 (1.8 +/- 0.99 wt\%) could
   significantly decrease coefficient of friction (CoF) from around 0.7 (Cu
   coating) to 0.14-0.15. MoS2 patches on the wear track exhibited a lower
   local CoF, and the main velocity accommodation mechanism was shearing
   MoS2-containing debris. Even though the coating wear rates were high in
   the early sliding (8.61-12.8 nm/cycle in penetration depth during the
   first 100 cycles), slow wear (0.12-0.22 nm/cycle) over the subsequent
   sliding was observed. It was also found that the presence of MoS2 helped
   to achieve high endurance of the first steady-state CoF. The dynamics of
   the process, material transfer, and phase transformation were examined
   using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The MoS2 patches developed on the
   wear track and the counterface served as reservoirs to replenish MoS2 in
   the contact and became depleted with sliding. Cross-sectional
   microstructure revealed by electron channeling contrast imaging
   technique showed a layer of sliding-induced microstructure, 3-5 mu m
   thick for the Cu-MoS2 coating, and 10-30 mu m thick for the Cu coating.}},

Title = {{Ectopic bone formation in rapidly fabricated acellular injectable dense
   collagen-Bioglass hybrid scaffolds via gel aspiration-ejection}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{128-141}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Gel aspiration-ejection (GAE) has recently been introduced as an
   effective technique for the rapid production of injectable dense
   collagen (IDC) gel scaffolds with tunable collagen fibrillar densities
   (CFDs) and microstructures. Herein, a GAE system was applied for the
   advanced production and delivery of IDC and IDC-Bioglass (R) (IDC-BG)
   hybrid gel scaffolds for potential bone tissue engineering applications.
   The efficacy of GAE in generating mineralizable IDC-BG gels (from an
   initial 75-25 collagen-BG ratio) produced through needle gauge numbers
   8G (3.4 mm diameter and 6 wt\% CFD) and 14G (1.6 mm diameter and 14 wt\%
   CFD) was investigated. Second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging of
   as-made gels revealed an increase in collagen fibril alignment with
   needle gauge number. In vitro mineralization of IDC-BG gels was
   confirmed where carbonated hydroxyapatite was detected as early as day 1
   in simulated body fluid, which progressively increased up to day 14. In
   vivo mineralization of, and host response to, acellular IDC and IDC-BG
   gel scaffolds were further investigated following subcutaneous injection
   in adult rats. Mineralization, neovascularization and cell infiltration
   into the scaffolds was enhanced by the addition of BG and at day 21 post
   injection, there was evidence of remodelling of granulation tissue into
   woven bone-like tissue in IDC-BG. SHG imaging of explanted scaffolds
   indicated collagen fibril remodelling through cell infiltration and
   mineralization over time. In sum, the results suggest that IDC-BG hybrid
   gels have osteoinductive properties and potentially offer a novel
   therapeutic approach for procedures requiring the injectable delivery of
   a malleable and dynamic bone graft that mineralizes under physiological
   conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Hydrophobicity of biofilm coatings influences the transport dynamics of
   polystyrene nanoparticles in biofilm-coated sand}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{113-120}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are used in the manufacture of over 2000
   industrial and consumer products to enhance their material properties
   and functions or to enable new nanoparticle-dependent functions. The
   widespread use of ENPs will result in their release to the subsurface
   and aquatic environments, where they will interact with indigenous
   biota. Laboratory column experiments were designed to understand the
   influence of two different Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on the
   mobility of polystyrene latex nanoparticles in granular porous media
   representative of groundwater aquifers or riverbank filtration settings.
   The transport behavior of 20 nm carboxylate-modified (CLPs) and sulfate
   (SLPs) polystyrene latex ENPs suspended in NaCl or CaCl2 (1 and 10 mM
   ionic strength, pH 7) was studied in columns packed with quartz sand
   coated with biofilms formed by two P. aeruginosa strains that differed
   in cell surface hydrophobicity (P. aeruginosa 9027 (TM), relatively
   hydrophilic and P. aeruginosa PAO1, relatively hydrophobic).
   Biofilm-coated quartz sand retained more of the electrostatically
   stabilized latex ENPs than clean, uncoated sand, regardless of the
   serotype. As IS increased, clear differences in the shape of the ENP
   breakthrough curves were observed for each type of biofilm coating. ENP
   breakthrough in the P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm-coated sand was generally
   constant with time whereby breakthrough in the P. aeruginosa 9027
   biofilm-coated sand showed dynamic behavior. This indicates a
   fundamental difference in the mechanisms of ENP deposition onto
   hydrophilic or hydrophobic biofilm coatings due to the hydration
   properties of these biofilms. The results of this study demonstrate the
   importance of considering the surface properties of aquifer grain
   coatings when evaluating ENP fate in natural subsurface environments.

   the decision-making process. We establish that if the parameter of the

   approach}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{65-72}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Existing evidence suggests that ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) (
   <0.1 mu m) may contribute to acute cardiorespiratory morbidity. However,
   few studies have examined the long-term health effects of these
   pollutants owing in part to a need for exposure surfaces that can be
   applied in large population-based studies. To address this need, we
   developed a land use regression model for UFPs in Montreal, Canada using
   mobile monitoring data collected from 414 road segments during the
   summer and winter months between 2011 and 2012. Two different approaches
   were examined for model development including standard multivariable
   linear regression and a machine learning approach (kernel-based
   regularized least squares (KRLS)) that learns the functional form of
   covariate impacts on ambient UFP concentrations from the data. The final
   models included parameters for population density, ambient temperature
   and wind speed, land use parameters (park space and open space), length
   of local roads and rail, and estimated annual average NOx emissions from
   traffic. The final multivariable linear regression model explained 62\%
   of the spatial variation in ambient UFP concentrations whereas the KRLS
   model explained 79\% of the variance. The KRLS model performed slightly
   better than the linear regression model when evaluated using an external
   dataset (R-2=0.58 vs. 0.55) or a cross-validation procedure (R-2=0.67
   vs. 0.60). In general, our findings suggest that the KRLS approach may
   offer modest improvements in predictive performance compared to standard
   multivariable linear regression models used to estimate spatial
   variations in ambient UFPs. However, differences in predictive
   performance were not statistically significant when evaluated using the
   cross-validation procedure. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{An as-cast Fe-0.2C-10Mn-3Si-3Al medium manganese steel with a ferrite
   plus austenite duplex microstructure was subjected to hot compression
   tests at deformation temperatures within two-phase (alpha + gamma) range
   and various strain rates. The microstructure evolution of the
   experimental steel during hot deformation was investigated. The flow
   curves were characterized by a discontinuous yielding at the beginning
   of plastic deformation, followed by a weak work hardening to a peak and
   a subsequent mild softening stage. Two restoration processes took place
   during hot deformation, namely dynamic recrystallization (DRX) of
   austenite and continuous dynamic recrystallization of ferrite. The DRX
   of austenite was believed to dominate the softening stage of the flow
   curves. The discontinuous yielding stemmed from the existing
   Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) orientation relationship between ferrite and
   austenite in the initial undeformed microstructure, which gradually
   weakened during subsequent deformation.}},

Title = {{Non-Fourier heat conduction in a sandwich panel with a cracked foam core}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Crack formation in cellular solids is often triggered by the presence of
   flaws caused by the manufacturing process that is used to build them. In
   thermal management applications, an imperfection embedded in the core of
   a sandwich panel might have a detrimental thermal impact that is often
   challenging to predict. This paper focuses on a theoretical study of
   non-Fourier heat conduction in a sandwich panel with a cracked foam
   core. With the aim of exploring the thermal response of a panel with
   porous core and skins made of a single material, we examine the role of
   crack position, relative density of the foam core, and other geometric
   parameters of the panel. Based on the assumption that the crack in the
   core is thermally insulated, i.e. no heat flux can pass through, we
   obtain the temperature distribution and heat flux intensity factor in
   the time domain via Fourier and Laplace transforms. The results are
   visualized in maps that show the influence of the size of the skin
   relative to that of the foam core and the crack location as well as the
   antagonist impact that the relative density of the foam core has on the
   maximum temperature and heat flux. The method presented here can be used
   to tailor the thermal response of sandwich panels. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Parboiling energy is met by wood in most West African Countries. This

   potential of rice husk is broadly examined under different utilization
   scenarios using energy replacement value based on a modified heating
   value, greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential and annual energy
   expenditure. Wood retailers are the main suppliers of parboiling energy,
   accounting for 65\% of wood supply. Wood consumption ranges from 030 to
   0.92 kg wood/kg of paddy soaked and 035-1.16 kg wood/kg of paddy for
   steamed. Rice husk use could effectively and efficiently replace wood
   achieving up to 67\% wood savings, 62.94\% GHG emission reduction and an
   annual parboiling energy expenditure reduction of 73\%. (C) 2015

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{The dune field intersected by the Israel-Egypt borderline has attracted
   many remote sensing studies over the years because it exhibits unique
   optical phenomena in several domains, from the visual to the thermal
   infrared. These phenomena are the result of land-use policies
   implemented by the two countries, which have differing effects on the
   two ecosystems. This study explores the surface properties that affect
   radar backscatter, namely the surface roughness and dielectric
   properties, in order to determine the cause for the variation across the
   border. The backscatter contrast was demonstrated for SIR-C, the first
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor to capture this phenomenon, as
   well as ASAR imagery that coincides with complementary ground
   observations. These field observations along the border, together with
   an aerial image from the same year as the SIR-C acquisition were used to
   analyze differences in vegetation patterns that can affect the surface
   roughness. The dielectric permittivity of two kinds of topsoil (sand,
   biocrust) was measured in the field and in the laboratory. The results
   suggest that the vegetation structure and spatial distribution differ
   between the two sides of the border in a manner that is consistent with
   the radar observations. The dielectric permittivity of sand and biocrust
   was found to be similar, although they are not constant across the radar
   spectral region (50 MHz-20 GHz). These findings support the hypothesis
   that changes to the vegetation, as a consequence of the different
   land-use practices in Israel and Egypt, are the cause for the radar
   backscatter contrast across the border. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is essential in our daily life to
   stabilize retinal images during head movements. Balanced vestibular
   functionality secures optimal reflex performance which otherwise can be
   distorted by peripheral vestibular lesions. Luckily, vestibular
   compensation in different neuronal sites restores VOR function to some
   extent over time. Studying vestibular compensation gives insight into
   the possible mechanisms for plasticity in the brain. In this work, novel
   experimental analysis tools are employed to reevaluate the VOR
   characteristics following unilateral vestibular lesions and
   compensation. Our results suggest that following vestibular lesions,
   asymmetric performance of the VOR is not only limited to its gain.
   Vestibular compensation also causes asymmetric dynamics, i.e., different
   time constants for the VOR during leftward or rightward passive head
   rotation. Potential mechanisms for these experimental observations are
   provided using simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofluids are a new class of fluids where nanosized solid particles are
   dispersed in a liquid medium. This study aims to experimentally
   investigate the production of gold nanofluids using catechin (CAT), a

   nanoparticles using UV-visible spectrophotometer, differential scanning
   calorimeter, dielectric spectroscopy, and transmission electron
   microscopy, attempts to generate information to understand the
   properties of green-synthesised gold nanofluids. Four nanofluids were
   prepared by varying their concentrations between CAT and tannic acid to
   form gold nanoparticles (AuNP) in water. The gold nanofluids exhibited
   interesting thermal, surface plasmon resonance, and dielectric
   properties. The formation of the AuNP was studied using two different
   methods using transmission electron microscope and they exhibited
   interesting growth patterns within 1 minute. These results are
   significant as they shed light on the importance of the onset of the
   AuNP formation.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the chemical processes that take place during hydrothermal
   gelation of graphene oxide (GO), quantifying the reaction products
   generated during hydrothermal reduction. The gelation proceeds with
   disproportionation of GO yielding a large amount of CO2 (about a quarter
   of the original mass of GO), organic acidic fragments, and CO. The CO,
   that is formed is trapped in the hydrogel creating macroscopic voids
   which can lead to cracking of the hydrogel during compression. We were
   able to quantify the amount of CO2 produced in situ by adding ammonia
   during the synthesis, and converting CO2 into ionic carbonate species
   that we could easily quantify by titration. We used titration to
   evaluate the formation of organic acidic fragments too and evaluated the
   amount of H2O and CO produced by thermogravimetric analysis and mass
   balance. The conversion of CO2 into ionic species allowed us to produce
   void-free hydrogels which remain structurally stable after extensive
   compression. However, such hydrogels on average showed lower mechanical
   strength and electrical conductivity than the hydrogels with voids. This
   is a result of the difference in chemistry and morphology between
   hydrogels reduced under acidic pH and basic pH. Our work provides for
   the first time a clear quantitative estimate of CO2 evolution and
   organic fragment formation during hydrothermal reduction of GO, an
   overall picture of the reaction products, and a deepened understanding
   of the conditions that can be used to prepare stronger and more
   conductive graphene hydrogels and aerogels.}},

Title = {{Hemodynamic Response to Interictal Epileptiform Discharges Addressed by
   Personalized EEG-fNIRS Recordings}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We aimed at studying the hemodynamic response (HR) to
   Interictal Epileptic Discharges (IEDs) using patient-specific and
   prolonged simultaneous ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) and functional Near
   InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings.
   Methods: The epileptic generator was localized using
   Magnetoencephalography source imaging. fNIRS montage was tailored for
   each patient, using an algorithm to optimize the sensitivity to the
   epileptic generator. Optodes were glued using collodion to achieve
   prolonged acquisition with high quality signal. fNIRS data analysis was
   handled with no a priori constraint on HR time course, averaging fNIRS
   signals to similar IEDs. Cluster-permutation analysis was performed on
   3D reconstructed fNIRS data to identify significant spatio-temporal HR
   clusters. Standard (GLM with fixed HRF) and cluster-permutation EEG-fMRI
   analyses were performed for comparison purposes.
   Results: fNIRS detected HR to IEDs for 8/9 patients. It mainly consisted
   oxy-hemoglobin increases (seven patients), followed by oxy-hemoglobin
   decreases (six patients). HR was lateralized in six patients and lasted
   from 8.5 to 30 s. Standard EEG-fMRI analysis detected an HR in 4/9
   patients (4/9 without enough IEDs, 1/9 unreliable result). The
   cluster-permutation EEG-fMRI analysis restricted to the region
   investigated by fNIRS showed additional strong and non-canonical BOLD
   responses starting earlier than the IEDs and lasting up to 30s.
   Conclusions: (i) EEG-fNIRS is suitable to detect the HR to IEDs and can
   outperform EEG-fMRI because of prolonged recordings and greater chance
   to detect IEDs: (ii) cluster-permutation analysis unveils additional HR
   features underestimated when imposing a canonical HR function (iii) the
   HR is often bilateral and lasts up to 30s.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling light between an optical fiber and a silicon nanophotonic
   waveguide is a challenge facing the field of silicon photonics to which
   various mode converters have been proposed. Inverted tapers stand out as
   a practical solution enabling efficient and broadband mode conversion.
   Current design approaches often use linearly-shaped tapers and two
   dimensional approximations; however, these approaches have not been
   rigorously verified and there is not an overarching design framework to
   guide the design process. Here, using a Lagrangian formulation, we
   propose an original, constant-loss framework for designing
   shape-controlled photonic devices and apply this formalism to derive an
   ideal constant-loss taper (CLT). We specifically report on the
   experimental demonstration of a fabrication-tolerant, 15-mu m-long CLT
   coupler, that produces 0.56 dB fiber-chip coupling efficiency, the
   highest efficiency-per-length ratio ever reported. (C) 2016 Optical

Title = {{Quantification of ecdysteroids and retinoic acids in whole daphnids by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1438}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of ecdysteroids and retinoic acids at picograms per
   individual is typically achieved with radioimmunoassay methods. However,
   those methods cannot identify individual types of ecdysteroids or
   provide an absolute concentration, which poses problems for comparative
   assays such as the metabolic profiling approach for toxicity testing.
   The method described in the present paper, based on liquid
   chromatography-electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass
   spectrometry, was developed to allow the quantification in whole
   daphnids extracts of ecdysteroids (20-hydroxyecdysone, ecdysone,
   ponasterone A) and retinoic acid (sum of isomers). This approach avoids
   having to perform the difficult task of sampling the haemolymph on small
   organism (<5 mm). Recoveries, evaluated at three concentrations in
   matrix blank fortified samples, ranged from 83 to 119\% for ecdysteroids
   and from 144 to 155\% for retinoic acids. Precision (2.4-14.2\%) and
   accuracy (-41.7 to 14.5\%) were reproducible and stable over three
   quality control concentrations. The described liquid
   chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method achieved
   quantification limits ranging from 210 to 380 pg mL(-1) for ecdysteroids
   and 5 ng mL(-1) for retinoic acids in spiked matrix blanks.
   20-hydroxyecdysone was quantified in Daphnia magna adults (19 +/- 8
   pgind(-1)) and juveniles (3.6 +/- 1.0 pgind(-1)), but was below the
   limit of quantification in neonates (approximate to 0.19 pg ind(-1)).
   Ecdysone was also detected in adult specimens (approximate to 1.8 pg
   ind(-1)). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of Molecular Diagnostics for Tuberculosis on Patient-Important
   Outcomes: A Systematic Review of Study Methodologies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Several reviews on the accuracy of Tuberculosis (TB) Nucleic Acid
   Amplification Tests (NAATs) have been performed but the evidence on
   their impact on patient-important outcomes has not been systematically
   reviewed. Given the recent increase in research evaluating such outcomes
   and the growing list of TB NAATs that will reach the market over the
   coming years, there is a need to bring together the existing evidence on
   impact, rather than accuracy. We aimed to assess the approaches that
   have been employed to measure the impact of TB NAATs on
   patient-important outcomes in adults with possible pulmonary TB and/or
   drug-resistant TB.
   Methods
   We first develop a conceptual framework to clarify through which
   mechanisms the improved technical performance of a novel TB test may
   lead to improved patient outcomes and outline which designs may be used
   to measure them. We then systematically review the literature on studies
   attempting to assess the impact of molecular TB diagnostics on such
   outcomes and provide a narrative synthesis of designs used, outcomes
   assessed and risk of bias across different study designs.
   Results
   We found 25 eligible studies that assessed a wide range of outcomes and
   utilized a variety of experimental and observational study designs. Many
   potentially strong design options have never been used. We found that
   much of the available evidence on patient-important outcomes comes from
   a small number of settings with particular epidemiological and
   operational context and that confounding, time trends and incomplete
   outcome data receive insufficient attention.
   Conclusions
   A broader range of designs should be considered when designing studies
   to assess the impact of TB diagnostics on patient outcomes and more
   attention needs to be paid to the analysis as concerns about confounding
   and selection bias become relevant in addition to those on measurement
   that are of greatest concern in accuracy studies.}},

Abstract = {{The heterogeneous grafting of chitosan with thermoresponsive
   (oligoethylene)glycol methacrylate (OEGMA)/diethyleneglycol methacrylate
   (MEO(2)MA)/acrylonitrile (AN) was accomplished by nitroxide mediated
   polymerization (NMP) with SG1-based BlocBuilder unimolecular initiators.
   Homogeneous OEGMA/MEO(2)MA/AN terpolymerizations in solution were done
   first at 120 degrees C to confirm the cloud point temperatures (CPTs) of
   the thermoresponsive chains that were to be grafted onto the chitosan
   (CPT tuning from 30 to 65 degrees C was done by varying OEGMA:MEO(2)MA
   in the initial monomer composition). Grafting was accomplished by
   reacting chitosan with acryloyl choride and the subsequent acrylamide
   grafted chitosan was reacted by a 1,2 intermolecular radical addition
   with BlocBuilder followed by NMP OEGMA/MEO(2)MA/AN monomers. TGA
   revealed 65-80\% of the composite material was due to the grafted
   polymer. CPTs of the chitosan-graft-poly(OEGMA-ran-MEO(2)MA-ran-AN)
   reflected those of the homogeneous case, but there was extensive
   hysteresis as the composite particles could not readily disentangle upon
   cooling below the CPT. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new process for the production of glycine by using antisolvent
   crystallization with the mixture of ethylene glycol (MEG) and water as a
   substitute for methanol has been developed on the basis of chemical
   modeling phase equilibria for the glycineNH(4)ClMEGH(2)O system. MEG is
   considered as a green solvent because it has great higher boiling point
   up to 470 K and thus is almost nonvolatile compared with methanol. We
   discovered that the solubility of glycine, NH4Cl and their mixtures can
   be greatly changed by altering the composition of the mixed MEG-H2O
   solvents and realized the complete separation of glycine and NH4Cl by
   water evaporation. Phase equilibria for the glycine NH4Cl-MEG-H2O system
   were measured from 278 to 353 K. The mixed-solvent electrolyte (MSE)
   model was applied with new binary interaction parameters obtained from
   regressing experimental and literature data. This newly modified model
   accurately predicted the solubilities in the quaternary glycine
   NH4Cl-MEG-H2O system with average absolute relative deviations of 5.84\%
   and 1.03\% for glycine and NH4Cl, respectively. Simulation for the new
   process was performed by the model to investigate its operating
   conditions, from which the optimal composition of antisolvent was
   determined to be 50 wt \% of MEG solution. Under this condition, glycine
   and NH4Cl were successfully separated from their solid mixtures in batch
   crystallization experiments, validating the feasibility of the proposed
   process for glycine production.}},

Abstract = {{The intermittent drying characteristics of an Iranian popular paddy rice
   variety were experimentally investigated to determine the drying
   kinetics and obtain the effective moisture diffusivity. A lab-scale
   fluidized bed dryer was designed and constructed to enable obtaining the
   required results while controlling critical drying parameters. The
   effects of drying temperature and tempering period on drying kinetics
   and moisture diffusivity were studied. The results showed a significant
   effect on drying performance and effective moisture diffusivity by
   adding tempering stage. Drying rate improved sharply by implementing the
   tempering stage, increase of drying air temperature as well as the
   tempering duration. Several thin layer drying models were fitted
   separately to experimental data of each drying stages namely
   pre-tempering and post-tempering and suitability of these models were
   examined using the statistical analysis. The Midilli and Tow-Term model
   were found to be the most appropriate one for the first and second
   drying stages, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Eight ultra-high-strength concrete (UHSC) square columns were
   constructed and tested to investigate the effects of yield strength of
   transverse (f(yh) approximate to 550 and 800 MPa {[}79.8 and 116.0 ksi])
   and longitudinal reinforcement (f(yh) approximate to 480 and 640 MPa
   {[}69.6 and 92.8 ksi]) on axial load response. The UHSC had compressive
   strengths varying from 185 to 200 MPa (26.8 to 29.0 ksi). The effects of
   using high-strength transverse reinforcement with two different
   configurations and amounts were evaluated. For a constant amount of
   confinement reinforcement, high-strength transverse reinforcement
   improves the performance of well-confined UHSC columns in terms of
   strength, post-peak deformability, and toughness, provided that the
   hoops are detailed with proper end anchorage (135-degree seismic hooks).
   The use of high-strength transverse reinforcement was also effective in
   reducing steel congestion for UHSC columns. The effects of using
   high-strength longitudinal reinforcement in UHSC columns were also
   studied. It was determined that the combination of high-strength
   longitudinal reinforcement and UHSC results in yielding of this
   reinforcement. However, for typical longitudinal reinforcement ratios,
   the benefit of using high-strength longitudinal steel is limited due to
   the relatively small contribution of this reinforcement to the strength
   of UHSC columns and the early cover spalling of UHSC.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, molecular community analysis and analytical measurements
   were combined to assess and compare the identity, functionality,
   structure, and temporal changes of membrane and conventional enhanced
   biological phosphorous removal systems (which ran stable over 300 days)
   and to identify the dynamics of the foam forming population. Magnesium
   was added to the system with the goal to enhance phosphate removal. Both
   systems behaved similarly with respect to phosphate and nitrogen removal
   efficiency and had similar community evenness, but they differed in
   community composition. A principle component analysis indicated that,
   the community of the membrane system changed permanently whereas the
   conventional system returned to approximately its initial composition.
   The relative intensity of DGGE bands were transformed in a numerical
   matrix and based on this matrix a model was constructed, which predicted
   some bands as foam forming bands, which were identified as foam-forming
   filamentous bacteria by sequencing.}},

   (g/g mixture) substrate loading, Ca(OH)(2) at 10 \% (g/g of substrate)
   and 106 min isothermal treatment could extract 69.67 +/- 1.26 \% (g/g)

Abstract = {{A competent low permeability and chemically inert geological barrier is
   an essential component of any strategy for the deep geological disposal
   of fluidized hazardous material and greenhouse gases. While the
   processes of injection are important to the assessment of the
   sequestration potential of the storage formation, the performance of the
   caprock is important to the containment potential, which can be
   compromised by the development of cracks and other defects that might be
   activated during and after injection. This paper presents a mathematical
   modelling approach that can be used to assess the state of stress in a
   surficial caprock during injection of a fluid to the interior of a
   poroelastic storage formation. Important information related to
   time-dependent evolution of the stress state and displacements of the
   surficial caprock with injection rates, and the stress state in the
   storage formation can be obtained from the theoretical developments.
   Most importantly, numerical results illustrate the influence of
   poromechanics on the development of adverse stress states in the
   geological barrier. The results obtained from the mathematical analysis
   illustrate that the surface heave increases as the hydraulic
   conductivity of the caprock decreases, whereas the surface heave
   decreases as the shear modulus of the caprock increases. The results
   also illustrate the influence of poromechanics on the development of
   adverse stress states in the caprock.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a portable paper-based microfluidic platform for
   multiplexed electrochemical detection of antibody markers of human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in serum
   samples. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper-based
   electrochemical immunosensing platform, with multiplexing and
   telemedicine capabilities, for diagnosing HIV/HCV co-infection. The
   platform consists of an electrochemical microfluidic paper-based
   immunosensor array (E-mu PIA) and a handheld multi-channel potentiostat,
   and is capable of performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
   simultaneously on eight samples within 20 min (using a prepared E-lPIA).
   The multiplexing feature of the platform allows it to produce multiple
   measurement data for HIV and HCV markers from a single run, and its
   wireless communication module can transmit the results to a remote site
   for telemedicine. The unique integration of paper-based microfluidics
   and mobile instrumentation renders our platform portable, low-cost,

Abstract = {{The input variable selection problem has recently garnered much interest
   in the time series modeling community, especially within water resources
   applications, demonstrating that information theoretic (nonlinear)-based
   input variable selection algorithms such as partial mutual information
   (PMI) selection (PMIS) provide an improved representation of the modeled
   process when compared to linear alternatives such as partial correlation
   input selection (PCIS). PMIS is a popular algorithm for water resources
   modeling problems considering nonlinear input variable selection;
   however, this method requires the specification of two nonlinear
   regression models, each with parametric settings that greatly influence
   the selected input variables. Other attempts to develop input variable
   selection methods using conditional mutual information (CMI) (an analog
   to PMI) have been formulated under different parametric pretenses such
   as k nearest-neighbor (KNN) statistics or kernel density estimates
   (KDE). In this paper, we introduce a new input variable selection method
   based on CMI that uses a nonparametric multivariate continuous
   probability estimator based on Edgeworth approximations (EA). We improve
   the EA method by considering the uncertainty in the input variable
   selection procedure by introducing a bootstrap resampling procedure that
   uses rank statistics to order the selected input sets; we name our
   proposed method bootstrap rank-ordered CMI (broCMI). We demonstrate the
   superior performance of broCMI when compared to CMI-based alternatives
   (EA, KDE, and KNN), PMIS, and PCIS input variable selection algorithms
   on a set of seven synthetic test problems and a real-world urban water
   demand (UWD) forecasting experiment in Ottawa, Canada.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations and analysis indicate that the Richtmyer-Meshkov
   instability (RMI) is suppressed in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in
   Cartesian slab geometry. Motivated by the presence of hydrodynamic
   instabilities in inertial confinement fusion and suppression by means of
   a magnetic field, we investigate the RMI via linear MHD simulations in
   cylindrical geometry. The physical setup is that of a Chisnell-type
   converging shock interacting with a density interface with either axial
   or azimuthal (2D) perturbations. The linear stability is examined in the
   context of an initial value problem (with a time-varying base state)
   wherein the linearized ideal MHD equations are solved with an upwind
   numerical method. Linear simulations in the absence of a magnetic field
   indicate that RMI growth rate during the early time period is similar to
   that observed in Cartesian geometry. However, this RMI phase is
   short-lived and followed by a Rayleigh-Taylor instability phase with an
   accompanied exponential increase in the perturbation amplitude. We
   examine several strengths of the magnetic field (characterized by beta =
   2p/B-r(2)) and observe a significant suppression of the instability for
   beta <= 4. The suppression of the instability is attributed to the
   transport of vorticity away from the interface by Alfven fronts. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{48-56}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Air jet impingement is an effective enhanced heat transfer technique
   which has been widely applied in cooling of electronic components and
   drying of continuous sheets of materials, etc. Although steady and
   unsteady impingement systems have led to many studies on jet impingement
   flow and heat transfer, the vast majority of them focus on smooth
   surfaces. As the flow and thermal physics of jet impingement on a rough
   surface are significantly different from that on a smooth surface, a
   numerical study was performed on the two-dimensional air jet impingement
   with a model rough surface by computational fluid dynamics method. A
   sinusoidal wave was employed to model the rough impinging target surface
   subjected to a slot jet nozzle. A dimensionless heat transfer
   enhancement factor was introduced to quantify the effect of jet flow
   Reynolds number, jet impingement dimension, and surface roughness as
   well as temperature difference between jet flow and impinging target on
   the heat transfer of jet impingement. It is observed that the roughness
   effect is minimal in the impingement zone while it is prominent in the
   wall jet region, and the surface roughness plays a dominant role on the
   enhancement factor of heat transfer rate compared with jet geometrical
   dimension, Reynolds number of jet flow as well as temperature
   difference. Furthermore, entropy generation analysis was also performed
   on the heat and mass transfer in air jet impingement, and optimal
   designs were found with entropy generation minimization principle
   accordingly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Agel aspiration-ejection (GAE) system has been developed for the
   advanced production and delivery of injectable dense collagen (I-DC)
   gels of unique collagen fibrillar densities (CFDs). Through the creation
   of negative pressure, GAE aspirates prefabricated highly hydrated
   collagen gels into a needle, simultaneously inducing compaction and
   meso-scale anisotropy (i.e., fibrillar alignment) on the gels, and by
   subsequent reversal of the pressure, I-DC gels can be controllably
   ejected. The system generates I-DC gels with CFDs ranging from 5 to 32
   wt\%, controlling the initial scaffold microstructure, anisotropy,
   hydraulic permeability, and mechanical properties. These features could
   potentially enable the minimally invasive delivery of more stable
   hydrogels. The viability, metabolic activity, and differentiation of
   seeded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was investigated in the I-DC gels
   of distinct CFDs and extents of anisotropy produced through two
   different gauge needles. MSC osteoblastic differentiation was found to
   be relatively accelerated in I-DC gels that combined physiologically
   relevant CFDs and increased fibrillar alignment. The ability to not only
   support homogenous cell seeding, but also to direct and accelerate their
   differentiation through tissue-equivalent anisotropy, creates numerous
   opportunities in regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a three-node buffer-aided relaying network with statistical
   quality-of-service (QoS) constraint in terms of maximum acceptable
   end-to-end queue-length bound outage probability. In particular, we
   study the adaptive link selection relaying problem that aims to maximize
   the constant supportable arrival rate mu to the source (i.e., the
   effective capacity). Fixed and adaptive source and relay power
   allocation are investigated. By employing asymptotic delay analysis, we
   first convert the QoS constraint into minimum QoS exponent constraints
   at the source and relay queues. We then derive the link selection and
   power allocation solutions as functions of the instantaneous link
   conditions and QoS exponents using Lagrangian approach. Solutions for
   various special cases of link conditions and QoS constraints are
   presented. Moreover, we compare the effective capacities of the proposed
   relaying schemes and other existing schemes under different link
   conditions and QoS constraints. Illustrative results indicate that the
   proposed schemes offer substantial performance gains, and power adaption
   outperforms fixed power allocation at low signal-to-noise power ratio
   (SNR) region or under loose QoS constraints.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the concept of faster-than-Nyquist rate (FTN) broadcasting,
   which nonorthogonally multiplexes more than one user message in the
   continuous-time domain for transmission over broadcast channels. Two FTN
   broadcasting approaches, namely, sub-FTN and full-FTN, are considered
   for broadcasting of K independent messages over K-user continuous time
   Gaussian broadcast channel. The derived achievable rate regions of the
   two approaches are shown to be, in general, greater than the capacity
   region of the optimally coded Nyquist-rate broadcasting using a same
   modulating pulse. The full-FTN broadcasting provides larger degrees of
   freedom (capacity pre-log factor) to each user of the broadcast channel
   while the sub-FTN improves signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios of
   the individual link. The amount of capacity gains in high SNR regime is
   linearly proportional to excess bandwidth in the modulating pulse used
   and dependent on FTN signaling rates, channel SNRs, and number of users
   in the broadcast channel. The simulated sub-FTN and full-FTN broadcast
   transceivers outperform coded Nyquist-rate systems both in BER
   performances and in capacity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a cooperative wideband spectrum sensing scheme based on
   the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for the
   detection of a primary user (PU) system in multiantenna cognitive radio
   (CR) networks. Given noisy signal observations from N secondary users
   (SUs) over multiple subbands at a fusion center (FC), prior works on
   cooperative spectrum sensing often use the set of received subband
   energy as decision statistics over the sensing interval. However, to
   achieve satisfactory performance, knowledge of the channel state
   information (CSI) and the noise variances at all the SUs is required by
   these algorithms. To overcome this limitation, our proposed method,
   which is referred to as joint detection and estimation (JDE), adopts the
   EMalgorithm to jointly detect the PU signal and estimate the unknown
   channel frequency responses and noise variances over multiple subbands
   in an iterative manner. Various aspects of this proposed EM-JDE scheme
   are investigated, including a reliable initialization strategy to ensure
   convergence under practical conditions and a distributed implementation
   to reduce communication overhead. Under the assumption of perfect
   estimation for the channel frequency responses and noise variances, we
   further show that the proposed EM-JDE converges to the maximumlikelihood
   (ML) solution, which serves as an upper bound on its performance. Monte
   Carlo simulations over Rayleigh fading channels show that the proposed
   scheme significantly improves the performance of spectrum detection by
   exploiting the diversity of the spatially distributed SUs with multiple
   antennas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying
   for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) multiuser relay networks,
   where each source transmits multiple data streams to its corresponding
   destination with the assistance of multiple relays. Assuming realistic
   imperfect channel state information (CSI) of all the source-relay and
   relay-destination links, we propose a robust optimization framework for
   the joint design of the source transmit precoders (TPCs), relay AF
   matrices and receive filters. Specifically, two wellknown CSI error
   models are considered, namely, the statistical and the norm-bounded
   error models. We commence by considering the problem of minimizing the
   maximum per-stream mean square error (MSE) subject to the source and
   relay power constraints (min-max problem). Then, the statistically
   robust and worst-case robust versions of this problem, which take into
   account the statistical and norm-bounded CSI errors, respectively, are
   formulated. Both of the resultant optimization problems are nonconvex
   (semi-infinite in the worst-case robust design). Therefore, algorithmic
   solutions having proven convergence and tractable complexity are
   proposed by resorting to the iterative block coordinate update approach
   along with matrix transformation and convex conic optimization
   techniques. We then consider the problem of minimizing the maximum
   per-relay power subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for
   each stream and the source power constraints (QoS problem).
   Specifically, an efficient initial feasibility search algorithm is
   proposed based on the relationship between the feasibility check and the
   min-max problems. Our simulation results show that the proposed joint
   transceiver design is capable of achieving improved robustness against
   different types of CSI errors when compared with non-robust approaches.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an empirical study aiming at identifying the main
   differences between different logistic regression models and collision
   data aggregation methods that are commonly applied in road safety
   literature for modeling collision severity. In particular, the research
   compares three popular multilevel logistic models (i.e., sequential
   binary logit models, ordered logit models, and multinomial logit models)
   as well as three data aggregation methods (i.e., occupant based, vehicle
   based, and collision based). Six years of collision data (2001-2006)
   from 31 highway routes from across the province of Ontario, Canada were
   used for this analysis. It was found that a multilevel multinomial logit
   model has the best fit to the data than the other two models while the
   results obtained from occupant-based data are more reliable than those
   from vehicle-and collision-based data. More importantly, while generally
   consistent in terms of factors that were found to be significant between
   different models and data aggregation methods, the effect size of each
   factor differ substantially, which could have significant implications
   for evaluating the effects of different safety-related policies and
   countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents a heuristic technique for simplifying the
   parity-check node operation in a relaxed min-sum iterative decoder. The
   proposed decoder eliminates the second-minimum computation in check
   nodes, which allows broadcasting the same output to all neighboring
   variable nodes to alleviate routing problem in VLSI implementations of
   low-density parity check (LDPC) decoders. The second-minimum, when
   required, is emulated by adding an offset to the first-minimum. The
   proposed relaxed decoder also uses a relaxation factor equal to 0.5 to
   simplify variable nodes. Simulation results for two LDPC codes show the
   proposed decoding algorithm with only 4-bit quantization closely matches
   the performance of floating-point normalized/offset min-sum and
   sum-product decoders in the waterfall region.}},

Abstract = {{Optical integrated network (OIN) is a promising alternative to overcome
   the restrictions that electrical networks-on-chip (eNoCs) will face in
   the next generation of multiprocessor integrated systems due to
   electrical interconnects' physical limitations. OINs present a higher
   bandwidth and lower power consumption but their full capabilities are
   curbed by high latency controllers. Control techniques, such as circuit
   switching, impose a high latency to perform the correct network routing
   and a better solution must be found in order to fully utilize OINs. In
   this letter, we have designed and modeled a low-latency centralized
   controller (LUCC). For validation purposes, we modeled different
   Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)-based optical interconnects that
   employ the proposed LUCC. We obtain a response time of only one clock
   cycle when using the LUCC, even when conflicts are found.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the use of a forward body biasing (FBB) scheme to
   mitigate output conductance degradation due to short channel effects in
   ultra-low voltage (ULV) circuits with no additional power consumption.
   It is shown that FBB boosts the output resistance of a transistor such
   that the intrinsic gain reduction due to low-supply voltages can be
   compensated. This technique is then used to implement a low-noise
   amplifier (LNA) tailored for ultra-low power (ULP) and ULV applications.
   The proposed LNA uses common-gate (CG) NMOS transistors as input devices
   in a complementary current-reuse structure. Low-power input matching is
   achieved by employing an active shunt-feedback architecture while the
   current of the feedback stage is also reused by the input transistor.
   Moreover, a separate FBB scheme is exploited to tune the feedback
   coefficient. An inductive gm-boosting technique is used to increase the
   bandwidth of the LNA without additional power consumption. The proposed
   LNA is implemented in an IBM 0.13 mu m 1P8M CMOS technology and occupies
   0.39 mm(2). The measured LNA has a 14 dB gain, 4 dB minimum noise
   figure, IIP3 of -10 dBm, and 0.6-4.2 GHz bandwidth, while consuming only
   500 mu A from a 0.5 V supply. The LNA operates with supplies as low as
   0.4 V while maintaining good performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents algorithms and hardware implementations of
   associative memories based on multiple-valued sparse clustered networks
   (MV-SCNs). SCNs are recently-introduced binary-weighted associative
   memories that significantly improve the storage and retrieval
   capabilities over the prior state-of-the art. However, deleting or
   updating the messages stored in binary-weighted connections result in a
   significant increase in the data retrieval error probability as the
   binary-weighted connections deleted may be shared for several data
   patterns. In order to address the problem, the proposed algorithm
   exploits multiple-valued weighted connections of the network for storing
   the messages while maintaining the number of computation nodes in a
   cluster. The use of the multiple-valued weighted connections reduces the
   probability of deleting the shared connections compared to the
   binary-weighted connections. As a result, the proposed algorithm lowers
   the error rate by an order of magnitude for our sample network with 60\%
   deleted contents compared to the conventional algorithm when the same
   amount of memory is used. For performance comparisons in hardware, the
   proposed SCNs are designed using Verilog-HDL and synthesized on TSMC 65
   nm CMOS technology. The synthesis results show that the proposed MV-SCNs
   are around 10\% smaller than the conventional binary-weighted SCNs as
   the number of computation nodes in the proposed SCNs is smaller than
   that of the conventional SCNs with the comparable speed and memory size.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical calculation method for the computation
   of the magnetic vector potential of an axisymmetric solenoid in the

   the analysis of the current carrying coil in the presence of the

   solution approach is based on partitioning the solution domain into
   distinct regions. The general form of the solution to Maxwell's equation
   in each region along with the corresponding boundary conditions is
   obtained using the Fourier analysis and the separation of variables. The
   final solution to the boundary value problem is constituted by
   considering the continuity of the magnetic vector potential, as well as
   the magnetic field, on the interfaces between the regions. Finally, the
   proposed analytical computation method is applied on an electromagnetic
   actuator. The magnetic vector potential is computed over the entire
   solution domain, and the result is compared with that of the

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an approach to construct a rational function that
   fits the finite set of data points on the B-H plane representing the
   non-linear response of a permeable material, providing an approximation
   to the data well-suited for interpolation and extrapolation. Improving
   on previous methods, this approach provides a smooth, closed-form
   approximation to the data capable of representing the material's
   response from its Rayleigh region through to its saturation, appropriate
   for use with finite-element solvers. This is achieved by applying the
   method of vector fitting (as seen in the discipline of control systems)
   to the B-H data set, while taking care to remove pole-zero pairs that
   may occur between data points. The method is demonstrated to provide
   high-accuracy approximations to the data sets of a range of materials.
   Good agreement with measured data is obtained when the rational material
   representation is used in a finite-element software package to solve the

Abstract = {{Design engineers are always looking for extra computational power to
   speed up the execution of their tasks. One way to achieve this speedup
   is to identify tasks with a high degree of parallelism and process them
   with graphic processing units (GPUs). GPUs are optimized to process such
   tasks efficiently and quickly in massive multicore hardware. The steps
   involved in a finite-element (FE) electromagnetic simulation are
   computationally very expensive. One such step is the communication
   between FE solver and the material loss model that takes place for all
   the elements in the mesh for each time step. This task is massively
   parallel and, thus, could be executed in a GPU. As an example, a
   physics-based material model, the Jiles-Atherton model, is implemented
   in a GPU to compute the B-H hysteretic relationship, which can be
   directly incorporated in FE simulations. The performance of the GPU is
   compared with that of the given microprocessor in terms of computational
   time. A time gain of 13.8 times has been achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The operating conditions, such as the frequency of excitation and

   behavior of ferromagnetic cores, which translates into increased iron
   losses. The physics-based hysteresis models, such as the Jiles-Atherton

   losses and can be embedded in the finite-element simulations. In this
   paper, we have implemented the JA model to predict iron losses, and the
   effect of the frequency of the excitation waveform and compressive
   stress on the JA model parameters has been investigated. A simple
   approach is proposed to predict iron losses for any value of frequency
   and compressive stress using the original JA model equation. This
   approach not only reduces the computational complexity of the problem,
   but also reduces the amount of material information required.}},

Abstract = {{A generalizable algorithm is proposed for the design optimization of
   synchronous reluctance machine rotors. Single-barrier models are
   considered to reduce the algorithm's computational complexity and
   provide a relative comparison for rotors with different slots-per-pole
   combinations. Two objective values per sampled design (average and
   ripple torques) are computed using 2-D finite-element analysis
   simulations. Non-linear regression or surrogate models are trained for
   the two objectives through a Bayesian regularization backpropagation
   neural network. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to find the
   validated Pareto front solutions. An analytical ellipse constraint is
   then suggested to encapsulate optimal solutions. Compared with a direct
   sampling approach, this restriction captures an optimal region within
   the double-barrier space for further torque ripple reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate road-traffic emission inventories are of great interest to
   metropolitan planning agencies especially in the appraisal of regional
   transport policies. Integrated road transport emission models are an
   effective means of establishing emission estimates, yet their
   development requires significant investments in data and resources. It
   is therefore important to investigate which data inputs are the most
   critical to inventory accuracy. To address this issue, an integrated
   transport and emissions model is developed using the Montreal
   metropolitan region as a case-study. Daily regional hydrocarbon (HC)
   emissions from private individual travel are estimated, including the
   excess emissions due to engine starts. The sensitivity of emission
   estimates is then evaluated by testing various levels of input
   aggregation common in practice and in previous research. The evaluated
   inputs include the effect of start emissions, ambient weather
   conditions, traffic speed, path choice, and vehicle registry
   information. Inherent randomness within the integrated model through
   vehicle selection and path allocation is also evaluated. The inclusion
   of start emissions is observed to have the largest impact on emission
   inventories, contributing approximately 67 \% of total on-road HC
   emissions. Ambient weather conditions (season) and vehicle registry data
   (types, model years) are also found to be significant. Model randomness
   had a minimal effect in comparison with the impact of other variables.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on monthly scans of healthy patient volunteers with
   the clinical prototype of a microwave imaging system. The system uses
   time-domain measurements, and incorporates a multistatic radar approach
   to imaging. It operates in the 2-4 GHz range and contains 16 wideband
   sensors embedded in a hemispherical dielectric radome. The system has
   been previously tested on tissue phantoms in controlled experiments.
   With this system prototype, we scanned 13 patients (26 breasts) over an
   eight-month period, collecting a total of 342 breast scans. The goal of
   the study described in this paper was to investigate how the system
   measurements are impacted by multiple factors that are unavoidable in
   monthly monitoring of human subjects. These factors include both
   biological variability (e.g., tissue variations due to hormonal changes
   or weight gain) and measurement variability (e.g., inconsistencies in
   patient positioning, system noise). For each patient breast, we process
   the results of the monthly scans to assess the variability in both the
   raw measured signals and in the generated images. The significance of
   this study is that it quantifies how much variability should be
   anticipated when conducting microwave breast imaging of a healthy
   patient over a longer period. This is an important step toward
   establishing the feasibility of the microwave radar imaging system for
   frequent monitoring of breast health.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study is to investigate the nonlinear motion
   characteristics of a shear deformable microplate based on the modified
   couple stress theory. The microplate is modeled via the third-order
   shear deformation theory retaining in-plane displacements and inertia.
   Using the Lagrange equations together with an assumed-mode method, five
   sets of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations of motion
   with coupled terms are obtained. These five sets of equations (two for
   the in-plane motions, one for the out-of-plane motion, and two for
   rotations) are transformed into ten sets of first-order nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations. These resultant equations are then
   solved by means of a direct time integration technique and the
   pseudo-arclength continuation method in order to analyze the nonlinear
   response of the system. Apart from the nonlinear analysis, the linear
   natural frequencies of the system are obtained using an eigenvalue
   analysis. Results are shown through frequency-response and
   force-response curves. Points of interest in the parameter space in the
   form of time histories, phase-plane portraits, and fast Fourier
   transforms are also highlighted. Moreover, a comparison is made between
   the motion characteristics of the system based on the modified couple
   stress and classical continuum theories.}},

Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{109-124}},

Abstract = {{The rapid formation of nitric oxide (NO) within the flame front of
   hydrocarbon flames, occurring via the prompt-NO formation route, is
   strongly coupled to the concentration of the methylidyne radical,
   {[}CH]. This work presents absolute measurements of {[}CH] taken in
   atmospheric-pressure, premixed, stagnation flames of methane, ethane,
   propane, and n-butane. One-dimensional (1D) CH fluorescence profiles are
   extracted from 2D Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) measurements
   made quantitative through normalization by the Rayleigh scattering
   signal of nitrogen. Axial velocity profiles are measured by Particle
   Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) and, along with mixture composition and
   temperature measurements, provide the required boundary conditions for
   flame simulations based on the 1D hydrodynamic model of Kee et al.
   (1989). A time-resolved, four-level, LIF model considering rotational
   energy transfer in both the ground and excited electronic states is used
   to convert the modeled CH concentration profiles into units compatible
   with the quantitative CH-LIF measurements. Large variations in the CH
   concentrations predicted by four thermochemical mechanisms are observed
   for all fuels and equivalence ratios considered. A detailed study of the
   mechanisms, through reaction path and sensitivity analysis, shows that
   the principal reactions impacting CH formation are: (a) involved in the
   CH formation route (CH3 -> CH2{*} -> CH2 -> CH), (b) bypass and remove
   carbon atoms from the CH formation route, or (c) affect the pool of
   reaction partners in the aforementioned reactions. The order of
   magnitude variability in the model predictions is caused by significant
   disagreements among the mechanisms in terms of rate coefficients and
   reactions included in these pathways. This data set is made available
   and provides validation and optimization targets for future combustion
   model revisions. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Title = {{Comparison of Homogenous Region Delineation Approaches for Regional
   Flood Frequency Analysis at Ungauged Sites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The occurrence of floods and their impacts on hydrologic systems and
   society are critical considerations in the design and management of a
   large number of water resources projects. As streamflow records are
   often limited or unavailable at many watersheds, it is necessary to
   develop better methods for regional estimation of floods at these
   partially-gauged or ungauged sites. In this paper, a comparative study
   of homogeneous region delineation approaches in the context of regional
   flood quantile estimation is presented. Three approaches were considered
   in this study using the available annual maximum series (AMS) of flood
   peaks for 57 watersheds in Quebec, Canada. The first approach was the
   scaling method, which is a relatively new approach for homogeneous
   region delineation. This approach is based on the scaling behavior of
   the flood series with the basin area. The other two approaches were the
   region of influence (ROI) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
   methods. Regional flood estimation was carried out using the index flood
   method. The jackknife technique was used to represent the ungauged site
   condition. Analyses of hydrologic data from Quebec have indicated that
   the AMS exhibited a simple scaling behavior and that the drainage area
   alone may describe most of the variability in the statistical moments of
   the AMS data. Results of this numerical application have found that the
   flood quantile estimates obtained from the scaling approach are more
   accurate and more robust than those given by the ROI or CCA methods. In
   addition, it was found that the grouping of similar basins on the basis
   of the scaling approach formed well-defined geographical regions with
   distinct climatic characteristics.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{23-33}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The remarkable mechanical performance of biological materials such as
   bone, nacre, and spider silk stems from their staggered microstructure
   in which stiff and strong reinforcements are elongated in the direction
   of loading, separated by softer interfaces, and shifted relative to each
   other. This structure results in useful combinations of modulus,
   strength and toughness and therefore is increasingly mimicked in
   bio-inspired engineering composites. Here, we report the use of a simple
   and versatile technique based on doctor-blading to fabricate staggered
   composites of microscopic alumina tablets with high alignment in a
   chitosan matrix. Tensile tests on these nacre -like materials show that
   the modulus and strength of the composite films are enhanced by the
   incorporation of ceramic tablets, but only up to 15 vol\% after which
   all properties degrade. This phenomenon, also reported in the past for
   most of nacre -like materials, composed of micro/nano tablets, obtained
   from different techniques, has been limiting our ability to produce
   large volumes of high-performance nacre -like materials. Examination of
   the structure of the films revealed that at lower tablet concentrations
   the tablets are well -aligned and well dispersed thorough the volume of
   the film. At 15 vol\% and beyond, we observed tablet misalignment and
   clustering. In order to investigate the impact of these imperfections on
   material performance we developed large scale finite element models
   representative of the structure of the composite films. These models
   show that the mechanical performance significantly degrades with tablet
   misalignment, and especially at high tablet concentrations. The
   simulations along with the SEM images therefore quantitatively explain
   the experimental trends, e.g. the degradation of mechanical properties
   at high tablet contents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Rethinking research in the medical humanities: a scoping review and

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesThe rise of medical humanities teaching in medical education
   has introduced pressure to prove efficacy and utility. Review articles
   on the available evidence have been criticised for poor methodology and
   unwarranted conclusions. To support a more nuanced discussion of how the
   medical humanities work, we conducted a scoping review of quantitative
   studies of medical humanities teaching.
   MethodsUsing a search strategy involving MEDLINE, EMBASE and ERIC, and
   hand searching, our scoping review located 11045 articles that referred
   to the use of medical humanities teaching in medical education. Of
   these, 62 studies using quantitative evaluation methods were selected
   for review. Three iterations of analysis were performed: descriptive,
   conceptual, and discursive.
   ResultsDescriptive analysis revealed that the medical humanities as a
   whole cannot be easily systematised based on simple descriptive
   categories. Conceptual analysis supported the development of a
   conceptual framework in which the foci of the arts and humanities in
   medical education can be mapped alongside their related epistemic
   functions for teaching and learning. Within the framework, art
   functioned as expertise, as dialogue or as a means of expression and
   transformation. In the discursive analysis, we found three main ways in
   which the relationship between the arts and humanities and medicine was
   constructed as, respectively, intrinsic, additive and curative.
   ConclusionsThis review offers a nuanced framework of how different types
   of medical humanities work. The epistemological assumptions and
   discursive positioning of medical humanities teaching frame the forms of
   outcomes research that are considered relevant to curriculum decision
   making, and shed light on why dominant review methodologies make some
   functions of medical humanities teaching visible and render others
   invisible. We recommend the use of this framework to improve the rigor
   and relevance of future explorations of the efficacy and utility of
   medical humanities teaching.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The size-dependent dynamical performance of a microgyroscope is
   investigated via use of the modified couple stress theory. The
   size-dependent potential energy and the kinetic energy of the system are
   constructed as functions of both transverse and lateral motions as well
   as base-rotation; the works of DC and AC voltages applied by the drive
   and sense electrodes are constructed in terms of the system parameters.
   The work and energy terms are balanced via use of Hamilton's principle
   yielding the continuous expressions for the transverse and lateral
   motions of the microgyroscope. By means of a weighted-residual method, a
   reduction procedure is applied leading to a reduced-order model. This
   model is solved via use of a continuation technique. The relation
   between the base-rotation and gyroscopic couplings is obtained and the
   calibration curve of the microgyroscope is plotted. The size-dependent
   frequency response curves for the sense and drive directions are
   obtained; the gyroscopic effect gives rise to the displacement in the
   sense direction. The effect of different system parameter including the
   length-scale parameter on the dynamical performance of the

Abstract = {{Fluorescent-based live/dead labelling combined with fluorescent
   microscopy is one of the widely used and reliable methods for assessment
   of cell viability. This method is, however, not quantitative. Many
   image-processing methods have been proposed for cell quantification in
   an image. Among all these methods, several of them are capable of
   quantifying the number of cells in high-resolution images with closely
   packed cells. However, no method has addressed the quantification of the
   number of cells in low-resolution images containing closely packed cells
   with variable sizes. This paper presents a novel method for automatic
   quantification of live/dead cells in 2D fluorescent low-resolution
   images containing closely packed cells with variable sizes using a mean
   shift-based gradient flow tracking. Accuracy and performance of the
   method was tested on growth plate confocal images. Experimental results
   show that our algorithm has a better performance in comparison to other
   methods used in similar detection conditions.
   Lay description In biology, it is frequently needed to count the number
   of live and dead cells in microscopic images. When processing large
   number of samples, automatic cell counting approaches become very
   useful. Most of the available viability tests results in fluorescent
   images. Therefore, many algorithms have been previously proposed for
   identifying and counting the number of cells in such images. Although
   several methods have been previously developed for cell segmentations in
   images with closely packed cells of various size and shapes, but most of
   them fail to identify cells in low-resolution images. The purpose of
   ours study was to develop and validate an algorithm based on gradient
   flow tracking, which is able to count the number of closely packed cells
   with different size and shapes in low resolution images. Our method is
   based on finding the centers of cells as an indicator of the number of
   cells in an image by detecting the intersection of gradient vectors. In
   comparison to other existing methods, our proposed algorithm resulted in
   a more accurate quantification of cells.}},

Abstract = {{Actual implementation of augmented Lagrangian algorithms requires a
   solution of the subproblem generated at each iterate, which is the most
   challenging task. In this paper, we propose two approaches to make the
   augmented Lagrangian algorithms, introduced in Iusem and Nasri (RAIRO
   Oper Res 44:5-26, 2010) for equilibrium problems, computer amenable. The
   first algorithm that we suggest here incorporates the Newton method and
   the other one benefits from the Shor subgradient method to solve the
   subproblems that are produced when the augmented Lagrangian algorithms
   are applied to the equilibrium problem. We also illustrate our findings
   by numerical results which are obtained when our algorithms are
   implemented to solve quadratic equilibrium problems and certain
   generalized Nash equilibrium problem, including the river basin
   pollution problem, a particular case of the equilibrium problem.
   Moreover, we compare our numerical results with those presented in
   Matioli et al. (Comput Optim Appl 52:281-292, 2012) and Tran et al.
   (Optimization 57:749-776, 2008) for the same test problems.}},

Title = {{Geometric Effect of Asperities on Shear Mechanism of Rock Joints}},
Journal = {{ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{801-820}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional tracking of changes of asperities is one of the most
   important ways to illustrate shear mechanism of rock joints during
   testing. In this paper, the changes of the role of asperities during
   different stages of shearing are described by using a new methodology
   for the characterization of the asperities. The basis of the proposed
   method is the examination of the three-dimensional roughness of joint
   surfaces scanned before and after shear testing. By defining a concept
   named `tiny window', the geometric model of the joint surfaces is
   reconstructed. Tiny windows are expressed as a function of the x and y
   coordinates, the height (z coordinate), and the angle of a small area of
   the surface. Constant normal load (CNL) direct shear tests were
   conducted on replica joints and, by using the proposed method, the
   distribution and size of contact and damaged areas were identified.
   Image analysis of the surfaces was used to verify the results of the
   proposed method. The results indicated that the proposed method is
   suitable for determining the size and distribution of the contact and
   damaged areas at any shearing stage. The geometric properties of the
   tiny windows in the pre-peak, peak, post-peak softening, and residual
   shearing stages were investigated based on their angle and height. It
   was found that tiny windows that face the shear direction, especially
   the steepest ones, have a primary role in shearing. However, due to
   degradation of asperities at higher normal stresses and shear
   displacements, some of the tiny windows that do not initially face the
   shear direction also come in contact. It was also observed that tiny
   windows with different heights participate in the shearing process, not
   just the highest ones. Total contact area of the joint surfaces was
   considered as summation of just-in-contact areas and damaged areas. The
   results of the proposed method indicated that considering differences
   between just-in-contact areas and damaged areas provide useful insights
   into understanding the shear mechanism of rock joints.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the concentration and nature of functional groups in plasma

   Plasma polymer films containing various concentrations of nitrogen and

   capacitively-coupled glow discharge reactor by plasma polymerization of
   binary gas mixtures of a hydrocarbon (ethylene or butadiene) and a
   heteroatom source gas (ammonia and/or carbon dioxide). Increasing the
   flow ratio of heteroatom to hydrocarbon gases increased the
   concentration of bonded nitrogen or oxygen, including that of primary
   amine or carboxylic groups as determined by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and chemical derivatization procedures. The zeta potential
   of samples was measured using an electro-kinetic analyser in a diluted
   sodium chloride solution. The deposition parameters controlled the
   composition of the coatings, allowing to tune the surface charge to
   either positive (ammonia based films)-or negatively (carbon dioxide base
   films) values at physiological pH.}},

Abstract = {{We present a framework to detect fast oscillations (FOs) in
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) and to perform magnetic source imaging
   (MSI) to determine the location and extent of their generators in the
   cortex. FOs can be of physiologic origin associated to sensory
   processing and memory consolidation. In epilepsy, FOs are of pathologic
   origin and biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone. Seventeen patients with
   focal epilepsy previously confirmed with identified FOs in scalp
   electroencephalography (EEG) were evaluated. To handle data deriving
   from large number of sensors (275 axial gradiometers) we used an
   automatic detector with high sensitivity. False positives were discarded
   by two human experts. MSI of the FOs was performed with the wavelet
   based maximum entropy on the mean method. We found FOs in 11/17
   patients, in only one patient the channel with highest FO rate was not
   concordant with the epileptogenic region and might correspond to
   physiologic oscillations. MEG FOs rates were very low: 0.02-4.55 per
   minute. Compared to scalp EEG, detection sensitivity was lower, but the
   specificity higher in MEG. MSI of FOs showed concordance or partial
   concordance with proven generators of seizures and epileptiform activity
   in 10/11 patients. We have validated the proposed framework for the
   non-invasive study of FOs with MEG. The excellent overall concordance
   with other clinical gold standard evaluation tools indicates that MEG
   FOs can provide relevant information to guide implantation for
   intracranial EEG pre-surgical evaluation and for surgical treatment, and
   demonstrates the important added value of choosing appropriate FOs
   detection and source localization methods.}},

Abstract = {{Automated counting technologies are one of the fastest growing sources
   of data in the non-motorized transportation field. Although automated
   counts make it possible to collect data for longer time periods and to
   document temporal variations in volumes more effectively than manual
   counts, all of the technologies being used are subject to systematic
   miscount rates that must be accounted for to generate accurate volume
   estimates. In this paper, accuracy and precision rates are tested for
   six automated pedestrian and bicycle counting technologies: passive
   infrared, active infrared, radio beam, pneumatic tubes, inductive loops,
   and piezoelectric strips. For some technologies, multiple products are
   tested. Counting devices were installed at 13 sites in seven cities to
   introduce variation in environmental (weather) conditions and volume
   levels, and manual validation counts were conducted based on video
   footage taken at each of the test sites. Correction functions are
   developed for each technology to increase accuracy of volume estimates.
   Various environmental conditions including temperature, rain, and
   lighting are tested in the development of the correction functions. For
   most technologies, a net undercount effect was observed that appears to
   worsen at higher volumes. Average error rates (average percentage
   deviation) for the tested technologies range from 0.55\% for inductive
   loops to -17.38\% for pneumatic tubes. However, after applying
   correction functions accuracy improves for nearly all technologies. (C)

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{287}},
Pages = {{398-409}},

Abstract = {{Anatase is an important functional nanomaterial in a wide variety of
   applications. Despite a breadth of research on novel synthesis methods,
   there is a lack of studies geared towards developing scalable processes
   for nanoscale anatase crystalline materials. In this study, anatase
   secondary nanoparticles are produced in a continuous stirred-tank
   reactor (CSTR) through forced hydrolysis of pre-diluted aqueous TiCl4
   solution by controlling pH. The steady-state supersaturation regime of
   the CSTR process is shown to be inducive to the formation of phase-pure
   nanocrystalline anatase aggregates in the order of similar to 500-1000
   nm possessing a very high surface area similar to 200-250 m(2)/g. The
   aggregates made of 6 nm individual primary nanocrystallites are
   mesoporous - a highly desirable property in building photocatalytic and
   thin film electrode (Li-ion and solar) devices with enhanced interfacial
   functionalities. The new process was tested at a range of conditions,
   70-90 degrees C, 0.1-0.5 M TiCl4, pH 2-5, and 30-60 min. pH control was
   vital in stabilizing the metastable anatase nanocrystallites and
   promoting their aggregation that facilitates their handling and
   application. The process achieves >98\% steady-state conversion of

   separation and Coulomb friction on the load-displacement behaviour of
   the spherical rigid inclusion. Both analytical methods and boundary
   element techniques are used to examine the inclusion/elastic medium
   interaction problems. This paper also provides a comprehensive review of
   non-classical interface conditions between inclusions and the

Abstract = {{Cross-planar di-vacancies (CPDVs) within stacked graphene hexagonal
   boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures provide stabilized covalent links
   to bridge adjacent graphene and h-BN sheets. Through a first principle
   theoretical study based on density functional theory (DFT), it was shown
   that the CPDVs serve as focal points for cross-planar atom diffusion
   between graphene and h-BN, and the chemical nature of interlayer links
   along with associated cross-planar migration pathways at these defects
   can be predictively manipulated through modulation of the chemical
   environment and charge engineering, to achieve consistent B or N doping
   and simultaneous healing of graphene. The present study proposed a
   viable approach integrating irradiation, chemical and charge
   engineering, to produce high-quality graphene with tunable electronic
   and electrochemical properties, using the h-BN substrate. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of K2CO3 addition to Genesse sub-bituminous

   rate were investigated for CO2 gasification at 700-800 degrees C. For
   the uncatalyzed samples, no significant changes in gasification rate and
   char conversion were observed for the low-ash product (12 wt\% ash)
   compared to the raw coal (33 wt\% ash). However, with the addition of 10
   wt potassium catalyst, the low-ash product exhibited a higher
   gasification rate than the raw coal. An increase of the catalyst loading
   up to 50 wt\% resulted in a decline of the gasification rate for both
   coal samples. The activation energy increased with conversion and at
   higher K2CO3 loadings. Kinetic modeling showed that the extended-random
   pore model fits the experimental data well for both coal samples and
   supported the speculation that excess catalyst blocks pores, resulting a
   reduction in gasification rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Chevrel phase compounds Mo6X8 (X = S, Se, Te) are theoretically
   studied by ab initio methods as potential candidates for battery cathode
   materials. The voltage profiles are calculated for the cases of various
   alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) serving as guest intercalation
   ions. The Ca ions are shown to offer the practically significant voltage
   of similar to 1.0-1.25 V, with S substitution giving the highest voltage
   over Se and Te. We further demonstrate that doubling the capacity of
   such a battery would also be possible by incorporating a second Ca ion
   near the Mo6X8 cluster. The electronic properties of this material are
   investigated, revealing that the entire Mob cluster behaves as a redox
   center. Finally, the ion diffusion barriers are calculated, showing
   comparable values to existing battery materials. This work demonstrates
   that the Chevrel phase may be useful as a cathode material for
   intercalating divalent ions, and also offers insights into possible
   tuning of cathode properties by judicious selection of the constituents.

Abstract = {{The cerebral wall of the human fetal brain is composed of transient
   cellular compartments, which show characteristic spatiotemporal
   relationships with intensity of major neurogenic events (cell
   proliferation, migration, axonal growth, dendritic differentiation,
   synaptogenesis, cell death, and myelination). The aim of the present
   study was to obtain new quantitative data describing volume, surface
   area, and thickness of transient compartments in the human fetal
   cerebrum. Forty-four postmortem fetal brains aged 13-40 postconceptional
   weeks (PCW) were included in this study. High-resolution T1 weighted MR
   images were acquired on 19 fetal brain hemispheres. MR images were
   processed using in-house software (MNI-ACE toolbox). Delineation of
   fetal compartments was performed semi-automatically by co-registration
   of MRI with histological sections of the same brains, or with the
   age-matched brains from Zagreb Neuroembryological Collection. Growth
   trajectories of transient fetal compartments were reconstructed. The
   composition of telencephalic wall was quantitatively assessed. Between
   13 and 25 PCVV, when the intensity of neuronal proliferation decreases
   drastically, the relative volume of proliferative (ventricular and
   subventricular) compartments showed pronounced decline. In contrast,
   synapse- and extracellular matrix-rich subplate compartment continued to
   grow during the first two trimesters, occupying up to 45\% of
   telencephalon and reaching its maximum volume and thickness around 30
   PCW. This developmental maximum coincides with a period of intensive
   growth of long cortico-cortical fibers, which enter and wait in subplate
   before approaching the cortical plate. Although we did not find
   significant age related changes in mean thickness of the cortical plate,
   the volume, gyrification index, and surface area of the cortical plate
   continued to exponentially grow during the last phases of prenatal
   development. This cortical expansion coincides developmentally with the
   transformation of embryonic cortical columns, dendritic differentiation,
   and ingrowth of axons. These results provide a quantitative description
   of transient human fetal brain compartments observable with MRI.
   Moreover, they will improve understanding of structural-functional
   relationships during brain development, will enable correlation between
   in vitro/in vivo imaging and fine structural histological studies, and
   will serve as a reference for study of perinatal brain injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Structural neuroimaging of humans with typical and atypical
   sex-chromosome complements has established the marked influence of both
   Yand X-/Y-chromosome dosage on total brain volume (TBV) and identified
   potential cortical substrates for the psychiatric phenotypes associated
   with sex-chromosome aneuploidy (SCA). Here, in a cohort of 354 humans
   with varying karyotypes (XX, XY, XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY, XXXXY), we
   investigate sex and SCA effects on subcortical size and shape; focusing
   on the striatum, pallidum and thalamus. Wefind large effect-size
   differences in the volume and shape of all three structures as a
   function of sex and SCA. We correct for TBV effects with a novel
   allometric method harnessing normative scaling rules for subcortical
   size and shape in humans, which we derive here for the first time. We
   show that all three subcortical volumes scale sublinearly with TBV among
   healthy humans, mirroring known relationships between subcortical volume
   and TBV among species. Traditional TBV correction methods assume linear
   scaling and can therefore invert or exaggerate sex and SCA effects on
   subcortical anatomy. Allometric analysis restricts sex-differences to:
   (1) greater pallidal volume (PV) in males, and (2) relative caudate head
   expansion and ventral striatum contraction in females. Allometric
   analysis of SCA reveals that supernumerary X-and Y-chromosomes both
   cause disproportionate reductions in PV, and coordinated deformations of
   striatopallidal shape. Our study provides a novel understanding of sex
   and sex-chromosome dosage effects on subcortical organization, using an
   allometric approach that can be generalized to other basic and clinical
   structural neuroimaging settings.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel
   low-complexity technique for fiber nonlinearity compensation. We
   achieved a transmission distance of 2818 km for a 32-GBaud
   dual-polarization 16QAM signal. For efficient implantation, and to
   facilitate integration with conventional digital signal processing (
   DSP) approaches, we independently compensate fiber nonlinearities after
   linear impairment equalization. Therefore this algorithm can be easily
   implemented in currently deployed transmission systems after using
   linear DSP. The proposed equalizer operates at one sample per symbol and
   requires only one computation step. The structure of the algorithm is
   based on a first-order perturbation model with quantized perturbation
   coefficients. Also, it does not require any prior calculation or
   detailed knowledge of the transmission system. We identified common
   symmetries between perturbation coefficients to avoid duplicate and
   unnecessary operations. In addition, we use only a few adaptive filter
   coefficients by grouping multiple nonlinear terms and dedicating only
   one adaptive nonlinear filter coefficient to each group. Finally, the
   complexity of the proposed algorithm is lower than previously studied
   nonlinear equalizers by more than one order of magnitude. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Hydrogen embrittlement of metals is widely observed, but its atomistic
   origins remain little understood and much debated. Combining a unique
   identification of interstitial sites through polyhedral tessellation and
   first-principles calculations, we study hydrogen adsorption at grain
   boundaries in a variety of face-centered cubic metals of Ni, Cu,
   gamma-Fe, and Pd. We discover the chemomechanical origin of the
   variation of adsorption energetics for interstitial hydrogen at grain
   boundaries. A general chemomechanical formula is established to provide
   accurate assessments of hydrogen trapping and segregation energetics at
   grain boundaries, and it also offers direct explanations for certain
   experimental observations. The present study deepens our mechanistic
   understanding of the role of grain boundaries in hydrogen embrittlement
   and points to a viable path towards predictive microstructure
   engineering against hydrogen embrittlement in structural metals.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles are often coated with
   polymeric surface modifiers for improved colloidal stability and
   transport during remediation of contaminated aquifers. Doping the NZVI
   surface with palladium (Pd-NZVI) increases its reactivity to pollutants
   such as trichloroethylene (TCE). In this study, we investigate the
   effects of coating Pd-NZVI with two surface modifiers of very different
   molecular size: rhamnolipid (RL, anionic biosurfactant, M.W. 600 g
   mol(-1)) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, anionic polyelectrolyte, M.W.
   700 000 g mol(-1)) on TCE degradation. RL loadings of 13-133 mg TOC/g
   NZVI inhibited deposition of Pd in a concentration-dependent manner,
   thus limiting the number of available Pd sites and decreasing the TCE
   degradation reaction rate constant from 0.191 h(-1) to 0.027 h(-1).
   Furthermore, the presence of RL in solution had an additional inhibitory
   effect on the reactivity of Pd-NZVI by interacting with the exposed Pd
   deposits after they were formed. In contrast, CMC had no effect on
   reactivity at loadings up to 167 mg TOC/g NZVI. There was a lack of
   correlation between Pd-NZVI aggregate sizes and TCE reaction rates, and
   is explained by cryo-transmission electron microscopy images that show
   open, porous aggregate structures where TCE would be able to easily
   access Pd sites.}},

Abstract = {{There are limited studies that focus on greywater treatment and reuse
   options, particularly in nomadic societies with unique cultural and
   climatic conditions. Studies relating to household greywater treatment
   in nomadic-cultured societies are limited. This study aims to address
   this gap by examining a case with a high concentration of chemical
   components in the greywater (e.g. where chemical oxygen demand ranged
   between 35 and 70,032 mg/L). Specifically, an upgraded greenhouse
   greywater treatment unit (GH-GWTU) was designed and constructed during
   the summer of 2013 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in order to assess the
   technical feasibility, and up-scaling capability, of the system at the
   community level. Chemical and biological test results indicated that
   most parameters (e.g. PO43-, NO2-, NH4+) had a high removal rate of up
   to 98\%. Moreover, the greenhouse may extend the treatment period up to
   8 months. This study has shown that GH-GWTU is a potential technology
   that can significantly reduce the chemicals and biological agents in
   greywater in Mongolian Ger contexts which may reduce the greywaterborne
   hazards and vulnerability in the area. It can be replicable both at the
   household and community scale according to resources available for
   system operation and maintenance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a format-transparent carrier phase recovery
   algorithm for the agile metropolitan optical networks based on an
   optimized superscalar parallelization structure. The pilot overhead and
   the buffer size in the superscalar parallelization can be minimized by
   optimizing the parallelization structure depending on the required laser
   linewidth tolerance of the system. The trade-off between the laser
   linewidth tolerance and the reduction of buffer size in the proposed
   superscalar parallelization is revealed in simulations for 16-QAM,
   32-QAM, and 64-QAM, respectively. The results indicate that the buffer
   size in the superscalar parallelization can be reduced significantly
   when commercially available external cavity lasers (ECL) are employed
   for coherent detection inmetro links beyond 100 Gb/s. Experiments are
   further conducted in a single-channel system with ECLs as the
   transmitter and local oscillator lasers to demonstrate the reduction of
   the pilot overhead and buffer size using the proposed superscalar
   parallelization compared with the previous superscalar structures.}},

Abstract = {{Research in seizure prediction has come a long way since its debut
   almost 4 decades ago. Early studies suffered methodological caveats
   leading to overoptimistic results and lack of statistical significance.
   The publication of guidelines addressing mainly the question of
   performance evaluation and statistical validation in seizure prediction
   helped revising the status of the field. While many studies failed to
   prove that above chance prediction is possible by applying these
   guidelines, other studies were successful. Methods based on EEG analysis
   using linear and nonlinear measures were reportedly successful in
   detecting preictal changes and using them to predict seizures above
   chance. In this review, we present a selection of studies in seizure
   prediction published in the last decade. The studies were selected based
   on the validity of the methods and the statistical significance of
   performance results. These results varied between studies and many
   showed acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity that could be
   appealing for therapeutic devices. The relatively large prediction
   horizon and early preictal changes reported in most studies suggest that
   seizure prediction may work better in closed loop seizure control
   devices rather than as seizure advisory devices. The emergence of a
   large database of annotated long-term EEG recordings should help
   prospective assessment of prediction methods. Some questions remain to
   be addressed before large clinical trials involving seizure prediction
   can be carried out. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Associative memories allow the retrieval of previously stored messages
   given a part of their content. In this paper, we are interested in
   associative memories based on c-partite graphs that were recently
   introduced. These memories are almost optimal in terms of the amount of
   storage they require (efficiency) and allow retrieving messages with low
   complexity. We propose a generic implementation model for the retrieval
   algorithm that can be readily mapped to an integrated circuit and study
   the retrieval performance when hardware components are affected by
   faults. We show using analytical and simulation results that these
   associative memories can be made resilient to circuit faults with a
   minor modification of the retrieval algorithm. In one example, the
   memory retains 88\% of its efficiency when 1\% of the storage cells are
   faulty, or 98\% when 0.1\% of the binary outputs of the retrieval
   algorithm are faulty. When considering storage faults, the fault
   tolerance exhibited by the proposed associative memory can be comparable
   to using a capacity-achieving error correction code for protecting the
   stored information.}},

Title = {{Effects of Mg and Al doping on dislocation slips in GaN}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{First-principles density functional theory calculations were employed to
   systematically examine the effects of Mg and Al additions to wurtzite
   GaN on the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) curves for (1 (1)
   over bar 00){[}11 (2) over bar0] and(1 (1) over bar 00){[}0001]
   dislocations along the glide or shuffle slip planes. It was found that
   for both slip systems, Mg doping leads to significant reduction of the
   GSFE while Al doping elevates the GSFE curve. For each dopant, the
   effect of doping on the GSFE was shown to scale linearly with the dopant
   concentration, being independent of the slip (i.e., glide or shuffle)
   plane. The GSFE curves were subsequently combined with the
   Peierls-Nabarro model to quantitatively analyze the micromechanical
   characteristics of dislocation slips. The implications of our findings
   to slip dynamics and dislocation dissociation mechanism were then
   discussed. Our study provides important insights towards the
   understanding and control of dislocation ;dynamics in impurity-doped
   GaN. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) to TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs)
   has been recently considered as a method to improve the photocatalytic
   efficiency of TiO2 by favoring charge carrier separation. Here, we show
   that it is possible to improve the efficiency of GNP-TiO2 composites by
   controlling the shape, stability, and facets of TiO2 NPs grown on GNP
   functionalized with either COOH or NH2 groups, while adding
   ethylendiamine (EDA) and oleic acid (OA) during a hydrothermal
   synthesis. We studied the photocatalytic activity of all synthesized
   materials under UV-A light using phenol as a target molecule. GNPTiO(2)
   composites synthesized on COOH-functionalized GNP, exposing \{101\}
   facets, were more efficient at abating phenol than those synthesized on
   NH2-functionalized GNP, exposing \{101\} and \{100\} facets. However,
   neither of these composites was stable under irradiation. The addition
   of both OA and EDA stabilized the materials under irradiation; however,
   only the composite prepared on COOH-functionalized GNP in the presence
   of EDA showed a significant increase in phenol degradation rate, leading
   to results that were better than those obtained with TiO2 alone. This
   result can be attributed to Ti-OH complexation by EDA, which protects
   GNP from oxidation. The orientation of the most reducing \{101\} facets
   toward GNP and the most oxidizing \{100\} facets toward the solution
   induces faster phenol degradation owing to a better separation of the
   charge carriers.}},

Title = {{Qualities and Inequalities in Online Social Networks through the Lens of
   the Generalized Friendship Paradox}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{The friendship paradox is the phenomenon that in social networks, people
   on average have fewer friends than their friends do. The generalized
   friendship paradox is an extension to attributes other than the number
   of friends. The friendship paradox and its generalized version have
   gathered recent attention due to the information they provide about
   network structure and local inequalities. In this paper, we propose
   several measures of nodal qualities which capture different aspects of
   their activities and influence in online social networks. Using these
   measures we analyse the prevalence of the generalized friendship paradox
   over Twitter and we report high levels of prevalence (up to over 90\% of
   nodes). We contend that this prevalence of the friendship paradox and
   its generalized version arise because of the hierarchical nature of the
   connections in the network. This hierarchy is nested as opposed to being
   star-like. We conclude that these paradoxes are collective phenomena not
   created merely by a minority of well-connected or high-attribute nodes.
   Moreover, our results show that a large fraction of individuals can
   experience the generalized friendship paradox even in the absence of a
   significant correlation between degrees and attributes.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers a simple bit level combining technique, aided by
   robust bit reliability information, for uplink collaborating
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base-stations (also known as
   macrodiversity MIMO), operating over composite Rayleigh-lognormal fading
   channels. Bit reliability weights based on a robust modification of the
   logarithmic likelihood ratio, combined with instantaneous symbol
   signal-to-noise ratio information, are derived for different local MIMO
   detection schemes. This bit reliability information is used at the
   fusion center, together with locally detected data, for combining and
   producing final information bits delivered to the destination. Computer
   simulation results confirm that such bit level combining techniques,
   when used with minimum mean squared error ordered successive
   interference cancelation and also with sphere decoding maximum
   likelihood local detectors, provide significant performance improvements
   over non-collaborative base-stations systems. Performance gains are
   maintained even when these schemes suffer from channel estimation errors
   and also in the presence of space correlation. Low backhaul overhead and
   performance advantages make these bit level combining techniques
   attractive for applications in next generation cellular systems
   employing coordinated multi-point (CoMP) technology, as well as for
   other collaborative MIMO communication schemes.Copyright (C) 2014 John

Month = {{FEB 8}},
Abstract = {{We report non-linear electronic transport measurement of Al/Si-doped
   n-type InN nanowire/Al junctions performed at T = 0.3 K, below the
   superconducting transition temperature of the Al electrodes. The
   proximity effect is observed in these devices through a strong dip in
   resistance at zero bias. In addition to the resistance dip at zero bias,
   several resistance peaks can be identified at bias voltages above the
   superconducting gap of the electrodes, while no resistance dip is
   observed at the superconducting gap. The resistance peaks disappear as
   the Al electrodes turn normal beyond the critical magnetic field except
   one which remains visible at fields several times higher than critical
   magnetic field. An unexpected non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of
   the peak position is observed. We discuss the physical origin of these
   observations and propose that the resistance peaks could be the
   McMillan-Rowell oscillations arising from different closed paths
   localized near different regions of the junctions. (C) 2016 AIP

Abstract = {{A secretome signature is a heterogeneous profile of secretions present
   in a single cell type. From the secretome signature a smaller panel of
   proteins, namely a secretion fingerprint, can be chosen to feasibly
   monitor specific cellular activity. Based on a thorough appraisal of the
   literature, this review explores the possibility of defining and using a
   secretion fingerprint to gauge the functionality of pancreatic islets of
   Langerhans. It covers the state of the art regarding microfluidic
   perfusion systems used in pancreatic islet research. Candidate
   analytical tools to be integrated within microfluidic perfusion systems
   for dynamic secretory fingerprint monitoring were identified. These
   analytical tools include patch clamp, amperometry/voltametry, impedance
   spectroscopy, field effect transistors and surface plasmon resonance.
   Coupled with these tools, microfluidic devices can ultimately find
   applications in determining islet quality for transplantation, islet
   regeneration and drug screening of therapeutic agents for the treatment

Abstract = {{In this study, exergy analysis was applied for a rotating-tray dryer
   equipped with a cross-flow plate heat exchanger during drying of apple
   slices. Three drying air temperatures and tray rotation speeds in the
   range of 50-80 degrees C and 0-12 rpm, respectively, were employed. Two
   drying air velocities in the range of 1-2 m/s were adjusted for each
   drying temperature and rotation speed with and without application of
   the heat exchanger. The experiments were conducted to assess the effects
   of the experimental variables on the exergetic performance parameters of
   the dryer. Also, the effect of drying conditions on the quality of dried
   apple slices was assessed by determining rehydration ratio, apparent
   density, shrinkage, and surface color. In general, the exergetic
   performance parameters of the dryer depended profoundly on the drying
   air temperature and velocity. Interestingly, the exergetic efficiency of
   drying process was significantly improved from a minimum value of 23.0\%
   to a maximum value of 96.1\% by using the heat exchanger. Furthermore,
   the incorporation of heat exchanger did not negatively affect the
   quality of dried product. Therefore, the strategy presented herein could
   be a promising approach for waste energy recovery in drying without any
   unfavorable change in the quality of dried product. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A simple and effective technique to skip the computation of reliable
   portions of a frame (windows) for turbo code decoding is proposed. The
   proposed criterion relies on a very simple approximation of
   cross-entropy measure by means of thresholding. This criterion features
   negligible complexity and low-memory requirements. Simulation results
   show that, in the best case, up to 20\% of windows can be skipped with
   no error-rate degradation. Such a significant computation reduction can
   be exploited to directly reduce the power consumption as well.}},

Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{Nonlinear vibrations of viscoelastic thin rectangular plates subjected
   to normal harmonic excitation in the spectral neighborhood of the lowest
   resonances are investigated. The von Karman nonlinear
   strain-displacement relationships are used and geometric imperfections
   are taken into account. The material is modeled as a Kelvin-Voigt
   viscoelastic solid by retaining all the nonlinear terms. The discretized
   nonlinear equations of motion are studied by using the arclength
   continuation and collocation method. Numerical results are obtained for
   the fundamental mode of a simply supported square plate with immovable
   edges by using models with 16 and 22 degrees of freedom and
   investigating solution convergence. Comparison to viscous damping and
   the effect of neglecting nonlinear viscoelastic damping terms are shown.
   The change of the frequency-response with the retardation time parameter
   is also investigated as well as the effect of geometric imperfections.

Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Objective:To determine the motor-behavioral and neural correlates of
   putative functional common variants in the sodium-channel Na(V)1.8
   encoding gene (SCN10A) in vivo in patients with multiple sclerosis
   (MS).Methods:We recruited 161 patients with relapsing-onset MS and 94
   demographically comparable healthy participants. All patients with MS
   underwent structural MRI and clinical examinations (Expanded Disability
   Status Scale {[}EDSS] and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite
   {[}MSFC]). Whole-brain voxel-wise and cerebellar volumetry were
   performed to assess differences in regional brain volumes between
   genotype groups. Resting-state fMRI was acquired from 62 patients with
   MS to evaluate differences in cerebellar functional connectivity. All
   participants were genotyped for 4 potentially functional SCN10A
   polymorphisms.Results:Two SCN10A polymorphisms in high linkage
   disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.95) showed significant association with MSFC
   performance in patients with MS (rs6795970: p = 6.2 x 10(-4); rs6801957:
   p = 0.0025). Patients with MS with rs6795970(AA) genotype performed
   significantly worse than rs6795970(G) carriers in MSFC (p = 1.8 x
   10(-4)) and all of its subscores. This association was independent of
   EDSS and cerebellar atrophy. Although the genotype groups showed no
   difference in regional brain volumes, rs6795970(AA) carriers
   demonstrated significantly diminished cerebellar functional connectivity
   with the thalami and midbrain. No significant SCN10A-genotype effect was
   observed on MSFC performance in healthy participants.Conclusions:Our
   data suggest that SCN10A variation substantially influences functional
   status, including prominent effects on motor coordination in patients
   with MS. These findings were supported by the effects of this variant on
   a neural system important for motor coordination, namely
   cerebello-thalamic circuitry. Overall, our findings add to the emerging
   evidence that suggests that sodium channel Na(V)1.8 could serve as a
   target for future drug-based interventions to treat cerebellar
   dysfunction in MS.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of using positron emission particle
   tracking to record the trajectories of large (empty set approximate to
   1440 mu m) and small (empty set approximate to 58 mu m) particles of
   hematite (S.G. = 5.3) and quartz (S.G. = 2.7) in a slurry of iron ore
   (20\% solids w/w) flowing in a gravity spiral concentrator. The tracking
   was undertaken using modular positron emission particle tracking
   detectors (ECAT 951) assembled and calibrated for this purpose. The
   tracer particles used were generated by the direct activation of large
   particle in a cyclotron beam (He-3, 35 MeV), in the Positron Imaging
   Centre at the University of Birmingham. These larger particles were then
   broken and sized to isolate small active particle when required. The
   behaviour of the valuable and gangue particles in the first two turns of
   the spiral is presented. The formation and interaction of different
   bands of similar size/density particles is shown. For small particles,
   these bands are less defined and can be present at dispersion is
   influenced by the flow of the slurry. Part of the large dense hematite
   particles are shown concentrating toward the inside of the spiral trough
   while some others are shown remaining in the high flow-speed outer zone
   outside of a band of large quartz particles. The behaviour in the feed
   device and first 0.3 turn of the spiral is related to the later
   separation of some of the large particles and this highlights the effect
   of the feed radial distribution of the particles on the trough.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Demand is growing for explosive-free rock breakage systems for civil and
   mining engineering, and space industry applications. This paper
   highlights the work being undertaken in the Geomechanics Laboratory of
   McGill University to make a real application of microwave-assisted
   mechanical rock breakage to full-face tunneling machines and drilling.
   Comprehensive laboratory tests investigated the effect of microwave
   radiation on temperature profiles and strength reduction in hard rocks
   (norite, granite, and basalt) for a range of exposure times and
   microwave power levels. The heating rate on the surface of the rock
   specimens linearly decreased with distance between the sample and the
   microwave antenna, regardless of microwave power level and exposure
   time. Tensile and uniaxial compressive strengths were reduced with
   increasing exposure time and power level. Scanning electron micrographs
   (SEMs) highlighted fracture development in treated basalt. It was
   concluded that the microwave power level has a strong positive influence
   on the amount of heat damage induced to the rock surface. Numerical
   simulations of electric field intensity and wave propagation conducted
   with COMSOL Multiphysics (R) software generated temperature profiles
   that were in close agreement with experimental results. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Conversion between multi-level modulation formats is one of key
   processing functions for flexible networking aimed at high spectral
   efficiency (SE) in optical fiber transmission. The authors previously
   proposed an all-optical format conversion system from binary phase-shift
   keying (BPSK) to quadrature PSK (QPSK) and reported an experimental
   demonstration. In this paper, we consider its reversed conversion, that
   is, from QPSK to BPSK. The proposed system consists of a highly
   nonlinear fiber used to generate complex conjugate signal, and a 3-dB
   directional coupler used to produce converted signals by interfering the
   incident signal with the complex conjugate signal. The incident QPSK
   stream is converted into two BPSK tributaries without any loss of
   transmitting data. We show the system performances such as
   bit-error-rate and optical signal-to-noise ratio penalty evaluated by
   numerical simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Biomimetic hierarchical surface structures that exhibit features having
   multiple length scales have been used in many technological and
   engineering applications. Their surface topographies are most commonly
   analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which only allows for
   qualitative visual assessments. Here we introduce fractal and lacunarity
   analyses as a method of characterizing the SEM images of hierarchical
   surface structures in a quantitative manner. Taking femtosecond
   laser-irradiated metals as an example, our results illustrate that,
   while the fractal dimension is a poor descriptor of surface complexity,
   lacunarity analysis can successfully quantify the spatial texture of an
   SEM image; this, in turn, provides a convenient means of reporting
   changes in surface topography with respect to changes in processing
   parameters. Furthermore, lacunarity plots are shown to be sensitive to
   the different length scales present within a hierarchical structure due
   to the reversal of lacunarity trends at specific magnifications where
   new features become resolvable. Finally, we have established a
   consistent method of detecting pattern sizes in an image from the
   oscillation of lacunarity plots. Therefore, we promote the adoption of
   lacunarity analysis as a powerful tool for quantitative characterization
   of, but not limited to, multi-scale hierarchical surface topographies.}},

Title = {{Study of the mechanical stability and bioactivity of Bioglass (R) based

Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Large bone defects are challenging to heal, and often require an
   osteoconductive and stable support to help the repair of damaged tissue.
   Bioglass-based scaffolds are particularly promising for this purpose due
   to their ability to stimulate bone regeneration. However, processing
   technologies adopted so far do not allow for the synthesis of scaffolds
   with suitable mechanical properties. Also, conventional sintering
   processes result in glass de-vitrification, which generates concerns
   about bioactivity. In this work, we studied the bioactivity and the
   mechanical properties of Bioglass (R) based scaffolds, produced via a
   powder technology inspired process. The scaffolds showed compressive
   strengths in the range of 5-40 MPa, i.e. in the upper range of values
   reported so far for these materials, had tunable porosity, in the range
   between 55 and 77\%, and pore sizes that are optimal for bone tissue
   regeneration (100-500 mu m). We immersed the scaffolds in simulated body
   fluid (SBF) for 28 d and analyzed the evolution of the scaffold
   mechanical properties and microstructure. Even if, after sintering,
   partial de-vitrification occurred, immersion in SBF caused ion release
   and the formation of a Ca-P coating within 2 d, which reached a
   thickness of 10-15 mu m after 28 d. This coating contained both
   hydroxyapatite and an amorphous background, indicating microstructural
   amorphization of the base material. Scaffolds retained a good
   compressive strength and structural integrity also after 28 d of
   immersion (6 MPa compressive strength). The decrease in mechanical
   properties was mainly related to the increase in porosity, caused by its
   dissolution, rather than to the amorphization process and the formation
   of a Ca-P coating. These results suggest that Bioglass (R) based
   scaffolds produced via powder metallurgy-inspired technique are
   excellent candidates for bone regeneration applications.}},

Abstract = {{We studied transit ridership from the perspective of the transit
   provider, with the objective of quantifying the influence of transit
   system operational attributes, transportation system infrastructure
   attributes and built environment attributes on the disaggregate stop
   level boardings and alightings by time of day for the bus transit system
   in the Montreal region. A Composite Marginal Likelihood (CML) based
   ordered response probit (ORP) model, that simultaneously allows us to
   incorporate the influence of exogenous variables and potential
   correlations between boardings and alightings across multiple time
   periods of the day is employed. Our results indicate that headway
   affects ridership negatively, while the presence of public
   transportation around the stop has a positive and significant effect
   Moreover, parks, commercial enterprises, and residential area, amongst
   others, have various effects across the day on boardings and alightings
   at bus stops. An elasticity analysis provides useful insights.
   Specifically, we observe that the most effective way to increase
   ridership is to increase public transport service and accessibility,
   whereas enhancements to land use have a smaller effect on ridership. The
   framework from our analysis provides transit agencies a mechanism to
   study the influence of transit accessibility, transit connectivity,
   transit schedule alterations (to increase/reduce headway), and land-use
   pattern changes on ridership. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Multiple-point simulation (MPS) methods have been developed over the
   last decade as a means of reproducing complex geological patterns while
   generating stochastic simulations. Some geological spatial
   configurations are complex, such as the spatial geometries and patterns
   of diamond bearing kimberlite pipes and their internal facies
   controlling diamond quality and distribution.
   Two MPS methods were tested for modelling the geology of a diamond pipe
   located at the Ekati mine, NT, Canada. These are the single normal
   equation simulation algorithm SNESIM, which captures different patterns
   from a training image (TI), and the filter simulation algorithm
   FILTERSIM, which classifies the patterns founded on the TI. Both methods
   were tested in the stochastic simulation of a four-category geology
   model: crater, diatreme, xenoliths, and host rock. Soft information
   about the location of host rock was also used. The validation of the
   simulation results shows a reasonable reproduction of the geometry and
   data proportions for all geological units considered; the validation of
   spatial statistics, however, shows that although simulated realizations
   from both methods reasonably reproduce the fourth-order spatial
   statistics of the TI, they do not reproduce well the same spatial
   statistics of the available data (when this differs from the TI). An
   interesting observation is that SNESIM better imitated the shape of the
   pipe, while FILTERSIM yielded a better reproduction of the xenolith
   bodies.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of conventional AlGaN deep ultraviolet light emitting
   diodes has been limited by the extremely low light extraction efficiency
   (<10\%), due to the unique transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light
   emission. Here, we show that, by exploiting the lateral side emission,
   the extraction efficiency of TM polarized light can be significantly
   enhanced in AlGaN nanowire structures. Using the three-dimensional
   finite-difference time domain simulation, we demonstrate that the
   nanowire structures can be designed to inhibit the emission of guided
   modes and redirect trapped light into radiated modes. A light extraction
   efficiency of more than 70\% can, in principle, be achieved by carefully
   optimizing the nanowire size, nanowire spacing, and p-GaN thickness. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper reports a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based
   XY-stage integrating compliant motion amplification mechanism for
   nanopositioning at sub nanometer resolution. The MEMS stage is driven by
   bidirectional Z-beam electrothermal actuators that generate large output
   forces to actuate the motion amplification mechanism. The motion
   amplification mechanisms are used in their inverse (motion reduction)
   mode to convert micrometer input displacements (from the Z-beam
   actuators) into nanometer output displacements at a constant motion
   reduction ratio with good linearity. This unique design significantly
   enhances the positioning resolution of the XY-stage. An analytical model
   is developed to predict output displacements of the XY-stage as a
   function of the input voltages applied to the Z-beam actuators, and the
   predicted results agree with the experimental results. Capacitive
   displacement sensors are arranged along both X- and Y-axes for measuring
   the input displacements of the amplification mechanisms, enabling
   closed-loop nanopositioning control of the XY-stage. The device
   calibration results show that, within an actuation voltage of +/- 15 V,
   the MEMS stage offers a motion range close to +/- 1 mu m and a
   displacement resolution better than 0.3 nm root Hz(-1).}},

Abstract = {{A detailed hydrogeological investigation was carried out in the Tabriz
   plain in Iran using conventional hydrogeological field investigations
   and hydrochemistry. The study was carried out because the aquifers are
   of particular importance as they are more or less the only source of
   water supply available to the rural population and for agricultural and
   industrial activities. Analytical and numerical methods were applied to
   the constant rate pumping test data from the Tabriz airport and the
   Tabriz Power Station well fields. Two types of aquifers of different
   water quality were identified in the study area: an unconfined aquifer
   that extends over the plain and confined aquifers that are found in the
   deeper layers of the multilayered sediment terraces of the Aji-Chay
   River course. Therefore, the central part of the Tabriz plain contains
   both unconfined and confined aquifers, while close to the highlands,
   there is only an unconfined aquifer. There was evidence of minor leakage
   in the confined aquifers when the numerical method was used for
   analysis. The groundwater in the area can be identified by three main
   geochemical facies: Na-Cl, Ca-HCO3, and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4. The
   processes responsible for the hydrochemical evolution in the area fall
   into five categories: dissolution of evaporate minerals, precipitation
   of carbonate minerals, evaporation, ion exchange, and anthropogenic
   activity.}},

Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{696-705}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Composite bonded joints are prone to disbond when submitted to fatigue
   or extreme loads. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the
   integrity of a composite skin-stringer joint using the scattering
   behavior of the Lamb waves. The structure of interest is composed of
   three carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates bonded together by
   adhesive film as a typical representative of skin-stringer assembly. Two
   different bonding conditions are investigated for the joint: undamaged
   and damaged (with disbond). A circular disbond is introduced into the
   joint using Teflon tape during manufacturing. Two co-localized
   rectangular piezoceramics are used to generate plane guided waves at 180
   degrees and 135 degrees incidence. A non-contact measurement is
   performed using a 3-D Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) to extract the
   required information for evaluation of bonding condition. The results
   present the different scattered field of the guided waves at the joint
   as a function of frequency, mode, excitation angle and presence of
   artificial damage. It was found that the amplitude and directivity
   patterns of scattered fields are affected by the presence of damage,
   such that SHM design guidelines can be derived for efficient damage
   detection in the composite skin-stringer bonded joints. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The implementation of biodegradable stents has the potential to
   revolutionize obstructive coronary artery disease treatment. Limitations
   still currently exist, however, that prevent biodegradable stents from
   replacing permanent metallic stents in the global market. The ideal
   combination of stent properties, including sufficient mechanical
   strength, controlled degradation, and biocompatibility, has yet to be
   realized. A novel manufacturing process is proposed that utilizes cold
   gas-dynamic spraying to fabricate a metal structure with significantly
   reduced grain size. Iron and stainless steel 316L are combined to form a
   novel amalgamate with enhanced mechanical strength and a controllable
   degradation rate, due to the resulting microgalvanic reaction. Flat
   specimens composed of iron and 316L are fabricated in various
   compositions, and mechanical and degradation tests were conducted. Femto
   laser techniques are utilized to produce stents composed of 80\% Fe and
   20\% stainless steel 316L. The in vitro degradation behaviour of the
   stent is investigated using static and dynamic corrosion tests. It is
   shown that the corrosion rate can be adjusted to desired values, by
   varying the weight percentage of iron and stainless steel 316L within
   the amalgamate.}},

Title = {{Effect of the driving algorithm on the turbulence generated by a random
   jet array}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Different driving algorithms for a large random jet array (RJA) were
   tested and their performance characterized by comparing the statistics
   of the turbulence generated downstream of the RJA. Of particular
   interest was the spatial configuration of the jets operating at any
   given instant (an aspect that has not been documented in previous RJAs
   studies), as well as the statistics of their respective on/off times.
   All algorithms generated flows with nonzero skewnesses of the velocity
   fluctuation normal to the plane of the RJA (identified as an inherent
   limitation of the system resulting from the unidirectional forcing
   imposed from only one side of the RJA), and slightly super-Gaussian
   kurtoses of the velocity fluctuations in all directions. It was observed
   that algorithms imposing spatial configurations generated the most
   isotropic flows; however, they suffered from high mean flows and low
   turbulent kinetic energies. The algorithm identified as RANDOM (also
   referred to as the ``sunbathing algorithm{''}) generated the flow that,
   on an overall basis, most closely approximated zero-mean-flow
   homogeneous isotropic turbulence, with variations in horizontal and
   vertical homogeneities of RMS velocities of no more than +/- 6 \%,
   deviations from isotropy (w(RMS)/u(RMS)) in the range of 0.62-0.77, and
   mean flows on the order of 7 \% of the RMS velocities (determined by
   averaging their absolute values over the three velocity components and
   three downstream distances). A relatively high turbulent Reynolds number
   (Re-T = u(T) l/v= 2360, where l is the integral length scale of the flow
   and uT is a characteristic RMS velocity) was achieved using the RANDOM
   algorithm and the integral length scale (l = 11.5 cm) is the largest
   reported to date. The quality of the turbulence in our large facility
   demonstrates the ability of RJAs to be scaled-up and to be the
   laboratory system most capable of generating the largest
   quasi-homogeneous isotropic turbulent regions with zero mean flow.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the performance of distributed least-mean square (LMS)
   algorithms for parameter estimation over sensor networks where the

   Under this condition, we show that the estimates produced by distributed
   LMS algorithms will be biased if the regression noise is excluded from
   consideration. We propose a bias-elimination technique and develop a
   novel class of diffusion LMS algorithms that can mitigate the effect of
   regression noise and obtain an unbiased estimate of the unknown
   parameter vector over the network. In our development, we first assume
   that the variances of the regression noises are known a priori. Later,
   we relax this assumption by estimating these variances in real time. We
   analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed algorithms and
   derive closed-form expressions to characterize their mean-square error
   performance in transient and steady-state regimes. We further provide
   computer experiment results that illustrate the efficiency of the
   proposed algorithms and support the analytical findings.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, various channel coding schemes that can be used in hybrid

   failure, is compared to adaptive HARQ where the transmitter adapts
   either the length or the transmit power of the codewords using outdated
   channel state information (i.e., experienced by the receiver during the
   past transmissions). Describing the problems within a Markov decision
   process framework, we find optimal adaptation policies for both
   persistent (unlimited number of transmission) and truncated HARQ
   protocols. Numerical examples obtained in a Rayleigh block fading
   channel show that, in terms of energy efficiency, the adaptation of the
   codewords length provides notable gains over power adaptation and

Abstract = {{This paper considers a detect-and-forward multirelay wireless system
   employing differential MPSK modulation with decision-feedback
   differential coherent (DFDC) receivers. The DFDC receivers overcome the
   limitation of conventional differential detectors when used over
   time-varying fading channels and provide performance gains. Using a
   selective approach, the relays transmit only when the demodulation is
   errorless, and hence the destination employs an SNR-dependent
   threshold-decision rule to determine when the relays are active. The
   SNR-dependent thresholds ensure good performance over a wide SNR range.
   We propose the hold-and-estimate and hold-and-combine strategies for
   proper operation of the DFDC receivers over the relay to destination
   channels, to address the problem of intermittent transmissions on these
   links because of the selective protocol. We also demonstrate the
   necessity of initializing the DFDC receivers with pilot symbols.
   Finally, a recursive least squares adaptive algorithm is employed with
   the DFDC receivers to bypass the need of estimating the channel
   autocorrelation function. Analytical lower bounds to error probability
   illustrate the potential advantages of using DFDC receivers in such
   relaying systems. Extensive computer simulation results demonstrate the
   performance gains achieved by these relaying schemes with respect to
   comparable systems, especially over fast fading channels.}},

Title = {{The influence of composition and location on the toughness of human
   atherosclerotic femoral plaque tissue}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{264-275}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The toughness of femoral atherosclerotic tissue is of pivotal importance
   to understanding the mechanism of luminal expansion during cutting
   balloon angioplasty (CBA) in the peripheral vessels. Furthermore, the
   ability to relate this parameter to plaque composition, pathological
   inclusions and location within the femoral vessels would allow for the
   improvement of existing CBA technology and for the stratification of
   patient treatment based on the predicted fracture response of the plaque
   tissue to CBA. Such information may lead to a reduction in clinically
   observed complications, an improvement in trial results and an increased
   adoption of the CBA technique to reduce vessel trauma and further
   endovascular treatment uptake.
   This study characterises the toughness of atherosclerotic plaque
   extracted from the femoral arteries of ten patients using a lubricated
   guillotine cutting test to determine the critical energy release rate.
   This information is related to the location that the plaque section was
   removed from within the femoral vessels and the composition of the
   plaque tissue, determined using Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy,
   to establish the influence of location and composition on the toughness
   of the plaque tissue. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is employed to
   examine the fracture surfaces of the sections to determine the
   contribution of tissue morphology to toughness.
   Toughness results exhibit large inter and intra patient and location
   variance with values ranging far above and below the toughness of
   healthy porcine arterial tissue (Range: 1330-3035 for location and
   140-4560 J/m(2) for patients). No significant difference in mean
   toughness is observed between patients or location. However, the
   composition parameter representing the calcified tissue content of the
   plaque correlates significantly with sample toughness (r = 0.949, p <
   0.001). SEM reveals the presence of large calcified regions in the
   toughest sections that are absent from the least tough sections.
   Regression analysis highlights the potential of employing the calcified
   tissue content of the plaque as a preoperative tool for predicting the
   fracture response of a target lesion to CBA (R-2 = 0.885, p < 0.001).
   Statement of Significance
   This study addresses a gap in current knowledge regarding the influence
   of plaque location, composition and morphology on the toughness of human
   femoral plaque tissue. Such information is of great importance to the
   continued improvement of endovascular treatments, particularly cutting
   balloon angioplasty (CBA), which require experimentally derived data as
   a framework for assessing clinical cases and advancing medical devices.
   This study identifies that femoral plaque tissue exhibits large inter
   and intra patient and location variance regarding tissue toughness.
   Increasing calcified plaque content is demonstrated to correlate
   significantly with increasing toughness. This highlights the potential
   for predicting target lesion toughness which may lead to an increased
   adoption of the CBA technique and also further the uptake of
   endovascular treatment. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Title = {{Protein patterning by microcontact printing using pyramidal PDMS stamps}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Micro-contact printing, mu CP, is a well-established soft-lithography
   technique for printing biomolecules. mu CP uses stamps made of
   Poly(dimethylsiloxane), PDMS, made by replicating a microstructured
   silicon master fabricated by semiconductor manufacturing processes. One
   of the problems of the mu CP is the difficult control of the printing
   process, which, because of the high compressibility of PDMS, is very
   sensitive to minute changes in the applied pressure. This oversensitive
   response leads to frequent and/or uncontrollable collapse of the stamps
   with high aspect ratios, thus decreasing the printing accuracy and
   reproducibility. Here we present a straightforward methodology of
   designing and fabricating PDMS structures with an architecture which
   uses the collapse of the stamp to reduce, rather than enlarge the
   variability of the printing. The PDMS stamp, organized as an array of
   pyramidal micro-posts, whose ceiling collapses when pressed on a flat
   surface, replicates the structure of the silicon master fabricated by
   anisotropic wet etching. Upon application of pressure, depending on the
   size of, and the pitch between, the PDMS pyramids, an air gap is formed
   surrounding either the entire array, or individual posts. The printing
   technology, which also exhibits a remarkably low background noise for
   fluorescence detection, may find applications when the clear demarcation
   of the shapes of protein patterns and the distance between them are
   critical, such as microarrays and studies of cell patterning.}},

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated for the first time an n(++)-GaN/Al/p(++)-GaN

   without the use of Al tunnel junction or with the incorporation of an

   overcomes some of the critical issues related to conventional GaN-based
   tunnel junction designs, including stress relaxation, wide depletion
   region, and light absorption, and holds tremendous promise for realizing
   low-resistivity, high-brightness III-nitride nanowire LEDs in the

Abstract = {{In the present study, laboratory simulation of hot-strip rolling
   followed by coiling process was carried out in order to investigate the
   effect of bainite transformation on microstructure development and
   mechanical properties of low-silicon-content TRIP-assisted steels.
   Following a typical multistage isothermal deformation and cooling path,
   compression samples were quenched into a salt bath at various
   temperatures within bainite transformation range and held for different
   periods of time. The results indicated a decrease in either bainite
   holding time or temperature resulted in an increase in TS, whereas both
   T-El\% and formability index have shown maximum values at some
   intermediate bainite holding temperature and time. Variation of TS with
   holding time was correlated to the fraction of martensite and
   microstructural coarsening whilst the changes in T-El\% and formability
   index were appeared to follow the same trend as V-RA. Additionally, the
   presence of thermal martensite provides a shielding effect on RA

Abstract = {{The energy consumption of worm robots is composed of three parts: heat
   losses in the motors, internal friction losses of the worm device and
   mechanical energy locomotion requirements which we refer to as the cost
   of transport (COT). The COT, which is the main focus of this paper, is
   composed of work against two types of external factors: (i) the
   resisting forces, such as weight, tether force, or fluid drag for robots
   navigating inside wet environments and (ii) sliding friction forces that
   may result from sliding either forward or backward. In a previous work,
   we determined the mechanical energy requirement of worm robot locomotion
   over compliant surfaces, independently of the efficiency of the worm
   device. Analytical results were obtained by summing up the external work
   done on the robot and alternatively, by integrating the actuator forces
   over the actuator motions. In this paper, we present experimental
   results for an earthworm robot fitted with compliant contacts and these
   are post-processed to estimate the energy expenditure of the device. The
   results show that due to compliance, the COT of our device is increased
   by up to four-fold compared to theoretical predictions for rigid-contact
   worm-like locomotion.}},

Abstract = {{Compression moulding of Randomly-Oriented Strands (ROS) of
   pre-impregnated thermoplastic composites is a process that enables the

   the macroscopic squeeze flow behaviour that occurs during forming. This
   mechanism rules the filling of intricate features of the mould initially
   empty. A 2D Finite Element model was developed to predict the squeeze
   flow of ROS composites. The material was modelled as a Bingham fluid and
   the equivalent viscosity and yield stress of three different strand
   sizes were determined using an inverse method. The viscosity and yield
   stress were found to increase with strand length. Experimental
   validation of the model was performed using Carbon/PEEK ROS flat samples
   and the average difference between experimentally measured and predicted
   final strain was below 5\% for all cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Investigation of a New Weighted Averaging Method to Improve SNR of
   Electrocochleography Recordings}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Goal: The aim of this study was to investigate methods to improve
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of extratympanic electrocochleography
   (ET-ECOG); a low SNR electrophysiological measurement technique. The
   current standard for ET-ECOG involves acquiring and uniform averaging
   similar to 1000 evoked responses to reveal the signal of interest.
   Weighted averaging is commonly employed to enhance SNR of repetitive
   signals in the presence of a nonstationary noise, yet its efficacy in
   ET-ECOG has not been explored to date, which was the focus of this
   study. Methods: Conventional techniques used to compute signal
   statistics required for weighted averaging were found to be ineffective
   for ET-ECOG due to low SNR; therefore, a modified correlation
   coefficient-based approach was derived to quantify the ``signal{''}
   component. Several variants of weighted averaging schemes were
   implemented and evaluated on 54 ECOG recordings obtained from seven
   healthy volunteers. Results: The best weighted averaging scheme provided
   a 17\% (p < 0.05) SNR increase {[}signal amplitude to standard deviation
   (STD) of the noise ratio] compared to uniform averaging, and further
   improved to 22\% (p<0.05) when variance of the noise was incorporated as
   a cost factor. The implemented weighted averaging schemes were robust
   and effective for variants of ET-ECOG recording protocols investigated.
   Conclusion: Weighted averaging improved SNR of low amplitude ET-ECOG
   recordings in the presence of nonstationary noise. Significance: SNR
   improvements for ECOG have significant benefits in clinical
   applications; the variability associated with biofeatures extracted can
   be reduced, and may lead to shorter recordings. Methods described in
   this study can easily be incorporated in other low SNR repetitive
   electrophysiological measurement techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The three-phase series-connected modular multilevel converter (SC-MMC)
   is presented as one option for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) tap to
   reduce the cost of an HVDC station. Compared with conventional
   three-phase parallel-connected MMC, the number of semiconductor switches
   in SC-MMC is reduced by one-third to withstand the same dc voltage.
   First, the paper studies the operating principle of SC-MMC, and then
   presents an interspacing phase-shifted pulsewidth-modulated method which
   could improve the waveform of the output ac voltage for a given
   switching frequency. Next, the control strategy based on the identical
   real power input of each phase is proposed to balance the dc voltage of
   each phase under an unbalanced grid condition. The current limit of
   switching devices is also taken into consideration to protect SC-MMC
   from overcurrent. Furthermore, a universal zero-sequence current
   controller is developed as one part of the control strategy. In
   addition, an innovative method to suppress the third harmonics of ac
   current is presented. With the third harmonic suppression strategy, the
   SC-MMC can operate with much smaller SM capacitors without deteriorating
   the ac current, which contributes to the cost reduction further.
   Finally, simulation results obtained in PSCAD/EMTDC are provided to
   validate the proposed control strategies.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear parametric dynamics of a geometrically imperfect microbeam
   subject to a time dependent axial load is investigated in this paper.
   Based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the modified couple stress
   theory, continuous models for kinetic and potential energies are
   developed and balanced via use of Hamilton's principle. A model
   reduction procedure is carried out by applying the Galerkin scheme
   coupled with an assumed-mode technique, yielding a high-dimensional
   second-order reduced-order model. A linear analysis is performed upon
   the linear part of the reduced-order model in order to obtain the linear
   size-dependent natural frequencies. A nonlinear analysis is performed on
   the reduced-order model using the pseudo-arclength continuation method
   and a direct time-integration technique, yielding generalised
   coordinates, and hence the system parametric response. It is shown that,
   the steady-state frequency-response curves possess a trivial solution,
   both stable and unstable, throughout the solution space, separated by
   period-doubling bifurcation points, from which non-trivial solution
   branches bifurcate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater is important for energy and food security, human health and
   ecosystems. The time since groundwater was recharged-or groundwater
   age-can be important for diverse geologic processes, such as chemical
   weathering, ocean eutrophication and climate change. However, measured
   groundwater ages range from months to millions of years. The global
   volume and distribution of groundwater less than 50 years old-modern
   groundwater that is the most recently recharged and also the most
   vulnerable to global change-are unknown. Here we combine geochemical,
   geologic, hydrologic and geospatial data sets with numerical simulations
   of groundwater and analyse tritium ages to show that less than 6\% of
   the groundwater in the uppermost portion of Earth's landmass is modern.
   We find that the total groundwater volume in the upper 2 km of
   continental crust is approximately 22.6 million km(3), of which 0.1-5.0
   million km(3) is less than 50 years old. Although modern groundwater
   represents a small percentage of the total groundwater on Earth, the
   volume of modern groundwater is equivalent to a body of water with a
   depth of about 3 m spread over the continents. This water resource
   dwarfs all other components of the active hydrologic cycle.}},

Abstract = {{A structural electrical conductivity model for oxide melts was developed
   based on the Nernst-Einstein relationship of ionic conductivity. In the
   description of ionic conductivity, the effective diffusivities of
   cations in oxide slags were described as a function of the
   polymerization of the melt. The polymerization of oxide melts was
   calculated from the Modified Quasichemical Model, taking into account
   the short-range ordering in slags. The parameters of this conductivity
   model were fixed to reproduce the electrical conductivity data in unary
   and binary melts, and the model can well predict the conductivity data
   in ternary and higher order system without any additional model
   parameters. The model is successfully applied to the
   CaO-MgO-MnO-PbO-Al2O3-SiO2 system.}},

Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1171-1183}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The supercritical parametric instability of a microbeam subject to a
   time-dependent axial load is examined. The axial load is comprised of a
   constant mean value along with harmonic fluctuations. The mean value is
   increased from zero and is set to a value in the supercritical regime;
   the nonlinear parametric instability over the buckled state, due to the
   axial load variations, is examined. From the modelling perspective,
   based on the modified couple stress theory, the potential energy of the
   system is obtained in terms of the system parameters and displacement
   field. Moreover, the kinetic energy is formulated as a function of
   system parameters and the displacement field. The continuous model is
   developed by means of Hamilton's principle and then truncated into a
   reduced-order model via a weighted-residual technique. Three different
   numerical techniques, i.e. the pseudo-arclength continuation method, a
   direct time-integration scheme, and an eigenvalue extraction, are
   employed to solve the high-dimensional reduced-order model. A stability
   analysis is also conducted via the Floquet theory. The nonlinear
   size-dependent parametric response of the system over the buckled
   configuration is presented in the form of frequency-response diagrams,
   force-response curves, time histories, phase-plane portraits, fast
   Fourier transforms, and Poincar, sections.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an earth levee model is constructed to investigate the
   impact of animal burrows on the integrity and performance of earthen
   structures. A series of centrifuge experiments are conducted on
   homogenous scaled-down 1H:1V levee models built from the natural Kasama
   soil. Both intact and deteriorated models were subject to a 35g
   acceleration level. Invasive animal intrusions were introduced in the
   form of horizontal array of idealized cylindrical burrows at the
   mid-height of the levee. The water level was gradually increased during
   the centrifuge flight, and the response of the levee was monitored
   throughout the test. Pore pressures were recorded using pressure
   transducers placed at preselected locations within the model. Surface
   displacements were measured using laser LVDTs and supplemented with
   three digital cameras for tracking the overall deformation pattern of
   the levee model. A summary of the test procedure and selected results is
   presented herewith. The observed deformation mechanism due to the
   presence of animal burrows is also described. As compared with the
   intact levee, the presence of burrows is found to alter the pattern of
   the water flow through the deteriorated levee structure-leading to a
   notable increase in the exit hydraulic gradient, internal erosion, and
   subsequently slope failure.}},

Title = {{Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome as a model for vascular aging}},
Journal = {{BIOGERONTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{129-145}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging
   disorder caused by a de novo genetic mutation that leads to the
   accumulation of a splicing isoform of lamin A termed progerin. Progerin
   expression alters the organization of the nuclear lamina and chromatin.
   The life expectancy of HGPS patients is severely reduced due to critical
   cardiovascular defects. Progerin also accumulates in an age-dependent
   manner in the vascular cells of adults that do not carry genetic
   mutations associated with HGPS. The molecular mechanisms that lead to
   vascular dysfunction in HGPS may therefore also play a role in vascular
   aging. The vascular phenotypic and molecular changes observed in HGPS
   are strikingly similar to those seen with age, including increased
   senescence, altered mechanotransduction and stem cell exhaustion. This
   article discusses the similarities and differences between age-dependent
   and HGPS-related vascular aging to highlight the relevance of HGPS as a
   model for vascular aging. Induced pluripotent stem cells derived from
   HGPS patients are suggested as an attractive model to study vascular
   aging in order to develop novel approaches to treat cardiovascular
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes asymptotically achieve the symmetric capacity of memoryless
   channels, yet their error-correcting performance under
   successive-cancellation (SC) decoding for short and moderate length
   codes is worse than that of other modern codes such as low-density
   parity-check (LDPC) codes. Of the many methods to improve the
   error-correction performance of polar codes, list decoding yields the
   best results, especially when the polar code is concatenated with a
   cyclic redundancy check (CRC). List decoding involves exploring several
   decoding paths with SC decoding, and therefore tends to be slower than
   SC decoding itself, by an order of magnitude in practical
   implementations. In this paper, we present a new algorithm based on
   unrolling the decoding tree of the code that improves the speed of list
   decoding by an order of magnitude when implemented in software.
   Furthermore, we show that for software-defined radio applications, our
   proposed algorithm is faster than the fastest software implementations
   of LDPC decoders in the literature while offering comparable
   error-correction performance at similar or shorter code lengths.}},

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{135-142}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this work, compost Microbial Fuel Cells (cMFCs) were used to generate
   electricity from a mix of fruit and vegetable wastes, and soil with
   different C/N ratios and salinities. Experiments were carried out in 500
   mL cMFCs equipped with carbon felt anodes and manganese dioxide
   cathodes. The cMFCs were loaded with fresh compost and operated at 20-23
   degrees C for up to 97 days. The low C/N ratio (C/N 24) had a greater
   power production with a maximum power density of 5.29 mW/m(2) (71.43
   mW/m(3)), indicating a more favorable condition for microbial growth.
   High-saline cMFCs produced lower power, suggesting that their level of
   salinity (10 g/L of NaCl) inhibited electricigenic microorganisms. The
   closed-circuit cMFC showed an improved degradation of organic matter by
   6\% to 8\% compared to the control MFC operated in an open circuit mode
   (no external resistor attached). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In most national building codes, site classification is based on the
   V-s30 parameter, the average shear wave velocity for the first 30 m of
   soil below the surface, and defines amplification factors (e.g. F-a and
   F-v) to be applied to ground motions for a reference condition. Seismic
   microzonation mapping is usually achieved by combining information from
   various sources, each with varying degrees of uncertainties. A
   preliminary microzonation can be derived from surface geology or surface
   elevation maps, while a more detailed and accurate map is usually based
   on extensive seismic surveys. A procedure is proposed that progressively
   allows the integration of information from various sources and to
   estimate the degree of uncertainty on the microzonation. This allows
   planners to determine where microzonation maps require further
   investigations given current or future urban development plans. The
   proposed procedure uses conditional second moment estimation and
   provides the best linear unbiased estimates of V-s30 and its
   uncertainty. Next, these estimates are used to derive soil
   classification probability maps and to compute the expected values and
   variance of soil amplification factors F-a ad F-v to be used in
   probabilistic seismic risk analyses. The proposed procedure is
   demonstrated for the seismic microzonation of the island of Montreal.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the research was to examine the effect of increasing
   carbon surface basicity on uptake of perfluorooctane sulfonic (PFOS) and
   carboxylic acids (PFOA) by activated carbon. Granular activated carbons
   made from coal, coconut shell, wood, and phenolic-polymer-based
   activated carbon fibers were modified through high-temperature and
   ammonia gas treatments to facilitate systematical evaluation of the
   impact of basicity of different origins. Comparison of adsorption
   isotherms and adsorption distribution coefficients showed that the
   ammonia gas treatment was more effective than the high-temperature
   treatment in enhancing surface basicity. The resultant higher point of
   zero charges and total basicity (measured by total HCl uptake)
   correlated with improved adsorption affinity for PFOS and PFOA. The
   effectiveness of surface modification to enhance adsorption varied with
   carbon raw material. Wood-based carbons and activated carbon fibers
   showed enhancement by one to three orders of magnitudes while other
   materials could experience reduction in adsorption towards either PFOS
   or PFOA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Direct injection of nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles is being
   considered for remediation of contaminated sites. However, the transport
   characteristics of NZVI under horizontal flow conditions are not fully
   understood. In this study, NZVI particles were stabilized with
   carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and injected in vertical and horizontal
   columns to compare the effects of the flow direction on the transport.
   Columns were packed with sand of mean grain diameters of 180, 340 or
   1140 mu m (referred to as fine, intermediate and coarse sand,
   respectively), and were injected with CMC-NZVI suspensions of 0.3, 1 or
   3 g Fe L-1. Experimental breakthrough curves showed that with the coarse
   and intermediate sands, the steady-state effluent concentration in the
   horizontal column were up to 84\% lower than those in the vertical
   column regardless of the initial NZVI concentration. However, in the
   fine sand the differences were insignificant, except at the highest NZVI
   particle concentration. Additionally, in the horizontally-oriented
   columns containing the coarse or intermediated sand, NZVI aggregates
   particles were non-uniformly distributed in the cross-section of the
   columns and there higher deposition in the bottom-half of the
   cross-section due to gravity effects. These deposition patterns can be
   accounted for, in part, by the gravitational settling of the large
   aggregates of NZVI, especially at high NZVI concentrations. A particle
   trajectory analysis in three dimensions demonstrated that under
   horizontal flow, gravity forces resulted in lower deposition of NZVI on
   the bottom-half of a single collector, as particles approaching the
   bottom-half of the collector were deflected by gravity to collectors
   below. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Stabilization of iron arsenate solids by encapsulation with aluminum

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDFerric arsenate solids in the form of scorodite
   (FeAsO(4)2H(2)O) particles are suitable carriers for immobilization of
   arsenic-rich wastes. The stability of scorodite is, however, highly pH
   dependent (typically at 4 pH 7) and satisfactory only under oxic
   disposal conditions. In this work a new stabilization technology based
   on the concept of encapsulation with aluminum hydroxyl gels is
   investigated to enhance the stability of arsenical solids over a wider
   range of disposal conditions.
   RESULTSThe encapsulation system investigated involves blending and
   short-term ageing of synthetic scorodite particles with amorphous
   aluminum hydroxyl gels derived from partial hydrolysis of aluminum
   chloride or aluminum sulfate salts. Of the two gel types, the
   Al(SO4)(1.5)-derived gel proved to be the most effective, even at the
   very low Al(III)/As(V) molar ratio of 0.1, apparently due to in situ
   development of protective aluminum hydroxide matrix and not as a simple
   adsorption sink for soluble arsenate species.
   CONCLUSIONArsenic release from the scorodite-aluminum hydroxyl gel
   composites was found to be drastically reduced with respect to gel-free
   scorodite, making this system a very interesting candidate for further
   development as an effective hazardous material encapsulating material.

Abstract = {{Powder metallurgy of Inconel 718 superalloy is advantageous as a
   near-net shape process for complex parts to reduce the buy-to-fly ratio

   and involves the risk of distortion at high temperatures. The present
   work is focused on modeling the onset of sintering and distortion as a
   function of temperature, grain size, and part geometry for Inconel 718.
   Using experimental sintering results and data available in the
   literature, the supersolidus liquid phase sintering of Inconel 718 was
   modeled. The model was used to define a processing window where part
   distortion would be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Crosslinked injectable hyaluronic acid (HA)-gelatin (Ge) hydrogels have
   remarkable viscoelastic and biological properties for vocal fold tissue
   engineering. Patient-specific tuning of the viscoelastic properties of
   this injectable biomaterial could improve tissue regeneration. The
   frequency-dependent viscoelasticity of crosslinked HA-Ge hydrogels was
   measured as a function of the concentration of HA, Ge, and crosslinker.
   Synthetic extracellular matrix hydrogels were fabricated using
   thiol-modified HA and Ge, and crosslinked by poly(ethylene glycol)
   diacrylate. A recently developed characterization method based on
   Rayleigh wave propagation was used to quantify the frequency-dependent
   viscoelastic properties of these hydrogels, including shear storage and
   loss moduli, over a broad frequency range; that is, from 40 to 4000 Hz.
   The viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels increased with frequency.
   The storage and loss moduli values and the rate of increase with
   frequency varied with the concentrations of the constituents. The range
   of the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels was within that of human
   vocal fold tissue obtained from in vivo and ex vivo measurements.
   Frequency-dependent parametric relations were obtained using a linear
   least-squares regression. The results are useful to better fine-tune the
   storage and loss moduli of HA-Ge hydrogels by varying the concentrations
   of the constituents for use in patient-specific treatments. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, effects of dynamically formed precipitates on the
   microstructure and texture evolution were investigated during the
   post-deformation annealing. Two ternary alloys of Mg, Al, and Sn were
   produced and deformed at 250 and 300 A degrees C to form different
   amounts of strain-induced precipitates during deformation and different
   levels of dynamic recrystallization. Subsequent annealing at deformation
   temperatures was performed at various times for up to 4 h and
   recrystallization, grain coarsening, and precipitation behaviors were
   characterized. The deformed structures were all partially dynamically
   recrystallized exhibiting necklacing. Static recrystallization (SRX)
   progressed by the transformation of the coarse grained un-necklaced
   regions to fine grains. It was found that increasing levels of
   pre-existing precipitates on dynamic recrystallized grain boundaries
   inhibited SRX as well as grain coarsening, by precipitation pinning.
   Texture was weakened after a short time annealing compared to the
   as-deformed condition and high amount of precipitates at the grain
   boundary restricted the grain coarsening and kept the texture weaken
   associated with grain coarsening.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional nonlinear global dynamics of an axially moving
   viscoelastic beam is investigated numerically, retaining longitudinal,
   transverse, and lateral displacements and inertia. The nonlinear
   continuous model governing the motion of the system is obtained by means
   of Hamilton's principle. The Galerkin scheme along with suitable
   eigenfunctions is employed for model reduction. Direct time-integration
   is conducted upon the reduced-order model yielding the time-varying
   generalized coordinates. From the time histories of the generalized
   coordinates, the bifurcation diagrams of Poincare sections are
   constructed by varying either the forcing amplitude or the axial speed
   as the bifurcation parameter. The results for the three-dimensional
   viscoelastic model are compared to those of a three-dimensional elastic
   model in order to better understand the effect of the internal energy
   dissipation mechanism on the dynamical behavior of the system. The
   results are also presented by means of time histories, phase-plane
   diagrams, and fast Fourier transforms (FFT).}},

Title = {{A Fourier penalty method for solving the time-dependent Maxwell's
   equations in domains with curved boundaries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{306}},
Pages = {{167-198}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{We present a high order, Fourier penalty method for the Maxwell's
   equations in the vicinity of perfect electric conductor boundary
   conditions. The approach relies on extending the smooth non-periodic
   domain of the equations to a periodic domain by removing the exact
   boundary conditions and introducing an analytic forcing term in the
   extended domain. The forcing, or penalty term is chosen to
   systematically enforce the boundary conditions to high order in the
   penalty parameter, which then allows for higher order numerical methods.
   We present an efficient numerical method for constructing the penalty
   term, and discretize the resulting equations using a Fourier spectral
   method. We demonstrate convergence orders of up to 3.5 for the
   one-dimensional Maxwell's equations, and show that the numerical method
   does not suffer from dispersion (or pollution) errors. We also
   illustrate the approach in two dimensions and demonstrate convergence
   orders of 2.5 for transverse magnetic modes and 1.5 for the transverse
   electric modes. We conclude the paper with numerous test cases in
   dimensions two and three including waves traveling in a bent waveguide,
   and scattering off of a windmill-like geometry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Equivalence between the Energy Stable Flux Reconstruction and Filtered
   Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{306}},
Pages = {{343-369}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the equivalence between filtered
   Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes and the Energy Stable Flux
   Reconstruction (ESFR) schemes, expanding on previous demonstrations in
   1D {[}1] and for straight-sided elements in 3D {[}2]. We first derive
   the DG and ESFR schemes in strong form and compare the respective flux
   penalization terms while highlighting the implications of the
   fundamental assumptions for stability in the ESFR formulations, notably
   that all ESFR scheme correction fields can be interpreted as modally
   filtered DG correction fields. We present the result in the general
   context of all higher dimensional curvilinear element formulations.
   Through a demonstration that there exists a weak form of the ESFR
   schemes which is both discretely and analytically equivalent to the
   strong form, we then extend the results obtained for the strong
   formulations to demonstrate that ESFR schemes can be interpreted as a DG
   scheme in weak form where discontinuous edge flux is substituted for
   numerical edge flux correction. Theoretical derivations are then
   verified with numerical results obtained from a 2D Euler testcase with
   curved boundaries. Given the current choice of high-order DG-type
   schemes and the question as to which might be best to use for a specific
   application, the main significance of this work is the bridge that it
   provides between them. Clearly outlining the similarities between the
   schemes results in the important conclusion that it is always less
   efficient to use ESFR schemes, as opposed to the weak DG scheme, when
   solving problems implicitly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cooked, milled purple-fleshed sweet potato (PFSP) accessions, PM09.812

   laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed
   accession-dependent variations in anthocyanin release and degradation.
   After 24 h, more anthocyanin species were detected in the small
   intestinal vessel relative to other vessels for accession PM09.960
   whereas more species appeared in the ascending colonic vessel for
   accession PM09.812. The ferric reducing antioxidant power was increased
   in the small intestinal vessel for PM09.960 and in the ascending colonic
   vessel for accession PM09.812, corresponding to the appearance of a
   majority of anthocyanins for each accession. These results show that
   intestinal and colonic microbial digestion of PFSP leads to an
   accession-dependent pattern for anthocyanin bioaccessibility and
   degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   doping may also induce crack deflection to further improve the fracture
   resistance of graphene grain boundaries (GBs). Furthermore, we showed
   that the presence of multiple B and N dopants in the pentagon-heptagon

   coated with a 10 +/- 2 nm layer of chitosan (CH) hydrogel cross-linked
   with a photocleavable cross-linker (PhL). We encapsulated
   fluorescent-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) inside the gel. Under 980 nm
   excitation, the upconverted UV emission cleaves the PhL cross-links and
   instantaneously liberates the FITC-BSA under 2 cm thick tissue. The
   release is immediately arrested if the excitation source is switched
   off. The upconverted NIR light allows for the tracking of particles
   under the tissue. Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells cultured with UCNPs are
   viable both in the presence and in the absence of laser irradiation.

Title = {{Comparison and analysis of the effects of various improved turbocharging

Abstract = {{In this paper, several kinds of improved modes for exhaust gas
   turbocharging (EGT) have been investigated on the transient
   performances, including steam-assisted turbocharging (SAT),
   electronically controlled turbocharging (ECT) and supercharger-exhaust
   gas turbocharging (SET). A turbocharged gasoline engine was employed a
   the study object, which was conducted bench test firstly to get basic
   data for building and calibrating the simulation model. Then, an
   accurate and reliable GT-Power model in steady and transient engine
   operation was developed. On this basis, the transient processes of four
   types of engines: EGT engine, SET engine, SAT engine and ECT engine were
   investigated by simulation and comparative analysis. The results show
   that SET, SAT and ECT can reduce the response time and fuel consumption
   in acceleration process. The response time of various turbocharging
   approaches follows the descending sequence of EGT, SAT, ECT and SET. At
   the speed of 2000 r/min (from idling to full load), compared with EGT
   engine, the specific fuel consumption (SFC) of SET engine is decreased
   by 23.3\%, while it can be reduced by 38.2\% and 36.3\% in SAT engine
   and ECT engine, respectively. Finally, to reveal the improvement
   potentials of SAT and ECT, both of them were re-matched with a larger

Abstract = {{The potential use of a novel scaffold biomaterial consisting of
   cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA)-gelatin (Ge) composite microgels is
   investigated for use in treating vocal fold injury and scarring. Cell
   adhesion integrins and kinematics of cell motion are investigated in 2D
   and 3D culture conditions, respectively. Human vocal fold fibroblast
   (hVFF)cells are seeded on HA-Ge microgels attached to a HA hydrogel thin
   film. The results show that hVFF cells establish effective adhesion to
   HA-Ge microgels through the ubiquitous expression of beta(1) integrin in
   the cell membrane. The microgels are then encapsulated in a 3D HA
   hydrogel for the study of cell migration. The cells within the HA-Ge
   microgel-reinforced composite hydrogel (MRCH) scaffold have an average
   motility speed of 0.24 +/- 0.08 mu m min(-1). The recorded microscopic
   images reveal features that are presumably associated with lobopodial
   and lamellipodial cell migration modes within the MRCH scaffold. Average
   cell speed during lobopodial migration is greater than that during
   lamellipodial migration. The cells move faster in the MRCH than in the
   HA-Ge gel without microgels. These findings support the hypothesis that
   HA-Ge MRCH promotes cell adhesion and migration; thereby they constitute
   a promising biomaterial for vocal fold repair.}},

Pages = {{226-242}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear size-dependent dynamics of a geometrically imperfect shear
   deformable microplate is investigated based on the modified couple
   stress theory. An initial imperfection in the out-of-plane direction is
   taken into account. The third-order shear deformation theory is employed
   to model the system by retaining in-plane displacements and inertia. The
   governing equations of motion of the system are obtained employing an
   energy method through use of the Lagrange equations, which upon
   employing an assumed-mode technique, yields a set of second-order
   nonlinear ordinary differential equations with coupled terms. A
   high-dimensional discretised system is considered and made
   double-dimensional via a change of variables in order to obtain a set of
   first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The resulting
   equations are solved using a direct time-integration technique,
   resulting in time-dependent generalised coordinates for the in-plane and
   out-of-plane displacements and two rotations. From these generalised
   coordinates, phase-plane portraits and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs)
   are also obtained. Moreover, the frequency-response and force-response
   curves of the system are obtained using a continuation technique;
   stability analysis is conducted via the Floquet theory. The effect of
   the initial imperfection as well as the length-scale parameter on the
   system response is also examined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present work, we study the effects of the electronic relaxation
   of semicore levels on polaron activation energies and dynamics. Within
   the framework of adiabatic ab initio theory, we utilize both static
   transition state theory and molecular dynamics methods for an in-depth
   study of polaronic hopping in delithiated LiFePO4 (FePO4). Our results
   show that electronic relaxation of semicore states is significant in
   FePO4, resulting in a lower activation barrier and kinetics that is one
   to two orders faster compared to the result of calculations that do not
   incorporate semicore states. In general, the results suggest that the
   relaxation of states far below the Fermi energy could dramatically
   impact the ab initio polaronic barrier estimates for many transition
   metal oxides and phosphates.}},

Title = {{High-strength porous biomaterials for bone replacement: A strategy to
   assess the interplay between cell morphology, mechanical properties,
   bone ingrowth and manufacturing constraints}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{345-356}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{High-strength fully porous biomaterials built with additive
   manufacturing provide an exciting opportunity for load-bearing
   orthopedic applications. While factors controlling their mechanical and
   biological response have recently been the subject of intense research,
   the interplay between mechanical properties, bone ingrowth requirements,
   and manufacturing constraints, is still unclear. In this paper, we
   present two high-strength stretch-dominated topologies, the Tetrahedron
   and the Octet truss, as well as an intuitive visualization method to
   understand the relationship of cell topology, pore size, porosity with
   constraints imposed by bone ingrowth requirements and additive
   manufacturing. 40 samples of selected porosities are fabricated using
   Selective Laser Melting (SLM), and their morphological deviations
   resulting from SLM are assessed via micro-CF. Mechanical compression
   testing is used to obtain stiffness and strength properties, whereas
   bone ingrowth is assessed in a canine in vivo model at four and eight
   weeks. The results show that the maximum strength and stiffness ranged
   from 227.86 +/- 10.15 to 31.37 +/- 2.19 MPa and 4.58 +/- 0.18 to 1.23
   +/- 0.40 GPa respectively, and the maximum 0.2\% offset strength is
   almost 5 times stronger than that of tantalum foam. For Tetrahedron
   samples, bone ingrowth after four and eight weeks is 28.6\% +/- 11.6\%,
   and 41.3\% +/- 4.3\%, while for the Octet truss 35.5\% +/- 1.9\% and
   56.9\% +/- 4.0\% respectively. This research is the first to demonstrate
   the occurrence of bone ingrowth into high-strength porous biomaterials
   which have higher structural efficiency than current porous biomaterials
   in the market.
   Statement of significance
   We present two stretch-dominated cell topologies for porous biomaterials
   that can be used for load bearing orthopaedic applications, and prove
   that they encourage bone ingrowth in a canine model. We also introduce
   an intuitive method to visualize and understand the relationship of cell
   topology, pore size, porosity with constraints imposed by bone ingrowth
   requirements and additive manufacturing. We show this strategy helps to
   gain insight into the interaction of exogenous implant factors and
   endogenous system factors that can affect the success of load-bearing
   orthopaedic devices. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Using Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and Phase Field Crystal (PFC)
   modelling, the early-stage precipitation phenomenon is investigated for
   naturally- and artificially-aged Al-Mg-Si alloys of two different Mg/Si
   ratios, i.e. 1 and 2. It is shown that, regardless of alloy composition
   and aging history, the earliest precipitates appear as finely-dispersed
   Si-rich clusters which gradually undergo a simultaneous coarsening and
   Mg-enrichment. In addition, the energetic factors for the instability of
   natural aging clusters are analysed. The energy analysis also suggests
   that the initial Si-enrichment of the earliest precipitates is due to
   the affinity of locally-strained areas for higher Si concentrations when
   achieving a meta-stable equilibrium with the strain-free surrounding
   matrix. The subsequent Mg-enrichment is shown to be energetically
   necessary for an evolving precipitate to survive and grow. The alloy
   with smaller Mg/Si ratio shows a delay in the onset of Mg-enrichment
   during natural aging, which is attributed to the higher average Si
   content, as well as the slow kinetics of diffusion at natural aging
   temperatures. It is shown that this alloy exhibits a smaller nucleation
   barrier and critical nucleus size as well. We suggest that the above
   described mechanisms govern the evolution of early-stage clustering in
   the common range of age-hardenable Al-Mg-Si alloy compositions. (C) 2015

Title = {{A review on lithium combustion}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{948-965}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Lithium combustion has been studied for several decades, with a primary
   focus on safety issues, such as lithium fires resulting from spills in
   nuclear reactors. Several studies have also considered the use of
   lithium as a fuel within propellants, or within propulsion systems that
   burn lithium in the atmospheric ``air{''} of other planets. Lithium
   safety has typically been investigated through combustion of molten
   pieces of lithium or within pool fires. For propulsion applications,
   experiments were carried out using packed beds of lithium particles.
   A novel approach that has recently been proposed is the use of lithium
   as a recyclable fuel, or energy carrier that can compactly store
   renewable energy. In this scheme, lithium is burned with air, or
   power-plant exhaust, to generate heat for thermal power systems when
   power is needed. The solid-phase combustion products would be collected
   and recycled, via electrolysis, back into elemental lithium when excess
   renewable power is available.
   This paper summarizes the existing knowledge on lithium combustion. It
   presents the available findings on lithium combustion for large single
   pieces of lithium, on pool fires, reaction in packed beds, as well as
   the combustion of sub-mm sized particles and droplets which are needed
   for the use of lithium as an energy carrier. The combustion reactions of
   lithium with O-2, H2O, CO2 and N-2 are discussed. Modelling of
   lithium-particle combustion is at the early stages of development and
   available results are discussed. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Reactivity in an aqueous medium is a key parameter for determining the
   potential bioactivity (i.e., the ability to form a bond to bone) of
   bioactive and soluble glasses. In this study, dynamic vapour sorption
   (DVS), a gravimetric technique that measures vapour sorption under
   controlled relative humidity (RH) and temperature, was used to
   investigate the short-term aqueous interactions of Bioglass (R) 4555
   (BG). Specifically, DVS was applied to monitor the sorption
   characteristics of BG particles of three different sizes exposed to
   variable RH between 0 and 90\%. In addition, the effect of directly
   exposing these glasses to 90\% RH for up to 24 h and its effect on the
   structural and morphological properties was analysed. Attributable to
   their larger surface areas, smaller BG particles adsorbed more vapour,
   and consequently underwent larger total and final mass percent changes
   as well as greater extent of surface transformation. Precise vapour
   sorption rates, determined using DVS, were correlated with BG particle
   surface area and initial rate of ion release when immersed in deionized
   water, thus demonstrating the ability of DVS to accurately predict
   reactivity and potential bioactivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents and discusses results of a computational study of
   the flow field and heat transfer characteristics for a turbulent slot
   jet of an Al2O3-water nanofluid impinging normally on to a semi-circular
   concave surface. A wide range of various flow and geometrical
   parameters, including the nanoparticle volume fraction (Phi), jet
   Reynolds number (Re), and jet-to-target distance (h/B) have been
   considered. The results are presented in terms of the streamline
   patterns, local and average Nusselt numbers, stagnation Nusselt number,
   shear stress distribution, and pumping power. The results show a
   significant improvement of heat transfer rate due to the presence of the
   nanoparticles in water. Moreover, for ratios of h/B greater than three,
   the maximum average heat transfer rate from the concave surface occurs
   at h/B = 5. An increase in the jet Reynolds number and nanoparticle
   concentration leads to an improved cooling performance of jet
   impingement on the concave surface. However, the elevated viscosity of
   the nanofluid has the adverse effect of increasing the pumping power
   needed per unit of heat transferred. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to investigate the within-the-bond guided
   wave propagation in a composite skin-stringer joint. The structure of
   interest is composed of three carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   plates bonded together by adhesive film. This bonded joint is prone to
   disbond when submitted to extreme loads or fatigue. Therefore, two
   bonding conditions are investigated, namely undamaged and damaged (with
   disbond). The artificial disbond is introduced into the joint using a
   circular Teflon tape during manufacturing. Two co-localized slender
   rectangular piezoceramics are used to generate plane guided waves
   within-the-bondlines and non-contact measurement is performed using a
   3-D laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) to extract the required information
   for evaluation of the bonding conditions. The results include
   reflection, transmission and also scattering of the guided waves at the
   joint as a function of frequency, propagating mode and presence of
   artificial damage. It was found that the amplitude of the reflection,
   transmission coefficients and directivity patterns of scattered waves
   are affected by the presence of damage, such that Structural Health
   Monitoring (SHM) design guidelines can be derived for efficient damage
   detection in the composite assemblies using a within-the-bond inspection
   strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Superlattice-like Sn18Sb52-SnSe2 multiple thin films are systematically
   investigated for phase change memory application. The thin films have a
   preferable thermal stability owing to the wide bandgap, strong Sn-Se

   Besides, the variation in resistance of the film not only can lower the
   power consumption but also can facilitate device operation. Meanwhile,
   operating speed of the device based on specific {[}Sn18Sb82(2
   nm)-SnSe2(10 nm)](4) thin film is dramatically increased, reaching 5 ns
   compared with 100 ns of traditional Ge2Sb2Te5. This high operating speed
   is mainly derived from the precipitated Sb phase and weak Sb-Sb, Se-Se

Abstract = {{Background: Chronic high-frequency electrical deep brain stimulation
   (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate region is currently being
   investigated clinically as a therapy for treatment of refractory
   depression. Experimental DBS of the homologous region, the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), in rodent models has previously demonstrated
   anti-depressant-like effects. Our goal was to determine if structural
   remodeling accompanies the alterations of brain function previously
   observed as a result of chronic DBS.
   Methods: Here we applied 6 h of high-frequency bilateral VMPFC DBS daily
   to 8 9-week old C57Bl/6 mice for 5 days. We investigated the
   ``micro-lesion{''} effect by using a sham stimulation group (8 mice) and
   a control group (8 mice with a hole drilled into the skull only). Whole
   brain anatomy was investigated post-mortem using high-resolution
   magnetic resonance imaging and areas demonstrating volumetric expansion
   were further investigated using histology and immunohistochemistry.
   Results: The DBS group demonstrated bilateral increases in whole
   hippocampus and the left thalamus volume compared to both sham and
   control groups. Local hippocampal and thalamic volume increases were
   also observed at the voxel-level; however these increases were observed
   in both DBS and sham groups. Follow-up immunohistochemistry in the
   hippocampus revealed DBS increased blood vessel size and synaptic
   density relative to the control group whereas the sham group
   demonstrated increased astrocyte size.
   Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that DBS not only works by altering
   function with neural circuits, but also by structurally altering
   circuits at the cellular level. Neuroplastic alterations may play a role
   inmediating the clinical efficacy of DBS therapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Chemicals released into freshwater systems threaten ecological
   functioning and may put aquatic life and the health of humans at risk.
   We developed a new contaminant fate model (CFM) that follows simple,
   well-established methodologies and is unique in its cross-border,
   seamless hydrological and geospatial framework, including lake routing,
   a critical component in northern environments. We validated the model
   using the pharmaceutical Carbamazepine and predicted eco-toxicological
   risk for 15 pharmaceuticals in the Saint-Lawrence River Basin, Canada.
   The results indicated negligible to low environmental risk for the
   majority of tested chemicals, while two pharmaceuticals showed elevated
   risk in up to 13\% of rivers affected by municipal effluents. As an
   integrated model, our CFM is designed for application at very large
   scales with the primary goal of detecting high risk zones. In regulatory
   frameworks, it can help screen existing or new chemicals entering the
   market regarding their potential impact on human and environmental
   health. Due to its high geospatial resolution, our CFM can also
   facilitate the prioritization of actions, such as identifying regions
   where reducing contamination sources or upgrading treatment plants is
   most pertinent to achieve targeted pollutant removal or to protect
   drinking water resources. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   approach was employed to study the effect of ultrasonic amplitude on the
   enzymatic transesterification. Kinetic constants of transesterification
   reaction were determined at different ultrasonic amplitudes (30\%, 35\%,
   40\%, 45\%, and 50\%) and enzyme concentrations (4, 6, and 8 wt.\% of
   fat) at constant molar ratio (fat:methanol); 1:6, and ultrasonic cycle;
   5 kHz. Parametric effects on the yield were studied using three sets of
   experiments namely A, B, and C. In experiment set A, two factors
   (ultrasonic amplitude and cycle) were investigated at three levels; in
   experiment set B, two factors (molar ratio and enzyme concentration)
   were examined at three levels; and in experiment set C, two factors
   (ultrasonic amplitude and reaction time) were investigated at five
   levels. A yield of 96.8\% was attained in 20 min at an ultrasonic
   amplitude (40\%) at 5 kHz, fat:methanol molar ratio (1:4) and catalyst
   level 6\% (w/w of fat). The fitted curves of the kinetic mechanism
   showed a sigmoidal curve due to mass transfer limitations which
   controlled the process at the beginning of the reaction. The kinetic
   model results also revealed interesting features of ultrasound assisted
   enzyme-catalyzed transesterification: at ultrasonic amplitude 40\%, the
   reaction activities within the system seemed to be steady after 20 min
   which means the reaction could proceed with or without ultrasonic
   mixing. The kinetic model approach employed describes the whole
   methanolysis process accurately. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Here, we present FissionNet, a proteome-wide binary protein interactome
   for S. pombe, comprising 2,278 high-quality interactions, of which
   similar to 50\% were previously not reported in any species. Fission-Net
   unravels previously unreported interactions implicated in processes such
   as gene silencing and pre-mRNA splicing. We developed a rigorous network
   comparison framework that accounts for assay sensitivity and
   specificity, revealing extensive species-specific network rewiring
   between fission yeast, budding yeast, and human. Surprisingly, although
   genes are better conserved between the yeasts, S. pombe interactions are
   significantly better conserved in human than in S. cerevisiae. Our
   framework also reveals that different modes of gene duplication
   influence the extent to which paralogous proteins are functionally
   repurposed. Finally, cross-species interactome mapping demonstrates that
   coevolution of interacting proteins is remarkably prevalent, a result
   with important implications for studying human disease in model
   organisms. Overall, FissionNet is a valuable resource for understanding
   protein functions and their evolution.}},

Abstract = {{A myriad of pathologies affect the gastrointestinal tract, citing this
   affected area as a significant target for therapeutic intervention. One
   group of therapeutic agents, antisense and oligonucleotides and small
   interfering RNAs, offer a promising platform for treating a wide variety
   of diseases ranging from cancer to auto-immune diseases. Current
   delivery methods are carried out either systemically or locally into
   diseased areas, both of which involve needles. The challenge in orally
   administering this type of treatment lies in the complications that
   arise due to the vast environmental extremes found within the
   gastrointestinal tract, owing to the fact that, as the drug travels down
   the gastrointestinal tract, it is subjected to pH changes and
   interactions with bacteria and a variety of digestive and protective
   enzymes including proteases, DNAses, and RNAses. Overcoming these
   challenges to allow the practical application of these drugs is a
   priority that has invoked a multitude of research in the chemical,
   biological, and material sciences. In this review, we will address
   common gastrointestinal pathologies, the barriers to oral-based
   therapies and antisense-interfering technologies, the approaches that
   have already been applied for their delivery, and the current status of
   antisense drug therapy clinical trials for gastrointestinal-related

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Tin dioxide (SnO2) is a widely investigated lithium (Li) storage
   material because of its easy preparation, two-step storage mechanism and
   high specific capacity for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this
   contribution, a phase-pure cobalt-doped SnO2 (Co/SnO2) and a cobalt and
   nitrogen co-doped SnO2 (Co-N/SnO2) nanocrystals are prepared to explore
   their Li storage behaviors. It is found that the morphology, specific
   surface area, and electrochemical properties could be largely modulated
   in the doped and co-doped SnO2 nanocrystals. Gavalnostatic cycling
   results indicate that the Co-N/SnO2 electrode delivers a specific
   capacity as high as 716 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, and the same
   outstanding rate performance can be observed in subsequent cycles due to
   the ionic/electronic conductivity enhancement by co-doping effect.
   Further, microstructure observation indicates the existence of
   intermediate phase of Li3N with high ionic conductivity upon cycling,
   which probably accounts for the improvements of Co-N/SnO2 electrodes.
   The method of synergetic doping into SnO2 with Co and N, with which the
   electrochemical performances is enhanced remarkably, undoubtedly, will
   have an important influence on the material itself and community of LIBs
   as well.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in microsensor technologies for air pollution monitoring
   encourage a growing use of portable sensors. This study aims at testing
   their performance in the development of exposure surfaces for nitrogen
   dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3). In Montreal, Canada, a data-collection
   campaign was conducted across three seasons in 2014 for 76 sites
   spanning the range of land uses and built environments of the city; each
   site was visited from 6 to 12 times, for 20 min, using NO2 and O-3
   sensors manufactured by Aeroqual. Land-use regression models were
   developed, achieving R-2 values of 0.86 for NO2 and 0.92 for O-3 when
   adjusted for regional meteorology to control for the fact that all of
   the locations were not monitored at the same time. A total of two
   exposure surfaces were then developed for NO3 and O-3 as averages over
   spring, summer, and fall. Validation against the fixed-station data and
   previous campaigns suggests that Aeroqual sensors tend to overestimate
   the highest NO2 and O-3 concentrations, thus increasing the range of
   values across the city. However, the sensors suggest a good performance
   with respect to capturing the spatial variability in NO2 and O-3 and are
   very convenient to use, having great potential for capturing temporal
   variability.}},

Abstract = {{During sintering of blended powders by spark plasma sintering (SPS),
   short sintering times are opposed by the requirement of sufficient
   diffusion times to obtain chemical homogenization. In this study,
   commercially blended Al-alloy powder Alumix 431D was sintered by SPS at
   425 degrees C for various sintering times. Microstructure analysis and
   mechanical properties of the consolidated components in the T1 and T6
   states were evaluated. Densities between 97.5 and 99.7\%TD were obtained
   across all hold times. After sintering for 60 min, microhardnesses of 91
   +/- 8 and 143 +/- 6 HV were attained in the T1 and T6 conditions,
   respectively. The T1 samples had a flexural strength of 659 +/- 37 MPa
   and a flexural strain of 5.7 +/- 0.3\%, compared to 552 +/- 43 MPa and
   3.8 +/- 0.2\% in the T6 temper. The mechanical properties of the T6
   components were lower than those found in the literature. Extensive
   solution heat treatments of 2 and 4 h were performed prior to aging. (C)

Abstract = {{A meshless method is used to simulate free-surface fluid flows
   containing solid particles, motivated by the need to simulate river ice
   dynamics problems. A smoothed particle hydrodynamics model (SPH), with
   an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation for the fluid phase, is
   two-way coupled with the discrete element method (DEM) for the solid
   phase. Validation test cases include a bouncing sphere on a level
   surface, a collapse of a granular column, wedge entry into still water
   and solids of different densities falling into still water. The computed
   results using the SPH-DEM model agree quantitatively with the expected
   behaviour in the test cases. Numerical convergence is demonstrated for
   the wedge entry validation case. The SPH-DEM model is then used to
   simulate the stability of floating ice blocks approaching a stationary
   cover and ice accumulation upstream of an obstruction. The results show
   promise to serve as a useful quantitative engineering tool.}},

Abstract = {{Polyhemoglobin-superoxide dismutase-catalase-carbonic anhydrase
   (Poly-{[}Hb-SOD-CAT-CA]) contains all three major functions of red blood
   cells (RBCs) at an enhanced level. It transports oxygen, removes oxygen
   radicals and transports carbon dioxide. Our previous studies in a 90-min
   30mm Hg Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) sustained hemorrhagic shock rat
   model shows that it is more effective than blood in the lowering of
   elevated intracellular pCO(2), recovery of ST-elevation and histology of
   the heart and intestine. This paper is to analyze the storage and
   temperature stability. Allowable storage time for RBC is about 1 d at
   room temperature and 42 d at 4 degrees C. Also, RBC cannot be
   pasteurized to remove infective agents like HIV and Ebola. PolyHb can be
   heat sterilized and can be stored for 1 year even at room temperature.
   However, Poly-{[}Hb-SOD-CAT-CA] contains both Hb and enzymes and enzymes
   are particularly sensitive to storage and heat. We thus carried out
   studies to analyze its storage stability at different temperatures and
   heat pasteurization stability. Results of storage stability show that
   lyophilization extends the storage time to 1 year at 4 degrees C and 40d
   at room temperature (compared to respectively, 42 d and 1 d for RBC).
   After the freeze-dry process, the enzyme activities of
   Poly-{[}SFHb-SOD-CAT-CA] was 100 +/- 2\% for CA, 100 +/- 2\% for SOD and
   93 +/- 3.5\% for CAT. After heat pasteurization at 70 degrees C for 2 h,
   lyophilized Poly-{[}Hb-SOD-CAT-CA] retained good enzyme activities of CA
   97 +/- 4\%, SOD 100 +/- 2.5\% and CAT 63.8 +/- 4\%. More CAT can be
   added during the crosslinking process to maintain the same enzyme ratio
   after heat pasteurization. Heat pasteurization is possible only for the
   lyophilized form of Poly-{[}Hb-SOD-CAT-CA] and not for the solution. It
   can be easily reconstituted by dissolving in suitable solutions that
   continues to have good storage stability though less than that for the
   lyophilized form. According to the P50 value, Poly-{[}SFHb-SOD-CAT-CA]
   retains its oxygen carrying ability before and after long-term storage.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic waves arising from fault-slips induced by mining activities in
   underground mines can inflict severe damage to mine openings. Laboratory
   experiments on the cataclastic rock-flour found on surfaces of
   mining-induced faults have revealed that intense shock pulses can arise
   due to the unloading of fault surface asperities during fault-slip. This
   paper focuses on investigating the effect of fault surface asperities on
   the intensity of the seismic waves. Dynamic modelling of fault-slip with
   a mine-wide model has revealed that particle velocity of the rockmass
   can increase substantially when unloading takes place. It is concluded
   that considering the occurrence of locally intense seismic waves is
   indispensable for optimising secondary support systems.}},

Abstract = {{Gas drainage for the single and low gas permeability coal seam is the
   key technical problem hampering efficient coal mine gas drainage and
   without which mining safely cannot be realised in China. To solve this
   problem, this paper presents an engineering method for enhanced coalbed
   methane recovery based on high-pressure hydraulic flush from floor
   tunnels. The first step is to evaluate when the likelihood of coal and
   gas outburst reaches dangerous levels according to coal seam parameters
   (including coal seam gas contents, gas pressure, permeability and
   geological conditions). With these parameters in place, the second step
   is to determine and optimise borehole parameters, such as the effective
   influencing radius of hydraulic flush, hydraulic flush space between
   drills and borehole number to make sure that the coal seam stress is
   fully released and permeability is dramatically increased. What is also
   included in this step is the employment of a high-pressure hydraulic
   flush of coal from boreholes drilled from tunnels developed in the floor
   of the coal seam. Parameters of water pressure, water flow rate and the
   volume of coal flushed out are selected based on on-site testing and
   numerical modelling. Finally, numerical modelling and onsite testing are
   employed to validate the effects of enhanced coalbed methane recovery,
   which is whether or not coal and gas outburst danger is eliminated
   according to the national standards of China. The results show that the
   technology could improve the permeability of a coal seam and that the
   gas seepage coefficient was increased by about 10.50 times, the pre-gas
   drainage ratio was up to 35.5-70.4\% and the borehole gas drainage
   experienced a process of increase-steady-decrease, which delayed
   15-20days of the attenuation time.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a methodology to evaluate damage around
   underground openings due to seismic waves arising from mining-induced
   fault-slip is proposed. First, expressions for an associated flow rule
   with a failure criterion developed for biaxial stress conditions are
   derived, which are newly implemented into FLAC3D code. With the code,
   stope extraction is simulated using a 3D mine-wide model encompassing a
   fault running parallel to a steeply dipping orebody. The failure
   criterion for biaxial stress conditions is applied to only the rockmass
   in the vicinity of stopes within the hanging wall. After extracting
   stopes in the orebody, mining-induced fault-slip is simulated in dynamic
   conditions, considering its trigger mechanism, i.e., stress drop caused
   by instantaneous shearing of fault surface asperities, using Barton's
   shear strength model. Damage to the rockmass caused by seismic waves is
   then evaluated with the increase in plastic strain. The proposed
   methodology takes into account the mechanism of mining-induced
   fault-slip, propagation of seismic waves, biaxial stress conditions on
   the surface of openings, and plastic strain as damage criterion.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this parametric study is to quantify the effect of panel
   destressing on a steeply dipping remnant ore pillar. A large-scale
   destress blast program is simulated in the hanging wall of the ore
   pillar using the finite difference program FLAC3D. The simplified model
   consists of a 10MT ore pillar divided into 20 stopes on two levels. Two
   panels are destressed in the hanging wall to cover 8 stopes, followed by
   the mining of 4 stopes in the stress shadow in a retreat sequence. The
   varied parameters are the rock fragmentation factor (a) and stress
   reduction factor (beta) of the destress panel. The effect of panel
   destressing is evaluated based on the volume of ore at risk in the
   stress shadow as well as the sudden stress change in the stope caused by
   the destress blast. Overall, a successful blast with a realistic stress
   reduction factor and rock fragmentation factor reduces the major
   principal stress in the nearest stopes by 10 MPa to 25 MPa. This yields
   a reduction of ore at risk volume ranging from 8\% to 50\% in the stress
   shadow as the first 4 stopes are mined.}},

Abstract = {{Mine developments are the main access to extract tabular ore deposits in
   deep underground mines. Therefore, their stability is considered the
   principal priority during the mine production plan. The success of ore
   extraction mainly depends on the stability and serviceability of mine
   developments. Mine development instability is expensive and is a risk to
   personnel and equipment and in turn, it raises operational costs (e.g,
   repair costs, slashing, rehabilitation costs, costs of adding secondary
   support, miners wages and delay of production) (Ellefmo, and Eidsvik,
   2009; Abdellah et al. 2014a; 2014b; 2014c). This paper aims to develop a
   hybrid approach in which deterministic numerical modelling is integrated
   with probabilistic methods to estimate the probability of unsatisfactory
   performance (e.g. rating and ranking) associated with the instability of
   mine developments with respect to mining sequences adopting
   Rosenblueth's Point-Estimate Method (RPEM). A three-dimensional,
   elastoplastic, finite difference model (FLAC3D) is created (Itasca,
   2009). The results are presented and categorized with respect to the
   probability of instability and the mining stage.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the instability mechanism of an isolated pillar,
   caused by time-dependent skin degradation and strength heterogeneity.
   The time-dependent skin degradation is simulated with a non-linear
   rheological model capable of simulating tertiary creep. The inherent
   strength heterogeneity is realized with Weibull's distribution. The
   results obtained from the analysis show that pillar degradation is
   limited to the regions near the surface or the skin until two months
   after ore extraction, but afterwards degradation starts to extend deeper
   into the pillar, eventually leaving a highly stressed pillar core due to
   stress transfer from the failed rock regions. Rockburst potential
   indices show that the risk increases exponentially at the core as time
   goes by. It is then demonstrated that the progressive skin degradation
   cannot be simulated with the conventional strain-softening model
   assuming brittle failure. The parametric study with respect to the
   degree of heterogeneity reveals that heterogeneity is key to the
   occurrence of progressive skin degradation. Although the average UCS in
   the model with a high degree of heterogeneity is almost the same as that
   in the model with a low degree of heterogeneity, degradation of the
   rockmass extends deep into the pillar only when the pillar material is
   highly heterogeneous.}},

Abstract = {{Haulage drifts and related infrastructure are crucial to the success of
   underground mining operations. In the sublevel stoping mining method,
   they are developed well before any extraction commences in a given
   section of the orebody. One of the more complex design parameters is the
   relative distance of a haulage drift from the orebody as it runs
   parallel to its strike. Opposing considerations from operational and
   ground control teams need to be balanced, with the former preferring a
   shorter distance for increased productivity and the latter requesting a
   further distance for safety and stability. Numerical codes are one of
   the analytical tools used frequently in making these decisions by
   providing mining-induced stress and displacement magnitudes using a
   properly calibrated model. In this study, a simplified model is
   constructed of a typical tabular orebody within the geological settings
   of the Canadian Shield, striking East-West and dipping steeply to the
   south. Three other formations with the same strike and dip are added to
   the model, along with two intrusive dykes at variable distances from the
   orebody and the drift. The rockmass properties for all formations are
   obtained from a previous work on a case study mine in the Canadian
   Shield, and the model is calibrated based on in-situ stress measurements
   there. Two stope sequences comprising two simultaneous mining fronts are
   implemented and analyzed for the orebody; a diminishing pillar one that
   moves from both east and west to the middle, and a center-out option
   that moves from its center to the sides. In both cases, 24
   mine-andbackfill stages - comprising 6 stopes each - are needed to
   completely extract the orebody. A quantitative assessment of instability
   around the drifts, crosscuts, and stopes is conducted at each stage for
   a level at a depth of 1490 m. Two instability parameters - the brittle
   shear ratio (BSR) and a low compressive-tensile stress state - are
   combined with volumetric analysis to obtain the quantity of potentially
   unstable rockmass. The relative proximity of the drift and stopes to the
   dykes is evaluated and observed to have an impact on the results. A
   combined numerical-volumetric approach is found to provide a useful tool
   for comparing different sequences and obtaining information on the type,
   location, volume, and timing of rockmass instability.}},

Abstract = {{Many classification systems have been proposed in the literature to
   identify the state of stability of rock slopes. Most of these
   classification systems involve factors relevant to the general condition
   of the rock mass, for example, intact rock strength (UCS), geometry and
   condition of discontinuities, and groundwater condition. Such factors
   represent the basic part of most of the classification systems, which
   refer to the well-known Bieniawski's Rock Mass Rating or RMR system.
   However, these factors were initially developed for underground
   excavations. Therefore, these classification systems have been subjected
   to many criticisms and were questioned for their suitability for rock
   slopes.
   In this paper, some of the common classification systems for rock slopes
   are used to identify their suitability for rock cuts. Twenty two sites
   of rock cuts in mountainous roads affected by heavy rainfall in the
   southwestern part of Saudi Arabia have been selected as case studies,
   and four empirical methods are examined for these case studies. The
   selected methods are Slope Mass Rating or SMR (Romana, 1985), continuous
   SMR (Tomas, 2007), Chinese SMR (Chen, 1995), and a graphical SMR
   (Romana, 2012). The stability conditions for each site have been
   determined by each of these methods and a comparison between the results
   is made for the case of plane failure mode. It is shown that some of the
   empirical methods are not applicable such as Chinese SMR (for slopes
   less than 80 m high), and the graphical SMR method when the slope angle
   is more than 80 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Gravity-driven debris flow of granular particles down an inclined slope
   is a problem of growing concern in mountainous regions and poses a
   significant risk to people, roads, and other infrastructure. Different
   aspects of the problem have been previously investigated using physical
   modelling and numerical analysis. However, three dimensional pressure
   distribution on a barrier wall resulting from debris flow over a rough
   slope is scarce in the literature. In this study, a series of
   experiments are conducted to track the movement of granular particles
   down a slope and measure the impact pressure imposed by the flowing
   particles on a nearby vertical wall. The particles are released from a
   container located at the top of the slope and the velocity profiles are
   recorded using marked pebbles and a high-speed camera. The effect of the
   debris volume, slope angle, and distance to the wall on the velocity
   profiles and impact forces are investigated. Validated using the
   experimental results, discrete element simulationsare performed using
   PFC3D to evaluate the effect of particle sizes on the flow
   characteristics and final impact pressure on the structure. Analysis
   showed that impact energy is highly affected by the slope inclination,
   particle velocity, and runout distance.}},

Abstract = {{Operating in weak narrow vein mines presents many issues in terms of ore
   productivity. Maintaining stable mining excavations and limiting
   unplanned overbreak are some of the main concerns in narrow vein mining.
   The use of numerical modelling has become a popular method because it is
   capable of examining stress patterns and identifying rockmass failure.
   This paper will focus on creating a 3-dimensional constitutive numerical
   model for narrow vein mines that incorporate weak rockmass properties.

Abstract = {{Virtual Reality (VR) technology in mining is a new field of research.
   The successful application of VR to mining is critical to mine safety
   and production. Based on different input/output devices that are used in
   the VR system, the current VR mining system can be divided into three
   types: screen-based general system, projector-based customized system,
   and Head Mount Display (HMD)-based intuitive system. Based on a VR
   headset, a smartphone and a Leap Motion, an HMD-based intuitive VR
   training system was built and tested by 10 students who tried both the
   HMD-based system and a normal screen-based system to experience the
   difference between the two systems. The results showed that the
   HMD-based system can give a better user experience, and is easier to
   use. In the future, with the employment of more intuitive input devices
   and improved system software, the VR training system for mines could
   play a much more important role in mine training.}},

Abstract = {{The daily operations in the mining industry are still a significant
   source of risk with regard to occupational safety and health (OS\&H).
   Various research studies and statistical data world-wide show that the
   number of serious injuries and fatalities still remains high despite
   substantial efforts to decrease those numbers put in place by the
   industry in recent years. This paper argues that the next level of
   safety performance will have to consider a transition from coping solely
   with workplace dangers, to a more systemic model taking organizational
   risks into consideration. In this particular aspect, lessons learned
   from the nuclear industry may be useful, as organizational learning
   processes are more universal than the technology in which they are used.
   With the notable exception of major accidents, organizational
   performance has not received all the attention it deserves. A key
   element for reaching the next level of performance is to include
   organizational factors in low level events analyses, and approach
   management as a risk control system. These factors will then appear not
   only in event analysis, but also in supervision activities, audits,
   change management and the like. Many recent event analyses across
   various industries have shown that organizational factors play a key
   role in creating conditions for triggering major accidents (aviation,
   railway transportation, nuclear industry, oil exploitation, mining
   etc.). In the following paper, we will present a perspective that may be
   used in supervisory activities, self-assessments and minor events
   investigations. When ingrained in an organizational culture, this
   perspective has the highest potential for continuous safety improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Through the advancement of human-machine interactions in various fields,
   understanding beyond the technical components has become prominent.
   Traditional methods for analyzing human behavior in a work setting,
   which mostly centralize in identifying material and observable traits,
   don't seem to fit modern technology and systems used in various
   industries today. The concept of Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), in this
   regard, has gained interest in academic and business settings in the
   last few decades. A cognitive analysis expands the observation of
   worker's interactions to a more cognitive and behavioural level and sets
   a safety standard for a well-designed project. This research essentially
   aims to fully comprehend the five steps of CWA through the examination
   of cases and finally, seeks possible applications in the mining
   industry, where accidents due to human error are impactful. In this
   paper, an initial proposal of a CWA model for the mining industry is
   developed based on an existing model of quantifying human error in
   maintenance in various industries.}},

Abstract = {{By establishing model and experimental verification, this paper aims to
   improve the accuracy and applicability of gas diffusion mathematical
   models from coal particles in engineering applications. Firstly, based
   on Fick's second law and the continuity theory of gas diffusion in
   porous media, a new constitutive model for gas diffusion from
   non-homogeneous coal particles with three-layer pore structure is
   constructed by considering the difference of characteristics in pore
   structure between soft coal and hard coal. Then, the analytical solution
   is derived from the new model, that is, the quantitative relationship
   between gas diffusion rate (Qt/Q8) and diffusion time (t). The pore
   structure parameters of soft coal and hard coal from Juji coal mine are
   determined by using the mercury injection method. Gas desorption and
   diffusion rules of coal samples are numerically calculated and
   investigated by using physical simulation methods. Lastly, the
   applicability of the constitutive model is verified. The results show
   that the homogeneous model that is currently widely used only applies to
   the description of the gas diffusion process of the hard coal within the
   initial 10 minutes, while the new model can describe the gas diffusion
   law of different pore structure characteristics. The calculated results
   from the new model and the physical experimental results are nearly
   identical within the initial 30 minutes. The difference in the gas
   diffusion process between soft coal and hard coal can be effectively
   reflected by the parameters of pore structure in the new model.}},

Abstract = {{In underground coal mines, uncontrolled accumulation of methane and fine
   coal dust often leads to serious accidents such as explosions.
   Therefore, methane and dust dispersion in underground mines is closely
   monitored and strictly regulated. Accordingly, significant efforts have
   been devoted to study methane and dust dispersion in underground mines.
   In this study, methane emission and dust concentration are numerically
   investigated using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach.
   Various possible scenarios of underground mine configurations are
   evaluated. The results indicate that solitary existence of a continuous
   miner adversely affects the airflow and leads to increases in both
   methane and dust concentrations. Nevertheless, it is found that the
   negative effects of a continuous miner presence on concentrations can be
   minimized or even neutralized by operating the scrubber fan on suction
   mode. In addition, it was found that the combination of scrubber fan on
   suction mode and brattice results in the best performance of methane and
   dust removal from the mining face.}},

Abstract = {{The ground stability of gateroads is a major concern in underground coal
   mines, especially where the surrounding strata are weak and fractured.
   This paper presents a novel numerical modelling technique for gateroad
   stability analysis based on a case study conducted in Zhaogu No. 2 mine,
   China. Considering the occurrence of fractures and its weakening effect
   on the stiffness of rock mass, a tension-weakening model is implemented
   into FLAC3D, whereby the stiffness of rock mass is progressively
   decreased according to failure state. A relationship between the
   intensity of fractures and the residual properties is built. A
   parametric study of the tension-weakening model with respect to
   weakening parameter is carried out, and the results are compared to
   perfect elasto-plastic model and strain-softening model. The comparison
   shows that the tension-weakening model exhibits a noticeable effect on
   ground deformation and rock support loading, and can simulate more
   realistic behavior of a gateroad. The proposed model provides a rigorous
   approach for gateroad stability analysis and can be utilized for rock
   reinforcement design under similar geotechnical circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{As the complexity of radio frequency circuits increases, the generation
   of macromodels for circuit blocks that can be used in system simulations
   has become increasingly useful and even necessary. Recently
   X-parameters(1) have been proposed as an extension to the concept of
   S-Parameters in order to create a macromodel that captures some of the
   key nonlinearities in the circuit. In this paper, an efficient
   semi-analytical approach for the computation of X-parameters is
   presented. More specifically, a clear relation between the X-parameters
   and the circuit moments is developed, which in turn facilitates the
   application of moments to further improve the efficiency of X-parameter
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{In Canada, Montreal is the second city with the highest seismic risk.
   This is due to its relatively high seismic hazard, old infrastructures
   and high population density. The region is characterised by moderate
   seismic activity with no recent record of a major earthquake. The lack
   of historical strong ground motion records for the region contributes to
   large uncertainties in the estimation of hazards. Among the sources of
   uncertainty, the attenuation function is the main contributor and its
   effect on estimates of risks is investigated. Epistemic uncertainty was
   considered by obtaining damage estimates for three attenuation functions
   that were developed for Eastern North America. The results indicate that
   loss estimates are highly sensitive to the choice of the attenuation
   function and suggest that epistemic uncertainty should be considered
   both for the definition of the hazard function and in loss estimation
   methodologies. Seismic loss estimates are performed for a 2\% in 50
   years seismic threat, which corresponds to the design level earthquake
   in the national building code of Canada, using HAZUS-MH4 for the
   Montreal region over 522 census tracts. The study estimated that for the
   average scenario roughly 5\% of the building stock would be damaged with
   direct economic losses evaluated at 1.4 billion dollars for such a
   scenario. The maximum number of casualties would result in approximately
   500 people being injured or dead at a calculated time of occurrence of 2
   pm.}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes are a new class of block codes with an explicit construction
   that provably achieve the capacity of various communications channels,
   even with the low-complexity successive-cancellation (SC) decoding
   algorithm. Yet, the more complex successive-cancellation list (SCL)
   decoding algorithm is gathering more attention lately as it
   significantly improves the error-correction performance of short-to
   moderate-length polar codes, especially when they are concatenated with
   a cyclic redundancy check code. However, as SCL decoding explores
   several decoding paths, existing hardware implementations tend to be
   significantly slower than SC-based decoders. In this paper, we show how
   the unrolling technique, which has already been used in the context of
   SC decoding, can be adapted to SCL decoding yielding a multi-Gbps
   SCL-based polar decoder with an error-correction performance that is
   competitive when compared to an LDPC code of similar length and rate.
   Post-place-androute ASIC results for 28 nm CMOS are provided showing
   that this decoder can sustain a throughput greater than 10 Gbps at 468
   MHz with an energy efficiency of 7.25 pJ/bit.}},

   Design for Inertial Sensors (MIDIS) process developed by Teledyne DALSA
   Semiconductor Inc. (TDSI). The Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
   resonator is designed to operate with an ultra-low DC polarization
   voltage, as low as 1V, and low motional resistance. This is achieved by
   using a transduction gap reduction technique based on electrostatic
   deflection of movable electrode and subsequent localized melting of
   welding pads. A transimpedance operational amplifier is used as
   sustaining amplifier to help with continuous oscillation. The oscillator
   operates with an average power consumption of 1.86 mW that is suitable

   transmit at all. The estimator estimates the Markov process based on the
   transmitted observations. In such a system, there is a trade-off between
   communication cost and estimation accuracy. Two fundamental limits of
   this trade-off are characterized for infinite horizon discounted cost
   and average cost setups. First, when each transmission is costly, we
   characterize the minimum achievable cost of communication plus
   estimation error. Second, when there is a constraint on the average
   number of transmissions, we characterize the minimum achievable
   estimation error. Transmission and estimation strategies that achieve
   these fundamental limits are also identified.}},

Abstract = {{There are challenges for image cancer nuclei segmentation in clinical
   decision support systems for brain tumor diagnosis. In this study, we
   propose a method for segmentation of cancer nuclei when such conflicts
   of cancer nuclei involve `omics' indicative of brain tumors
   pathologically. To constrain the problem space in the region of color
   information (i.e. cancer nuclei), we begin by converting the images into
   the V component of HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) using the level-set
   segmentation (VLS) in the training stage, follow by applying the
   sparsity representation (SR) in the test stage. Via the SR, the proposed
   VLS-SR would exhibits an improved capability of searching recursively
   for the optimal threshold level-set in the working subsets of the SR for
   image cancer nuclei segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Goal-oriented analysis allows performing trade-off analysis among
   competing solutions to a problem by determining which proposed solution
   strikes a more appropriate balance of stakeholder objectives and desired
   qualities of a system. Standard language definitions of common
   goal-oriented languages such as i{*}, the Goal-oriented Requirement
   Language (GRL), the NFR Framework, and KAOS offer varying support for
   such analysis. In most cases, however, the analysis is essentially
   confined to one snapshot in time. While several goal models may be
   created that represent different stages of a system, the current
   language definitions do not allow these models to be connected and make
   it difficult to analyze them simultaneously. Furthermore, many model
   elements need to be repeated in the models of the various stages,
   causing problems when these models need to be evolved consistently. This
   paper introduces TimedGRL, an extension of the GRL standard, which
   enables the modeling and analysis of a comprehensive set of changes to a
   goal model over time. The goal model and the changes to the goal model
   are captured in one model, which eases system evolution. The metamodel
   for TimedGRL is presented and an analysis algorithm for TimedGRL models
   is defined. The usefulness of TimedGRL is illustrated with an example
   from the sustainability domain.}},

Abstract = {{Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) aims to describe a system with the help
   of a series of models. More abstract models are refined into more
   concrete models by model transformations that ensure that the
   information from higher-level models is retained in lower-level models.
   This reduces the effort required to build lower-level models. The
   quality of lower-level models is also improved because they are partly
   based on well-tested model transformations. A key prerequisite for MDE
   is the definition of formal modeling languages, for which metamodeling
   is typically used. Formally defined modeling languages capture an
   evergrowing number of aspects of the software development process from
   requirements to architecture, design, and implementation details. A
   commonly held sentiment in the requirements modeling community is that
   requirements elicitation techniques have received less attention in
   terms of MDE. We perform a systematic literature review to either refute
   or confirm this sentiment by exploring the use of metamodels in papers
   on five well-known elicitation techniques: Cognitive Work Analysis,
   Complex Adaptive Systems Theory, Contextual Inquiry and Design,
   Distributed Cognition, and Emergent Knowledge Process design. The result
   of the survey indicates -within the limitations of the survey -that
   there is very little research applying metamodeling to the definition of
   these elicitation techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Kinesthetic haptic applications employ force feedback on top of graphic
   and sound modalities to enable the human operator to interact with
   objects within a virtual world. The force feedback sensation, in
   particular, is created by a haptic device that displays the forces
   arising from this interaction. These forces must accurately emulate a
   real contact interaction, an objective which is commonly referred to as
   high-fidelity force feedback rendering. To achieve this, the current
   paper proposes a constrained-based rendering using a virtual tool that
   comes into unilateral contact with the virtual objects. Unlike common
   quasi-static or quasi-dynamic formulations in the haptics literature, a
   truly dynamic physical interaction between the virtual tool and the
   objects is modeled here. The paper develops analytical formulations for
   a canonical problem including colliding contact, sustained contact, slip
   and stick friction. Initial simulation and experimental evaluations show
   the potential of this method for handling complicated contact scenarios
   such as those encountered in haptic simulations of spinal or dental
   surgeries.}},

   under both transmission rate and energy harvesting (EH) constraints. An
   iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization and with
   guaranteed monotonic convergence is proposed to successively optimize
   the transceiver coefficients. The algorithm consists of three main
   steps, aimed at successively optimizing: 1) the power splitting (PS)
   vectors of the EH nodes; 2) the receive beamforming vectors; 3) the
   transmit beamforming vectors. The first step is carried out based on
   concave-convex procedure (CCCP), the second step is based on the minimum
   mean square error (MMSE) criterion and the third step resorts to using
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulation results are presented to
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.(1)}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two self-interference (SI) cancellation methods
   using active signal injection (ASI) for full-duplex MIMO-OFDM systems.
   Specifically, the ASI approach considers adding an appropriate
   cancelling signal to the transmitted signal to reduce the SI at the
   receiver input to avoid overloading the receiver low-noise amplifier
   (LNA) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) while ensuring proper signal
   detection. In the first method, the cancelling signal uses some reserved
   subcarriers that are not used for data transmission. In the second
   method, the constellation points are dynamically extended within the
   cancellation boundary in order to minimize the SI. The proposed
   techniques appear to be simple to implement and do not require any
   change on the receiver structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes hybrid TDMA-CSMA for virtualized wireless networks,
   aiming to meet their isolation requirements. In this scheme, high-load
   users with non-empty queues are proper and potential candidates for
   TDMA, while others can compete using p-persistent CSMA. At each
   superframe, AP decides on TDMA-CSMA scheduling by taking into account
   traffic parameters of users and slice reservations to maximize the
   network utilization, while maintaining slice isolation. The
   corresponding optimization problem is formulated to dynamically schedule
   users for TDMA phase and optimally pick p parameter for remaining CSMA
   users. Using complementary geometric programming (CGP) and monomial
   approximations, an iterative algorithm is developed to find the optimal
   solution. The simulation results reveal the performance gains of the
   proposed algorithm in improving the throughput and keeping isolation in
   a virtualized wireless network.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a prototype implementation and experimental
   performance evaluation of compress-and-forward (CF) relaying using
   software-defined radios. Under QPSK transmissions from all nodes, the
   relay demodulates the received signal before applying distributed joint
   source-channel coding (DJSCC) implemented with the help of an
   off-the-shelf convolutional code. The destination employs two stages of
   standard BCJR decoding; a DJSCC decoding stage for the relay's
   demodulated data followed by another to recover the source's message.
   Under varying channel conditions, we propose and implement an
   opportunistic Decode-or-Compress-and-Forward (DoCF) relaying strategy in
   which the relay forwards the decoded packet if a cyclic redundancy check
   (CRC) is satisfied, and uses CF relaying otherwise. The prototype
   implementation of DoCF is carried out using National Instruments USRP
   2921 devices. Over-the-air experiments in an indoor office environment
   indicate that the proposed DoCF strategy can achieve up to ten times
   smaller bit-error-rate than a standard DF implementation. To the best of
   our knowledge, this work is the first in the literature to carry out an
   experimental study of CF relaying.}},

Abstract = {{Relay technique is introduced in the Long Term Evolution Advanced
   (LTE-Advanced) system to extend the network coverage, improve the
   performance of cell-edge user equipments (UEs) and increase the fairness
   among different UEs. The combination of multiple-input-multiple-output
   (MIMO) and relay can further increase frequency efficiency and improve
   system performance. In this paper, based on the architecture of MIMO
   relay-enhanced TD-LTE-Advanced system, a fairness-aware resource
   allocation algorithm is proposed, and the resource allocation is divided
   into 3 phases: a frequency resource partition scheme is firstly proposed
   to realize the tradeoff between fairness among UEs served by various
   relay nodes (RNs) and system throughput; secondly, a backhaul resource
   allocation algorithm is presented to match the eNB to relay transmission
   with the relay to UE transmission with reduced feedback overhead;
   finally, a resource allocation algorithm from eNB and relay to UEs is
   given to maximize the proportional fairness so that user fairness can be
   guaranteed. Simulation results show that both system throughput and user
   fairness can be improved with limited feedback overhead, using the
   proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Jointly detecting signals from the source and relay in a multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) relaying system can achieve lower symbol error
   probability (SEP) and higher diversity order. In the literature, the
   best detector for spatial multiplexing decode-and-forward (DF) MIMO
   relaying systems is the near maximum likelihood (NML) decoder. However,
   both NML decoder and its variation are computationally intensive,
   especially when high-order modulations and multiple data streams are
   adopted. In order to develop a more efficient detection scheme, we
   propose a weighted combining (WC) algorithm which is applied before the
   final detector. The proposed algorithm merges the signal vectors from
   the source and relay without expanding their dimension and formulates an
   equivalent MIMO channel matrix for the combined signal, resulting in a
   much lower complexity for the subsequent detection. Simulation results
   show that by using the proposed WC algorithm with the ML detector, the
   same diversity gain as that of the more complex NML detection scheme can
   be achieved. In particular, in a symmetric network topology, the
   performance of the proposed WC algorithm is comparable to that of NML.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computationally efficient beamforming approach to
   combat wiretapping in a relay-based multiple-input multiple output
   (MIMO) communication system which is part of a cognitive radio (CR)
   network. The system operates in two stages, that is, multiple-access
   (MA) followed by broadcasting (BC) using physical layer network coding
   (PNC). The beamforming design is based on minimizing the mean square
   error (MSE) at the receiving node(s) while enforcing
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the
   eavesdroppers. The constraints take into account uncertainty bounds on
   eavesdropper channel estimation errors. In each stage of communication,
   an optimization problem is devised and solved using an iterative
   procedure, considering two different types of eavesdropper
   functionality, i.e., selection combining and ``blind{''} beamforming.
   Numerical results show the convergence of the MSE at the nodes and the
   SINR distributions at the eavesdroppers for both cases. Comparisons to
   previously suggested solutions for blind beamforming are also included
   showing improvements in MSE values in the MA stage and computational
   efficiency in both stages.}},

   reserved rate is considered for each slice for guaranteeing their
   isolation. The formulated resource allocation problem aiming to minimize
   the total transmit power subject to the isolation constraints is
   non-convex and suffers from high computational complexity. By applying
   complementary geometric programming (CGP) to convert the non-convex
   problem into the convex form, we develop an efficient iterative approach
   with low computational complexity to solve the proposed problem.
   Illustrative simulation results on the performance evaluation of VWN

Abstract = {{Wireless cellular networks aim to operate efficiently in low and high
   SINR regions while maximizing the overall network capacity.
   Nevertheless, achieving high capacity in all regions is opposed to being
   fair with all mobile devices. i.e., it is well known that, due to the
   nature of wireless communications, the effective channel capacity at the
   cell edge is significantly smaller than at the cell center. We consider
   a wireless cellular network where mobile devices have multiple network
   interfaces and are capable to relay traffic. In this paper we
   investigate: 1) How the use of a mobile device as a relay can improve
   the traffic fairness, 2) How to maximize the overall network capacity,
   and 3) How to devise the best relay selection strategy. We propose a
   greedy algorithm that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by
   appropriately selecting the mobile devices that will act as relays. Our
   simulation results indicate that using mobile devices as relays not only
   helps to improve the Jain's fairness by around 8\% but also increases
   the average network capacity by 20\% while reducing the transmission
   power consumption by 80\%.}},

Abstract = {{Condition monitoring is essential to electrical power networks. A
   real-time measurement of equipment operating conditions can reduce
   maintenance cost and improve supplies reliability. However, the
   installation cost for wiring monitoring sensors on high voltage (HV)
   devices can be very high. Providing an autonomous wireless sensor
   network (WSN) can reduce the installation cost and make the monitoring
   sensors more accessible in a substation environment. In this work, we
   study an autonomous WSN in a substation area, using energy harvesting
   and wireless transfer of energy. In our model energy is first scavenged
   from the available electric field around high voltage devices and then
   will be transferred to the sensor by radiating radio frequency (RF)
   signals. This paper only considers one sensor scenario. However, the
   method that is proposed here can be generalized to multiple sensors as a
   future work.}},

   and the target is kept stationary. An ARtag fiducial marker system is
   used for position based visual servoing control with a glideslope
   guidance algorithm for soft docking. The physical docking of the
   Tryphons is achieved through contact of the protruder and receiver ends
   of the two electromagnetic docking mechanisms. Simulations of the

Abstract = {{In the remote estimation system, a transmitter observes a discrete-time
   symmetric countable state Markov process and decides to either transmit
   the current state of the Markov process or not transmit. The transmitted
   packet gets dropped in the communication channel with a probability e.
   An estimator estimates the Markov process based on the received
   observations. When each transmission is costly, we characterize the
   minimum achievable cost of communication plus estimation error. When
   there is a constraint on the average number of transmissions, we
   characterize the minimum achievable estimation error. Transmission and
   estimation strategies that achieve these fundamental limits are also
   identified. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Abstract = {{Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication has the potential to improve road
   safety significantly by providing connectivity between vehicles to
   exchange information messages. V2V has recently gained considerable
   attention in part due to the standardization work that has started for
   Long Term Evolution (LTE) under the Third Generation Partnership Project
   (3GPP). Efficient and reliable distributed allocation of time-frequency
   resources among different vehicle user equipments (VUEs) remains a
   challenge particularly in dense urban environments. In this work, a new
   autonomous resource selection scheme for urban V2V communication
   scenario is proposed. Specifically, the proposed scheme relies on
   resource partitioning based on VUE heading direction along with a
   sensing-based collision avoidance mechanism, which aims to alleviate the
   potential interference between VUEs due to resource collision and
   in-band emission (IBE). The performance of the two-stage autonomous
   resource selection scheme is evaluated by system-level simulations in
   urban scenarios, where the results show a significant performance gain
   in comparison to existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, microwave breast cancer detection has
   attracted an increasing amount of research attention and various
   research groups have recently commenced clinical testing. Much of the
   past assessment of algorithms and hardware has relied on breast
   phantoms. We illustrate in this paper through experimental data
   collected with breast phantoms that classification with breast phantoms
   can be a much easier task than that with clinical trial data (with
   numerically-simulated tumour responses). One antenna pair is sufficient
   to achieve almost perfect classification on the phantom data but has
   little success with the clinical trial data. The results demonstrate
   that we should exercise caution when evaluating classifier performance
   based solely on breast phantoms, and highlight the importance of
   validating microwave breast cancer detection algorithms with clinical
   trial data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the down-link dynamic resource allocation in
   multi-cell virtualized wireless networks (VWNs) to support the users of
   different service providers (slices) within a specific region by a set
   of base stations (BSs) through orthogonal frequency division multiple
   access (01-DMA). In particular, we develop a joint BS assignment,
   sub-carrier, and power allocation algorithm to maximize the network sum
   rate, while satisfying the minimum required rate of each slice. Under
   the assumption that each user at each transmission instance can connect
   to no more than one BS, we introduce the user-association factor to
   represent the joint sub-carrier and BS assignment as the optimization
   variable vector in the problem formulation. Sub-carrier reuse is allowed
   in different cells, but not within one cell. As the proposed
   optimization problem is inherently non-convex and NP-hard, by applying
   the successive convex approximation (SCA) and complementary geometric
   programming (CGP), we develop an efficient two-step iterative approach
   with low computational complexity to solve the proposed problem. For a
   given problem, Step 1 derives the optimum user-association and
   subsequently, and for an obtained user-association, Step 2 finds the
   optimum power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed iterative algorithm outperforms the traditional approach in
   which each user is assigned to the BS with the largest average value of
   signal strength, and then, joint sub-carrier and power allocation is
   obtained for the assigned users of each cell. Simulation results reveal
   a coverage improvement, offered by the proposed approach, of 57\% and
   71\% for uniform and non-uniform users distribution, respectively,
   leading to higher spectrum efficiency for VWN.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic relationship between surface EMG (sEMG) and torque can be
   estimated from data acquired while subjects voluntarily modulate joint
   torque. We have shown that for such data, the input (EMG) contains a
   feedback component from the output (torque) and so accurate estimates of
   the dynamics require the use of closed-loop identification algorithms.
   Moreover, this approach has several other limitations since the input is
   controlled indirectly and so the frequency content and signal-to-noise
   ratio cannot be controlled. This paper investigates how these factors
   influence the accuracy of estimates. This was studied using experimental
   sEMG recorded from healthy human subjects for tasks with different
   modulation rates. Box-Jenkin (BJ) method was used for identification.
   Results showed that input frequency content had little effect on
   estimates of gain and natural frequency but had strong effect on damping
   factor estimates. It was demonstrated that to accurately estimate the
   damping factor, the command signal switching rate must be less than 2s.
   It was also shown that random errors increased with noise level but was
   limited to 10\% of the parameters true value for highest noise level
   tested. To summarize, simulation study of this work showed that
   voluntary modulation paradigm can accurately identify sEMG-torque
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Ankle joint stiffness, the dynamic relationship between the joint angle
   and the torque acting about it, plays an important role in the control
   of upright stance. In order to identify the contribution of ankle joint
   stiffness to stance control, ankle joint must be perturbed externally.
   One way to do this is to displace the foot that will cause shank
   movement. For identification, the ankle angle must be measured with high
   accuracy, for which we need to measure both foot and shank angles.
   However, most motion capture systems do not have the resolution and
   accuracy needed to measure the small ankle joint movements that occur
   during stance. This paper describes a method for the high resolution
   measurement of ankle angle during standing that uses a laser range
   finder to track linear displacements, which is then used to compute
   shank angle with respect to the vertical. A theoretical analysis of
   different possible measurement configurations demonstrated that
   measurements of horizontal shank movement would provide the optimal
   resolution; a range finder with a linear resolution of 25 micros would
   provide an angle resolution better than 0.01 degree. We built a
   measurement system using this configuration and performed static and
   dynamic experiments that demonstrated angle measurements with a
   resolution of less than 0.01 degree, which outperforms other motion
   capture systems, such as IMUs, whose resolution is in the order of one
   degree. Utility of the method was then demonstrated by using it to
   measure shank ankle during quiet and perturbed stance. The results
   confirmed that the method tracks small shank movements during both quiet
   and perturbed conditions. Estimated shank angle then was used with the
   foot angle, measured with a potentiometer to obtain the ankle joint
   angle, needed to identify the joint stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound is a viable imaging technology in remote and
   resources-limited areas. Ultrasonography is a user-dependent skill which
   depends on a high degree of training and hands-on experience. However,
   there is a limited number of skillful sonographers located in remote
   areas. In this work, we aim to develop a real-time video streaming
   platform which allows specialist physicians to remotely monitor
   ultrasound exams. To this end, an ultrasound stream is captured and
   transmitted through a wireless network into remote computers,
   smart-phones and tablets. In addition, the system is equipped with a
   camera to track the position of the ultrasound probe. The main advantage
   of our work is using an open source platform for video streaming which
   gives us more control over streaming parameters than the available
   commercial products. The transmission delays of the system are evaluated
   for several ultrasound video resolutions and the results show that
   ultrasound videos close to the high-definition (HD) resolution can be
   received and displayed on an Android tablet with the delay of 0.5
   seconds which is acceptable for accurate real-time diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a distributed coordination mechanism which enables nodes in a
   directed graph to accurately estimate their eigenvector centrality
   (eigencentrality) even if they update their values at times determined
   by their own clocks. The clocks need neither be synchronized nor have
   the same speed. The main idea is to let nodes adjust the weights on
   outgoing links to compensate for their update speed: the higher the
   update frequency, the smaller the link weights.
   Our mechanism is used to develop a distributed algorithm for computing
   the PageRank vector, commonly used to assign importance to web pages and
   rank search results. Although several distributed approaches in the
   literature can deal with asynchronism, they cannot handle the different
   update speeds that occur when servers have heterogeneous computational
   capabilities. When existing algorithms are executed using heterogeneous
   update speeds, they compute incorrect PageRank values. The advantages of
   our algorithm over existing approaches are verified through illustrative
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{Partially observed Mean Field Game (PO MFG) theory was introduced and
   developed in (Caines and Kizilkale, 2013, 2014, Sen and Caines 2014,
   2015), where it is assumed the major agent's state is partially observed
   by each minor agent, and the major agent completely observes its own
   state. Accordingly, each minor agent can recursively estimate the major
   agent's state, compute the system's mean field and thence generate the
   feedback control which yields the epsilon-Nash property. This PO MM LQG
   MFG theory was further extended in recent work (Firoozi and Caines,
   2015) to major-minor LQG systems in which both the major agent and the
   minor agents partially observe the major agent's state. The existence of
   epsilon-Nash equilibria, together with the individual agents' control
   laws yielding the equilibria, were established wherein each minor agent
   recursively generates (i) an estimate of the major agent's state, and
   (ii) an estimate of the major agent's estimate of its own state (in
   order to estimate the major agent's control feedback), and hence
   generates a version of the system's mean field. In the current work, PO
   MM LQG MFG theory is applied to the optimal execution problem in the
   financial sector where an institutional investor, interpreted as a major
   agent, has partial observations of its own inventories, and high
   frequency traders (HFTs), interpreted as minor agents, have partial
   observations of the major agent's inventories. The objective for each
   agent is to maximize its own wealth and to avoid the occurrence of large
   execution prices, large rates of trading and large trading accelerations
   which are appropriately weighted in the agent's performance function. PO
   LQG MFG theory is utilized to establish the existence of epsilon-Nash
   equilibria and a simulation example is provided.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear deterministic attitude estimator is developed. The estimator
   evolves directly on the special orthogonal group of rigid-body
   rotations. Similar estimators in the literature are characterized by
   constant estimator gains that amplify noise across all frequencies. The
   proposed method accounts for undesirable noise in exteroceptive
   measurements by incorporating a strictly positive real (SPR) filter in
   the estimator structure. By tuning the ``embedded{''} SPR filter over a
   frequency bandwidth undesirable noise corrupting exteroceptive
   measurements may be rejected. Rate-gyro bias estimation is also
   considered. The proposed attitude estimator is shown to asymptotically
   converge to the desired equilibrium point (i.e., when the estimated
   attitude and bias are equal to their true counterparts), provided a
   restriction on the set of initial conditions is satisfied. Moreover,
   exponential convergence is shown in a certain region about the desired
   equilibrium point. The proposed method is demonstrated in simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Subject to reasonable conditions, in large population stochastic
   dynamics games where the agents are coupled by the system's mean field
   through their nonlinear dynamics and cost functions, it can be shown
   that a best response control action for each agent exists which (i)
   depends only upon the individual agent's state observations and the mean
   field, and (ii) achieves an-Nash equilibrium for the system. In this
   work we formulate a class of problems where each agent has only partial
   observations on its individual state. The main result is that the -Nash
   equilibrium property holds where the best response control action of
   each agent depends upon the conditional density of its own state
   generated by a nonlinear filter, together with the system's mean field.
   Finally, it is worthwhile comparing this MFG state estimation problem to
   one found in the literature where there exists a major agent whose
   partially observed state process is independent of the control action of
   any individual agent; by contrast, in this work, the partially observed
   state process of any agent depends upon that agent's control action.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the vulnerability of relay-assisted communications, improving
   wireless security from a physical layer signal processing perspective is
   attracting increasing interest. Hence, we address the problem of secure
   transmission in a relay-assisted network, where a pair of legitimate
   user equipments (UEs) communicate with the aid of a multiple-input
   multiple output (MIMO) relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers
   (eves). Assuming imperfect knowledge of the eves' channels, we jointly
   optimize the power of the source UE, the amplify-and-forward relaying
   matrix, and the covariance of the artificial noise transmitted by the
   relay, in order to maximize the received
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the destination, while
   imposing a set of robust secrecy constraints. To tackle the resultant
   non-convex optimization problem with tractable complexity, a new
   penalized difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is proposed, which is
   specifically designed for solving a class of non-convex semidefinite
   programs. We show how this penalized DC framework can be invoked for
   solving our robust secure relaying problem with proven convergence. In
   addition, to benchmark the proposed algorithm, we subsequently propose a
   semidefinite relaxation-based exhaustive search approach, which yields
   an upper bound of the secure relaying problem, however, with
   significantly higher complexity. Our simulation results show that the
   proposed solution is capable of ensuring the secrecy of the relay-aided
   transmission and significantly improving the robustness toward the eves'
   channel uncertainties as compared with the non-robust counterparts. It
   is also demonstrated the penalized DC-based method advocated yields a
   performance close to the upper bound.}},

Abstract = {{In order to predict the exact amount of maximum surface settlement
   value, this paper presents a method to predict ground movement above
   tunnels with random forests (RF). Surface settlement above a tunnel due
   to a tunnel construction is predicted with the help of input variables
   that have direct physical significance. The RF-based model is developed
   by free R programs, trained and tested with parameters obtained from the
   detailed investigation of different tunnel projects published in
   literature. The maximum settlement is taken as a function of tunnel
   diameter, depth to the tunnel axis, cohesion, internal friction angle,
   compressibility modulus of soil, grouting pressure, percent tail voild
   grout filling, thrust force and advance rate for shield tunneling. A
   repeated 5-fold cross-validation procedure (10 repeats) is implemented
   to determine the optimal parameter values during modeling and an
   external testing set is employed to validate the prediction performance
   of models. Two performance measures namely R-2 and RMSE have been
   employed. The RF demonstrated a promising result and predicted the
   desired goal fairly successfully.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a decision support tool (SDEXRAIN) for assessing the
   climate change impacts on extreme rainfall processes at a given
   location. More specifically, the SDEXRAIN consists of two components:
   (i) a spatial statistical downscaling model to describe the linkage
   between global climate variables and daily annual maximum rainfalls at a
   given site; and (ii) a temporal statistical downscaling model to
   describe the relations between daily and sub-daily annual maximum
   rainfalls. Results of a numerical application of this tool using NCEP
   re-analysis and observed precipitation data available at two locations
   with completely different climatic conditions (Seoul station in South
   Korea and Dorval station in Canada) have indicated that the proposed
   SDEXRAIN could accurately describe the relations between global climate
   predictors and daily and sub-daily annual maximum rainfalls at a given
   site. Hence, this tool can be used for assessing the climate change
   impacts on extreme rainfalls at a location of interest.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an efficient approach which explores and finds the

   motor in the transient, rated and flux weakening operations is proposed.
   The permanent magnet flux linkage and the saliency ratio are
   analytically formulated as the functions of the motor dimensions by
   means of the magnetic equivalent circuit theory and used to identify the
   best operating regions of the starting torque, the rated efficiency and
   the characteristic current. It is shown that the mentioned objectives
   possess a pretty smooth and monotonic variation if they are expressed
   versus the flux linkage and the saliency ratio. Therefore, the optimum
   pareto fronts could be efficiently identified. The proposed method
   provides a very significant improvement for accelerating performance of
   optimizations since the computationbased constraint handling process is
   replaced by an analytical alternative.}},

Abstract = {{This work provides new magnetic and electrical design guidelines for an

   the electric and magnetic loadings are targeted to address the issues

   A set of new constraints are also introduced in terms of the magnetic,
   electrical and thermal limits of a field oriented controlled permanent
   magnet motor to highlight the corresponding design challenges. Moreover,
   the demagnetization proximity limit is incorporated to ensure a reliable
   and safe operation of the permanent magnet material. The results show
   that the magnetic and electrical requirements of an efficient integrated
   system are totally different from the efficient performances of either
   side of the system, the motor or the inverter. Finally, considering a
   proper efficiency/reliability trade-off, an optimally designed
   integrated system is proposed with the goal of reducing the torque
   ripple and the system cost.}},

Abstract = {{The Jiles-Atherton (JA) model is a physics-based model which translates
   into a simple first order differential equation with five material
   constants known as the JA parameters. However, JA parameters identified
   from the saturated B-H loop cannot predict the inner loops accurately
   which poses a major hindrance for its use in the Finite Element (FE)
   based simulations. In this work, we have proposed a new approach which
   assumes one of the JA parameters to be a function of magnetic field
   intensity H or magnetic flux density B and requires the knowledge of
   inner loops. The improvement in the accuracy of the modified JA model
   has been demonstrated by comparing its predictions with the measurements
   and one of the already published works.}},

   imaging (SPRi) has become one of the most widely used label-free method
   for fast and sensitive detection of chemical and biological analytes on

   problem. The problem is considered to be a variant of the well-known
   Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), namely, Minimum-Time Multidepot
   multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (MTMmTSP). The distinguishing
   features of the proposed problem statement is that first of all the
   initial depots and their corresponding assigned number of robots are not

   travel time of robots as opposed to the travel distance or waiting time

Abstract = {{In the standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) and nonlinear Mean Field
   Game (MFG) models the agents are coupled through their dynamics and cost
   functions; subject to reasonable conditions, it may be shown that a best
   response control action for each agent exists which (i) depends only
   upon individual agent state observations and the distribution of the
   generic agent, namely the systems mean field, and (ii) achieves an
   epsilon-Nash equilibrium for the system. In this work MFG systems are
   considered where each agent has only noisy observations of its
   individual state. The LQG case of this problem is already analyzed in
   the literature. Here we consider the situation where the dynamics and
   the cost functions are nonlinear and we employ nonlinear filtering
   theory and the Separation Principle in order to analyze the game in the
   asymptotically infinite population limit.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers dynamic modeling and control of a flexible
   kiteplane used for wind-energy harvesting. Each component of the
   kiteplane is modeled separately and is then constrained to the other
   components using the null-space method. The flexible wings are modeled
   as thin plates with bending and torsional stiffness. An unsteady
   aerodynamic model is included to increase the fidelity of the simulation
   under transient conditions. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
   attitude control law is implemented that uses the direction cosine
   matrix (DCM) directly and proportional-integral (PI) control is used to
   track a desired tether reel-in rate. Numerical simulation of the
   closed-loop system demonstrate the kiteplane's ability to harvest wind
   energy.}},

   bandwidth for spacebased pointing systems via the application of mu-tip
   control, a passivity-based control methodology. First, the equations of
   motion of a pointing system are derived. Then, using a ``massive payload
   assumption{''} a passive input-output map is established between a
   modified output, called the mu-tip rate, and a modified control input.
   Bandwidth recovery is confirmed by investigating the frequency response
   of the linearized system. Simulation results that demonstrate the
   performance of the developed control algorithm are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging additive manufacturing (AM) technology works in a
   layer-wise fashion which makes it possible to manipulate material
   distribution and composition. The resulting effects are reflected on the
   potential of innovative shape design, consolidated assembly, optimized
   topology, and functionally graded material. These new characteristics
   force designers to rethink about how to make a better engineering
   design. However, existing design theory and methodology cannot take
   these potentials provided by AM into account. To fill this void, various
   design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) approaches are reported.
   Unfortunately, majority of them focused on part level redesign without
   potential of being extended to assembly level applications. In order to
   shed a light into this emerging field, an overview of current
   assembly-level DFAM is summarized in this paper. After that, existing
   issues including the absent analysis of AM's impact on conceptual
   design, the lack of explicit functional analysis method, the shortage of
   decision-making support for part consolidation, the deficiency of
   functional reasoning approaches to generate AM-enabled features, and the
   scarcity of integrating manufacturing and assembly knowledge into design
   stage are analyzed and discussed. However, it seems that addressing
   these issues is such a large scope that collaborative efforts are in
   need from both design and manufacturing communities. Therefore, this
   paper serves as a call to action for the research community to establish
   a comprehensive assembly-level/product-level DFAM method to realize
   product evolution. As an initial benchmark, authors propose a
   three-stage design methodology on the basis of the Systematic Design
   approach. In the presented framework, functional analysis, part
   consolidation, and structural optimization with process knowledge
   integration are much highlighted. Moreover, a simple redesign case study
   is exemplified to clarify existing issues and how the benchmark method
   works. In the end, this paper is wrapped up with future research.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different

   vacuum drying (MVD), pulse-spouted vacuum microwave drying (PSMVD),
   pulse-spouted microwave drying (PSMD), and microwave freeze drying
   (MFD). Parameters of apparent density, color, processing temperature,
   expansion ratio, rehydration ratio, texture, and microstructure of the
   dried products were determined. The results showed that the MFD green
   soybean had a small change on bright color, compared with the fresh
   samples, but the drying time was the longest among the four methods. The
   bright color value of PSMVD/PSMD/MVD, respectively, was 79.77, 71.43,
   and 55.45, and drying time of them was slightly different. The
   PSMVD/PSMD showed advantages over MVD by improving the product quality.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work in air transportation system-of-systems design
   optimization considered integrated aircraft sizing, fleet allocation and
   route network configuration. The associated nested multidisciplinary
   formulation posed a numerically challenging optimization problem;
   therefore, direct search methods with convergence properties were used
   to solve it. However, the complexity of the blackbox is such that it
   impedes greatly the solution of larger-scale problems, where the number
   of considered nodes in the route network is high. The research presented
   here adopts a rule-based route network design inspired by biological
   transfer principles. This bio-inspired approach decouples the network
   configuration problem from the optimization loop, leading to significant
   numerical simplifications. The usefulness of the bio-inspired approach
   is demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained using the
   nested formulation for a 15-city network. We then consider introduction
   of new aircraft as well as a larger problem with 20 cities.}},

Abstract = {{Dissipation mechanisms and dissipative forces play a pivotal role in the
   operations and performance of human-machine interfaces and particularly
   in haptic systems. Dissipation is a very difficult phenomenon to model.
   Coulomb friction in general can be the most influential element in
   systems involving multiple direct contact connections such as joints
   with transmissions or mechanically guided components. Coulomb friction
   includes non-smooth discontinuity and can induce complex dynamic
   behaviours. Very little attention has been paid to the analysis of the
   effects of Coulomb friction in haptic devices. In this paper we
   illustrate, by experiment, analysis and simulation, the nature of the
   dynamic behaviour caused by Coulomb friction in haptic sampled-data
   systems. We demonstrate that a simple model can represent this
   behaviour; and show the effects of the haptic system parameters on this
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of large-scale multibody systems with unilateral contacts
   requires formulations with which good computational performance can be
   achieved. The availability of many solver algorithms for Linear
   Complementarity Problems (LCP) makes the LCP-based formulations a good
   candidate for this. How-. ever, considering friction in contacts asks
   for new friction models compatible with this kind of formulations. Here,
   a new, regularized friction model is presented to approximate the
   Coulomb model, which allows to formulate the multibody system dynamics
   as a LCP with bounds. Moreover, a bristle approach is used to
   approximate the stiction force, so that it improves the numerical
   behaviour of the system and makes it able to handle redundancy coming
   from the friction interfaces. Several examples using a 3D wheel model
   has been carried out, and the proposed friction model shows a better
   approximation of the Coulomb model compared to other LCP-based
   formulations.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most commonly used electric drive topologies for electric
   vehicles is that of a permanent magnet motor powered by a two-level
   inverter and a high voltage battery (system SI). An alternative to this
   topology is to replace the high voltage battery with a low voltage
   battery and a DC-DC boost converter (system S2). Previous work has shown
   that such a design is beneficial for vehicles that usually follow daily
   drive cycles with low average speed and many start and stop cycles. One
   category of vehicles that meet these criteria are medium duty delivery
   trucks. It has been demonstrated that the target modulation index of
   system S2 can be optimized in order to minimize the energy consumption
   over a specific drive cycle. This paper focuses on the effect of the
   battery voltage on system efficiency and demonstrates that the battery
   voltage can be used as an optimization parameter along with the
   previously studied target modulation index.}},

Abstract = {{The design, optimization and application of a number of surface mounted
   fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) electric machines for
   application to Class IV electric vehicles have been considered. Four
   FSCW motors with nominal power ratings of 50, 65, 75 and 100 kW have
   been designed. The motors were optimized using a novel multi-objective
   optimization strategy which allows a large numbers of objectives to be
   considered while ensuring computational efficiency and Pareto
   optimality. Vehicle simulations were carried out using the optimized
   motors for some typical drive cycles. The gear ratio of the drive train
   was optimized for each motor with respect to the drive cycle and the
   vehicle performances were calculated. The methodology and results
   presented provide a novel and improved framework for considering the
   trade-offs between the motor size, gear ratio and vehicle performance
   for Class IV and other vehicle classes.}},

Abstract = {{ISPs and network administrators use Internet Packet Classification (IPC)
   to categorize packets into flows (traffic sharing IP addresses, ports,
   and protocol), and thereby the application classes generating them.
   Distinguishing between safe and malicious traffic aids in network
   intrusion interception. Likewise, categorizing applications into classes
   is useful for traffic management for better service. Traditional IPC
   based on port numbers and payload pattern recognition are no longer
   effective because current applications can dynamically change port
   numbers and cipher their contents. Recent machine learning (ML) IPC
   solutions have speed-bounded accuracy, and complex implementation due to
   their dependence on packet sizes and order of arrival. We propose a new
   IPC approach that uses associative memory (AM) based on sparse-clustered
   network with selective decoding. Unlike ML approaches our solution takes
   bits extracted directly from the flow ID as input, which greatly reduces
   system complexity and cost. It achieves 85.1\% accuracy, consumes only
   516 Mbits of memory, and runs 387x faster than the state-of-the-art
   FPGA-implemented approach, which uses Support Vector Machines.}},

   has turned towards exploring novel computing architectures in order to

   Representing information with single-bit binary pulse trains, the

   to the existing field of stochastic computing. In this paper, we not
   only illustrate the parallels between digital spiking neural networks
   and stochastic computing, but we also demonstrate that many computing

Abstract = {{Generative models such as neural networks or markov random fields are
   difficult to extend beyond a limited spatial extent due to the large
   configuration spaces involved. Their usage in applications such as super
   resolution is thus problematic, despite their capacity for learning rich
   descriptions from local receptive fields. For example, due to model
   complexity, the number of parameters grows exponentially with respect to
   the size of the receptive field. In this paper we show how to deal with
   this limitation using a Convolutional Deep Boltzmann Machine (ConvDBM)
   for modelling distributions on large receptive fields with a
   controllable number of parameters. In particular, we show that i) by
   weight sharing and joint training over the second hidden layer, the
   prior distribution on a large receptive field can be represented
   properly using a small number of parameters; ii) scaling up to high
   resolution images can be achieved by applying the resulting ConvDBM
   sequentially with tiled weights. Experimental results are presented that
   show successful application of this approach to the problem of
   super-resolution.}},

   tracking one or more targets using a sensor network. We propose a novel
   approach for reducing the communication overhead involved in the data
   fusion step. The approach uses graph-based signal processing to
   construct a transform of the joint log likelihood values of the
   particles. This transform is adaptive to particle locations and in many
   cases leads to a parsimonious representation, so that the the joint
   likelihood values of all particles can be accurately approximated using
   only a few transform coefficients. The proposed particle filter uses
   gossip to perform distributed, approximate computation of the transform
   coefficients. Numerical experiments highlight the potential of the
   proposed approach to provide accurate tracks with reduced communication

   multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying and artificial
   noise (AN) optimization for secure communication between a
   source-destination pair in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers
   (eves). The eves' channel state information (ECSI) is subject to
   arbitrarily distributed random errors. Assuming that only the first and
   second moments of the ECSI errors are known, we introduce a
   probabilistically robust design method, which aims to maximize the
   received signalto-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the
   destination while satisfying a set of robust intercept probability
   constraints. Since the resultant optimization problem is non-convex, we
   propose a solution approach by resorting to a duality-based method along
   with the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, where a global optimal
   solution to our design problem can be found. Our simulation results
   demonstrate the improved secrecy of the proposed robust relaying design
   against eavesdropping and its robustness against the channel
   uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Hemodynamics in large human arteries, both in systemic and pulmonary
   circulation, is analysed. To the best of our knowledge, in pulsatile
   flow, this is the first theoretical study elaborating on hemodynamic
   factors such as Wall Shear Stress, Oscillatory Shear Index, Relative
   Residence Time and their effects on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
   by employing BJR slip at the lumen-wall interface, which takes into
   account the finite wall thickness of the artery. Also, the physiological
   pressure gradient waveform taken from the medical literature is modeled
   realistically by using McDonald's model. All the results reported are in
   good agreement with the data given in the available medical literature.
   Our model can predict the biological response of the artery in the
   normal/abnormal flow regime in a much better way, if the data fixed are
   subject specific. Our results confirm that low WSS and high OSI need not
   co-locate and also, explain the significances of OSI and RRT in the
   formation of atherosclerosis. Further, it emphasizes the need for the
   appropriate slip condition at the lumen-wall interface in the context of

Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Peer facilitators play an important role in determining the
   success of many support groups for patients with medical illnesses.
   However, many facilitators do not receive training for their role and
   report a number of challenges in fulfilling their responsibilities. The
   objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of
   training and support programmes for peer facilitators of support groups
   for people with medical illnesses on (1) the competency and
   self-efficacy of group facilitators and (2) self-efficacy for disease
   management, health outcomes and satisfaction with support groups among
   group members.
   Methods: Searches included the CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE,
   PsycINFO and Web of Science databases from inception through 8 April
   2016; reference list reviews; citation tracking of included articles;
   and trial registry reviews. Eligible studies were randomised controlled
   trials (RCTs) in any language that evaluated the effects of training
   programmes for peer facilitators compared with no training or
   alternative training formats on (1) competency or self-efficacy of peer
   facilitators, and (2) self-efficacy for disease management, health
   outcomes and satisfaction with groups of group members. The Cochrane
   Risk of Bias tool was used to assess risk of bias.
   Results: There were 9757 unique titles/abstracts and 2 full-text
   publications reviewed. 1 RCT met inclusion criteria. The study evaluated
   the confidence and self-efficacy of cancer support group facilitators
   randomised to 4 months access to a website and discussion forum (N=23;
   low resource) versus website, discussion forum and 2-day training
   workshop (N=29). There were no significant differences in facilitator
   confidence (Hedges' g=0.16, 95\% CI -0.39 to 0.71) or self-efficacy
   (Hedges' g=0.31, 95\% CI -0.24 to 0.86). Risk of bias was unclear or
   high for 4 of 6 domains.
   Conclusions: Well-designed and well-conducted, adequately powered trials
   of peer support group facilitator training programmes for patients with
   medical illnesses are needed.}},

   without major agents, the mean field term becomes stochastic due to the
   stochastic evolution of the state of the major agent; furthermore, the
   best response control actions of the minor agents depend on the state of
   the major agent as well as the stochastic mean field. In a decentralized
   environment, one is led to consider the situation where the agents are
   provided only with partial information on the major agent's state; in
   this work such a scenario is considered for systems with nonlinear
   dynamics and cost functions, and an epsilon-Nash MFG theory is developed
   for this MM-MFG setup. The approach to the problem of partially observed
   MM-MFG systems adopted in this work is to follow the procedure of
   constructing the associated completely observed system via the
   application of nonlinear filtering theory; consequently, as a first
   step, nonlinear filtering equations are obtained for partially observed
   stochastic dynamical systems whose state equations contain a measure
   term corresponding to the distribution of the solution of a state
   process. Stochastic control theory for systems with random parameters is
   next generalized to the partially observed case by lifting the analysis
   to the infinite-dimensional domain. To achieve this, the Ito-Kunita
   lemma is first generalized to processes taking values in a subset of L-1
   consisting of the space of solutions of the conditional density process
   generated by the filtering equations. The existence and uniqueness of
   solutions to the MFG system of equations is next established by a fixed
   point argument in the Wasserstein space of random probability measures
   in which the robustness property of nonlinear filtering theory is used.
   Finally, the epsilon-Nash property of such a solution is analyzed in
   this setting where the state consists of finite-and infinite-dimensional
   (density) valued stochastic processes.}},

Abstract = {{Particle flow filters, introduced in a series of papers by Daum and
   Huang, are an attractive alternative to particle filters for filtering
   tasks in high-dimensional spaces or with very informative measurements.
   Many variants of particle flow filters have been developed, but all
   require approximations in multiple stages of the implementation, which
   leads to particles deviating from the true posterior distribution. To
   preserve the statistical consistency of the filtering algorithm, some
   recent papers embed the particle flow techniques within a particle
   filter, using them to generate a proposal distribution. In recent work,
   we developed such a particle flow particle filter, modifying the flow
   mechanism to ensure that the implemented, approximate flow was an
   invertible mapping. This property allows efficient computation of the
   importance weights. In this paper, we strive to reduce the computational
   overhead of the particle flow particle filter by incorporating
   clustering of the particles. Results from a multi-target acoustic
   tracking simulation demonstrate that we can significantly reduce the
   computational cost of particle flow particle filters with a relative
   small sacrifice in tracking accuracy.}},

   analysis revealed that CNCs with low carboxyl content resulted in single
   crystal thin triangular nanoprisms. Increasing the CNC carboxyl content
   resulted in hexagonal nanosheets and flower-like/dendric structures. The

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a leader-follower controller for the

   desired position with respect to a designated leader. Using the range
   and bearing of the leader from the robot, the leader-follower controller
   computes the desired wheel velocities of the MHT to achieve
   leader-follower formation control. In addition to performing wheeled
   locomotion to follow the leader, the MHT is capable of using its legs to
   reconfigure its posture. Thus, moving beyond standard implementations,
   the leader-follower control strategy presented in this paper is combined
   with a velocity-based inverse kinematics controller developed in
   previous work to control the posture of the MHT during leader-follower
   maneuvers. The results of the leader-follower scenarios implemented in

Abstract = {{This paper details novel methods to accurately estimate the achievable
   rates of channels with additive Gaussian mixture (GM) noise. Attention
   is paid to a Gaussian input and discrete inputs. Such discrete inputs
   represent a wide range of signaling strategies and include the
   capacity-achieving input as a special case. At first, we propose a
   simple technique to calculate the GM noise entropy. Specifically, when
   the noise level is high, a lower bound on the integrand of the noise
   entropy is established and the noise entropy can be estimated in
   closed-form. In the low noise region, the piecewise-linear curve fitting
   (PWLCF) method is applied to calculate the noise entropy. It is then
   demonstrated this can be estimated in both regions with a predetermined
   accuracy. We then extend this result to calculate the output entropy and
   the achievable rate when the input is Gaussian distributed, which is
   shown to be asymptotically optimal. Next, we propose a simple
   PWLCF-based method to estimate the output entropy for a given discrete
   input. In particular, the output entropy is evaluated by examining the
   output in high and low regions of amplitude using a lower bound on the
   integrand of the output entropy and PWLCF, respectively. It is
   demonstrated that the output entropy, and consequently, the achievable
   rates, can be computed to achieve any desired accuracy level.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study joint design of linear hybrid precoding and
   equalization for full-duplex (FD) massive multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) systems such that the sum mean squared error is minimized across
   all mobile stations. To better resolve practical issues such as hardware
   complexity, power consumption, and overhead of channel estimation,
   hybrid processing, which consists of digital processing in the baseband
   and radio frequency (RF) analog processing, is employed at the base
   station for simultaneous transmission and reception. In particular,
   baseband processing is adjusted according to instantaneous channel
   variation while RF processing is only updated based on such long-term
   channel statistics as transmit and receive correlation. In the presence
   of self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference, joint power
   optimization is carried out in order to achieve balanced performance for
   both the uplink and the downlink. As demonstrated by numerical results,
   FD is able to outperform half-duplex under realistic SI. Furthermore,
   the employment of the proposed hybrid processing structure is justified
   by its near optimal performance when equipped with even only a small
   number of RF chains.}},

Abstract = {{Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication has emerged as one of the most
   promising technologies to deal with the increasing demand in data
   transmissions over wireless networks. However, due to the propagation
   characteristic at the mmWave band, much higher pathloss is observed
   compared to the commonly-used microwave band. Thus, antenna arrays
   become a necessary ingredient in mmWave systems because of their needed
   beamforming gains. Beamforming for multiple users, also known as
   multiuser precoding, can be utilized to further improve the spectral
   efficiency of mmWave systems. Unfortunately, fully digital precoding
   with large antenna arrays is difficult to implement due to the hardware
   cost and power constraint in mmWave systems. Recent works in literature
   have advocated the structure of hybrid analog/digital precoding for
   mmWave systems, in which only minor performance degradation is observed.
   In this work, we study hybrid precoding for multiuser mmWave systems.
   After reviewing recent works in literature on hybrid precoding designs,
   we then develop a new hybrid minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) precoder.
   The proposed precoder can be easily obtained by an orthogonal matching
   pursuit-based algorithm. Simulation results show significant performance
   advantages of the proposed precoder over known designs in various system
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{The Successive-Cancellation List (SCL) decoding algorithm is one of the
   most promising approaches towards practical polar code decoding. It is
   able to provide a good trade-off between error-correction performance
   and complexity, tunable through the size of the list. In this paper, we
   show that in the conventional formulation of SCL, there are redundant
   calculations which do not need to be performed in the course of the
   algorithm. We simplify SCL by removing these redundant calculations and
   prove that the proposed simplified SCL and the conventional SCL
   algorithms are equivalent. The simplified SCL algorithm is valid for any
   code and can reduce the time-complexity of SCL without affecting the
   space complexity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the problem of the dynamics of a quadrotor
   unmanned aerial vehicle undergoing impact with its environment. This
   work is motivated by the fact that operation of UAVs (manual or
   autonomous) carries with it a significant risk of collision with
   surrounding objects, particularly in unknown, unstructured environments.
   To make small UAVs more viable and expand their autonomy, our ultimate
   objective is to develop control methods which would allow automatic
   recovery from a `non-destructive' collision, where operation of the
   vehicle is not compromised. Towards this goal, we formulate the dynamics
   model of a quadrotor equipped with protective bumpers around its
   propellers, undergoing an arbitrary collision with a vertical wall: no
   prior assumptions are made regarding the points and number of impacts,
   nor the impact speed, nor the orientation of the vehicle at the instance
   of collision. The model is exercised through a series of simulations for
   different pre-impact attitudes of the platform and different approach
   speeds. Results of experimental tests conducted with Spiri quadrotor
   platform are presented. Comparison to the simulated responses mimicking
   the experimental pre-impact conditions and command inputs show excellent
   qualitative agreement.}},

Abstract = {{A special class of fixed-wing UAVs called agile UAVs have emerged
   recently, that are lightweight with control surfaces as big as 50\%
   chord capable of deflecting up to 50 deg., and are characterized by high
   thrust-to-weight ratios of around 2-3, and a strong propwash. Such
   configuration allows agile UAVs to perform extreme aerobatic maneuvers
   that expand the conventional flight envelope to cover the full angle of
   attack and sideslip range. The desire to automate these aerobatic
   capabilities has led to a renewed interest in fixed-wing UAVs with a
   focus on understanding and modeling their dynamics for the full flight
   envelope. This paper presents a six degree-of freedom dynamics model for
   agile UAVs obtained through first principles. Simple but accurate
   techniques are presented to model the aerodynamics, thruster dynamics
   and propeller slipstream effects, which are embedded into the overall
   UAV simulation that is setup to run both offline as well as in real-time
   with the pilot-in-loop. Static bench tests are performed for validation
   of the presented six-dof agile UAV model and underlying modeling
   techniques. As well, qualitative validation shows the model to
   successfully capture well-known RC maneuvers flown by an experienced
   pilot in real-time simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides the fundamentals of integrated motor-drive system
   design knowledge which could be used as a basis to change the existing
   machine design approach from being a separate machine design tool to a
   more advanced engineering package. Various user's preferences including
   motor performances at transient, rated and flux weakening operations
   along with the inverter quality are studied by means of a competent
   co-simulation process which utilizes FEM, MATIAB and SIMULINK packages
   to build the framework based on which magnetic, electric and electronic
   devices and quantities are modeled, simulated and post processed. A case
   study of an interior permanent magnet motor connected to a field
   oriented controlled drive is investigated and the design process
   concepts are developed by means of a comprehensive statistical analysis.
   The initial goal is to reduce the search space of the optimal region. It
   is shown that incorporating the inverter effects into the design process
   changes the idea of an optimum motor design and not only the design
   parameters but also the expectations from motor performance have to be
   revised. In fact, an integrated motor drive system design process
   regarding the best motor operations in the transient, rated and flux
   weakening modes is targeted as the ultimate goal. A set of practical
   solutions are proposed to fulfill any motor operations requirement while
   keeping the inverter efficiency at the highest possible level.}},

   dependent power loss curves have also been measured and are fitted to a
   two term iron loss formula to compute the magnetic losses. The

   loss formula) and the resistivity values of the conductors have then
   been incorporated into the Finite Element (FE) based computer

Abstract = {{This paper considers a selective detect-and-forward two-way relay
   network employing differential MPSK modulation with Weighted
   Decision-Feedback Differential Coherent (W-DFDC) receivers. The system
   employs a three-phase relaying protocol with direct transmissions, where
   two terminals transmit separately in the first two phases. In the third
   phase, the relay forwards the network coded message to both terminals
   only if it has successfully decoded both messages received from the
   terminals. At the destination nodes, SNR-dependent thresholds are
   proposed to allow only the received signal from the relay corresponding
   to when it transmits to be combined with the signal from the direct
   link. Monte Carlo simulation results for fast fading channels show the
   performance gains of this relaying scheme with W-DFDC receivers over
   conventional differential detectors.}},

   where the responses are monotonic functions of linear transformations of

   transformation function. We prove that our algorithm, which maximizes
   the rank correlation of responses and linear transformations of
   predictors, is a consistent estimator of the true coefficient matrix. We
   also identify the rate of convergence and show that the squared
   estimation error decays with a rate of o(1/,root n). We then propose a
   greedy algorithm to maximize the highly non smooth objective function of
   our model and examine its performance through simulations. Finally, we
   compare our algorithm with traditional multivariate regression

Abstract = {{We introduce a sparse multivariate regression algorithm which
   simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction and parameter
   estimation. We decompose the coefficient matrix into two sparse
   matrices: a long matrix mapping the predictors to a set of factors and a
   wide matrix estimating the responses from the factors. We impose an
   elastic net penalty on the former and an l(1) penalty on the latter. Our
   algorithm simultaneously performs dimension reduction and coefficient
   estimation and automatically estimates the number of latent factors from
   the data. Our formulation results in a non-convex optimization problem,
   which despite its flexibility to impose effective low-dimensional
   structure, is difficult, or even impossible, to solve exactly in a
   reasonable time. We specify a greedy optimization algorithm based on
   alternating minimization to solve this non-convex problem and provide
   theoretical results on its convergence and optimality. Finally, we
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm via experiments on
   simulated and real data.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of networked systems typically begin by obtaining information
   about the network structure. In many settings it is impractical or
   impossible to directly observe the network, and sampling is used.
   Sampling the structure of offline social networks is especially costly
   and time-consuming Respondents are asked to name close friends and
   acquaintances (strong and weak ties). However, because a person may have
   a large number of acquaintances, surveys use a fixed-choice design where
   respondents are asked to name a small, fixed number of their weak ties.
   Surprisingly, studies based on fixed-choice designs then directly use
   the network derived from the responses without correcting for the bias
   introduced by fixed-choice sampling. In this paper we demonstrate how to
   account for fixed choice sampling when inferring network
   characteristics. Our approach is based on the generalized method of
   moments. We verify the accuracy of our results via simulation and
   discuss immediate applications and consequences of our work to existing
   results.}},

Title = {{The prediction of iron losses under PWM excitation using the classical

Abstract = {{Purpose - The losses incurred in ferromagnetic materials under PWM
   excitations must be predicted accurately to optimize the design of
   modern electrical machines. The purpose of this paper is to employ
   mathematical hysteresis models (i.e. classical Preisach model) to
   predict iron losses in electrical steels under PWM excitation without
   compromising the computational complexity of the model.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a novel approach based on
   the dynamic inverse Preisach model is proposed to model the iron losses.
   The PWM magnetic flux density waveform is decomposed into its harmonic
   component using Fourier series and a weighted Everett function is
   computed based on these harmonic components. The Preisach model is
   applied for the given flux waveform and results are validated against
   the measurements.
   Findings - The paper predicts the total iron loss by computing a
   weighted Everett function based on the harmonics present in PWM
   waveform. Moreover, it formulates the possibility of utilizing the
   classical Preisach model to predict iron losses under PWM excitation.
   Research limitations/implications - The approach is still limited in
   terms of its application at high frequencies. This work may eventually
   lead toward the accurate prediction of iron loss under PWM excitation in
   electromagnetic machine design.
   Practical implications - The paper provides a simple approach applying
   the Preisach model for the prediction of iron losses under PWM
   excitation. The proposed approach does not require additional
   experimental data beyond B-H loops measured under sinusoidal excitation.
   Originality/value - A novel approach is presented to incorporate the
   frequency dependence into a static inverse Preisach model. The approach
   extends the ability of the static Preisach model to compute total iron
   loss under PWM excitation using a weighted Everett function.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks have gone through a recent rise in
   popularity, achieving state-of-the-art results in various fields,
   including image classification, speech recognition, and automated
   control. Both the performance and computational complexity of such
   models are heavily dependant on the design of characteristic
   hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, or
   choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been optimized
   manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and
   embedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance
   (accuracy), but also for implementation complexity, becomes paramount.
   In this work, we present a multi-objective design space exploration
   method that reduces the number of solution networks trained and
   evaluated through response surface modelling. Given spaces which can
   easily exceed 1020 solutions, manually designing a near-optimal
   architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network complexity,
   while maintaining performance, may be overlooked. This problem is
   exacerbated by the fact that hyper-parameters which perform well on
   specific datasets may yield sub-par results on others, and must
   therefore be designed on a per-application basis. In our work, machine
   learning is leveraged by training an artificial neural network to
   predict the performance of future candidate networks. The method is
   evaluated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, optimizing for both
   recognition accuracy and computational complexity. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed method can closely approximate the
   Pareto-optimal}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a single channel speech enhancement algorithm
   using a subband iterative Kalman filter. A wavelet filterbank is first
   used to decompose the noise corrupted speech into a number of subbands.
   To achieve the best trade-off among the noise reduction, speech
   intelligibility and computational complexity, a partial reconstruction
   scheme based on consecutive mean squared error is proposed to synthesize
   the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) subbands. An iterative
   Kalman filter is then applied to the partially reconstructed HF subband
   speech. Finally, the enhanced HF subband speech is combined with the
   partially reconstructed LF subband speech to reconstruct the fullband
   enhanced speech. Experimental results show that the proposed subband
   iterative Kalman filter based algorithm is capable of reducing adverse
   environmental noises for a wide range of input SNRs. The overall
   performance of our method in terms of segmental SNR, perceptual
   evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and computational cost is superior
   to several existing Kalman filter based algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Single-microphone speech dereverberation is a challenging problem of
   de-convolving the reverberation produced by the room impulse response
   from the speech signal, when only one observation of the reverberant
   signal (one microphone) is available. By using linear prediction
   (LP)-residuals and spectral subtraction as two promising tools for
   dereverberation, a new technique is proposed. The first stage of the
   proposed technique consists of pre-whitening followed by a delayed
   long-term LP filtering whose kurtosis or skewness of LP-residuals is
   maximized to control the weight updates of the inverse filter. A
   nonlinear spectral subtraction scheme is the second stage of the
   proposed technique. It is shown that that the proposed algorithms
   outperform the existing major single-microphone methods in terms of a
   number of qualitative and quantitative measures.}},

Abstract = {{While printable electronics (PE) has the potential to provide a low cost
   means to manufacture electronic solutions, it suffers serious levels of
   component variations. While many of the problems facing PE are early
   technological development yield-related problems, some are more
   fundamental to its manufacturing nature. In this work, methods to
   construct PE circuits that compensate for these variations will be
   described. These methods include a combination of printing, severing,
   and ink deposition techniques that are performed both during and after
   manufacturing. Data obtained from working prototypes made using the PE
   technology at the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada will be
   described.}},

Abstract = {{The Successive-Cancellation List (SCL) algorithm is one of the best
   polar code decoding algorithms in terms of trade-offs between complexity
   and error correction performance. The List-Sphere Decoding (List-SD)
   algorithm has been recently proposed: it yields a better
   complexity/performance trade-off than SCL in the decoding of short polar
   codes, that can be used as component codes for larger polar codes. We
   exploit the structure of the generator matrix of polar codes to propose
   a matrix reordering technique which allows to significantly reduce the
   List-SD complexity without degrading its error correction performance,
   further improving the aforementioned trade-off. The proposed technique
   is implemented on hardware and it is shown that at the same Frame Error
   Rate ( FER) and Bit Error Rate (BER), the matrix reordering can reduce
   the resource requirements of List-SD of up to 73\%. Furthermore, FER and
   BER curves are plotted for case studies, showing that at the same
   complexity cost, matrix reordering improves the performance of List-SD
   of up to 0 : 7 5 dB at FER=10(-2).}},

Abstract = {{Selective laser melting (SLM) is an attractive manufacturing technique
   for the production of metal parts with complex geometries and high
   performance. This manufacturing process is characterized by highly
   localized laser energy inputs during short interaction times which
   significantly affect the densification process. In this present work,
   experimental investigation of fabricating 316L stainless steel parts by
   SLM process was conducted to determine the effect of different laser
   energy densities on the densification behavior and resultant
   microstructural development. It was found that using a low laser energy
   density below 50 J/mm(3) produced an instable melt pool that resulted in
   the formation of unmelted particles, pores, cracks, and balling in the
   as-built parts with low densification. In contrast, the as-built parts
   at a high energy density above 200 J/mm(3) showed irregular scan tracks
   with a number of pores and metal balls that decreased part density. The
   optimal laser energy density range was accordingly determined to be
   58-200 J/mm(3) by eliminating obvious SLM defects, which led to near
   full densification. The SLM samples fabricated using optimal parameters
   allowed observation of a microhardness of 280 Hv, ultimate strength of
   570 MPa, and yield strength of 530 MPa that were higher than those of
   the as-cast and wrought 316L stainless steel.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{48}},
Pages = {{33351-33356}},
Abstract = {{The polymorphism of two dimensional MoS2 promises new possibilities for
   nanoelectronics. The realization of those possibilities necessitates
   techniques to enable flexible and controllable phase engineering of
   MoS2. In the present study, based on first-principles calculations, a
   new and flexible route to engineer the phase stability of MoS2 by
   interfacing it with a GaN or AlN substrate is reported. Depending on the
   surface termination of the underlying substrate, MoS2 may exhibit either
   the 2H or 1T' (1T `') phase. The interface coupling between MoS2 and the
   substrate also affects the phase transition kinetics. In addition,
   electron doping can act as another means to influence MoS2-substrate
   interactions and enable further phase engineering of MoS2. The present
   findings contribute to new knowledge towards phase engineering of MoS2
   and the design of hybrid nanodevices comprising both 2D and 3D
   optoelectronic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Winding distortions can be mechanically induced during transportation,
   by large transient currents caused by lightning events or
   short-circuits, or as a result of gradual clamping looseness as the
   transformers age, after many loading and unloading cycles. Winding
   distortions lead to increased electromagnetic forces between the
   windings and the core, giving rise to changes in vibration signatures
   that could be useful as online condition monitoring tool. Unfortunately,
   this method is difficult when using electrical sensors mounted on the
   tank walls, i.e., vibration signals are highly dependent on mounting
   positions, and contaminated by noise from oil pumps, cooling fans, or
   the oil tank itself. For the first time, a thin fiber optics sensor has
   been developed to fit the 2 mm gap between the winding and the slot for
   direct winding vibration measurements. This sensor is an extension of
   the Fabry-Perot fiber optics vibration sensor-The VibroFibre-developed
   by QPS 5 years ago and already deployed around the world for monitoring
   Stator End Winding (SEW) vibration. The same hermetic junction plate
   developed to isolate the hydrogen cooled generator from the outside
   ambient is now conveniently adapted to become the feedthrough into the
   transformer tank, thus preventing any oil leaks to the environment. This
   paper discusses the successful showcase developed between QPS and Xian
   E-Sys Automation Engineering Co., Ltd in China. The proposed sensor,
   which is 2 mm thick, 50 mm long, and 20 mm wide, can measure vibration
   between 20 Hz to 1000 Hz. This work has been inspired by an extensive
   research program at University of Western Australia performing a
   rigorous finite element model simulating the magnetic forces interaction
   and vibration inside the transformer. We will validate all their
   simulation results showing how it is possible to detect significant
   winding distortions like buckling and bulging, open and short circuits,
   and clamp looseness. Missing inter-winding separation can also be
   identified as we trend the vibration amplitudes at twice the line signal
   frequency. The special sensor is also capable of measuring temperature
   to achieve a cost effective monitoring solution to extend the life of
   the transformers while providing good diagnostics.}},

   weighted prediction error (WPE) method. In contrast to the conventional
   WPE method which alternatively estimates the reverberation prediction
   weights and early speech spectral variance, the proposed algorithm
   estimates the latter efficiently by employing a geometric spectral
   enhancement approach and a proper estimate for late reverberant spectral
   variance (LRSV). Hence, our algorithm does not require iterations to
   estimate the reverberation prediction weights nor needs alternation
   between the prediction weights and the spectral variance of early
   speech. Performance assessments demonstrate considerable improvements in
   terms of speech quality measures and computational load compared to
   previous WPE-based dereverberation methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a basis compensation algorithm for
   non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) models as applied to supervised
   single-channel speech enhancement. In the proposed framework, we use
   extra free basis vectors for both the clean speech and noise during the
   enhancement stage in order to capture the features which are not
   included in the training data. Specifically, the free basis vectors of
   the clean speech are obtained by exploiting a priori knowledge based on
   a Gamma distribution. The free bases of the noise are estimated using a
   regularization approach, which enforces them to be orthogonal to the
   clean speech and noise basis vectors estimated during the training
   stage. Experimental results show that the proposed NMF algorithm with
   basis compensation provides better performance in speech enhancement
   than the benchmark algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the transceiver design problem for secure downlink
   communications over a multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO) relay
   system in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. A new algorithm based
   on alternating optimization (AO) is first proposed to maximize the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a legitimate receiver under power
   constraints at the base station (BS) and the relay station (RS) and a
   set of secrecy constraints, by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
   technique. To reduce complexity, a simplified design algorithm based on
   switched relaying (SR) is also proposed, in which both the BS and the RS
   are equipped with a codebook of permutation matrices. Based on this
   codebook, we construct a number of latent transceivers, each consisting
   of a BS beamforming vector and an optimally scaled RS permutation
   matrix. We use the bisection search and second-order cone programming
   (SOCP) techniques to design each latent transceiver and choose the
   optimal one with the largest SNR. We also develop an efficient approach
   to construct the codebook of permutation matrices. Our results show that
   the SR based algorithm significantly reduces the computational
   complexity while maintaining a similar performance to the AO based
   algorithm.(1)}},

Abstract = {{Particle flow algorithms have been developed as an alternative to
   particle filtering. In these algorithms, there is no importance
   sampling, and particles are migrated from the prior to the posterior via
   a ``flow{''}, described by differential equations. Aside from a few
   special cases, implementations involve multiple approximations, and
   their impact on the accuracy of the estimates is not clearly understood.
   In this paper, we propose algorithms that use particle flow procedures
   to construct an importance sampling distribution within a standard
   particle filter. The resultant algorithms retain the statistical
   consistency of sequential Monte Carlo methods, but acquire the desirable
   properties of particle flow techniques. We report the results of a
   multiple target tracking simulation study that combines highly
   informative measurements with a reasonably high-dimensional state space,
   leading to a challenging scenario for particle filters. Of the filters
   we test, the particle flow particle filter provides the smallest
   tracking error and achieves the largest average effective sample size.}},

Abstract = {{In studies on artificial bandwidth extension (ABE), there is a lack of
   international coordination in subjective tests between multiple methods
   and languages. Here we present the design of absolute category rating
   listening tests evaluating 12 ABE variants of six approaches in multiple
   languages, namely in American English, Chinese, German, and Korean.
   Since the number of ABE variants caused a higher-than-recommended length
   of the listening test, ABE variants were distributed into two separate
   listening tests per language. The paper focuses on the listening test
   design, which aimed at merging the subjective scores of both tests and
   thus allows for a joint analysis of all ABE variants under test at once.
   A language-dependent analysis, evaluating ABE variants in the context of
   the underlying coded narrowband speech condition showed statistical
   significant improvement in English, German, and Korean for some ABE
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) has received much recent attention due to its
   inherent fault-tolerance and low implementation cost compared to binary
   radix representations. SC has been proposed for various signal
   processing applications such as digital filters. The prior art in
   stochastic FIR filters can accurately implement the desired filtering
   function for low-order filters, however, their accuracy degrades as the
   filter order increases. Moreover, stochastic IIR filters demonstrate
   high hardware complexity and degraded accuracy. In this paper, we
   propose an architecture for high-order FIR filters with negligible
   accuracy loss compared to fixed-point implementation. The proposed
   architecture requires fewer random number generators. We also describe a
   novel cascaded second-order direct-form II structure for IIR filters.
   The implementation results of the proposed design show an improvement in
   latency and hardware complexity compared to the stochastic architectures
   reported to date.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report anomalous size-dependent photoluminescence (PL)
   intensity variation of PbS quantum dots (QDs) with the formation of a
   thin CdS shell via a microwave-assisted cation exchange approach. Thin
   shell formation has been established as an effective strategy for
   increasing the PL of QDs. Nonetheless, herein we observed an unusual PL
   decrease in ultrasmall QDs upon shell formation. We attempted to
   understand this abnormal phenomenon from the perspective of trap density
   variation and the probability of electrons and holes reaching surface
   defects. To this end, the quantum yield (QY) and PL lifetime (on the
   ns-mu s time scales) of pristine PbS QDs and PbS/CdS core/shell QDs were
   measured and the radiative and non-radiative recombination rates were
   derived and compared. Moreover, transient absorption (TA) analysis (on
   the fs-ns time scale) was performed to better understand exciton
   dynamics at early times that lead to and affect longer time dynamics and
   optical properties such as PL. These experimental results, in
   conjunction with theoretical calculations of electron and hole wave
   functions, provide a complete picture of the photophysics governing the
   core/shell system. A model was proposed to explain the size-dependent
   optical and dynamic properties observed.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics analysis is crucial not only for model-based control, but also
   for design. This task, however, is quite challenging when it comes to
   closed-loop mechanisms. The authors resort to the natural orthogonal
   complement, to formulate the dynamics model of this kind of mechanisms;
   the technique is illustrated with an application to the well-known
   Bricard mechanism, which is overconstrained and hence, highly demanding
   in terms of meeting the constraints. It is shown that this approach
   offers a systematic way of producing the dynamic response of closed-loop
   mechanisms, which reduces the computation complexity, and hence is quite
   suitable for real-time control and mechanical design. Moreover, this
   approach is shown to be especially suitable for single-loop mechanisms,
   whose formulation cost is virtually the same as that for an open chain.}},

   Use of Thermal Video Data and Surrogate Safety Measures}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate crosswalk pedestrian
   safety at nighttime by using surrogate safety measures derived from
   thermal video data. The methodology is illustrated for two unsignalized
   crosswalk locations in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Video
   recordings from a thermal camera were used to compare nighttime and
   daytime safety conditions with surrogate safety measures that included
   vehicle approaching speed, postencroachment time (PET), yielding
   compliances, and conflict rates. A disaggregate measure of pedestrian
   exposure that excludes noninteracting road users is also proposed. A
   thermal camera was used to alleviate issues pertaining to low visibility
   at night for video analysis when road users, especially pedestrians, are
   difficult to track. The results showed that the thermal-video based
   methodology could effectively collect interaction data at night
   regardless of lighting conditions. Through the use of thermal video data
   and the methodology proposed in this paper, the interactions between
   crossing pedestrians and motor vehicles, with related measures such as
   PET and speed, could be analyzed to evaluate the effect of different
   crosswalk treatments on pedestrian safety in low-visibility conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the debug needs of IoT devices and systems
   throughout their lifecycle, that also aims to preserve security required
   for IoT. A generic wireless debugging infrastructure over Bluetooth Low
   Energy (BLE) is proposed. We show how it is possible to balance the
   conflicting needs of security and visibility in a coherent framework
   based on leveraging an Android-powered device with protocol stack
   access. The concept of ``virtual fuses{''} is employed that allows
   selective access to the debug interface based on trust at stages
   starting from individual node development to the deployment and update
   of the system. The debug and security needs are solved with suitable
   trust management which allows selective activation or deactivation of
   debug resources throughout the system life. Lastly, the proposed system
   is implemented in a practical experiment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dynamic electro-thermal model for the V-and
   Z-shaped electrothermal microactuator for the first time. The model
   predicts the dynamic temperature responses of the actuator operating in
   vacuum conditions with constant input voltage applied at both ends.
   Dynamics of the temperature distribution are established, and the exact
   solution of the hybrid partial differential equation (PDE) is obtained
   to describe the electro-thermal behavior for each segment of the
   actuator. To solve the PDE, the final temperature responses are
   intentionally decomposed into two parts, i.e., the steady-state and
   transient responses. In addition to the initial and boundary conditions,
   continuity conditions that describe the temperature and heat flux
   density between adjacent segments of the actuator are employed to solve
   the hybrid PDE. The validation of the model is conducted by
   finite-element simulations using ANSYS software (version 14.0). The
   analytical results based on the proposed model well agree with the
   numerical results with ANSYS analysis in terms of predictions on both
   steady-state and transient responses. Along with the line-shaped beam
   model, this proposed model serves as the first sub-model in establishing
   the complete dynamic electro-thermal-mechanical model for the V-and
   Z-shaped actuators. The developed modeling method paves the way in
   improving the design and optimizing the dimensions of the actuator in
   achieving better static and dynamic performances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel methods to accurately calculate the
   information rates and capacity of quadrature Gaussian mixture (GM) noise
   channels without the need of time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations or
   numerical integrations. The focus is on three important input signals:
   i) a Gaussian input; ii) a complex input with discrete amplitude and
   independent uniform phase, which is a capacity-achieving input; and iii)
   finite-alphabet signaling schemes, such as practical quadrature
   amplitude modulation (QAM). To this end, a novel piecewise-linear curve
   fitting (PWLCF) method is first proposed to estimate the entropy of a
   complex GM random variable to achieve any desired level of accuracy. The
   result can then be used to calculate the information rate when a
   Gaussian input is used. For a complex input with discrete amplitude and
   independent uniform phase, the output entropy is estimated in a similar
   manner but using polar coordinates and the Kernel function. When a
   finite-alphabet input is used, we exploit the Laguerre-Gauss quadrature
   formula for an effective calculation of the output entropy. Combining
   with the noise entropy, we show that in all cases, the information rates
   can be computed accurately.}},

   users, respectively. In our spectrum sharing protocol, secondary users
   take the initiative to access the spectrum or act as a DF relay to
   assist the primary system adaptively according to the channel conditions
   of the direct transmission link. Moreover, the joint optimization of
   power allocation and user selection of distributed secondary users is
   studied to achieve the maximum achievable data rate for the secondary
   system while guaranteeing the target data rate of primary user.
   Simulation results show that compared with previous protocols, the

Abstract = {{Platinum (Pt) based electrocatalysts have electrochemical performance
   that outperforms many other noble metal and metal oxide based materials.
   Increasing performance allows a reduction in the platinum load, and thus

   electrochemical approach was developed to nucleate and grow Pt
   nanoparticles into flower shaped assemblies on graphene sheets. The
   unique morphology and structure of the Pt were characterized by field
   emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The electrocatalytical activities of the Pt
   nanoflowers were evaluated using methanol and ethanol oxidation as model
   reactions. This proposed method has led to the synthesis of Pt
   nanoflowers with the ability to control, both their density and their
   size on defect free graphene. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

   chaser-manipulator-Envisat system after the capture of the spacecraft
   has been executed. The challenge lies in the fact that Envisat is
   tumbling and thus, its angular momentum must be redistributed during the
   rigidization maneuver so that at the end, the whole system is rotating
   as a single rigid body. Two rigidization methods are proposed in the
   paper: a proportional-integral control of the joint rates to the desired
   null rates for rigidizing the arm. The second scheme, referred to as
   redundancy resolution control, generates the desired joint rates which,
   as a primary objective, satisfy the rigid-body velocity constraint
   between chaser and target motions and, secondly, dissipates energy of
   the system to ensure rigidization of the arm. The benefit of this
   approach is that it can also account for joint limits, which maybe
   critical to the success of the rigidization maneuver. The two
   rigidization methods are applied to the chaser-manipulator-Envisat
   system for three tumbling rates of the Envisat spacecraft. The so-called
   nominal rate corresponds to the observations collected during the 2013
   measurement campaign. The additional two rates considered are 1.5 and 2
   times the nominal rate, to allow for the uncertainty in Envisat's spin
   rate as mission planning must accommodate the worst case scenario.
   Simulation results are presented which demonstrate that rigidization can
   be accomplished for the nominal and intermediate spin rates; however,
   the manipulator arm is not sufficiently strong, for the assumed torque
   limits, to rigidize the system for the worst case considered.}},

Abstract = {{Relay selection among available relays is crucial in improving the
   performance of cooperative relaying. In this paper, we address the relay
   selection for a multi-relay decode-andforward (DF) cooperative relaying
   scheme over channels impaired by bursty impulsive noise in the presence
   of Rayleigh fading. For this scheme, we propose a novel best relay
   selection technique which is based on both the channel state information
   of source-relay and relay-destination links and the state of the
   impulsive noise that affect those links. Then, we provide a end-to-end
   bit error rate (BER) expression for the proposed scenario using BPSK
   modulation. Finally, the accuracy of the provided analytical results and
   the effectiveness of the proposed best relay selection algorithm under
   different network topology is discussed. It is shown that, by using the
   bursty impulsive noise characteristics, the proposed relay selection
   algorithm performs significantly better than the conventional relay
   selection algorithm which is optimized for additive white Gaussian noise
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the resource allocation problem for a
   virtualized wireless network (VWN) in which each base station (BS) is
   equipped with a large number of antennas and due to the pilot
   contamination error, the perfect estimation of channel state information
   (CSI) is not available. In this case, the duration of pilot sequence
   transmission plays a critical role on the achieved VWN throughput.
   Therefore, we consider this parameter as a new optimization variable and
   propose a novel utility function for the resource allocation problem.
   The proposed optimization problem is non-convex with high computational
   complexity. To address this issue, by applying relaxation and variable
   transformation techniques, we propose a two-step iterative algorithm in
   which the allocation of power, sub-carrier and number of antennas is
   first established and then used to optimize the pilot duration.
   Simulation results reveal that proper pilot duration design improves the
   VWN performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies hybrid RF/baseband linear pre-coding design to
   minimize the mean square error (MSE) for millimeter-wave massive
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using optimal linear
   equalizer. Instead of dealing with the objective function of sum MSE,
   which involves matrix inverses, we approach this problem by minimizing
   the Euclidean distance between the hybrid precoder and the optimal
   minimum MSE precoder. In an effort to impose the optimal structure of
   channel diagonalization, we separate the design of modulus-constrained
   RF precoder from the design of unconstrained baseband precoder.
   Magnitude-least-squares approximation is introduced to formulate the RF
   precoder design problem, and is subsequently transformed into a
   simultaneous matrix diagonalization problem. Such transformation enables
   application of a simple and numerically stable Jacobi-like algorithm.
   The effective channel representing a cascade of the derived RF precoder
   and the MIMO channel, is diagonalized by the baseband precoder. The
   error performance of the proposed solution is examined by numerical
   results where the effectiveness is verified by its closeness to the
   optimal design and its noticeable gain over sparse approximation based
   schemes.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{470-478}},
Abstract = {{Mineral concentrators are designed from preliminary geological data, and
   are therefore subject to geological uncertainty. This uncertainty has a
   demonstrable impact on the mining lifecycle, and has motivated
   stochastic strategic mine planning algorithms. The current paper
   describes how these algorithms may be extended to consider mineral
   processing operations in conjunction with open-pit mining operations. In
   particular, the paper describes an effective way to incorporate variable
   concentrator feed grade into these algorithms, which is the first step
   toward more elaborate representations of mineral concentrators. The
   resulting framework will be able to connect geological data to alternate
   configurations of the downstream resources, hence comparing the benefit
   of each configuration, and the corresponding capital investments. Sample
   computations are presented, comparing the net present value and
   utilisation for several different mineral processing capacities. Les
   usines de traitement de minerai sont concues a partir de donnees
   geologiques preliminaires et sont donc sujettes a une incertitude
   geologique. Cette incertitude a un effet demontrable sur la vie utile de
   l'exploitation et a suscite des algorithmes stochastiques de
   planification strategique de mine. Cet article decrit comment on peut
   etendre ces algorithmes afin de considerer les operations de traitement
   de minerai concurremment avec les operations d'exploitation a ciel
   ouvert. En particulier, l'article decrit une maniere efficace
   d'incorporer une qualite variable de charge de concentrateur dans ces
   algorithmes, ce qui est la premiere etape vers des representations plus
   elaborees des concentrateurs de minerai. Le cadre conceptuel qui en
   resulte permettra de connecter les donnees geologiques a des
   configurations de rechange des ressources en aval, comparant le benefice
   de chaque configuration et les investissements correspondants en

Abstract = {{Flame propagation in lean suspensions of nonvolatile fuels (aluminum and
   iron) in oxidizing atmospheres is experimentally investigated.
   Suspensions of micron-sized fuel particles were dispersed in glass tubes
   using a flow of oxygen/argon mixture, and flame propagation into a
   quiescent mixture was observed via a variety of techniques. An
   independence of flame speed on oxygen concentration (from 15\% to 30\%
   oxygen in argon) was observed for the suspensions of aluminum
   particulates. This result is found to be consistent with theoretical
   estimations of the relative magnitudes of the particle combustion time
   and the inter-particle heat diffusion time, suggesting that flame
   propagation through the aluminum suspensions occurs in a regime
   controlled by the spatial discreteness of the multiphase medium.
   Experiments with iron exhibited the expected square root dependence of
   flame speed on oxygen concentration (from 15\% to 60\% oxygen in argon),
   demonstrating that propagation in this mixture is in the classical,
   continuum regime of thermal flames. The aluminum mixtures also exhibited
   an array of flame instabilities, including a pulsating oscillation that
   is theoretically predicted for mixtures with a high Lewis number,
   although acoustic interactions with the flame tube could not be ruled
   out in influencing the pulsations. The result that lean aluminum flames
   propagate in a discrete regime suggests that the statistical nature of
   the particulate suspensions will have a significant influence on flame
   propagation, giving rise to percolation-like behavior seen in previous
   computational simulations of reactive waves in discrete media.}},
