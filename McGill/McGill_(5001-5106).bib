Abstract = {{We report the design, simulation, and fabrication of a miniaturized
   Golay cell array, implemented with monolayer graphene suspended over a
   TEM grid as the deflecting membrane. Currently, ultra-thin membranes for
   Golay cell applications suffer diminishing responsivity as the lateral
   dimensions are reduced to the microscopic scale. We propose graphene as
   the ideal membrane material for micro-Golay cell arrays, whereby the
   minimal elastic stiffness of atomically thin graphene allows membranes
   to be scaled to microscopic dimensions. We examine how graphene's unique
   material parameters, such as high mobility, negligible gas permeability,
   and supreme strength, offer ease of fabrication and improved performance
   over existing technology. Simulations of graphene membrane deflection
   versus temperature are presented, with an analysis of the optimal
   geometry for maximum sensitivity. Cavities with all spatial dimensions
   under 100 mu m are predicted to provide sensitivities of hundreds of
   nanometres per Kelvin, in good competition with existing research on
   devices many times larger. Up to a four-fold increase in responsivity of
   400 nm/K is predicted for a graphene cell of the same dimensions as
   current technology, and a three-fold increase for a cell one quarter the
   diameter. These predictions permit an increased detector density in a
   focal plane array application while still providing improved
   responsivity. Furthermore, our fabrication method permits the
   construction of arrays consisting of thousands of devices, avoiding
   individual cell assembly and including built-in electrical contacts due
   to the conductive nature of graphene. We also present a theoretical
   analysis of interferometric optical read-out of membrane deflection.}},

Abstract = {{Cavity ring down measurement approach is a promising technique for
   biosensing as it is insensitive to intensity fluctuations of a laser
   source. This technique in conjunction with ultra high Q microcavities
   have a great potential for ultra sensitive biosensing. Until now, most
   work on microcavity biosensors has been based on measurement of the
   resonant frequency shift induced by binding event on surface of the
   microcavity. Such measurements suffer from the noise due to intensity
   fluctuations of the laser source. However, the binding event will also
   introduce shift in quality factor of the microcavity, which can be
   tracked by using cavity ring down spectroscopy. In this work, we report
   on experimental demonstration of application of ring down measurement
   approach to microcavities for biosensing by tracking disassociation
   phase of a biotin-streptavidin reaction. These measurements were
   performed by using a bioconjugated ultra high Q microtoroidal cavity
   immersed in a liquid microacquarium. We found that disassociation curves
   agree with previously reported results on the protein kinetics
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The birchwood biochar produced by slow as well as fast pyrolysis was
   analyzed and compared according to physical characteristics of porosity
   and reflectance. A relation between char porosity and the reflectance of
   the biochar structure was found wherein porosity was found to be
   inversely proportional to reflectance. The wavelengths providing images
   with maximum clarity were established for classification through
   hyperspectral imaging technique. The wavelengths that were found to be
   optimum for both slow and fast pyrolysis biochars were 947 nm and 1685
   nm, which fall in the near-IR and short-IR wavelength ranges,
   respectively. The results of the hyperspectral imaging support the
   findings of the porosity evaluations from pycnometric analysis, which
   showed that the biochar sample treated at 350 degrees C for slow
   pyrolysis and 400 degrees C for fast pyrolysis for a holding time of 20
   min had the highest porosity and in turn showed the lowest reflectance
   mean values. The theory that reflectance of biochar samples decrease
   with increasing porosity of the char structure was substantiated through
   this qualitative study.}},

Title = {{The Hencky equivalent strain and its inapplicability to the
   interpretation of torsion testing experiments}},
Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{2313-2328}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out on a 0.06\% C plain C steel to determine
   the shear stress-shear strain behaviour. The results obtained at 1200
   degrees C and a shear strain rate of 0.866 s(-1) are described. The
   experimental data are converted into equivalent stress-equivalent strain
   form using the von Mises and Hencky formalisms. It is shown that when
   the equivalent stress is of interest, as in the calculation of rolling
   load, only the von Mises formulation can be used without the
   introduction of large errors. This is required so that the incremental
   work done/unit volume of material can remain constant in both the shear
   and equivalent uniaxial tension formulations. The problem with the
   Hencky formalism with regard to simple shear is that the orientations of
   the Hencky principal strains and principal strain increments do not
   coincide and also vary continuously. As a consequence, the absolute
   values of the strain increments cannot simply be summed and the
   description of the equivalent strain applicable to large strain torsion
   proposed by Onaka {[}Philos. Mag. Lett. 90 (2010) p. 633] cannot be used
   to predict mechanical properties along other strain or loading paths.
   The problems associated with the definitions of the Hencky equivalent
   stress and Hencky work increment are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This research evaluated the effects of microwave and high-voltage

   and high electric field (HEF; 430 kV/m for 15 min) as pretreatments on
   enhancement of the drying rates during subsequent drying and the value
   addition due to the above pretreatments on the quality of the final

   was developed by fitting the drying kinetics to the Page equation to
   predict the effects of the pretreatments on the drying kinetics of the
   mushrooms. The parameters considered for the evaluation of product
   quality project included color, texture, shrinkage properties, and
   rehydration ratio of the dried mushrooms. The drying rate of
   HEF-pretreated mushrooms was found to be unaffected overall when
   compared to the control and the HEF pretreatment resulted in better

Abstract = {{The Vibrofiber sensor is a Fabry-Perot cavity formed between two broad
   band fiber gratings creating interference fringes. It was introduced
   three years ago to monitor the vibration and temperature rise of the
   stator end winding in a power generator.(1) This paper will discuss the
   use of Vibrofiber to monitor the deflection of the bridge under adverse
   conditions: wide temperature swings, excess load, strong winds, earth
   quake, etc. The fringes in these cavity sensors have features like peaks
   and valleys which are sensitive to temperature and strain. When the
   bridge becomes overloaded, we are interested in knowing the extent of
   the deflection. In addition, we might want to locate the cause of the
   overload. A simple Sagnac FBG interferometer has been invented to
   provide such diagnostics. A pair of long fibers with such cavity sensors
   can be installed on the underside of the target bridge segment between
   two supporting columns. The objective is to monitor the deflection
   together with any distortion of the bridge deck. Each of the 2 long
   fiber segments has a pair of cavity sensors, one measures the deflection
   as a result of the excess strain, and the other measures temperature and
   provides compensation for the deflection data. An array of cavity
   sensors with different center wavelengths will be used to support the
   typical multi-segment bridge structure. The interrogation unit is based
   on a tunable laser that can hop to different ITU grids. A separate DFB
   laser will run a grating based Sagnac interferometer, measuring weight
   in motion, identifying the speed and the make of vehicle in traffic and
   provide deflection diagnostics. Overloaded trucks and speeding vehicles
   can be captured and tagged for corrective actions. The interrogation
   unit is equipped with wireless Ethernet communication enabling the
   monitoring of many bridges from a central location and similarly warning
   can be initiated to alert the central traffic control ahead of any
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Flames stabilized in a heated tube with a diameter on the order of the
   flame thickness (i.e., small Peclet number) are investigated with
   numerical models of differing formulations. Providing a benchmark for
   comparison, a two-dimensional detailed model that solves the full,
   elliptic Navier-Stokes equations assuming axisymmetry is implemented
   with detailed chemical kinetics. The solutions are compared to those
   obtained from a simpler one-dimensional volumetric model that relies on
   a constant Nusselt number assumption to account for the heat transfer
   between the gas and the wall. This volumetric model presents poor
   agreement with the detailed results with an average error of 231 K
   (18\%) in wall temperature at the stabilization position. In an attempt
   to improve the modeling accuracy, the volumetric model is extended to
   account for the variations in the thermal boundary layer inside the
   reaction zone and the resulting enhanced flame-wall heat transfer. This
   extended volumetric model demonstrates significant improvements, given
   the considerable savings in computational time when compared to the
   detailed model, with errors smaller than 55 K (4.2\%) in stabilization
   wall temperatures. The leading order effects influencing these flames
   are inferred based on the dissimilarities in the respective model
   formulations and on the accuracy of their predictions. Deviations
   between this improved model and the detailed model are further
   investigated to determine the influence of the neglected two-dimensional
   effects. The deviations are attributed to the differences in treatment
   of radial momentum and H species transport between the two models.}},

Abstract = {{This letter reports the design and experimental evaluation of three
   compact printed monopole antennas for UHF RFID applications. The
   antennas that include folded, 2-D meander, and 3-D meander monopole
   designs are inductively coupled to RFID chips and are fabricated using a
   1.524-mm-thick Rogers RB4350B substrate with the relative permittivity
   of 3.66. Experimental results reveal that these tags cover the worldwide
   UHF RFID operation band (860-960MHz) with a maximum readable range of
   6.3m for the folded monopole, 5.39 m for the 2-D meander, and 5.24 m for
   the 3-D meander monopole designs with an effective isotropic radiated
   power of 3.28 W. A method for measuring the radiation pattern of an
   assembled UHF RFID tag without the use of any additional matching
   circuits or feeding wires is presented. This method is used to measure
   the radiation pattern of the fabricated 3-D meander monopole tag

Abstract = {{In this study, the rapid reduction of selenious ions using sulfite

   of sulfite reduction and ultra-acidification with sulfuric acid to a
   colloidal form that can be determined using turbidimetry. The developed
   analytical procedure can accurately and reproducibly measure Se(IV)

   is necessary. Common transition metal ions such as iron(II), copper(II),
   or zinc(II) up to 10 g/L concentration were found not to have noticeable
   influence on the precision of the method. Finally the developed

Abstract = {{Models for explosives containing metal particles must consider the
   complex gas-particle flow that is generated following detonation of the
   explosive. Previous experimental studies have shown that when a layer of
   solid particles is explosively dispersed, the particles often develop a
   non-uniform spatial distribution. The instabilities within the particles
   and at the particle layer interface likely form on the timescale of the
   detonation propagation through the particles. The mesoscale
   perturbations are manifested at later times in experiments by the
   formation of clusters of particles or coherent jet-like particle
   structures which persist for some distance during the dispersal process.
   These particle jets influence the particle-gas mixing and hence particle
   reaction rates at the macro scale. The particle instabilities that occur
   in explosively dispersed particles are investigated with a mesh-free
   computational method (smoothed-particle hydrodynamics). The simulations
   are compared with experimental results for the dispersal of a
   cylindrical packed bed of particles surrounding a central explosive
   charge. Of particular interest is the effect of the particle density and
   charge/particle mass ratio on the susceptibility of the particles to
   form jets.}},

Abstract = {{Strong, high-density shocks in a gas can be generated by end-initiating
   a hollow cylinder of explosive surrounding a pressurized thin-walled
   tube. Implosion of the tube results in a pinch that travels at the
   detonation velocity of the explosive, thereby driving a strong shock
   into the gas ahead of it. In the present study, the pinch velocity was
   increased beyond the detonation velocity of known explosives by dragging
   an oblique detonation wave along the surface of the tube. The gas shock
   and detonation trajectories were measured for a variety of phase
   velocities and tube fill pressures. Strong shocks with an average
   velocity of 13 km/s were observed for fill pressures as high as 6.9 MPa
   in helium while transient velocities as high as 19 km/s were observed.
   Shock trajectory performance degraded strongly with increasing phase
   velocity and for a velocity of 16 km/s the gas shock barely advanced
   ahead of the detonation.}},

   (the standoff). A simple model based on hoop stress and acoustic
   interactions between the tubing was developed and used to predict the

   results indicate that the secondary tube and two layers of explosive did
   not prove to significantly increase the standoff. However, at higher

Abstract = {{Cadmium-free quantum dots (QDs), such as those made from InP, show
   similar optical properties to those containing toxic heavy metals and
   thus provide a promising alternative for imaging and therapeutics. The
   band gap of InP is similar to that of CdTe, so photosensitization of InP
   QDs with porphyrins or other dyes should lead to generation of reactive
   oxygen species, useful for targeted destruction of malignant cells or
   pathogenic bacteria. Here we show the results of measurements of singlet
   oxygen and superoxide generation from InP QDs with single and double ZnS
   shells compared with CdTe and CdSe/ZnS. Reactive oxygen species are
   measured using colorimetric or fluorescent reporter assays and spin-trap
   electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We find that the
   size of the InP QDs and the thickness of the ZnS shell both strongly
   influence ROS generation. These results suggest future approaches to the
   design of therapeutic nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline cellulose solid films derived from spruce pulp exhibit
   iridescence when cast from chiral nematic aqueous phase suspensions of
   the nanocrystals. Iridescence is a color travel phenomenon that might
   have potential for overt encryption as an anti-counterfeiting measure.
   The iridescent phase also offers an intrinsic level of covert encryption
   by virtue of the fact that films of NCC reflect left-circularly
   polarized light. Addition of TINOPAL, an optical brightening agent
   (OBA), adds a third level of ( covert) encryption potential since the
   chromophore exhibits strong fluorescence when excited at ultra-violet
   wavelengths. The overall result is a selectively polarizing fluorescent
   iridescent film. We study the impact of additions of OBA on NCC
   iridescence, optical activity, and physical structure variation with
   polarized optical microscopy, circular dichroism spectropolarimetry and
   zeta potential analysis. Increasing OBA additions increase the chiral
   nematic pitch of NCC films, and this in turn alters chiral nematic
   domain structure in the solid film. Under low concentration conditions
   defined by our experiments, OBA yields intense UV fluorescence, without
   compromising the visible light iridescent properties of the film. The
   potential security offered by NCC and its optical responses can be
   authenticated using a UV light source such as is commonly used for
   banknote verification, a circular polarizer in conjunction with an
   iridescent feature which can be verified by the eye or by chiral
   spectrometry.}},

Title = {{Therapeutic Vascular Compliance Change May Cause Significant Variation
   in Coronary Perfusion: A Numerical Study}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{In some pathological conditions like aortic stiffening and calcific
   aortic stenosis (CAS), the microstructure of the aortic root and the
   aortic valve leaflets are altered in response to stress resulting in
   changes in tissue thickness, stiffness, or both. This aortic stiffening
   and CAS are thought to affect coronary blood flow. The goal of the
   present paper was to include the flow in the coronary ostia in the
   previous fluid structure interaction model we have developed and to
   analyze the effect of diseased tissues (aortic root stiffening and CAS)
   on coronary perfusion. Results revealed a significant impact on the
   coronary perfusion due to a moderate increase in the aortic wall
   stiffness and CAS (increase of the aortic valve leaflets thickness). A
   marked drop of coronary peak velocity occurred when the values of
   leaflet thickness and aortic wall stiffness were above a certain
   threshold, corresponding to a threefold of their normal value.
   Consequently, mild and prophylactic treatments such as smoking
   cessation, exercise, or diet, which have been proven to increase the
   aortic compliance, may significantly improve the coronary perfusion.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to develop angiopoietin-1
   (Ang1)-expressing genetically modified human adipose tissue derived stem
   cells (hASCs) for myocardial therapy. For this, an efficient gene
   delivery system using recombinant baculovirus complexed with cell
   penetrating transactivating transcriptional activator TAT
   peptide/deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles (Bac-NP), through ionic
   interactions, was used. It was hypothesized that the hybrid Bac-NPAng1
   system can efficiently transduce hASCs and induces favorable therapeutic
   effects when transplanted in vivo. To evaluate this hypothesis, a rat
   model with acute myocardial infarction and intramyocardially
   transplanted Ang1-expressing hASCs (hASC-Ang1), genetically modified by
   Bac-NPAng1, was used. Ang1 is a crucial pro-angiogenic factor for
   vascular maturation and neovasculogenesis. The released hAng1 from
   hASC-Ang1 demonstrated profound mitotic and anti-apoptotic activities on
   endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. The transplanted hASC-Ang1 group
   showed higher cell retention compared to hASC and control groups. A
   significant increase in capillary density and reduction in infarct sizes
   were noted in the infarcted hearts with hASC-Ang1 treatment compared to
   infarcted hearts treated with hASC or the untreated group. Furthermore,
   the hASC-Ang1 group showed significantly higher cardiac performance in
   echocardiography (ejection fraction 46.28\% +/- 6.3\%, P < 0.001 versus
   control, n = 8) than the hASC group (36.35\% +/- 5.7\%, P < 0.01, n =
   8), 28 days post-infarction. The study identified Bac-NP complex as an
   advanced gene delivery vehicle for stem cells and demonstrated its
   potential to treat ischemic heart disease with high therapeutic index
   for combined stem cell-gene therapy strategy.}},

Title = {{A novel polyethyleneimine-coated adeno-associated virus-like particle
   formulation for efficient siRNA delivery in breast cancer therapy:
   preparation and in vitro analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{1575-1586}},
Abstract = {{Background: Systemic delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is
   limited by its poor stability and limited cell-penetrating properties.
   To overcome these limitations, we designed an efficient siRNA delivery
   system using polyethyleneimine-coated virus-like particles derived from
   adeno-associated virus type 2 (PEI-AAV2-VLPs).
   Methods: AAV2-VLPs were produced in insect cells by infection with a
   baculovirus vector containing three AAV2 capsid genes. Using this
   method, we generated well dispersed AAV2-VLPs with an average diameter
   of 20 nm, similar to that of the wild-type AAV2 capsid. The
   nanoparticles were subsequently purified by chromatography and three
   viral capsid proteins were confirmed by Western blot. The negatively
   charged AAV2-VLPs were surface-coated with PEI to develop cationic
   nanoparticles, and the formulation was used for efficient siRNA delivery
   under optimized transfection conditions.
   Results: PEI-AAV2-VLPs were able to condense siRNA and to protect it
   from degradation by nucleases, as confirmed by gel electrophoresis.
   siRNA delivery mediated by PEI-AAV2-VLPs resulted in a high transfection
   rate in MCF-7 breast cancer cells with no significant cytotoxicity. A
   cell death assay also confirmed the efficacy and functionality of this
   novel siRNA formulation towards MCF-7 cancer cells, in which more than
   60\% of cell death was induced within 72 hours of transfection.
   Conclusion: The present study explores the potential of virus-like
   particles as a new approach for gene delivery and confirms its potential
   for breast cancer therapy.}},

   simple shear experiments}},
Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{779-786}},
Abstract = {{The von Mises equivalent strain increment is derived for the case of
   large strain simple shear (torsion testing). This is used, in
   conjunction with the von Mises yield surface, to define the von Mises
   equivalent stress as well as the incremental work per unit volume.
   Integration of the equivalent strain increment leads to the definition
   of the von Mises equivalent strain for torsion. The Hencky equivalent
   strain increment is derived from the Hencky strain defined as the
   logarithm of the semi major and minor axes of the strain ellipse. This
   is then used, via the incremental work, to derive the `Hencky equivalent
   stress'. In the Onaka approach, the numerical values of the principal
   strain increments were integrated without taking into account the
   continuous rotation of the strain ellipse. This invalid operation leads
   to an expression for the equivalent strain increment that cannot be
   applied to the large strains considered by Onaka. Using the correct
   increments of the Hencky strain, it is shown that the shear strain
   increments turn negative and consequently, the incremental work becomes
   negative when the shear is large.}},

   coarse grain simulation based on interaction stress}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1158-1167}},
Abstract = {{A coarse grain approach was selected to simulate nanocomposites made of
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and poly(methyl methacrylate)
   (PMMA). Unlike common coarse grain simulations, which employ
   Lennard-Jones models as the force field between the beads, the current
   approach used experiment-based data, and hence is considered a
   semi-empirical approach. Interaction stress data obtained from atomic
   force microscopy experiments under water were multiplied by ten to
   represent the interaction stresses in vacuum and then fed into the
   simulation. A new planar approach was introduced to simplify the
   three-dimensional unit cell into a two-dimensional plane. Furthermore,
   preliminary one-dimensional simulations were carried out to acquire a
   trade-off between simulation time and accuracy of the results. It was
   shown that the final results were independent of the initial conditions
   and converging parameters (the parameters that define the convergence
   rate). Two sets of planar simulations were performed to model pure PMMA
   systems and PMMA-SWNT nanocomposites. Polymer chain configuration and
   density profiles for these systems were obtained and compared. The
   surface effect on the polymer configuration and density profile was
   captured and demonstrated to be identical for the two systems. The
   polymer simulations showed a core section with a constant density, where
   the surface effect from the free surface did not influence the behaviour
   of the polymer chains. The effect of nanotube on polymer morphology was
   observed by layered structures of polymer chains around the nanotube,
   with preferable bands of peaks and valleys in the radial density
   profile. Finally, a new method was presented to calculate the
   interfacial binding energy for nanocomposites. The value of 0.44 kcal
   mol(-1) angstrom(-2) obtained for the PMMA-SWNT nanocomposite was shown
   to be in good agreement with the previously reported results obtained
   from atomistic simulations.}},

   assess the ductility and strength of typical connections used for steel

   detailed to develop different failure modes, including net section
   rupture, block shear failure, bolt bearing, and bolt or weld shear
   failure. The inelastic deformation capacity associated with each failure
   mode could be determined through the tests. In the second experimental
   program, single and double angle brace connections were removed from
   existing buildings undergoing demolition and tested under cyclic tension
   loading to evaluate the failure modes, ductility and predictability.
   Various failure modes were observed, including failure of the bolts,
   failure of the gusset plates, failure of the gusset plate-to-column or
   beam welds, block shear tear out of the brace as well as net brace
   yielding followed by section fracture. These failure modes ranged from
   brittle (bolt shear fracture) to ductile (section yielding \& fracture).}},

   protocols. The equivalent energy elastic-plastic analysis approach was
   used to determine design values for stiffness, strength, ductility and
   overstrength. A resistance factor of 0.7 was found to be in agreement
   with data from previous tests comprising walls without gravity loads.
   The seismic force modification factors (R-d = 2.5 and R-o = 1.7) were
   also consistent with previous test results. In general, the test data
   indicates that the additional gravity loads do not affect the lateral
   behaviour of a steel frame/steel sheathed shear wall if the chord studs
   are designed to carry the combined lateral and gravity forces and their
   associated eccentricities in a capacity based context.}},

Abstract = {{The roof diaphragm of single-storey steel structures experiences
   in-plane shear and flexural deformations that add to the lateral
   deformations of the vertical bracing system. The in-plane flexibility of
   the diaphragm may also lengthen the building period compared to
   structures with rigid diaphragms. This paper describes a field test
   program performed on a typical single-storey steel braced frame building
   located in Montreal, Canada. Measurements were taken under three
   conditions: ambient vibration, forced vibration and pull \& release
   testing. The impact of removing bracing members in a braced bay located
   at mid-length of the building was also examined. Numerical models of the
   structure accounting for the flexibility of the roof diaphragm were used
   to predict the periods. The results show that the amplitude of
   excitation influences the period of the structure. The numerical
   predictions agreed with the high amplitude period measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of a flexible cantilevered cylinder in confined axial flow is
   investigated theoretically and experimentally, in the case where the
   flow is directed from the free end towards the clamped one. First, the
   dynamical behaviour is described, as observed in ad hoc experiments with
   air flow: the system develops small-amplitude first-mode oscillations at
   low flow velocities, which could be flutter, and at higher flows the
   oscillatory behaviour is succeeded by a static divergence. Then, a
   relatively simple, linear theoretical model for the system is developed,
   and the theoretically predicted behaviour is compared to that observed.
   The model captures the essentials of the observed behaviour. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The coprecipitation of arsenic(V) with ferric iron was studied through
   the use of continuous circuit coprecipitation experiments that involved
   lime neutralization of acidic sulfate solutions (Fe/As molar ratio of 4)
   to pH 8. The influence of coprecipitation circuit design on arsenic
   removal was evaluated through one, two and three-stage experiments as
   well as the use of solids recycling in a two-stage circuit. The
   two-stage (operating respectively at pH 4 and 8) continuous circuit
   configuration produced the lowest residual arsenic concentration and the
   lowest specific surface area coprecipitate. Two-stage continuous
   experiments were also used to examine the influence of nickel and
   aluminum, co-ions that are common in industrial solutions. Nickel was
   not observed to significantly influence the residual dissolved arsenic
   under the conditions tested. Aluminum was found to be a suitable
   equimolar substitute for a portion of the ferric iron. X ray diffraction
   and Raman spectroscopic data indicated that the coprecipitates consisted
   of a mixture of gypsum, poorly crystalline ferric arsenate and
   (arsenic-bearing) ferrihydrite. Calculations based on the pH of point of
   zero charge (pH(pzc)) suggested that the content of ferric arsenate
   ranged from 24\% to 57\% and was influenced by the coprecipitation
   circuit design. The highest ferric arsenate content was observed with
   the two-stage coprecipitation circuit which also yielded the lowest
   residual arsenic concentration. The results indicated that subtle
   chemical differences induced in the coprecipitates by the process could
   be of significant influence to the geochemical stability of arsenic. (C)

Title = {{The self-heating of sulfides: Galvanic effects}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{57-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Under certain conditions of moisture and oxygen, sulfides can
   spontaneously heat or self-heat. In this paper, we test a hypothesis
   that galvanic interaction between some sulfides can promote
   self-heating. Using a self-heating test procedure, four cases were
   examined. Case 1 (specimen sulfides) and case 2 (concentrates) comprised
   four sulfides: pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena. They were
   tested individually and as 50:50 weight mixtures. The individual samples
   and mixtures of low rest-potential difference did not self-heat but
   mixtures of high rest-potential difference did. In case 3, pyrite was
   mixed 50:50 with two materials that self-heated alone, pyrrhotite and
   nickel concentrate, and self-heating further increased. For case 4,
   mixtures of pyrite-sphalerite were tested as a function of particle
   size. Self-heating increased as particle size decreased and it was the
   fineness of the pyrite (high rest-potential or cathodic mineral) that
   governed the response. The increase in self-heating with high
   rest-potential difference and increasing particle fineness of cathodic
   mineral supports that galvanic interaction can contribute to sulfide
   self-heating. A possible mechanism based on the hydrogen sulfide
   hypothesis is proposed where the reduction reaction on the cathodic
   mineral surface is ferric to ferrous. The understanding gained will be
   of interest to those involved in mining, storage, shipping and disposal
   of sulfide minerals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical loading tests are reported for six double-sided, high-strength
   concrete corbel specimens. The primary variables of the investigation
   were the percentage of steel fibers and the anchorage method of the main
   tension tie. The test results indicated that performance in terms of
   load-carrying capacities, stiffness, ductility, and crack width was
   improved, as the steel fibers were added and the percentage of steel
   fibers was increased. The corbel specimens with headed bars used as the
   main tension-tie reinforcement showed superior load-carrying capacities,
   stiffness, and ductility compared with the corbel specimens in which the
   main tension ties were anchored by welding to the transverse bars. From
   the test results, it is expected that the load-carrying capacities,
   serviceability, and durability of high-strength concrete corbels would
   be improved by using steel fibers and headed bars. Experimental results
   presented were also compared with various prediction models. DOI:

Abstract = {{There are many methods presently available to produce recombinant
   proteins in mammalian systems. The BacMam system is a simple
   straightforward method which overlaps two well-established technologies,
   namely the BEVS insect cell system and the transduction of mammalian
   cells in vitro. This chapter describes a method for the study of gene
   expression in mammalian cells in a series of simple steps. Protocols
   outlined include the design and construction of the recombinant
   baculovirus, cell culture techniques required to maintain both insect
   and mammalian cells, generation of baculovirus stocks, and methods to
   obtain maximal and reproducible gene expression in mammalian cells.
   Currently available statistical techniques using factorial design of
   experiment to optimize conditions for recombinant protein in vitro are
   outlined. Then details with respect to process scale-up in disposable
   bioreactors are included.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on the interference caused by secondary
   users (SUs) due to misdetection and its effects on the capacity-outage
   performance of the primary user (PU) in a cognitive radio (CR) network
   assuming Rayleigh and Nakagami fading channels. The effect of beacon
   transmitter placement on aggregate interference distribution and
   capacity-outage performance is studied, considering two scenarios of
   beacon transmitter placement: a beacon transmitter located 1) at a PU
   transmitter or 2) at a PU receiver. Based on the developed statistical
   models for the interference distribution, closed-form expressions for
   the capacity-outage probability of the PU are derived to examine the
   effects of various system parameters on the performance of the PU in the
   presence of interference from SUs. It is shown that the beacon
   transmitter at the PU receiver imposes less interference and, hence,
   better capacity-outage probability to the PU than the beacon transmitter
   at the PU transmitter. Furthermore, the model is extended to investigate
   the cooperative sensing effect on aggregate interference statistical
   model and capacity-outage performance considering OR (i.e., logical OR
   operation) and maximum likelihood cooperative detection techniques.
   Simulation results are also provided to verify the developed analytical
   models.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a precoding scheme over multiple cooperative frames
   to exploit time and cooperative diversities over a non-orthogonal
   amplify-and-forward (NAF) half-duplex single-relay Rayleigh fading
   channel. Focusing on a coded system under the framework of bit
   interleaved coded modulation (BICM), we first derive a union bound on
   the bit error probability (BEP) of the proposed system. It is shown that
   the diversity gain function is the (N-f . d(H))th power of that of
   uncoded cooperative systems, where N-f is the number of precoded
   cooperative frames, and d(H) is the minimum Hamming distance of the
   outer code. An optimal class of precoders is then derived to optimize
   the asymptotic coding gain. It is then shown that the source should
   transmit a superposition of all symbols in the broadcasting phases while
   being silent in all cooperative phases for the best asymptotic
   performance. By further analyzing the first iteration performance, a
   design criterion is then developed to find optimal superposition angles
   for good convergence behavior. A pragmatic approach is then proposed to
   find good rotation angles. Analytical and simulation results show that
   the proposed scheme provides a significantly higher order of time and
   cooperative diversities and better coding gains than previous precoding
   schemes.}},

   Secondary Steelmaking Process}},
Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{52-61}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach towards the evolution of non-metallic
   inclusion (NMI) populations in Ti-alloyed Al-killed steels, based on an
   extensive inclusion analysis campaign at Tata Steel Europe, IJmuiden
   Works. Automated SEM techniques were used to characterize the inclusion
   populations in 120 steel samples taken from nine heats out of two
   casting series of this steel grade. As NMI in Ti-alloyed Al-killed
   steels are overwhelmingly dominated by chemically simple Al2O3, most of
   the process relevant information lies in the analysis of particle size
   distribution during the secondary steelmaking process. The population
   density function (PDF) concept was applied, for the first time, to the
   characterization of inclusion size distributions sampled from secondary
   steelmaking practice. Two size distribution forms predominate in the
   entire dataset: i) Lognormal size distributions associated with active
   nucleation and growth of alumina (deoxidation and reoxidation),
   indicating net transfer of matter between NMI and solutes in liquid
   steel and ii) Power-law size distributions, associated with an inclusion
   population in chemical equilibrium with the melt and subject to
   collision/breakup processes controlling the distributions. Based on
   inclusion PDF observations, it is found that the size distribution of
   alumina inclusions suspended in steel melt, after equilibration and
   effective float out of large inclusions, tends to approach a Reference
   Distribution of power-law type function (f(r) = a . r(-3.5)) that
   appears to be a fundamental feature of the alumina-steel system. This
   Reference Distribution can guide efforts to improve and engineer
   inclusion populations for a better controlled steel product.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},

Abstract = {{The CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagram) method was used to select
   ternary alloys from Mg-Zn-Y system, aimed at determining the role of
   precipitates in the microstructure and texture evolution of Mg during
   and after deformation. The selected alloys are Mg-6Zn-1.2Y and
   Mg-5Zn-2Y. The constituent phases in the as-cast Mg-6Zn-1.2Y alloy are
   alpha-Mg solid solution phase and I (Mg3YZn6) intermetallic phase. The
   as-cast Mg-5Zn-2Y alloy is composed of alpha-Mg, I and W (Mg3Y2Zn3)
   phases. The intermetallics in the two alloys form by eutectic reaction,
   which in Mg-5Zn-2Y alloy results in initially W-phase formation and
   ultimately I-phase formation during solidification. After heat
   treatment, the Mg-6Zn-1.2Y and Mg-5Zn-2Y alloys contain nearly the same
   amount of ternary intermetallics (I and W phases, respectively) in
   equilibrium with alpha-Mg solid solution phase. The main solute in
   alpha-Mg phase is Zn with the same amount in the two alloys. The type
   and quantity of the phases obtained experimentally disagree with the
   results obtained from the thermodynamic database. One important
   discrepancy is that, in Mg-6Zn-1.2Y alloy, the I phase is not stable at
   the temperature of 430 degrees C, and that the W phase is the stable
   phase at this temperature. The differences in the experimental and
   calculated data indicate that the Mg-Zn-Y system requires to be
   reassessed with more experimental data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{The effect of chemical composition and austenite conditioning on the
   transformation behavior of microalloyed steels}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{27-38}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this investigation, by using continuous cooling torsion (CCT)
   testing, the transformation behavior of four microalloyed steels under
   two circumstances of austenite conditioning and non-conditioning was
   studied. A full scale hot-rolling schedule containing a 13-pass
   deformation was employed for the conditioning of the austenite. The CCT
   tests were then employed till temperature of similar to 540 degrees C
   and the flow curves obtained from this process were analyzed. The
   initial and final microstructures of the steels were studied by optical
   and electron microscopes. Results show that alloying elements would
   decrease the transformation temperature. This effect intensifies with
   the gradual increase of Mo, Nb and Cu as alloying elements added to the
   microalloyed steels. As well, austenite conditioning increased the
   transformation start temperature due mainly to the promotion of
   polygonal ferrite formation that resulted from a pancaked austenite. The
   final microstructures also show that CCT alone would decrease the amount
   of bainite by inducing ferrite transformation in the two phase region.
   In addition, after the transformation begins, the deformation might
   result in the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization in the ferrite
   region. This could lead to two different ferrite grain sizes at the end
   of the CCT. Moreover, the Nb bearing steels show no sign of decreasing
   the strength level after the transformation begins in the
   non-conditioned situation and their microstructure is a mix of polygonal
   ferrite and bainite indicating an absence of probable dynamic
   recrystallization in this condition. In the conditioned cases, however,
   these steels show a rapid decrease of the strength level and their final
   microstructures insinuate that ferrite could have undergone a dynamic
   recrystallization due to deformation. Consequently, no bainite was seen
   in the austenite conditioned Nb bearing steels. The pancaking of
   austenite in the latest cases produced fully polygonal ferrite
   structures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating soil-based management zones (MZ) with crop-based active
   canopy sensors to direct spatially variable N applications has been
   proposed for improving N fertilizer management of corn (Zea mays L.).
   Analyses are needed to evaluate relationships between canopy sensing and
   soil-based MZ and their combined potential to improve N management. The
   objectives of this study were to: (i) identify soil variables related to
   in-season crop canopy reflectance and yield and use these variables to
   delineate MZ for N fertilizer management; and (ii) compare corn yield
   response to different N fertilizer treatments for different MZ. Eight N
   rates (0-274 kg N ha(-1) in 39 kg ha(-1) increments) were applied in
   replicated small plots across six irrigated fields in 2007 to 2008
   throughout central Nebraska. Soil variables evaluated for MZ delineation
   included: apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), soil optical
   reflectance, and landscape topography. Crop response to N was determined
   via active sensor assessments of in-season canopy reflectance
   (chlorophyll index, CI590) and grain yield. Relationships between soil
   and topography data and crop performance were evaluated, with selected
   soil variables used to delineate two MZ within four of the six fields.
   Economic benefits to N application according to soil-based MZ were
   observed in fields with silty clay loam and silt loam soils with
   substantial relief and eroded slopes. Sensor-based algorithms may need
   to be adjusted according to MZ to account for differences in crop N
   response.}},

Abstract = {{Contributions of spray drying to food processing applications are

   drying has not only contributed in drying of fluids but also has played
   a vital role in encapsulation and microencapsulation of valuable foods

   drying is a cost-effective one-step process as compared to other
   encapsulation methods. Encapsulation using spray drying is mainly used
   in the food sector to protect bioactive compounds or functional foods
   from light, temperature, oxidation, etc. This paper reviews the work

Abstract = {{Raw milk cheeses have unique flavor and texture characteristics not
   obtainable in cheeses made from pasteurized milk. However, cheeses made
   from pasteurized milk are widespread, primarily for public health
   reasons. Pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment as a non-thermal
   pasteurization method has shown its ability to keep the flavor and
   natural characteristics of food samples intact, thus providing advantage
   over conventional heat processing. In this study, PEF treatment was
   performed in a continuous treatment chamber, consisting of two parallel
   stainless steel electrodes separated by a 50-mm-thick insulator. A 30-kV
   pulse generator was used to deliver bi-polar square waveform electric
   field to milk sample. Pulse width was 2 A mu s; pulse frequency was 2
   Hz, and up to 120 pulses were applied. Cheese curds were made from raw
   milk, pasteurized milk, and PEF-treated milk, and their proteolysis
   processes were compared using curd slurry incubated at 30 A degrees C
   for 5 days. The profiles of water-soluble peptides were measured using
   an reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC)
   system. The concentration of free amino acids was measured by
   Cd-ninhydrin method. Results indicated that PEF-treated milk has
   intermediate proteolysis profiles between raw milk and pasteurized milk
   in terms of peptide and free amino acid concentration. The results
   showed the potential of making high-quality cheeses by PEF treatment
   without sacrificing the natural characteristics of the cheeses.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the applicability of hyperspectral technique, a fast and
   non-destructive, novel method was investigated for the color
   discrimination of avocados subjected to different treatments. Fruits
   like avocados are coated with edible films to extend their shelf life.
   Using different formulations of coating with varying pectin, beeswax,
   and sorbitol contents, nine different coating preparations with
   potential to influence the ripening behavior of avocados were developed.
   Avocados were coated with these formulations, air-dried, and stored at
   room temperature. Concurrently, the reflectance responses of the avocado
   fruits were measured in 2,151 wavebands (350 to 2500 nm) with a field
   spectroradiometer. To tackle the co-linearity that exists between the
   spectral observations, aggregated 10- and 20-nm data sets were used.
   Using a stepwise procedure, the most effective wavebands capable of
   discriminating treatment effects were selected. By applying a
   discrimination procedure with a well-chosen subset of the selected
   wavebands, treatments were correctly classified with more than 92\%
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Automation is acknowledged by distribution utilities as a successful
   investment strategy to enhance reliability and operation efficiency.
   However, practical approaches that can handle the complex
   decision-making process faced by decision makers to justify the
   long-term financial effects of distribution automation have remained
   scarce. An automated and remote-controlled sectionalizing switch play a
   fundamental role in an automated distribution network. This paper
   introduces a new optimization approach for distribution automation in
   terms of automated and remotely controlled sectionalizing switch
   placement. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is utilized to model
   the problem. The proposed model can be solved with large-scale
   commercial solvers in a computationally efficient manner. The proposed
   sectionalizing switch placement problem considers customer outage costs
   in conjunction with sectionalizing switch capital investment,
   installation, as well as annual operation and maintenance costs. The
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a reliability test
   system and a typical real size system. The presented results indicate
   the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{A novel numerical approach is proposed for determination of the surface
   conditions of ablative materials that can be considered as a counterpart
   of previous studies. The proposed technique benefits from the Euler
   solver that calculates the flowfield outside the boundary layer. The
   Euler solver is coupled with the charring material ablation code that
   accounts for unsteady ablation. In the current study, there is no need
   for determination of the flow and thermal fields in the adjacent
   boundary layers. The proposed approach approximates the boundary-layer
   effects and determines the surface conditions of ablators with minimal
   complexity and computational memory usage. The conjugate gradient method
   is also employed to estimate the boundary conditions at the ablator's
   surface from the measured temperature histories. Two test cases are
   analyzed using numerical experiments with simulated exact and noisy
   measurements, which illustrate the advantages of the proposed method
   applied to such problems.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first miniaturized fluorescent sensor based on algae, with

   complete the fluorescent detection system. The detection system was then
   integrated in a microfluidic chip made from (poly) dimethylsiloxane

   the microfluidic chamber. Algal chlorophyll fluorescence enables
   evaluation of the toxicity of pollutants like herbicides and metals-ions
   from agricultural run-offs. The entirely organic bioassay here presented
   allowed detection of the toxic effects of the herbicide Diuron on

Journal = {{SHOCK WAVES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{1-7}},

Abstract = {{In this study, effective energy from spark discharge for direct blast
   initiation of spherical gaseous detonations is investigated. In the
   experiment, direct initiation of detonation is achieved via a spark
   discharge from a high-voltage and low-inductance capacitor bank and the
   spark energy is estimated from the analysis of the current output. To
   determine the blast wave energy from the powerful spark, the
   time-of-arrival of the blast wave in air is measured at different radii
   using a piezoelectric pressure transducer. Good agreement is found in
   the scaled blast trajectories, i.e., scaled time c (o)center dot t/R (o)
   where c (o) is the ambient sound speed, as a function of blast radius R
   (s)/R (o) between the numerical simulation of a spherical blast wave
   from a point energy source and the experimental results where the
   explosion length scale R (o) is computed using the equivalent spark
   energy from the first 1/4 current discharge cycle. Alternatively, by
   fitting the experimental trajectories data, the blast energy estimated
   from the numerical simulation appears also in good agreement with that
   obtained experimentally using the 1/4 cycle criterion. Using the 1/4
   cycle of spark discharge for the effective energy, direct initiation
   experiments of spherical gaseous detonations are carried out to
   determine the critical initiation energy in C(2)H(2)-2.5O(2) mixtures
   with 70 and 0\% argon dilution. The experimental results obtained from
   the 1/4 cycle of spark discharge agree well with the prediction from two
   initiation models, namely, the Lee's surface energy model and a
   simplified work done model. The main source of discrepancy in the
   comparison can be explained by the uncertainty of cell size measurement
   which is needed for both the semi-empirical models.}},

Abstract = {{The sequential detonation of a layer of explosive surrounding a
   pressurized tube can be used to generate fast, high-density shock waves
   by means of a piston-like implosive pinch travelling at the detonation
   velocity of the explosive. A novel technique has been developed to
   extend the regime of operation to piston velocities greater than the
   detonation velocity of known explosives. This technique consists of
   cutting a slit in the tamper of a conventional explosive shock tube and
   introducing a phased detonation wave into the explosive cladding.
   Preliminary results indicate that quasi-steady shocks can be generated
   in helium with velocities between 13-17 km/s for initial fill pressures
   of 6.9 MPa.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Foaming Al by the powder metallurgy technique was investigated with Sn
   additions (<= 5 wt.\%). The low melting point of Sn and its
   immiscibility with Al creates integrity of the powder mixture during hot
   compaction and foaming. Furthermore, it decreases the surface tension of
   Al, reducing pore coalescence. Different alloying compositions and
   pressing and foaming parameters were evaluated. The materials were
   characterized using differential scanning calorimetry and thermodynamic
   simulation. Foam expansion and pore shape were studied by the
   construction of expansion maps and image analysis on foam
   cross-sections. It was established that, with Sn additions, not only is
   foaming possible at lower temperatures, but also the Sn stabilizes the
   foam, preventing collapse. The number of pores and sphericity values
   increased with increasing Sn concentrations. Optimized process
   parameters leading to an expansion of 375\% for up to 10 mm were
   achieved with 2-3 wt.\% Sn additions, hot pressing at 300 degrees C
   followed by foaming at 725 degrees C. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to flooding because of rapid
   urbanization, installation of complex infrastructure, and changes in the
   precipitation patterns caused by anthropogenic climate change. The
   present paper provides a critical review of the current state-of-the-art
   methods for assessing the impacts of climate change on precipitation at
   the urban catchment scale. Downscaling of results from global
   circulation models or regional climate models to urban catchment scales
   are needed because these models are not able to describe accurately the
   rainfall process at suitable high temporal and spatial resolution for
   urban drainage studies. The downscaled rainfall results are however
   highly uncertain, depending on the models and downscaling methods
   considered. This uncertainty becomes more challenging for rainfall
   extremes since the properties of these extremes do not automatically
   reflect those of average precipitation.
   In this paper, following an overview of some recent advances in the
   development of innovative methods for assessing the impacts of climate
   change on urban rainfall extremes as well as on urban hydrology and
   hydraulics, several existing difficulties and remaining challenges in
   dealing with this assessment are discussed and further research needs
   are described. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Silk fibroin (SF) is extensively investigated in osteoregenerative
   therapy as it combines extraordinary mechanical properties and directs
   calcium-phosphate formation. However, the role of the peptidic fractions
   in inducing the protein mineralization has not been previously decoded.
   In this study, we investigated the mineralization of fibroin-derived
   polypeptides (FDPs), which were obtained through the chymotryptic
   separation of the hydrophobic crystalline (Cp) fractions and of the
   hydrophilic electronegative amorphous (Cs) fractions. When immersed in
   simulated body fluid (SBF), only Cs fragments demonstrated the formation
   of carbonated apatite, providing experimental evidence that the
   mineralization of SF is dictated exclusively by its electronegative
   amino-acidic sequences. The potential of Cs to conceptually mimic the
   role of anionic non-collagenous proteins in biomineralization processes
   was investigated via their incorporation (up to 10\% by weight) in bulk
   osteoid-like dense collagen (DC) gels. Within 6 h in SBF, apatite was
   formed in DC-Cs hybrid gels, and by day 7, carbonated hydroxylapatite
   crystals were extensively formed. This accelerated 3-D mineralization
   resulted in a nine-fold increase in the compressive modulus of the
   hydrogel. The tailoring of the mineralization and mechanical properties
   of hydrogels through hybridization with FDPs could potentially have a
   significant impact on cell delivery and bone regenerative medicine. (C)

Abstract = {{Thermal simulation of the heat affected zone (HAZ) resulting from single

   achieved in an X80 line pipe. The continuous cooling of an X80 steel
   with initial acicular microstructure over Delta t(8-5) from 2 to 50 s
   results in mixed bainite and martensite microstructure at fast cooling
   times, bainite at intermediate cooling times and granular bainite with
   bainite at longer cooling times. These phases were confirmed through
   optical and electron microscopy. The resulting transformation
   temperatures have been assembled and presented as a continuous cooling
   transformation diagram. The toughness of the steel was examined with
   Charpy impact specimens for three simulated HAZ cooling cycles, grain
   coarsened (GC HAZ), intercritically reheated grain coarsened (ICR GC
   HAZ) and an interrupted intercritically reheated grain coarsened (NTR
   ICR GC HAZ). The NTR ICR GC HAZ is a novel HAZ that can result from dual
   torch welding at fast travel speed and close torch spacing. All of the
   thermally simulated HAZ regions showed reduced toughness that was
   attributed to bainitic microstructure and large effective grain sizes.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability of crucial earth resources, such as groundwater, is a
   critical issue. We consider groundwater sustainability a value-driven
   process of intra-and intergenerational equity that balances the
   environment, society, and economy. Synthesizing hydrogeological science
   and current sustainability concepts, we emphasize three sustainability
   approaches: setting multigenerational sustainability goals, backcasting,
   and managing adaptively. As most aquifer problems are long-term
   problems, we propose that multigenerational goals (50 to 100 years) for
   water quantity and quality that acknowledge the connections between
   groundwater, surface water, and ecosystems be set for many aquifers. The
   goals should be set by a watershed-or aquifer-based community in an
   inclusive and participatory manner. Policies for shorter time horizons
   should be developed by backcasting, and measures implemented through
   adaptive management to achieve the long-term goals. Two case histories
   illustrate the importance and complexity of a multigenerational
   perspective and adaptive management. These approaches could transform
   aquifer depletion and contamination to more sustainable groundwater use,
   providing groundwater for current and future generations while
   protecting ecological integrity and resilience.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{67-79}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We propose a simple preconditioning method for accelerating the solution
   of edge-preserving image super-resolution (SR) problems in which a
   linear shift-invariant point spread function is employed. Our technique
   involves reordering the high-resolution (HR) pixels in a similar manner
   to what is done in preconditioning methods for quadratic SR
   formulations. However, due to the edge preserving requirements, the
   Hessian matrix of the cost function varies during the minimization
   process. We develop an efficient update scheme for the preconditioner in
   order to cope with this situation. Unlike some other acceleration
   strategies that round the displacement values between the low-resolution
   (LR) images on the HR grid, the proposed method does not sacrifice the
   optimality of the observation model. In addition, we describe a
   technique for preconditioning SR problems involving rational
   magnification factors. The use of such factors is motivated in part by
   the fact that, under certain circumstances, optimal SR zooms are
   nonintegers. We show that, by reordering the pixels of the LR images,

Title = {{Distribution systems as reservoirs of Naegleria fowleri and other

Abstract = {{Naegleria fowleri is the etiological agent of primary amoebic
   meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rapidly fatal disease. Although PAM
   generally occurs after recreational exposure to contaminated water, two
   fatal cases of PAM were linked to a drinking water supply in Arizona.
   This study tested the ability of distribution system biofilms to be
   reservoirs for N. fowleri and other amoebae. When introduced to
   laboratory pipe loops, N. fowleri attached to biofilms and survived for
   five months. In two full-scale distribution systems, amoebic activity
   was detected in 67\% of biofilm samples tested, irrespective of
   chlorination. Amoebic activity occurred mostly in locations associated
   with stagnant water and high bacterial counts. Legionella were also
   found in 65\% of biofilm samples. Although N. fowleri were never
   detected in field samples, the observed risk factors-high bacterial
   counts, amoebic activity, and the presence of Legionella in
   biofilms-suggest that N. fowleri could thrive in both systems if
   introduced.}},

Abstract = {{A flax-reinforced sandwich structure suitable for replacing wood in the

   properties of Sitka spruce, the most widely used wood species for this
   application, were taken as a benchmark when the new materials were
   developed. The materials were characterized by static and dynamic
   methods to determine the dynamic Young's modulus, shear modulus,
   internal friction, and static mechanical properties. Based on the
   material characterization, a hand lay-up process with a two-part closed
   mold and internal pressure bladder was developed and six prototype
   ukuleles were manufactured. The results show that the flax-reinforced
   sandwich structure can successfully act as a top plate and that an
   efficient manufacturing process can be developed to produce monocoque
   string musical instruments out of composite materials.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{455-464}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{TiH2 decomposes over a range of temperatures strongly influenced by
   diverse factors including particle size. In the present research, a
   systematic study of the dehydrogenation behavior of TiH2 powder of
   different particle size distribution was undertaken with the aid of
   thermogravimetric analysis. The effect of this parameter on aluminum
   foaming was evaluated. It was found that when TiH2 exceeds a critical
   particle size (around 50 mu m), dehydrogenation occurs as a single
   desorption event with onset temperatures around 500 A degrees C. The
   reduction of particle size, besides reducing the onset of hydrogen
   release, decreases the dehydrogenation rate. As a result, the first
   dehydrogenation event gets sharper and tends to overlap with the second
   with increasing particle size. The use of selected powders on foaming
   showed that the final foam expansion and porosity features, such as pore
   size, pore density, and homogeneity are largely influenced by the
   particle size distribution of the foaming powder. TiH2 of the largest
   particle size was the most suitable for foaming pure aluminum.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study of the core structure and composition of a hedgehog
   defect in a mixture of a nematic liquid crystal and a second
   non-nematogenic component is presented. Fractionation of the components
   between the bulk and the defect core is rigorously considered by using
   solution thermodynamics. Two complementary approaches are used to
   analyze this problem: a multiscale model based on a Landau-de Gennes
   free energy functional that is solved numerically, and a macroscopic
   sharp interface phase-equilibrium model, which considers the defect core
   as an isotropic phase in equilibrium with a distorted nematic phase and
   that under certain limiting conditions yields equations that reveal the
   mechanisms that select defect core structure, geometry, and composition.
   It is found that the non-nematogenic component segregates preferentially
   to the defect core, and the defect radius increases as the concentration
   of the second component and the temperature are increased. As previously
   predicted for pure liquid crystals, close to saturation conditions the
   radius increases significantly, and a small range of supersaturation or
   superheating is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure of Ordinary Portland Cement paste subjected to early age
   carbonation curing was studied to examine the effect of early
   carbonation on performance of paste at different ages. The study was
   intended to understand the mechanism of concrete carbonation at early
   age through the microstructure development of its cement paste. Early
   carbonation was carried out after 18-hour initial controlled air curing.
   The microstructure characterized by XRD. TGA, (29)Si NMR and SEM was
   correlated to strength gain, CO(2) uptake and pH change. It was found
   that early carbonation could accelerate early strength while allowing
   subsequent hydration. The short term carbonation created a
   microstructure with more strength-contributing solids than conventional
   hydration. Calcium hydroxide was converted to calcium carbonates, and
   calcium-silicate-hydrate became intermingled with carbonates, generating
   an amorphous calcium-silicate-hydrocarbonate binding phase. Carbonation
   modified C-S-H retained its original gel structure. The re-hydration
   procedure applied after carbonation was essential in increasing late
   strength and durability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sub- and super-critical dynamics of an axially moving beam subjected
   to a transverse harmonic excitation force is examined for the cases
   where the system is tuned to a three-to-one internal resonance as well

   this gyroscopic system is discretized by employing Galerkin's technique
   which yields a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations. For the
   system in the sub-critical speed regime, the periodic solutions are
   studied using the pseudo-arclength continuation method, while the global
   dynamics is investigated numerically. In the latter case, bifurcation
   diagrams of Poincare maps are obtained via direct time integration.
   Moreover, for a selected set of system parameters, the dynamics of the
   system is presented in the form of time histories, phase-plane
   portraits, and Poincare maps. Finally, the effects of different system
   parameters on the amplitude-frequency responses as well as bifurcation

Abstract = {{We consider the decoding of regular low density parity-check codes with
   a Gallager-B message-passing algorithm built exclusively from faulty
   computing devices. We propose an extension of the Gallager-B algorithm
   where messages can be repeated to provide increased fault tolerance, and
   use EXIT functions to derive its average performance. Thresholds are
   obtained both for the channel quality and the faultiness of the decoder.
   We argue that decoding complexity is central to the analysis of faulty
   decoding and compare the complexity of decoding with a faulty decoder
   instead of a reliable decoder, for a fixed channel condition and
   residual error rate. Finally, we show that when the message repetitions
   in the extended Gallager-B algorithm are scheduled optimally, a small
   complexity overhead with respect to a reliable decoder provides large
   gains in fault tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{A lot of effort has been invested into characterizing the convergence
   rates of gradient based algorithms for non-linear convex optimization.
   Recently, motivated by large datasets and problems in machine learning,
   the interest has shifted towards distributed optimization. In this work
   we present a distributed algorithm for strongly convex constrained
   optimization. Each node in a network of n computers converges to the
   optimum of a strongly convex, L-Lipchitz continuous, separable objective
   at a rate O(log(root nT)/T) where T is the number of iterations. This
   rate is achieved in the online setting where the data is revealed one at
   a time to the nodes, and in the batch setting where each node has access
   to its full local dataset from the start. The same convergence rate is
   achieved in expectation when the subgradients used at each node are
   corrupted with additive zero-mean noise.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a model for the decision-making of a Demand
   Response (DR) program operator as an adaptive agent participating in a
   competitive electricity market. The model focuses on an electricity
   retailer stimulating DR as a means of avoiding high balancing market
   prices. Nevertheless, we demonstrate the ability to extend the model to
   other actors who could capitalize on the value of demand
   flexibility-e.g. wind power producers looking to offset output
   variability. The model considers voluntary demand modifications whose
   materialization, subject to the uncertainty of consumer behavior,results
   in redistribution of consumption over a short time frame. As the
   retailer is modeled via an adaptive agent, it has the potential to learn
   from both consumer behavior and market outcomes. Here, we implement a
   reinforcement learning approach with the objective of allowing the agent
   to increase its profit by identifying the conditions under which DR
   should be stimulated. We validate the proposed agent-based model as a
   tool to quantify DR potential in a market setting.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses practical consensus-based distributed optimization
   algorithms. In consensus-based optimization algorithms, nodes interleave
   local gradient descent steps with consensus iterations. Gradient steps
   drive the solution to a minimizer, while the consensus iterations
   synchronize the values so that all nodes converge to a network-wide
   optimum when the objective is convex and separable. The consensus update
   requires communication. If communication is synchronous and nodes wait
   to receive one message from each of their neighbors before updating then
   progress is limited by the slowest node. To be robust to failing or
   stalling nodes, asynchronous communications should be used. Asynchronous
   protocols using bi-directional communications cause deadlock, and so
   one-directional protocols are necessary. However, with one-directional
   asynchronous protocols it is no longer possible to guarantee the
   consensus matrix is doubly stochastic. At the same time it is essential
   that the coordination protocol achieve consensus on the average to avoid
   biasing the optimization objective. We report on experiments running
   Push-Sum Distributed Dual Averaging for convex optimization in a MPI
   cluster. The experiments illustrate the benefits of using asynchronous
   consensus-based distributed optimization when some nodes are unreliable
   and may fail or when messages experience time-varying delays.}},

Abstract = {{Fundamental limits of the cognitive interference channel (CIC) with two
   pairs of transmitter-receiver have been under exploration for several
   years. In this paper, we study the discrete memoryless cognitive
   interference channel (DM-CIC) in which the cognitive transmitter
   non-causally knows the full message of the primary transmitter. The
   capacity of this channel is not known in general; it is only known in
   some special cases. Inspired by the concept of less noisy broadcast
   channel (BC), in this work we introduce the notion of less noisy
   cognitive interference channel. Unlike BC, due to the inherent asymmetry
   of the cognitive channel, two different less noisy channels are
   distinguishable; these are named the primary-less-noisy and
   cognitive-less-noisy channels. We derive capacity region for the latter
   case by introducing inner and outer bounds on the capacity of the DM-CIC
   and showing that these bounds coincide for the cognitive-less-noisy
   channel. Having established the capacity region, we prove that
   superposition coding is the optimal encoding technique.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a fundamental shift from ever more complex single cores
   to single chip multi-core (CMP) designs. Along with this opportunity
   come major challenges; notably the sheer size of the CMP design space.
   An integrated suite of tools is needed that provides life-cycle support
   from early proto typing to final design. Here we present ArchFP, a
   ftoorplanning tool targeted towards prototyping of pre-RTL CMP design
   concepts. As such, it is complementary to traditional ftoorplanners that
   are more appropriate later in the design cycle.
   An ArchFP ftoorplan is specified using a model similar to that supported
   by GUI toolkits such as Java Swing and Windows Presentation Foundation.
   The ftoorplan design is comprised of a hierarchy of components placed
   within containers, called Layout Managers (LMs), that provide a variety
   of layout algorithms. Current LMs include a generalized grid LM, one
   that supports geographic hints for component placement, and a fixed
   layout of imported subcomponents. ArchFP is easy to extend with
   additional LMs that leverage these initial layout algorithms to support
   more specific design elements such as NoC configurations, cache
   partitioning strategies, SIMD design, etc. To the best of our knowledge,
   no one has previous used this approach for ftoorplanning. ArchFP is
   written in C++ for UNIX systems, and is free for download from
   http://lava.cs.virginia.edularchfp.
   We demonstrate the utility of ArchFP in the study of power delivery and
   temperature constraints in likely CMP configurations of Penryn-like
   cores over four technology scales.}},

Abstract = {{In most aging transformers, windings failures are caused by the
   deterioration of the insulation, leading to arcing and short circuits.
   Vibrations in a transformer are generated by different forces appearing
   in the core and winding during the operation. Winding vibrations result
   from the electromagnetic forces that are generated by the interaction of
   the current in a winding with leakage flux. These forces are
   proportional to the square of the load current, and therefore vibration
   is always there. VibroFibre (TM) technology was invented by QPS to
   monitor the vibration of the end windings. It works according to optical
   interference, i.e., when subjected to vibration, the signal reflected
   off the sensor is interpreted as intensity changes resulting from the
   change in the length of a fiber Bragg grating-based cavity. However, as
   temperature rises, the fringes also move making it necessary for other
   control measures to track this temperature rise. These counter measures
   effectively constitute indirect temperature measurement during this
   vibration monitoring. In other words, one single sensor can give two
   critical parameters The same technology is now adapted to be applied to
   diagnose transformers. The twin cavity sensor is packaged to measure
   trace moisture in oil. This moisture sensor has built in temperature
   compensation as well as direct temperature read out. This paper will
   describe the theoretical basis of this twin cavity sensor. In addition,
   we will also describe the fiber laser sensor for PD measurement. Because
   of the fact these PD sensors are to be mounted on the transformer wall.
   QPS continues to work on a miniature acoustic chamber. The paper will
   also discuss conceptually the algorithm behind the location of PD events
   in the context of a four wall transformer. Finally we will discuss in
   details the moisture sensor cable of reading moisture down to 1ppm with
   built in temperature compensation. Actually this moisture sensor is
   capable to give direct readout of the oil temperature which is the first
   in the world.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of an explosive-driven gas gun that
   can be scaled to launch a wide range of projectiles at velocities of
   interest for ordnance testing and hypervelocity impact. Explosives are
   used to sequentially implode a pressurized tube to shock-compressing a
   light gas to very high pressure and temperature. This scheme permits the
   transfer of the sizable energetic yield of high explosives to the
   projectile while cushioning it from significant hydrodynamic loading.
   The use of explosives leads to a number of unique design considerations
   including launcher expansion, the gas cumulation process, and the
   influence of projectile areal density on the launch cycle. These design
   issues are analyzed with hydrocode simulations. This paper also presents
   the parallel experimental development of a laboratory scale launcher
   capable of accelerating a 0.1 gram projectile to 9.1 km/s and a field
   device to launch a 19 gram FSP to 3 km/s.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of ceramic particles into ballistic fabrics has been

   The present study investigates the failure behaviour of two
   particle-laden mixtures, a shear thickening fluid and an elastomer-based
   matrix, not integrated into fabrics. Evidence of particle deformation
   within impacted STFs is presented, providing a possible explanation for
   the performance limitations of STF-impregnated armours. The behaviour of
   the mixtures at failure is discussed in relation to the possible

Abstract = {{In the present study, the ballistic response of chromium-sulfur CERMETS
   is investigated. A CERMET is a mesoscale ceramic-metal composite. The
   chromium sulfur CERMET was manufactured using self-propagating
   high-temperature synthesis, a process where the material is created
   under a self-sustaining combustion reaction between the chromium and
   sulfur. This type of synthesis allows the creation of near-net shape
   structures and offers the possibility of tuning material properties and
   material behavior by changing the reactant composition. High-speed
   ballistic impact (similar to 1000 m/s) of samples with initial molar
   concentrations ranging from {[}1.15:1] to {[}4:1] showed a transition in
   response from purely brittle to quasi-ductile when the molar ratio is
   above 3:1. Microscopy of the impacted samples revealed that this
   ductility is sustained by significant deformation of metal chromium
   grains supported in the matrix of chromium sulfide ceramic.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this applied research was to evaluate the performance of
   polymer-modified cement-based mortars (PMCM) in the laboratory and in
   the field for repairing damaged concrete surfaces exposed to cold
   climates. Twenty-five commercially available PMCM: seven containing
   styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) and 18 containing acrylics were selected
   and evaluated. They were compared with a pure cement-based mortar
   containing 8\% silica fume by weight of the cement, with a water/binder
   (cement + silica fume) ratio (W/B) of 0.31. All the mortars were
   subjected to mechanical and durability tests, such as thermal
   compatibility with base concrete, drying shrinkage, permeability,
   abrasion-erosion resistance, bond strength, compressive strength and
   freezing and thawing cycles, etc. The thermal compatibility with the
   base concrete at temperatures from -50 degrees C to +50 degrees C was
   used as a pre-selection test. Test data showed that the PMCM, even from
   the same family, i.e. SBR or acrylics, displayed mixed results, with
   their performance varying from one manufacturer's product to another.
   This paper also presents the performance of three best selected mortars
   (based on laboratory test data), installed on two spillways of a dam
   situated in a severe cold climate. These mortars were exposed to the
   abrasive action of water-borne sediments as well as the stresses related
   to hydraulic pressure and rigorous freezing and thawing and
   drying/wetting cycles. The eleven inspections so far have found that
   these three products are still performing well after an exposure to very
   low temperatures for a period of six years.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for application of Explosive Free Rock Breakage Systems
   (EFRB) for both civil and mining engineering, as well as the space
   industry, is growing. A number of potential novel EFRB techniques have
   been studied and reviewed, as well as their advantages and
   disadvantages. The application of microwave assisted mechanical breaking
   of rocks in terms of application to full face tunneling machines and
   drilling has been identified. This paper highlights the work being
   undertaken in the Geo-Mechanics Labs of McGill University to make this
   application a reality. The effect of microwave radiation on strength
   reduction of rocks has been investigated by extensive laboratory tests
   as well as numerical modeling. Physical and mechanical properties of
   different rocks are examined before and after microwave exposure at
   various durations and power levels at the frequency of 2.45 GHz.
   Microscopic analyses highlight the fracture developments in the rocks
   being exposed to microwaves. The results show a significant reduction in
   compressive and tensile strength while the exposure time and power level
   increase.}},

   is applied to the quantification of A2 protein, a highly immunogenic

Abstract = {{We present a study of gold nanopyramids and their optical properties. A
   comparison with the extinction properties of gold nanorods and nanocubes
   is also undertaken. The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is
   used for the study of optical properties. The nanopyramids display a
   dual plasmon resonance when excited with a perpendicularly polarized
   signal due to the excitation of dipole and quadrupole modes. The
   quadrupole modes are not strongly affected by changing the height of the
   nanopyramids whereas the dipole mode is redshifted with increasing the
   height of the nanopyramids. The quadrupole mode could be of interest in
   some applications where the shorter wavelength resonance is desired. The
   quadrupole and dipole modes are located at 620 nm and 765 nm
   respectively. This band is used for both intensity and wavelength
   modulated biosensors. Furthermore, the electric field is enhanced in the
   case of the nanopyramids which is considered as another advantage in

Abstract = {{Optical space switching is an important functionality in dense
   wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) optical communication systems,
   particularly within reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers
   (ROADMs) {[}1]. Current commercially available ROADMs are based on
   micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) or liquid crystal switches but
   these do not have sufficient switching speed for future network
   requirements. Power consumption (i.e. energy per switching operation
   multiplied by switching rate) is a very important parameter in the
   selection of a switching technology. Space switches based on current
   injection in silicon have been reported with nanosecond switching speeds
   and average power consumption on the order of mW {[}2], which becomes
   significant if many switches are required in a fabric. Electro-optic
   (EO) switches, which utilize the Pockels effect in which the refractive
   index changes when an external voltage is applied {[}3], only dissipate
   power when the switch state is changed. Electro-optic switches can be
   implemented either as non-resonant designs (for example the Mach-Zehnder
   interferometer (MZI)) or as resonant designs (for example the Fabry
   Perot interferometer (FPI)). In this study we compare the switching
   energies of electro-optic MZI and FPI switches by considering the
   capacitance of the switch, which is determined by the length of the
   active region of the switch. We show that for a non-resonant switch,
   switching energy increases linearly with device length, regardless of
   applied voltage, and so is simply determined by the strength of the
   electro-optic coefficient. We assume that the resonant switch is
   implemented as a switchable comb filter {[}4], with a free-spectral
   range equal to twice the wavelength spacing. This then fixes the
   interferometer length. As a result the resonant switch has requires
   significantly less switching energy for the same material parameters and
   is thus of interest for future ROADM implementations.}},

Abstract = {{The Lagrangian block advection and diffusion is developed as an
   alternative numerical procedure to the solution of the transport
   equation. The blocks are the computational elements, which are defined
   by the zero, first and second moments of the blocks. The centres of mass
   of the blocks move with the advection velocity. The second moment of the
   blocks increases at a rate proportional to the diffusivity. The accuracy
   of the simulations by the Lagrangian block method is assessed by
   comparing the block simulation with an exact solution of the
   advection-and-diffusion equation. Unlike most numerical methods, the
   error associated with the Lagrangian block method is small and is not
   cumulative even when a very coarse block size is employed for the
   computation. Artificial numerical diffusion error is totally avoidable
   when Lagrangian blocks are used to do the computation.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical investigation of steady, two-dimensional, ice-water systems
   with laminar buoyancy-driven natural convection in the water and
   conduction in the ice is presented. The calculation domains were
   rectangular enclosures, cooled and heated on opposite vertical side
   walls, and insulated (adiabatic) on the top and bottom walls. The
   long-term goal is to contribute to the development of mathematical
   models and numerical solution methods suitable for use as costeffective
   computational tools in the design of enhanced ice-water seasonal
   cold-storage (IWSCS) systems. A fixed-grid, co-located, finite volume
   method (FVM) was adapted for use in this work. Predictions were obtained
   using a variable-property model (VPM) and also a constant-property model
   (CPM). In simulations with the CPM, all properties of liquid water,
   except its density, were evaluated at several different reference
   temperatures and assumed constant, and the thermal conductivity of ice
   was pegged to its value at the melting temperature. The reference
   temperature that leads to the lowest differences between the results
   yielded by the VPM and CPM was determined, and it is the main
   contribution of this work. The reasons for seeking such a reference
   temperature are two-fold: 1) the CPM facilitates cost-effective
   simulations for designing IWSCS systems optimized for specific
   applications; and 2) porous metal foams are often embedded in IWSCS
   systems to improve their performance, and practical volume-averaged
   approaches to the modeling of fluid flow and heat transfer in such
   composite systems are usually based on a CPM. The computed streamlines,
   water-ice interface positions, and values of the average Nusselt number
   on the hot wall are also presented for the cases considered.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the aeroelastic oscillations of wing-like structures
   with the aim to detect at an incipient stage the presence of structural
   cracks. Such oscillations occur normally in certain flight evolutions of
   aircraft or can be excited by piezoelectric actuators bonded on the wing
   structure. These oscillations can be used to detect at an early stage
   the presence of cracks by monitoring the response of several
   piezoelectric sensors bonded on both sides of the structure during the
   aeroelastic oscillations. The proposed method of crack detection uses
   pairs of piezoelectric strip sensors bonded on the opposite sides of the
   structure and is based on the fact that the presence of a crack causes a
   difference between the strains measured by the two sensors of a pair.
   The structural analysis presented in this paper uses a nonlinear model
   for the cracks and a finite element formulation for the piezoelectric
   strips coupled with the structure. A 3D panel method developed by the
   authors is used to determine the unsteady aerodynamic loads acting on
   the oscillating wing structure. The dynamic analysis in the time domain
   is performed for the oscillating structures with piezoelectric strips
   subjected to unsteady aerodynamic loads. In the present work, the
   efficiency of this crack detection method is studied in realistic
   situations, by considering the aeroelastic oscillations in flexion and
   torsion of a wing-like structure which are excited in one of the
   following modes: (i) the aeroelastic oscillations excited by a pair of
   piezoelectric actuators bonded on the opposite sides of the structure;
   (ii) the aeroelastic oscillations excited by the harmonic oscillation of
   the angle of attack corresponding to the flight in atmospheric
   turbulence (harmonic gust); (iii) the aeroelastic oscillations generated
   by a sudden change in the angle of attack or in the airplane velocity
   due to a pilot control input. The numerical simulations for these cases
   have been performed by the simultaneous solution of the coupled
   equations of unsteady fluid flow and of the structure deformation
   motion, by using a finite element method for the dynamic of the
   structures with cracks and bonded piezoelectric strips, and a 3D panel

Abstract = {{Proposed in this paper is a methodology to synthesize a RCCC four-bar
   linkage intended for pick-and-place operations. The synthesis problem is
   set in the context of rigid-body guidance, which can be solved exactly
   for up to four prescribed poses of the coupler link As a consequence,
   for a pick-and-place operation, the selection of the unspecified two
   intermediate poses is thus left up to the mechanism designer's judgment.
   In this paper, we propose a method to determine the two intermediate
   poses resorting to the concept of robustness. In fact, robustness is
   needed in this context to overcome the presence of uncertainty due to
   the selection of the two unspecified poses. To this end, a theoretical
   framework for model-based robust design is invoked and a general
   methodology for robust kinematic synthesis is laid down. A numerical
   example is included to validate the concepts and illustrate the
   application of the methodology proposed here.}},

Abstract = {{Dry low emissions premixed combustion systems have the ability to give
   larger NOx emissions reduction in comparison to diffusion type of
   combustors. However, these systems are prone to flashback because the
   fuel and oxidizers are mixed upstream of the combustion chamber. This is
   particularly true for premixed systems burning high-reactivity fuels due
   to their higher flame speed. Flashback is undesirable in gas turbines
   because it leads to overheating and failure of fuel nozzles and
   premixing sections. Recently, a novel application of Plasma Actuation
   through non-thermal Dielectric Barrier Discharge has been shown to
   significantly delay flashback in the core flow along the axis of the
   premixer. Building on this successful endeavour, efforts were directed
   to prove the effectiveness of the control method in situations where
   flashback was triggered in the boundary layer. Results show that the
   current application delays the occurrence of flashback in the boundary
   layer of the premixer to higher equivalence ratios. Improvements in the
   combustor operability margin of 10 to 14\% when burning natural gas-air
   mixtures, and of about 3.5\% when replacing the fuel by an equimolar
   mixture of natural gas and hydrogen, were achieved. It was found that
   the proposed application of plasma actuation is even more efficient in
   preventing flashback in the boundary layer than in the core flow.}},

Abstract = {{Higher aircraft energy efficiency may be achieved by minimizing the
   clearance between the rotating blade tips and respective surrounding
   casing. A common technical solution consists in the implementation of an
   abradable liner which improves both the operational safety and the
   efficiency of modern turbomachines. Recently, unexpected abradable wear
   removal mechanisms were observed in experimental set-ups and during
   maintenance procedures. The present study introduces a numerical
   strategy capable to address this occurrence.
   After focusing on the analysis of the experimental results, the good
   agreement between experimental observations and numerical results is
   illustrated in terms of critical stress levels within the blade as well
   as final wear profiles of the abradable liner. New blade designs are
   also explored in order to assess the impact of blade design on the
   outbreak of the interaction phenomenon. The prevalence of three dominant
   parameters in the interaction onset is shown: (1) blade design, (2)
   abradable material mechanical properties and (3) the need for a global
   distortion of the casing to synchronize blade-tip/abradable coating
   contacts.}},

Abstract = {{In the increasingly modern and technological world, it has become common
   to use global navigation satellite system (GNSS), such as Global
   Positioning System (GPS), receivers, and Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS) in everyday life. GPS-equipped mobile devices and various Web
   services help users worldwide to determine their locations in real-time
   and to explore unfamiliar land areas using virtual tools. From the
   beginning, geospatial technologies have been driven by the need to make
   efficient use of natural resources. More recently, GPS-equipped
   autonomous vehicles and aircraft have been under development to
   facilitate technological processes, such as agricultural operations,
   transportation, or scouting, with limited or virtual human control. As
   outdoor robotics relies upon a number of principles related to science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), using such an
   instructional context for non-formal education has been promising. As a
   result, the Geospatial and Robotics Technologies for the 21st Century
   program discussed in this chapter integrates educational robotics and
   GPS/GIS technologies to provide educational experiences through summer
   camps, 4-H clubs, and afterschool programs. The project's impact was
   assessed in terms of: a) youth learning of computer programming,
   mathematics, geospatial and engineering/robotics concepts as well as b)
   youth attitudes and motivation towards STEM-related disciplines. An
   increase in robotics, GPS, and GIS learning questionnaire scores and a
   stronger self-efficacy in relevant STEM areas have been found through a
   set of project-related assessment instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate Gaussian densities are pervasive in pattern recognition and
   machine learning. A central operation that appears in most of these
   areas is to measure the difference between two multivariate Gaussians.
   Unfortunately, traditional measures based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
   divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance do not satisfy all metric
   axioms necessary for many algorithms. In this paper we propose a
   modification for the KL divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance, for
   multivariate Gaussian densities, that transforms the two measures into
   distance metrics. Next, we show how these metric axioms impact the
   unfolding process of manifold learning algorithms. Finally, we
   illustrate the efficacy of the proposed metrics on two different
   manifold learning algorithms when used for motion clustering in video
   data. Our results show that, in this particular application, the new
   proposed metrics lead to significant boosts in performance (at least
   7\%) when compared to other divergence measures.}},

Title = {{An interaction stress analysis of nanoscale elastic asperity contacts}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{157-166}},
Abstract = {{A new contact mechanics model is presented and experimentally examined
   at the nanoscale. The current work addresses the well-established field
   of contact mechanics, but at the nanoscale where interaction stresses
   seem to be effective. The new model combines the classic Hertz theory
   with the new interaction stress concept to provide the stress field in
   contact bodies with adhesion. Hence, it benefits from the simplicity of
   non-adhesive models, while offering the same applicability as more
   complicated models. In order to examine the model, a set of atomic force
   microscopy experiments were performed on substrates made from
   single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper. The stress field in the
   substrate was obtained by superposition of the Hertzian stress field and
   the interaction stress field, and then compared to other contact models.
   Finally, the effect of indentation depth on the stress field was studied
   for the interaction model as well as for the Hertz,
   Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov, and Johnson-Kendall-Roberts models. Thus, the
   amount of error introduced by using the Hertz theory to model contacts
   with adhesion was found for different indentation depths. It was
   observed that in the absence of interaction stress data, the Hertz
   theory predictions led to smaller errors compared to other
   contact-with-adhesion models.}},

Title = {{Numerical Investigation of Abradable Coating Removal in Aircraft Engines
   Through Plastic Constitutive Law}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In the field of turbomachines, better engine performances are achieved
   by reducing possible parasitic leakage flows through the closure of the
   clearance distance between blade tips and surrounding stationary casings
   and direct structural contact is now considered as part of the normal
   life of aircraft engines. In order to avoid catastrophic scenarios due
   to direct tip incursions into a bare metal housing, implementation of
   abradable coatings has been widely recognized as a robust solution
   offering several advantages: reducing potential nonrepairable damage to
   the incurring blade as well as adjusting operating clearances, in situ,
   to accept physical contact events. Nevertheless, the knowledge on the
   process of material removal affecting abradable coatings is very limited
   and it seems urgent to develop dedicated predicting numerical tools. The
   present work introduces a macroscopic model of the material removal
   through a piecewise linear plastic constitutive law which allows for
   real time access to the current abradable liner profile within a
   time-stepping approach of the explicit family. In order to reduce
   computational loads, the original finite element formulation of the
   blade of interest is projected onto a reduced-order basis embedding
   centrifugal stiffening. First results prove convergence in time and
   space and show that the frequency content of the blade response is
   clearly sensitive to the presence of abradable material. The continuous
   opening of the clearance between the blade tip and the casing due to the
   material removal yields larger amplitudes of motion and new scenarios of
   structural divergence far from the usual linear conditions provided by
   the well-known Campbell diagrams. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004951]}},

Abstract = {{Banana fruit quality and maturity stages were studied at three different
   temperatures, viz., 20, 25, and 30 degrees C by using hyperspectral
   imaging technique in the visible and near infrared (400-1000 nm)
   regions. The quality parameters like moisture content, firmness and
   total soluble solids were determined and correlated with the spectral
   data. The spectral data were analyzed using the partial least square
   analysis. The optimal wavelengths were selected using predicted residual
   error sum of squares. The principal component analysis was also used to
   test the variability of the observed data. By using multiple linear
   regressions (MLR), models were established based on the optimal wave
   lengths to predict the quality attributes. The coefficient of
   determination was found to be 0.85, 0.87, and 0.91 for total soluble
   solids, moisture and firmness of the banana fruits, respectively. The
   change in TSS and firmness of banana fruits stored at different
   temperatures, viz, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C during the ripening process
   followed the polynomial relationships and the change in moisture content
   followed a linear relationship at different maturity stages. (C) 2011
