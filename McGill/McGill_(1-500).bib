Title = {{Cold spray deposition of a Ni-WC composite coating and its dry sliding

Abstract = {{Ni-WC composite are ideal protective coatings against wear that are
   often fabricated using laser cladding. However, high temperature of
   laser cladding and associated materials melting may result in
   non-homogenous distribution of WC particles, as well as decarburization
   and considerable residual stress and a deterioration of the wear
   resistance. An alternative is to use cold spray to deposit WC based
   composite coatings. The lower temperature allows one to retain the
   composition of initial WC feedstock but the cold spray process is only
   recently being researched for development of composite coatings. In this
   study, Ni and Ni-WC coatings were fabricated by cold spray. The WC and
   Ni powders were fed to a de Laval nozzle from separate hoppers with
   independent feed rates. By adjusting feedrates, a blend of Ni-362 vol\%
   WC was sprayed, which resulted in a composite coating of Ni-10.5 vol.\%
   WC. The influence of WC on Ni deposition was examined via
   microstructural characterization, including morphology of the coating's
   top surface and polished cross sections. Mechanical properties of
   coatings were improved by incorporation of WC into the Ni matrix. The
   wear behavior of coatings was studied with reciprocating sliding wear
   tests using a 6.35 mm diameter WC-Co ball. All tests were conducted in
   dry air with a sliding speed of 3 minis, a track length of 10 mm, and
   normal load of 5N. WC-Ni coatings were more wear resistant than
   cold-sprayed Ni coatings. The correlations between worn surface
   morphologies, subsurface microstructure induced by wear and the wear
   behavior of the coatings was discussed. Microstructural analyses showed
   a mechanically mixed layer (MML) on the top of worn surfaces consisting
   of compacted oxides. It was revealed that the presence of hard particles
   in the Ni-WC coating facilitated fast development of the MML, as well as
   stabilized the MML, characterized by less plastic flow, fewer cracking
   and higher hardness. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{NF-kappa B signalling and cell fate decisions in response to a short
   pulse of tumour necrosis factor}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{In tissues and tumours, cell behaviours are regulated by multiple
   time-varying signals. While in the laboratory cells are often exposed to
   a stimulus for the duration of the experiment, in vivo exposures may be
   much shorter. In this study, we monitored NF-kappa B and caspase
   signalling in human cancer cells treated with a short pulse of Tumour
   Necrosis Factor (TNF). TNF is an inflammatory cytokine that can induce
   both the pro-survival NF-kappa B-driven gene transcription pathway and
   the pro-apoptotic caspase pathway. We find that a few seconds of
   exposure to TNF is sufficient to activate the NF-kappa B pathway in HeLa
   cells and induce apoptotic cell death in both HeLa and Kym-1 cells.
   Strikingly, a 1-min pulse of TNF can be more effective at killing than a
   1-hour pulse, indicating that in addition to TNF concentration, duration
   of exposure also coordinates cell fate decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The hyperelastic behavior of a thin square silicone rubber plate has
   been investigated analytically, numerically and experimentally; the case
   of small-amplitude vibrations has been considered, as well as the case
   of large static deflection under aerostatic pressure. The Mooney-Rivlin
   hyperelastic model has been chosen to describe the material nonlinear
   elasticity. The material parameters have been identified by a fitting
   procedure on the results of a uniaxial traction test. For the analytical
   model, the equations of motion have been obtained by a unified energy
   approach, and geometrical nonlinearities are modeled according to the
   Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory. A numerical model has also been
   developed by using a commercial Finite-Element code. In the experiments,
   the silicone rubber plate has been fixed to a heavy metal frame; a
   certain in-plane pre-load, applied by stretching the plate, has been
   given in order to ensure a flatness of the surface. An experimental
   modal analysis has been conducted; results have been used to identify
   the applied in-plane loads by optimization procedure with two different
   models: a numerical and an analytical one. The first four experimental
   and numerical natural modes and frequencies are in good agreement with
   the experiments after the pre-load identification. The static deflection
   has been measured experimentally for different pressures. Results have
   been compared to those obtained by analytical and numerical models. The
   static deflections are also satisfactorily compared, up to a deflection
   50 times larger than the plate thickness, corresponding to a 30 percent
   strain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ag nanoparticles (nAg) are used in various consumer products and a
   significant fraction is eventually discharged with municipal wastewater
   (WW). In this study we assessed the release of Ag from
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)- and citrate-coated 80 rim nAg in aerobic WW
   effluent and mixed liquor and the related changes in nAg size, using
   single particle ICP-MS (spICP-MS). The concentration of dissolved (non
   particulate) Ag in WW effluent was 0.89 +/- 0.05 ppb at 168 h and was
   71\% lower than in deionized (DI) water, in batch reactors spiked with 5
   x 10(6) PVP-nAg particles/mL (10 mu g/L), an environmentally relevant
   concentration. Dissolved Ag in WW was partly reformed into similar to 22
   nm nAg(x)S(y) by inorganic sulfides and organosulfur dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) after 120 h, whereas the parent nAg mean diameter decreased
   to 65.89 +/- 0.9 nm. Reformation of nAg(x)S(y) from Ag+ also occurred in
   cysteine solutions but not in DI water, or humic and fulvic acid
   solutions. Dissolution experiments with nAg in WW mixed liquor showed
   qualitatively similar dissolution trends. Time-of-flight secondary ion
   mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   analyses indicated binding of thiol- and amine-containing DOC as well as
   inorganic sulfides with nAg. Those WW components, as well as limited
   dissolved oxygen, decreased dissolution in WW.}},

Abstract = {{Surface bound guidance cues and gradients are vital for directing
   cellular processes during development and repair. In vivo, these cues
   are often presented within a soft extracellular matrix with elastic
   moduli E < 10 kPa, but in vitro haptotaxis experiments have been
   conducted primarily on hard substrates with elastic moduli in the MPa to
   GPa range. Here, a technique is presented for patterning haptotactic
   proteins with nanometer resolution on soft substrates with physiological
   elasticity. A new nanocontact printing process was developed that
   circumvented the use of plasma activation that was found to alter the
   mechanical properties of the substrate. A dissolvable poly(vinyl
   alcohol) film was first patterned by lift-off nanocontact printing, and
   in turn printed onto the soft substrate, followed by dissolution of the
   film in water. An array of 100 unique digital nanodot gradients (DNGs),
   consisting of millions of 200 X 200 nm(2) protein nanodots, was
   patterned in less than 5 min with with <5\% average deviation from the
   original gradient design. DNGs of netrin-1, a known protein guidance
   cue, were patterned, and the unpatterned surface was backfilled with a
   reference surface consisting of 75\% polyethylene glycol grafted with
   polylysine and 25\% poly-D-lysine. Haptotaxis of C2C12 myoblasts
   demonstrated the functionality of the DNGs patterned on soft substrates.
   In addition, high densities of netrin-1 were observed to induce cell
   spreading, while live imaging of sinusoidal control gradients
   highlighted cell migration and navigation by ``inching{''}. The
   nanopatterning technique developed here paves the way for studying
   haptotactic responses to diverse digital nanodot patterns on surfaces
   covering the full range of physiological elasticity, and is expected to
   be applicable to the study of both culture and primary cells, such as
   neutrophils and neurons.}},

Title = {{Simulation of weathered profiles coupled with multivariate block-support

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{215}},

Abstract = {{Modelling and assessing spatial variability and uncertainty of mineral
   deposits is critical for both capital investments in mining projects as
   well as operational issues once a mine is developed. However,
   traditional approaches for modelling geological domains and
   geostatistical estimation provide smoothed representations of the
   pertinent deposit attributes, ignore spatial variability and, thereby,
   can mislead downstream decisions. Spatial variability and related
   uncertainty in modelling mineral deposit characteristics of interest,
   ranging from metal content and geological boundaries to
   geomechanical-geotechnical rock properties, can be modelled and
   quantified by stochastic spatial simulations. This is demonstrated
   through a detailed, step-by-step application to the Puma deposit, a
   major nickel lateritic asset in Brazil, part of the Onca-Puma mining
   complex. To integrate the variability of the regolith profiles of the
   deposit, their thicknesses are calculated after an unwrinkling process
   is applied and the deposit is then jointly simulated using min/max
   autocorrelation factors (MAF). The realizations serve as geological
   boundaries within which Ni, Co, Fe, SiO2, MgO and Dry-tonnage factor
   (DTF) are subsequently jointly simulated directly at block support
   scale. The final result is a series of equally probable representations
   of the Puma deposit, which are used to quantify and assess the
   uncertainty about key aspects of the project at the Puma,deposit, such
   as the uncertainty of the in-situ resources documented herein, and the
   strict control of the ore's quality that feeds the ferronickel
   processing plant. The framework presented shows the advantages of the
   MAF and direct block simulation approaches for the efficient joint
   simulation of spatially variant geological attributes of large deposits
   for industrial environments. The methods presented are general, new in
   the context of geotechnical and geomechanical engineering, and can
   assist in the modelling of spatial variability and quantification of
   uncertainty linked to geotechnical rock properties and pertinent
   lithological boundaries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the capacity and energy efficiency of non-coherent
   Rayleigh fading channels with Gaussian mixture noise where neither the
   transmitter nor the receiver has the knowledge of channel state
   information. The channel under consideration is suited for cellular
   networks having multi-tier heterogeneous architectures in which the
   channel conditions change rapidly. In the first part of the paper, we
   characterize the structure of a capacity-achieving input signal.
   Specifically, we establish an integrable upper bound on the integrand in
   the output entropy and demonstrate that there exists a unique optimal
   input. By formulating the Kuhn-Tucker condition and establishing a
   diverging lower bound on it, we show that the optimal input is discrete
   having a finite number of mass points. Using this result, we investigate
   the capacity and energy efficiency of the considered channel in the
   second part of the paper. In particular, we first develop a numerical
   method to evaluate the optimal input and compute the capacity. The
   energy efficiency, which is related to the capacity and optimal input in
   low-power regimes, is examined by calculating the minimum bit energy and
   wideband slope of the spectral-efficiency curve. We also analytically
   show the optimality of an on-off signal in this regime.}},

Title = {{Fate and mass balance of contaminants of emerging concern during

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{573}},
Pages = {{1147-1158}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are often poorly removed from
   wastewater using conventional treatment technologies and there is
   limited understanding of their fate during treatment. Inappropriate
   sampling strategies lead to inaccuracies in estimating removals of CECs.
   In this study, we used the ``fractionated approach{''} that accounts for
   the residence time distribution (RTD) in treatment units to investigate
   the fate of 26 target CECs in a municipal wastewater treatment plant
   (WWTP) that includes primary, secondary and tertiary treatment steps.
   Prior, hydraulic calibration of each treatment unit was performed.
   Wastewater and sludge samples were collected at different locations
   along the treatment train and the concentrations of target CECs were
   measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The most
   substantial aqueous removal occurred during activated sludge treatment
   (up to 99\%). Removals were <50\% in the primary clarifier and tertiary
   rotating biological contactors (RBCs) and up to 70\% by sand filtration.
   Mass balance calculations demonstrated that (bio)degradation accounted
   for up to 50\% of the removal in the primary clarifier and 100\% in
   activated sludge. Removal by sorption to primary and secondary sludge
   was minimal for most CECs. Analysis of the selected metabolites
   demonstrated that negative removals obtained could be explained by
   transformations between the parent compound and their metabolites. This
   study contributes to the growing literature by applying the fractionated
   approach to calculate removal of different types of CECs across each
   wastewater treatment step. An additional level of understanding of the
   fate of CECs was provided by mass balance calculations in primary and
   secondary treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A fuzzy-logic based decision-making approach for identification of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{184}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{255-270}},

Abstract = {{Due to inherent uncertainties in measurement and analysis, groundwater
   quality assessment is a difficult task. Artificial intelligence
   techniques, specifically fuzzy inference systems, have proven useful in
   evaluating groundwater quality in uncertain and complex hydrogeological
   systems. In the present study, a Mamdani fuzzy-logic-based
   decision-making approach was developed to assess groundwater quality
   based on relevant indices. In an effort to develop a set of new hybrid
   fuzzy indices for groundwater quality assessment, a Mamdani fuzzy
   inference model was developed with widely-accepted groundwater quality
   indices: the Groundwater Quality Index (GQI), the Water Quality Index
   (WQI), and the Ground Water Quality Index (GWQI). In an effort to
   present generalized hybrid fuzzy indices a significant effort was made
   to employ well-known groundwater quality index acceptability ranges as
   fuzzy model output ranges rather than employing expert knowledge in the
   fuzzification of output parameters. The proposed approach was evaluated
   for its ability to assess the drinking water quality of 49 samples
   collected seasonally from groundwater resources in Iran's Sarab Plain
   during 2013-2014. Input membership functions were defined as
   ``desirable{''}, ``acceptable{''} and ``unacceptable{''} based on expert
   knowledge and the standard and permissible limits prescribed by the
   World Health Organization. Output data were categorized into multiple
   categories based on the GQI (5 categories), WQI (5 categories), and GWQI
   (3 categories). Given the potential of fuzzy models to minimize
   uncertainties, hybrid fuzzy-based indices produce significantly more
   accurate assessments of groundwater quality than traditional indices.
   The developed models' accuracy was assessed and a comparison of the
   performance indices demonstrated the Fuzzy Groundwater Quality Index
   model to be more accurate than both the Fuzzy Water Quality Index and
   Fuzzy Ground Water Quality Index models. This suggests that the new
   hybrid fuzzy indices developed in this research are reliable and
   flexible when used in groundwater quality assessment for drinking
   purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, seasonal trends as well as dominant and significant
   periods of variability of drought variables were analyzed for 30
   rainfall subdivisions in India over 141 years (1871-2012). Standardized
   precipitation index (SPI) was used as a meteorological drought
   indicator, and various drought variables (monsoon SPI, non-monsoon SPI,
   yearly SPI, annual drought duration, annual drought severity and annual
   drought peak) were analyzed. Discrete wavelet transform was used in
   conjunction with the Mann-Kendall test to analyze trends and dominant
   periodicities associated with the drought variables. Furthermore,
   continuous wavelet transform (CWT), based global wavelet spectrum was
   used to analyze significant periods of variability associated with the
   drought variables. From the trend analysis, we observed that over the
   second half of the 20th century, drought occurrences increased
   significantly in subdivisions of Northeast and Central India. In both
   short-term (2-8 years) and decadal (16-32 years) periodicities, the
   drought variables were found to influence the trend. However, CWT
   analysis indicated that the dominant periodic components were not
   significant for most of the geographical subdivisions. Although
   inter-annual and inter-decadal periodic components play an important
   role, they may not completely explain the variability associated with
   the drought variables across the country. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Accelerated craniofacial bone regeneration through dense collagen gel
   scaffolds seeded with dental pulp stem cells}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Therapies using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) seeded scaffolds may be
   applicable to various fields of regenerative medicine, including
   craniomaxillofacial surgery. Plastic compression of collagen scaffolds
   seeded with MSC has been shown to enhance the osteogenic differentiation
   of MSC as it increases the collagen fibrillary density. The aim of the
   present study was to evaluate the osteogenic effects of dense collagen
   gel scaffolds seeded with mesenchymal dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) on
   bone regeneration in a rat critical-size calvarial defect model. Two
   symmetrical full-thickness defects were created (5 mm diameter) and
   filled with either a rat DPSC-containing dense collagen gel scaffold (n
   = 15), or an acellular scaffold (n = 15). Animals were imaged in vivo by
   microcomputer tomography (Micro-CT) once a week during 5 weeks, whereas
   some animals were sacrificed each week for histology and
   histomorphometry analysis. Bone mineral density and bone
   micro-architectural parameters were significantly increased when
   DPSC-seeded scaffolds were used. Histological and histomorphometrical
   data also revealed significant increases in fibrous connective and
   mineralized tissue volume when DPSC-seeded scaffolds were used,
   associated with expression of type I collagen, osteoblast-associated
   alkaline phosphatase and osteoclastic-related tartrate-resistant acid
   phosphatase. Results demonstrate the potential of DPSC-loaded-dense
   collagen gel scaffolds to benefit of bone healing process.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) are attractive systems for potential applications in
   future solar energy technologies, due to their optical properties which
   are tunable as a function of size and composition. In this study, we
   synthesized PbS QDs with first excitonic peak in the range 1060 to 1300
   nm using a PbCl2/sulfur molar ratio of 10:1. The first excitonic
   absorption peak from 1300 to 950 nm of the PbS/CdS core/shell QDs can be
   further synthesized via the cation exchange approach. Our method
   resulted in high quantum yield, good stability, monodisperse QD
   solutions with a full surface coverage by excess Cd cations. In
   addition, we used our core/shell QDs in a photoelectrochemical cell for
   hydrogen generation. This heterostructure exhibited a saturated
   photocurrent as high as 3.3 mA cm(-2), leading to similar to 29 ml
   cm(-2) d(-1) hydrogen generation, indicating the strong potential of our
   core/shell QDs for applications in water splitting.}},

Title = {{Probing the Interaction between Nanoparticles and Lipid Membranes by
   Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring}},
Journal = {{Frontiers in Chemistry}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in using quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to investigate the interaction of
   nanoparticles (NPs) with model surfaces. The high sensitivity, ease of
   use and the ability to monitor interactions in real-time has made it a
   popular technique for colloid chemists, biologists, bioengineers, and
   biophysicists. QCM-D has been recently used to probe the interaction of
   NPs with supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) as model cell membranes. The
   interaction of NPs with SLBs is highly influenced by the quality of the
   lipid bilayers. Unlike many surface sensitive techniques, by using
   QCM-D, the quality of SLBs can be assessed in real-time, hence QCM-D
   studies on SLB-NP interactions are less prone to the artifacts arising
   from bilayers that are not well formed. The ease of use and commercial
   availability of a wide range of sensor surfaces also have made QCM-D a
   versatile tool for studying NP interactions with lipid bilayers. In this
   review, we summarize the state-of-the-art on QCM-D based techniques for
   probing the interactions of NPs with lipid bilayers.}},

   up to 1 T, from which characteristic scattering lengths could be
   inferred. The temperature dependence of the phase coherence length L-phi
   was investigated, and above 1 K, it was found to decrease weaker than
   the L-phi proportional to T-1/2 dependence characteristic of
   electron-electron scattering in the presence of elastic scattering in

Abstract = {{In this paper, we detail effective methods to approximate the achievable
   rates of channels with additive Gaussian mixture (GM) noise for both
   real and complex channels to achieve any desired level of accuracy.
   Attention is paid to a Gaussian input, a discrete real input, and a
   complex input with discrete amplitude and independent uniform phase.
   Such discrete inputs represent a wide range of input distributions and
   they include the capacity-achieving inputs as special cases. At first,
   we propose a simple technique to accurately calculate the noise entropy.
   Specifically, when the noise level is high, a lower bound on the
   integrand of the entropy is established and the noise entropy can be
   estimated using a closed-form solution. In the low noise region, the
   piecewise-linear curve fitting (PWLCF) method is applied. We then extend
   this result to calculate the achievable rate when the input is Gaussian
   distributed, which is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Next, we
   propose a simple PWLCF-based method to approximate the output entropy
   for a real GM channel when the input is discrete, and for a complex GM
   channel when the input is discrete in amplitude with independent uniform
   phase. In particular, for the real channel, the output entropy is
   evaluated by examining the output in high and low regions of amplitude
   using a lower bound on the integrand of the output entropy and PWLCF,
   respectively. For the complex channel, the output entropy is
   approximated a similar manner but using polar coordinates and the Kernel
   function. It is demonstrated that the output entropy, and consequently,
   the achievable rates, can be computed to achieve any given accuracy
   level.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The article presents an element increment method that is developed by
   current time increment method of train traction calculation. A railway
   route was divided, breaking it down into elements of different lengths.
   A whole train movement simulation curve (v-t curve and v-S curve) was
   formed by splitting the joints of each of the elements' individual
   simulation curves. During this process, the train velocity variance was
   calculated by time increment method with assistance of polynomial
   fitting technology. Additionally, a step-by-step method with iteration
   was used to combine each element and makes the whole simulation curve
   continuous. Meanwhile, the energy-saving issue was also taken into
   account to optimize the simulation curve. This article gives more
   details about the modeling by providing an example of a railway route
   based on moving block control. The element increment method is a more
   effective way to calculate train traction of high-speed railway, and it
   is an alternative method to train movement simulation for aiding
   macroscopic railway transportation planning. Copyright (C) 2017 John

Abstract = {{Dig-limit optimization is an operational decision making problem that
   significantly affects the value of open-pit mining operations.
   Traditionally, dig-limits have been drawn by hand and can be defined as
   classifying practical ore and waste boundaries suiting equipment sizes
   in a bench. In this paper, an optimization approach based on a genetic
   algorithm (GA) was developed to approximate optimal dig-limits on a
   bench, given grade control data, equipment constraints, processing, and
   mining costs. A case study was conducted on a sample disseminated nickel
   bench, in a two destination and single ore-type deposit. The results
   from using the GA are compared to hand-drawn results. The study shows
   that GA-based approach can be effectively used for dig-limit
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{A cost effective alternative catalyst to platinum for the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells is
   iron nanoparticles deposited into nitrogen-rich stacked graphene sheets.
   In this work graphene nanoflakes with high levels of nitrogen (HN-GNFs)
   are grown from the plasma phase and iron functionalities are added by a
   wet-chemical method. The amount of iron is varied to study the
   structural and electrochemical effects on the catalyst. The amount of
   iron in the sample and on the surface is measured and proven to have no
   effect on the qualitative surface conditions of HN-GNFs, as the iron is
   imbedded into the HN-GNFs. Electrochemical studies with a rotating disk
   electrode reveal that the addition of iron is beneficial in acid and
   neutral environments, with improvements of over 0.3 V to the onset
   potential and 1.85 mA cm(-2) to the current density at 0 V versus a
   reversible hydrogen electrode when the iron catalysts are compared to
   untreated HN-GNFs. The iron did not improve the catalytic performance in
   alkaline environments, with untreated HN-GNFs already showing good
   activity towards the ORR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic properties of non-oriented electrical steels are determined
   by a combination of several metallurgical variables, including crystal
   orientation, misorientation (the orientation difference between two
   crystal orientations), and the amount of residual stress associated with
   plastic deformation. These variables are influenced by cold rolling and
   annealing. In order to study these relationships, samples in the
   semi-processed condition were subjected to an additional cold roll and a
   subsequent annealing at different temperatures, and then characterized
   using electron backscatter diffraction and nanoindentation. The process
   routing for these samples was not intended to be representative of
   real-world manufacturing; the purpose was to produce a spread in the
   metallurgical variables being investigated. Although some trends were
   observed involving orientation and misorientation, when present,
   deformation observed close to grain boundaries appeared to be the most
   influential variable on the magnetic properties. (C) ASM International

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials become thicker rather than thinner when stretched,
   exhibiting an unusual negative Poisson's ratio well suited for designing
   shape transforming metamaterials. Current auxetic designs, however, are
   often monostable and cannot maintain the transformed shape upon load
   removal. Here, inspired by ancient geometric motifs arranged in square
   and triangular grids, we introduce a class of switchable architected
   materials exhibiting simultaneous auxeticity and structural bistability.
   The material concept is experimentally realized by perforating various
   cut motifs into a sheet of rubber, thus creating a network of rotating
   units connected with compliant hinges. The metamaterial performance is
   assessed through mechanical testing and accurately predicted by a
   coherent set of finite element simulations. A discussion on a rich set
   of mechanical phenomena follows to shed light on the main design
   principles governing bistable auxetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Evidence-based recommendations on the use of intravenous lipid emulsion
   therapy in poisoning}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{899-923}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) was first used to
   treat life-threatening local anesthetic (LA) toxicity, its use has
   expanded to include both non-local anesthetic (non-LA) poisoning and
   less severe manifestations of toxicity. A collaborative workgroup
   appraised the literature and provides evidence-based recommendations for
   the use of ILE in poisoning.
   Methods: Following a systematic review of the literature, data were
   summarized in four publications: LA and non-LA poisoning efficacy,
   adverse effects, and analytical, interferences. Twenty-two toxins or
   toxin categories and three clinical situations were selected for voting.
   Voting statements were proposed using a predetermined format. A
   two-round modified Delphi method was used to reach consensus on the
   voting statements. Disagreement was quantified using RAND/UCLA
   Appropriateness Method.
   Results: For the management of cardiac arrest, we recommend using ILE
   with bupivacaine toxicity, while our recommendations are neutral
   regarding its use for all other toxins. For the management of
   life-threatening toxicity, (1) as first line therapy, we suggest not to
   use ILE with toxicity from amitriptyline, non-lipid soluble beta
   receptor antagonists, bupropion, calcium channel blockers, cocaine,
   diphenhydramine, lamotrigine, malathion but are neutral for other
   toxins, (2) as part of treatment modalities, we suggest using ILE in
   bupivacaine toxicity if other therapies fail, but are neutral for other
   toxins, (3) if other therapies fail, we recommend ILE for bupivacaine
   toxicity and we suggest using ILE for toxicity due to other LAs,
   amitriptyline, and bupropion, but our recommendations are neutral for
   all other toxins. In the treatment of non-life-threatening toxicity,
   recommendations are variable according to the balance of expected risks
   and benefits for each toxin.
   For LA-toxicity we suggest the use of Intralipid (R) 20\% as it is the
   formulation the most often reported. There is no evidence to support a
   recommendation for the best formulation of ILE for non-LAs. The voting
   panel is neutral regarding ILE dosing and infusion duration due to
   insufficient data for non-LAs. All recommendations were based on very
   low quality of evidence.
   Conclusion: Clinical recommendations regarding the use of ILE in
   poisoning were only possible in a small number of scenarios and were
   based mainly on very low quality of evidence, balance of expected risks
   and benefits, adverse effects, laboratory interferences as well as
   related costs and resources. The workgroup emphasizes that dose-finding
   and controlled studies reflecting human poisoning scenarios are required
   to advance knowledge of limitations, indications, adverse effects,
   effectiveness, and best regimen for ILE treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an Evolution Strategy (ES)-based algorithm,
   designed to self-adapt its mutation operators, guiding the search into
   the solution space using a Self-Adaptive Reduced Variable Neighborhood
   Search procedure. In view of the specific local search operators for
   each individual, the proposed population-based approach also fits into
   the context of the Memetic Algorithms. The proposed variant uses the
   Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure with different greedy
   parameters for generating its initial population, providing an
   interesting exploration-exploitation balance. To validate the proposal,
   this framework is applied to solve three different NP-Hard combinatorial
   optimization problems: an Open-Pit-Mining Operational Planning Problem
   with dynamic allocation of trucks, an Unrelated Parallel Machine
   Scheduling Problem with Setup Times, and the calibration of a hybrid
   fuzzy model for Short-Term Load Forecasting. Computational results point
   out the convergence of the proposed model and highlight its ability in
   combining the application of move operations from distinct neighborhood
   structures along the optimization. The results gathered and reported in
   this article represent a collective evidence of the performance of the
   method in challenging combinatorial optimization problems from different
   application domains. The proposed evolution strategy demonstrates an
   ability of adapting the strength of the mutation disturbance during the
   generations of its evolution process. The effectiveness of the proposal
   motivates the application of this novel evolutionary framework for
   solving other combinatorial optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies stochastic power control problems over a fading
   channel, where the transmitter randomly harvests renewable energies from
   environment and stores them in a battery for future data transmissions.
   Moreover, data packets are assumed to arrive at the data queue of
   transmitter with constant rate mu. To incorporate delay
   quality-of-service guarantees, two delay constraint models are
   separately considered, namely average delay model with maximum average
   delay constraint and statistical delay model with maximum delay outage
   probability constraint. Under each delay constraint model, the
   stochastic power control problem aims at maximizing mu considering the
   randomness of channel fading and energy harvesting (EH) processes. The
   resulting optimization problems can be formulated as infinite-horizon
   Markov decision processes. Under average delay model, the optimal power
   control policy needs to keep track of current data queue-length state in
   addition to the battery state. On the other hand, under statistical
   delay model, a sufficiently large queue-length region is assumed, hence,
   the optimal policy does not depend on the data queue-length state. We
   study various structural properties of the optimal control policies and
   develop online power control algorithms that converge to the optimal
   solutions without requiring statistical knowledge of channel fading and
   EH processes. By defining and learning the so-called post-decision
   state-value functions, the proposed learning algorithms require less
   complexity and converge faster than the conventional reinforcement
   learning algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the online learning algorithms for different delay constraint models and
   EH settings.}},

Abstract = {{Absence of large amounts of orofacial tissues caused by cancerous
   resections, congenital defects, or trauma results in sequelae such as
   dysphagia and noticeable scars. Oral-neck tissue regeneration was
   studied in the axolotl (regenerative amphibian) following a 2.5- mm
   punch biopsy that simultaneously removed skin, connective tissue,
   muscle, and cartilage in the tongue and intermandibular region. The
   untreated wound was studied macroscopically and histologically at 17
   different time points ranging from 0 to 180 days (N = 120 axolotls). At
   12 hr, the wound's surface was smoothened and within 1mm, internal
   lingual muscular modifications occurred; at the same distance, between
   days 4-7 lingual muscle degradation was complete. Immunofluorescence
   indicates complete keratinocytes migration by 48 hr. These cells with
   epidermal Leydig cells, appearing yellow, lead the chin's deep tissue
   outgrowth until its closure on the 14th day. Regeneration speeds varied
   and peaked in time for each tissue, (1) deep chin 84.3 mu m/hr from 24
   to 96 hr, (2) superficial chin 71.1 mu m/hr from 7-14 days, and (3)
   tongue 86.0 mu m/hr between 48 hr and 7 days. Immunofluorescence to Col
   IV showed basement membrane reconnected between days 30-45 coinciding
   with the chin's dermal tissue's surface area recovery. New muscle
   appeared at 21 days and was always preceded by the formation of a
   collagen bed. Both chin tissues regain all surface area and practically
   all components while the lingual structure lacks some content but is
   generally similar to the original. The methodology and high-resolution
   observations described here are the first of its kind for this animal
   model and could serve as a basis for future studies in oral and facial
   regenerative research. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{A Review on the Dissection of Quenched Blast Furnaces-Spanning from the
   Early 1950s to the 1970s}},

Abstract = {{Since its invention until the 1950s, the iron blast furnace was viewed
   as a strange `black box'. Its operation was largely empirical and much
   of the information needed for monitoring and control of the process was
   yet to be known. More complete information was needed concerning the
   process such as the reduction of iron-bearing raw materials, the
   distribution of materials throughout the stack, the size, location, and
   structure of the fusion zone, and the transfer of silicon, sulfur, and
   carbon to the slag and metal. Hence, to obtain a better understanding of
   the blast furnace process, some iron-makers came up with the idea of
   quenching the contents of the furnace following normal operations. This
   was done in a neutral nitrogen atmosphere. The quenched contents were
   then sampled for analysis. Thus, this paper was written to discuss such
   works, spanning from the early 1950s to the 1970s. Care has been taken
   to include most of their findings and readers who have a fair amount of
   iron-making knowledge should be able to see and understand the
   in-furnace phenomena as the `black box' unfolds itself. Most of the text
   will be focused on two important studies into the matter, the first
   being the U. S. Bureau of Mines case in 1959 and the next being the Iron
   and Steel Institute of Japan (ISIJ) studies in the 1970s. The
   contribution of these works to modern day blast furnace operation is
   also discussed in the paper.}},

Title = {{Fault Detection Using the Clustering-kNN Rule for Gas Sensor Arrays}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The k-nearest neighbour (kNN) rule, which naturally handles the possible
   non-linearity of data, is introduced to solve the fault detection
   problem of gas sensor arrays. In traditional fault detection methods
   based on the kNN rule, the detection process of each new test sample
   involves all samples in the entire training sample set. Therefore, these
   methods can be computation intensive in monitoring processes with a
   large volume of variables and training samples and may be impossible for
   real-time monitoring. To address this problem, a novel clustering-kNN
   rule is presented. The landmark-based spectral clustering (LSC)
   algorithm, which has low computational complexity, is employed to divide
   the entire training sample set into several clusters. Further, the kNN
   rule is only conducted in the cluster that is nearest to the test
   sample; thus, the efficiency of the fault detection methods can be
   enhanced by reducing the number of training samples involved in the
   detection process of each test sample. The performance of the proposed
   clustering-kNN rule is fully verified in numerical simulations with both
   linear and non-linear models and a real gas sensor array experimental
   system with different kinds of faults. The results of simulations and
   experiments demonstrate that the clustering-kNN rule can greatly enhance
   both the accuracy and efficiency of fault detection methods and provide
   an excellent solution to reliable and real-time monitoring of gas sensor
   arrays.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of computational servers in data centers is
   imposing tighter constraints on the networking infrastructure. Scalable
   power efficient optical interconnect network becomes necessary to
   leverage the bandwidth capacity of current electronic switches or
   opto-electronic components. Hence, novel optical interconnect technology
   can enhance the network capacity by harnessing the feasibility of
   simultaneous processing of optical signal in the wavelength and time
   domains. In this paper, we present a four channel optical passive
   wavelength-striped mapping (PWSM) device, which passively time
   compresses/expands serial packets through optical wavelength
   multiplexing/demultiplexing. The PWSM device, which has a 1 x 4 channel
   optical wavelength demultiplexer with integrated optical delay lines, is
   designed in a low-loss Si3N4 (propagation loss similar to 3.1 dB/m)
   waveguide platform. The PWSM device multiplexes/demultiplexes four WDM
   channels and offsets in time the adjacent channels to optically
   serialize/de-serialize data packets. In this demonstration, a 64 ns long
   data packet is formed at the output of the device by combining four 16
   ns data segments of the packet in time domain. Incremental optical
   insertion loss between adjacent channels is similar to 9.7 dB due to the
   integrated passive optical delay waveguides. The data rate of the four
   segmented packets and the combined packet is 25 Gb/sec. We have measured
   a bit error rate performance below 1 x 10(-9) for the 64 ns serial data
   packet regenerated by the PWSM device for a received optical power of
   -6.7 dBm.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible conversion between multilevel modulation formats is one of the
   key processing functions to realize adaptive modulation techniques for
   flexible networking aimed at high spectral efficiency in optical fiber
   transmission. The authors have proposed an all-optical format conversion
   system from binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) to quadrature PSK (QPSK)
   and its reverse conversion from QPSK to BPSK. The latter had an
   advantage of wavelength-shift-free conversion from an incident QPSK to
   simultaneous two BPSK outputs without loss of the transmitting data.
   However, it was limited only for a single polarization signal. In this
   paper, we propose a novel method of wavelength-preserved conversion for
   polarization division multiplexed QPSK signal with arbitrary
   polarization rotation angle to the x-axis on the x-y polarization plane
   which is orthogonal to the propagation axis. The method is based on the
   orthogonal dual-pump four-wave-mixing (FWM) in the highly nonlinear
   fiber with a nonlinear optical loop mirror configuration, which has
   advantages that it separately outputs the original signal and the phase
   conjugate signal and has independent FWM efficiency of the signal
   polarization angle. We show the system performances such as
   bit-error-rate and optical signal-to-noise ratio penalty evaluated by
   numerical simulations.}},

   Microstructures}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We report on the effect of repetition rate on the formation and surface
   texture of the laser induced homogenous microstructures. Different
   microstructures were micromachined on copper (Cu) and titanium (Ti)
   using femtosecond pulses at 1 and 10 kHz. We studied the effect of the
   repetition rate on structure formation by comparing the threshold
   accumulated pulse (F-Sigma pulse) values and the effect on the surface
   texture through lacunarity analysis. Machining both metals at low
   F-Sigma pulse resulted in microstructures with higher lacunarity at 10
   kHz compared to 1 kHz. On increasing F-Sigma pulse, the microstructures
   showed higher lacunarity at 1 kHz. The effect of the repetition rate on
   the threshold F-Sigma pulse values were, however, considerably different
   on the two metals. With an increase in repetition rate, we observed a
   decrease in the threshold F-Sigma pulse on Cu, while on Ti we observed
   an increase. These differences were successfully allied to the
   respective material characteristics and the resulting melt dynamics.
   While machining Ti at 10 kHz, the melt layer induced by one laser pulse
   persists until the next pulse arrives, acting as a dielectric for the
   subsequent pulse, thereby increasing F-Sigma pulse. However, on Cu, the
   melt layer quickly resolidifies and no such dielectric like phase is
   observed. Our study contributes to the current knowledge on the effect
   of the repetition rate as an irradiation parameter.}},

Abstract = {{A novel titanium nitride (TiN)/carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite is
   produced with the purpose to mechanically, structurally and chemically
   stabilize a `felt-like' CNT growth structure. The CNTs are grown on
   stainless steel (SS) 304 by chemical vapor deposition using the direct
   growth method previously developed, which does not require the use of an
   additional catalyst precursor. The TiN coating is achieved by physical
   vapor deposition and is shown here to generate a nanocomposite with a
   porous three-dimensional architecture. The contact stiffness is
   evaluated using nanoindentation, and wetting properties of the TiN/CNT
   nanocomposites are determined from contact angle measurements. An
   increase in contact stiffness and effective elastic modulus with TiN
   coating time was observed. The TiN coating on the non-wetting CNT felt
   results in a wetting nanocomposite surface. The wetting property is
   found to be a function of the TiN coating thickness on the CNT
   structure.}},

Title = {{Investigating the gender differences on bicycle-vehicle conflicts at

Abstract = {{In the literature, a crash-based modeling approach has long been used to
   evaluate the factors that contribute to cyclist injury risk at
   intersections. However, this approach has been criticized as crashes are
   required to occur before contributing factors can be identified and
   countermeasures can be implemented. Moreover, human factors related to
   dangerous behaviors are difficult to evaluate using crash-based methods.
   As an alternative, surrogate safety measures have been developed to
   address the issue of reliance on crash data. Despite recent
   developments, few methodologies and little empirical evidence exist on
   bicycle-vehicle interactions at intersections using video-based data and
   statistical analyses to identify associated factors. This study
   investigates bicycle-vehicle conflict severity and evaluates the impact
   of different factors, including gender, on cyclist risk at urban
   intersections with cycle tracks. A segmented ordered logit model is used
   to evaluate post-encroachment time between cyclists and vehicles. Video
   data was collected at seven intersections in Montreal, Canada. Road user
   trajectories were automatically extracted, classified, and filtered
   using a computer vision software to yield 1514 interactions. The
   discrete choice variable was generated by dividing post-encroachment
   time into normal interactions, conflicts, and dangerous conflicts.
   Independent variables reflecting attributes of the cyclist, vehicle, and
   environment were extracted either automatically or manually. Results
   indicated that an ordered model is appropriate for analyzing traffic
   conflicts and identifying key factors. Furthermore, exogenous
   segmentation was beneficial in comparing different segments of the
   population within a single model. Male cyclists, with all else being
   equal, were less likely than female cyclists to be involved in conflicts
   and dangerous conflicts at the studied intersections. Bicycle and
   vehicle speed, along with the time of the conflict relative to the red
   light phase, were other significant factors in conflict severity. These
   results will contribute to and further the understanding of gender
   differences in cycling within North America. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In transportation safety studies, it is often necessary to account for
   unobserved heterogeneity and multimodality in data. The commonly used
   standard or over-dispersed generalized linear models (e.g., negative
   binomial models) do not fully address unobserved heterogeneity, assuming
   that crash frequencies follow unimodal exponential families of
   distributions. This paper employs Bayesian nonparametric Dirichlet
   process mixture models demonstrating some of their major advantages in
   transportation safety studies. We examine the performance of the
   proposed approach using both simulated and real data. We compare the
   proposed model with other models commonly used in road safety literature
   including the Poisson-Gamma, random effects, and conventional latent
   class models. We use pseudo Bayes factors as the goodness-of-fit
   measure, and also examine the performance of the proposed model in terms
   of replicating datasets with high proportions of zero crashes. In a
   multivariate setting, we extend the standard multivariate
   Poisson-lognormal model to a more flexible Dirichlet process mixture
   multivariate model. We allow for interdependence between outcomes
   through a nonparametric random effects density. Finally, we demonstrate
   how the robustness to parametric distributional assumptions (usually the
   multivariate normal density) can be examined using a mixture of points
   model when different (multivariate) outcomes are modeled jointly.}},

Abstract = {{Mid-infrared (MIR) soil spectroscopy has shown applicability to predict
   selected properties through various laboratory studies. However, reports
   on the successful use of MIR instruments in field conditions (in situ)
   have been limited. In this study, a small portable prototype MIR
   (898-1811 cm(-1)) spectrometer was used to collect soil spectra from two
   agricultural fields (predominantly organic and mineral soils). Both
   fields were located at Macdonald Campus of McGill University in
   Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. In each of the 120 predefined
   field locations, in situ spectroscopic measurements were repeated three
   times and one representative soil sample was analyzed following
   conventional laboratory procedures. For every soil property, a
   field-specific partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was
   developed and evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation routine.
   Each soil property was evaluated in terms of the accuracy and
   reproducibility of model predictions. Among tested soil properties, soil
   organic matter, water content, bulk density, cation exchange capacity
   (CEC), Ca and Mg yielded higher model performance indicators (R-2 > 0.50
   and RPD > 1.40) as compared to soil pH, Fe, Cu, phosphorus,
   nitrate-nitrogen, K or Na. In most instances, the error estimate
   representing the prediction reproducibility was found to be as high as
   50\% of the overall prediction error. This was due to the combination of
   optical and electrical noise and soil micro-variability causing soil
   spectra representing the same field location to yield different
   predictions. (C) 2016 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Characterization and quantification of soil properties are important for
   the optimum use and management our soil. While Soil texture is an
   important factor for decision making in agriculture, civil engineering
   and other industries, soil organic matter (SOM) is the backbone of soil
   health and quality and also affects a range of other soil properties and
   processes. Traditional methods for estimating these soil properties are
   time consuming and laborious. This paper discloses the design and
   development of a new cost effective in situ computer vision-based sensor
   system to estimate soil texture and SOM. A small and inexpensive
   hand-held microscope was used to develop an image acquisition system.
   Images acquired in laboratory with variable texture and SOM were
   processed using means of geospatial data analysis based computer vision
   algorithm. Simple linear regression predictive relationships were
   developed to estimate soil texture and SOM using various computed
   parameters of acquired imagery. Predicted sand (coefficients of
   determination, R-2 = 0.63) and SOM (R-2 = 0.83) were in good agreement
   with the laboratory measurement. These correspond to root mean square
   error of 84.7 g sand kg(-1) of soil and 0.11 log (SOM \%) for soils
   exhibiting the range of \% sand from 3.4 to 59.3 and \% SOM from 5.5 to
   72.8, respectively. Low cost and the portability of the acquisition
   system and the computer vision algorithm developed in this study
   suggested suitability for its use in both laboratory and field
   conditions and shows promise as a proximal soil sensor. (C) 2016 IAgrE.

   salinization, their accurate estimation is essential to the
   determination of appropriate soil salinization remediation techniques,
   irrigation regimes, and the agricultural distribution layout. A total of
   261 soil samples were collected from agricultural fields in the province
   of Xinjiang, China. A portable Fourier transform (FT) mid-infrared (MIR)
   spectrometer (4000-600 cm(-1)) and a visible near-infrared (VNIR) field
   spectrometer (350-2500 nm) were used to obtain soil spectra. We
   subsequently used partial least-square regression (PLSR) and support
   vector machine (SVM) algorithms to establish models in VNIR, MIR, and
   VNIR-MIR regions. The main objectives of this study are (i) to
   investigate the possibility of using spectroscopic techniques to predict
   total dissolved salts and soluble ion content; (ii) to compare the
   prediction accuracy of these soil properties in the VNIR, MIR, and VNIR
   MIR spectral regions; (3) to compare the prediction accuracy with linear
   and nonlinear algorithms. Our findings demonstrated that spectroscopic
   techniques are a promising way to predict total dissolved salts and
   soluble ion content. Good predictions were obtained for total dissolved
   salts content, HCO3-, SO42- and Ca2+, satisfactory for Mg2+, Cl-, and
   Na+, but poor for K. This work demonstrates the potential of portable
   VNIR and MIR spectrometers as proximal soil sensors for more efficient
   soil analysis and acquisition of soil salinity information. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Macromodeling techniques using Loewner matrix (LM) interpolation were
   proposed recently as a way to generate time-domain macromodels based on
   simulated Y-parameters. These approaches scale very well with respect to
   the number of ports as well as the number of poles in the system.
   However, these methods become less efficient in terms of accuracy and
   passivity for Y-parameters obtained using electromagnetic simulators. In
   this paper, we propose an LM-based interpolation technique that is
   applicable for large-scale distributed systems described by full-wave
   Y-parameters. An algorithm to approximate and extract the port impedance
   matrix D directly from the data is proposed. Additionally, an order
   selection scheme is proposed that results in an accurate macromodel
   while maintaining passivity. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
   approach is illustrated using comparisons with a standard technique.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the deformation of cylindrical membranes is important for
   understanding various mechanical systems, including biological
   structures such as the incudostapedial joint in the middle ear. Although
   the deformations of long cylindrical membranes have been extensively
   investigated, studies of short cylindrical membranes have not been
   published. Here we present an analytical solution for the deformation of
   moderate length and short cylindrical membranes using the Mooney-Rivlin
   form for the strain-energy function. The membrane profiles and the
   internal pressures fit well with a finite-element model. We show that
   both moderate length and short membranes become unstable when passing a
   certain limit pressure, and this instability persists even for very
   short membranes. Furthermore, we show that increasing the initial
   length, the pre-stretch and the stiffness all tend to stabilize a short
   membrane. The results may furnish insight into the mechanical behaviour
   of the incudostapedial joint.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{543}},

Abstract = {{In-situ bioremediation is the most common groundwater remediation
   procedure used for treating organically contaminated sites. A
   simulation-optimization approach, which incorporates a simulation model
   for groundwaterflow and transport processes within an optimization
   program, could help engineers in designing a remediation system that
   best satisfies management objectives as well as regulatory constraints.
   In-situ bioremediation is a highly complex, non-linear process and the
   modelling of such a complex system requires significant computational
   exertion. Soft computing techniques have a flexible mathematical
   structure which can generalize complex nonlinear processes. In in-situ
   bioremediation management, a physically-based model is used for the
   simulation and the simulated data is utilized by the optimization model
   to optimize the remediation cost. The recalling of simulator to satisfy
   the constraints is an extremely tedious and time consuming process and
   thus there is need for a simulator which can reduce the computational
   burden. This study presents a simulation-optimization approach to
   achieve an accurate and cost effective in-situ bioremediation system
   design for groundwater contaminated with BTEX (Benzene, Toluene,
   Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) compounds. In this study, the Extreme
   Learning Machine (ELM) is used as a proxy simulator to replace BIOPLUME
   III for the simulation. The selection of ELM is done by a comparative
   analysis with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine
   (SVM) as they were successfully used in previous studies of in-situ
   bioremediation system design. Further, a single-objective optimization
   problem is solved by a coupled Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)-Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to achieve the minimum cost for the
   in situ bioremediation system design. The results indicate that ELM is a
   faster and more accurate proxy simulator than ANN and SVM. The total
   cost obtained by the ELM-PSO approach is held to a minimum while
   successfully satisfying all the regulatory constraints of the
   contaminated site. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of ecological variables on community assembly of heterotrophic
   bacteria at eight full-scale and two pilot-scale activated sludge
   wastewater treatment plants (AS-WWTPs) were explored by pyrosequencing
   of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. In total, 39 samples covering a range of
   abiotic factors spread over space and time were analyzed. A core
   bacterial community of 24 families detected in at least six of the eight
   AS-WWTPs was defined. In addition to the core families, plant-specific
   families (observed at <50\% AS-WWTPs) were found to be also important in
   the community structure. Observed beta diversity was partitioned with
   respect to ecological variables. Specifically, the following variables
   were considered: influent wastewater characteristics, season (winter vs.
   summer), process operations (conventional, oxidation ditch, and sequence
   batch reactor), reactor sizes (pilot-scale vs. full-scale reactors),
   chemical stresses defined by ozonation of return activated sludge,
   interannual variation, and geographical locations. Among the assessed
   variables, influent wastewater characteristics and geographical
   locations contributed more in explaining the differences between AS-WWTP
   bacterial communities with a maximum of approximately 26\% of the
   observed variations. Partitioning of beta diversity is necessary to
   interpret the inherent variability in microbial community assembly and
   identify the driving forces at play in engineered microbial ecosystem.}},

Journal = {{RESOURCES POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{322-332}},

Abstract = {{Complex polymetallic mining projects with multiple processing streams
   tend to require tight blending constraints, with different operational
   and processing targets. These blending requirements are generally not
   focused solely on metal grade, but rather on a set of geometallurgical
   variables that affect the performance of the operation and its ability
   to meet targets and maximize project value. Because of this, a
   multivariate destination policy is developed here, based on coalition
   formation clustering (a line of study of cooperative game theory), which
   avoids the use of cut-off grades and defines where material is sent by
   accounting for the value and relation of groups of blocks being
   processed together. This allows improving investment decisions as a
   result of optimizing project performance, because the variables that
   affect blending and processing requirements are actively accounted for
   in the optimization process. A case study on a copper-gold mine with six
   destinations is presented, where the method proposed shows significant
   improvements in meeting processing requirements and increases the
   expected net present value by 5.6\% when compared to a traditional
   method. This shows that complex processing requirements can be accounted
   for and respected without any loss of project value.}},

Abstract = {{A computer program for detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the transport
   of electrons with kinetic energies in the range between about 0.1 and
   about 500 keV in bulk materials and in thin solid films is presented.
   Elastic scattering is described from differential cross sections
   calculated by the relativistic (Dirac) partial-wave expansion method
   with different models of the scattering potential. Inelastic
   interactions are simulated from an optical-data model based on an
   empirical optical oscillator strength that combines optical functions of
   the solid with atomic photoelectric data. The generalized oscillator
   strength is built from the adopted optical oscillator strength by using
   an extension algorithm derived from Lindhard's dielectric function for a
   free-electron gas. It is shown that simulated backscattering fractions
   of electron beams from bulk (semi-infinite) specimens are in good
   agreement with experimental data for beam energies from 0.1 keV up to
   about 100 keV. Simulations also yield transmitted and backscattered
   fractions of electron beams on thin solid films that agree closely with
   measurements for different film thicknesses and incidence angles.
   Simulated most probable deflection angles and depth-dose distributions
   also agree satisfactorily with measurements. Finally, electron energy
   loss spectra of several elemental solids are simulated and the effects
   of the beam energy and the foil thickness on the signal to background
   and signal to noise ratios are investigated. SCANNING 38:475-491, 2016.

Abstract = {{Lithium is the key element for the development of battery and new

   of Li K in pure metallic lithium is now possible in the Scanning

   time using EDS, the detection of Li K in several binary lithium
   compounds (LiH, Li3N, Li2S, LiF and LiCl). Experimental Li K X-rays
   intensity is compared with a specially modified Monte Carlo simulation
   program showing discrepancies between theoretical and experimental Li K
   measurements. The effect of chemical bounding on the X-rays emission
   using density functional theory with the all-electron linearized
   augmented plane wave is showing that the emission of Li K from the

Abstract = {{The current study was conducted to compare the protein bioaccessibility
   of soymilk and two soymilk curds generated by fermentation with
   Lactobacillus plantarum B1-6 and Lactobacillus plantarum 70810. Soluble
   protein content, degree of hydrolysis, and electrophoretic patterns were
   monitored during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of the soymilk and
   curds. Soluble protein content of digested soymilk was 2.0-2.6 times
   higher than that of digested curds as measured by the Bradford assay.
   The degree of hydrolysis was 1.6 times higher in digested soymilk than
   in digested soymilk curds as determined by the ortho-phthalaldehyde
   (OPA) method. Electrophoretic data showed that soymilk curds had slower
   protein digestion rates during simulated gastric and intestinal
   digestion. The soy protein 7S alpha', 7S alpha and 11S acidic subunits
   and a peptide of 28 kDa were observed even after simulated intestinal
   digestion. The different degradation profiles suggest that the soymilk
   curd hinders enzymatic hydrolysis during simulated gastrointestinal
   digestion.
   Industrial relevance: Soymilk curd is a popular food in East and
   Southeast Asian countries. Lactic acid fermentation is an emerging
   technology to form soymilk curds that creates a product with improved
   functional and probiotic properties. The purpose of the present study
   was to compare protein degradation profiles of soymilk curds produced by
   fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum B1-6 and 70810, and of soymilk
   using an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion system. Results of the
   study will expand the knowledge base of the effects of this novel
   coagulation technology on the nutritional characteristics, especially
   protein bioaccessibility of soymilk curds and thus would be expected to
   provide fundamental information in the future application of the
   emerging coagulation technology using lactic acid bacteria. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Although the endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is a less
   invasive alternative than classic open surgery, complications such as
   endoleak and kinking still need to be addressed. Numerical simulation of
   endovascular repair is becoming a valuable tool in stent-graft (SG)
   optimization, patient selection and surgical planning.
   The experimental and numerical forces required to produce SG
   deformations were compared in a range of in vivo conditions in the
   present study. The deformation modes investigated were: bending as well
   as axial, transversal and radial compressions. In particular, an
   original method was developed to efficiently account for radial pre-load
   because of the pre-compression of stents to match the graft dimensions
   during manufacturing. This is important in order to compute the radial
   force exerted on the vessel after deployment more accurately.
   Variations of displacement between the experimental and numerical
   results ranged from 1.39\% for simple leg bending to 5.93\% for
   three-point body bending.
   Finally, radial pre-load was modeled by increasing Young's modulus of
   each stent. On average, it was found that Young's modulus had to be
   augmented by a factor of 2. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Mg-Al-Sn alloy was hot compressed at 523 K (250 degrees
   C) and annealed at 623 K (350 degrees C) for various times. The initial
   as-deformed microstructure was partially dynamic recrystallized with
   strain-induced precipitates on the recrystallized grain boundaries.
   After annealing at 623 K (350 degrees C), static recrystallization (SRX)
   of the bimodal microstructure took place where, at this temperature, no
   static precipitates formed. The goal of this work was to study the
   effect of dynamic precipitation on the texture evolution during the SRX
   process. Progressive texture evolution was studied during annealing by
   electron backscattered diffraction technique through a
   microstructure-tracking process. It was found that the grain-coarsening
   mechanism during the early stage of annealing is not totally controlled
   by the basal-oriented grains. Also, it was found that the dynamic
   precipitates may have significant influence in the early texture
   weakening during annealing of a bimodal structure. (C) The Minerals,

Title = {{Complex patterns of spatially extended generators of epileptic activity:
   Comparison of source localization methods cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC on high

Abstract = {{Electric Source Imaging (ESI) and Magnetic Source Imaging (MSI) of EEG
   and MEG signals are widely used to determine the origin of interictal
   epileptic discharges during the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with
   epilepsy. Epileptic discharges are detectable on EEG/MEG scalp
   recordings only when associated with a spatially extended cortical
   generator of several square centimeters, therefore it is essential to
   assess the ability of source localization methods to recover such
   spatial extent.
   In this study we evaluated two source localization methods that have
   been developed for localizing spatially extended sources using EEG/MEG
   data: coherent Maximum Entropy on the Mean (cMEM) and 4th order Extended
   Source Multiple Signal Classification (4-ExSo-MUSIC). In order to
   propose a fair comparison of the performances of the two methods in MEG
   versus EEG, this study considered realistic simulations of simultaneous
   EEG/MEG acquisitions taking into account an equivalent number of
   channels in EEG (257 electrodes) and MEG (275 sensors), involving a
   biophysical computational neural mass model of neuronal discharges and
   realistically shaped head models. cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC were evaluated
   for their sensitivity to localize complex patterns of epileptic
   discharges which includes (a) different locations and spatial extents of
   multiple synchronous sources, and (b) propagation patterns exhibited by
   epileptic discharges. Performance of the source localization methods was
   assessed using a detection accuracy index (Area Under receiver operating
   characteristic Curve, AUC) and a Spatial Dispersion (SD) metric.
   Finally, we also presented two examples illustrating the performance of
   cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC on clinical data recorded using high resolution
   EEG and MEG.
   When simulating single sources at different locations, both 4-ExSo-MUSIC
   and cMEM exhibited excellent performance (median AUC significantly
   larger than 0.8 for EEG and MEG), whereas, only for EEG, 4-ExSo-MUSIC
   showed significantly larger AUC values than cMEM. On the other hand,
   cMEM showed significantly lower SD values than 4-ExSo-MUSIC for both EEG
   and MEG. When assessing the impact of the source spatial extent, both
   methods provided consistent and reliable detection accuracy for a wide
   range of source spatial extents (source sizes ranging from 3 to 20 cm(2)
   for MEG and 3 to 30 cm2 for EEG). For both EEG and MEG, 4-ExSo-MUSIC
   localized single source of large signal-to-noise ratio better than cMEM.
   In the presence of two synchronous sources, cMEM was able to distinguish
   well the two sources (their location and spatial extent), while
   4-ExSo-MUSIC only retrieved one of them. cMEM was able to detect the
   spatio-temporal propagation patterns of two synchronous activities while
   4-ExSo-MUSIC favored the strongest source activity.
   Overall, in the context of localizing sources of epileptic discharges
   from EEG and MEG data, 4-ExSo-MUSIC and cMEM were found accurately
   sensitive to the location and spatial extent of the sources, with some
   complementarities. Therefore, they are both eligible for application on
   clinical data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Leukocyte Adhesion in Cultured Endothelial Cells under Flow}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium is an early step in the
   pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Effective adhesion requires the binding
   of leukocytes to their cognate receptors on the surface of endothelial
   cells. The glycocalyx covers the surface of endothelial cells and is
   important in the mechanotransduction of shear stress. This study aimed
   to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of the
   glycocalyx in leukocyte adhesion under flow. We performed experiments
   using 3-D cell culture models, exposing human abdominal aortic
   endothelial cells to steady laminar shear stress (10 dynes/cm(2) for 24
   hours). We found that with the enzymatic degradation of the glycocalyx,
   endothelial cells developed a proinflammatory phenotype when exposed to
   uniform steady shear stress leading to an increase in leukocyte
   adhesion. Our results show an up-regulation of ICAM-1 with degradation
   compared to non-degraded controls (3-fold increase, p<0.05) and we
   attribute this effect to a de-regulation in NF-kappa B activity in
   response to flow. These results suggest that the glycocalyx is not
   solely a physical barrier to adhesion but rather plays an important role
   in governing the phenotype of endothelial cells, a key determinant in
   leukocyte adhesion. We provide evidence for how the destabilization of
   this structure may be an early and defining feature in the initiation of
   atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Rockbursts in underground mines can cause devastating damage to mine
   workings; hence, it is important to be able to assess the potential for
   their occurrence. The present study focuses on a large seismic event
   that took place at an underground base metal mine in Canada. The event
   took place in a dyke near the 100/900 orebodies on 3880 Level (1180 m
   below surface) of the Copper Cliff Mine in Sudbury, Canada. A 3D
   continuum stress analysis of the orebodies, i.e., 100 and 900, using an
   orebody-wide model encompassing the major geological structures and in
   situ stress heterogeneity in the mine shows low potential for rockburst
   at the seismic source location-a result which contradicts the fact that
   a large seismic event actually took place. A postulation is thus made
   that there had been highly stressed regions caused by geological
   disturbances at the source location before mining activities took place.
   In order to verify the postulation, a further study is undertaken with
   the discrete element modelling technique, whereby a cube-shaped model
   containing a fracture network is subjected to a stress state similar to
   that at the source location. A model parametrical study is conducted
   with respect to the distribution of the fracture (joint) network and its
   mechanical properties. The results reveal that when joints are densely
   distributed at the source location, the stress state becomes
   significantly burst prone. It is observed that the length, density,
   stiffness, and orientation of joints have a large influence on the
   stress state along the joints, while the friction angle, cohesion, and
   tensile strength do not influence the stress state. A cube-shaped model
   is constructed with joint sets actually mapped at the mine and a stress
   analysis is performed. The results demonstrate the generation of highly
   stressed regions due to the interaction of the joints with the applied
   in situ stress fields, thus leading to burst-prone conditions. The
   present study numerically confirms that a preexisting fracture network
   found within a stiff rockmass could lead to burst-prone stress state at
   relatively moderate mining depths.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Given its high pore volume and adsorption capacity, and when applied as
   an agricultural soil amendment, its ability to enhance the soil's
   nutrient-and water-holding capacities, biochar has become a focus of
   research interest. In most applications, crop productivity is
   significantly increased after agricultural soils are amended with
   biochar. In addition to increasing soil quality, the biochar amendments
   sequester carbon within the soil. However, the long-term effects of
   amending agricultural soils with biochar are difficult to predict,
   because the mechanisms behind the increase in productivity of biochar
   amended soils are not yet fully understood. Long-term detrimental
   effects on soil and the environment can occur if biochar is applied
   haphazardly. Current knowledge and the additional experimental work
   required to thoroughly understand the influence of biochar amendment on
   the behavior of agricultural soils processes are reviewed. Further,
   studies on the post production processing of biochar are discussed in
   the context of the possible engineering of biochar for particular states
   of soil degradation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers gain-scheduled control within a passive systems
   framework. Inspired by the passivity theorem and linear parameter
   varying systems theory, a very strictly passive gain-scheduled
   controller is introduced. The proposed gain-scheduled controller is used
   in tandem with an actuator saturation prevention technique. The actuator
   saturation prevention technique does not violate the passive properties
   of the controller, can account for feedforward control, and can have
   variable saturation limits. Scheduling signals are bounded and square
   integrable on finite time intervals. They have no restrictions on their
   derivatives, can be nonlinear, and can be functions of system states,
   exogenous signals, or time. The controller is applied to a trajectory
   tracking problem of a two-link flexible manipulator's heavy payload. The
   proposed controller is compared to two other gain-scheduling paradigms
   through experimentation. The theoretical and experimental results of
   this paper show that the proposed control architecture with a fixed
   number of integrating states is able to have improved stability
   properties over a traditional linear parameter varying controller
   without compromising performance. In addition, the proposed controller
   is able to asymptotically track a trajectory while avoiding actuator
   saturation.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing recognition that marine and coastal ecosystems
   are under severe threat. The implementation of Marine Protected Areas
   (MPAs) has become a cornerstone in addressing these impacts. The
   formulation of the Aichi Target (AT) 11 has acknowledged the benefits of
   MPAs as a vital approach to achieve marine conservation targets. In the
   AT 11, reference to the term ``equitably managed{''} has demonstrated
   the importance of equity in the planning and management of MPAs and in
   this paper, a description of how equity should be considered from the
   inception stage is detailed. Two case studies, one in Japan and the
   other in the Solomon Islands, were chosen because they include equity
   considerations from the inception and were successful in reaching their
   conservation targets. Through these two case studies, it is demonstrated
   that understanding the objectives and expectations of all stakeholders
   can help achieve the qualitative goals of the AT 11. This is
   particularly true for local and indigenous communities in Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS) and coastal communities in developing
   countries. Finally, a set of recommendations has been provided to
   address possible limitations that could arise during the MPA design
   exercise. Participatory area management and spatial and temporal zoning
   can help by ensuring that benefits and costs are distributed equitably
   between stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The in-plane effective diffusion coefficients in gas diffusion layers
   typically used in fuel cell electrodes were measured as a function of
   compression and hydrophobic polymer loading. This method was based on
   the transient diffusion of oxygen from air into an initially nitrogen
   purged porous sample and has proven to be accurate, fast, and
   straightforward. As anticipated, with higher compressions and higher
   PTFE loadings, effective diffusivity decreased, as a result of less pore
   space available for transport and because tortuosity increased. When
   plotted against compressed porosity, the effective diffusivity of
   untreated and treated materials for a given type of sample collapsed on
   top of each other, despite the simultaneous impact of PTFE loading and
   compression. It was possible to distinguish between the impact of PTFE
   and compression by plotting the data as tortuosity against compressed
   thickness. High compressions on the sample lead to irreversible damages
   to the fiber structure, resulting in decreased or unexpectedly low
   tortuosity. Finally, a percolation model was fitted through one of the
   tested materials and a reasonable agreement was observed for lower
   compression, but a fit to the entire data could not be achieved. This
   was attributed to fundamental structural changes occurring in the sample
   upon high compressions, an observation that helps to explain the general
   inability of theoretical tortuosity models to describe GDLs.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional quantitative approach to studying Bicycle Sharing System
   (BSS) usage involves examining the influence of BSS infrastructure (such
   as number of BSS stations and capacity), transportation network
   infrastructure, land use and urban form, meteorological data, and
   temporal characteristics. These studies, as expected, conclude that BSS
   infrastructure (number of stations and capacity) have substantial
   influence on BSS usage. The earlier studies consider usage as a
   dependent variable and employ BSS infrastructure as an independent
   variable. Thus, in the models developed, the unobserved factors
   influencing the measured dependent variable (BSS usage) also strongly
   influence one of the independent variables (BSS infrastructure). This is
   a classic violation of the most basic assumption in econometric modeling
   i.e. the error component in the model is not correlated with any of the
   exogenous variables. The model estimates obtained with this erroneous
   assumption are likely to over-estimate the impact of BSS infrastructure.
   Our research effort proposes an econometric framework that remedies this
   drawback. We propose a measurement equation to account for the
   installation process and relate it to the usage equations thus
   correcting for the bias introduced in earlier research efforts by
   formulating a multi-level joint econometric framework. The econometric
   models developed have been estimated using data compiled from April 2012
   to August 2012 for the BIXI system in Montreal. The model estimates
   support our hypothesis and clearly show over-estimation of BSS
   infrastructure impacts in models that neglect the installation process.
   An elasticity analysis to highlight the advantages of the proposed
   econometric model is also conducted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   systematic methodology is applied to the shape/mass of ice and to the
   aerodynamics penalties in terms of lift, drag, and pitching moments. The

Abstract = {{The sorption affinity and desorption resistance of two types of biochars
   as soil amendments was evaluated in laboratory. The softwood and
   hardwood-biochars demonstrated a high sorption affinity for
   progesterone. The effective distribution coefficient (K-d(eff)) of
   soil-soft wood-derived biochar (SBS450) was significantly higher (HO:
   P<0.05) than soil-hardwood-derived biochar (SBH750), indicating its
   stronger sorption affinity for progesterone. Accordingly, a
   field-lysimeter study was conducted to elucidate the fate and transport
   of manure-borne progesterone in soil matrix and aquatic media in the
   presence of 1\% softwood-biochar (BS450) in upper 0.1 m layer of soil.
   The spatial-temporal stratification of progesterone was monitored at
   four depths over a 46-day period where two different types of manures
   (swine and poultry) were applied to the topsoil of lysimeters under two
   treatments, soil (S) and SBS450. The progesterone concentrations in
   SBS450 were significantly higher (HO: P<0.05) and persisted for a longer
   period in the surface soil than in the control (S); however, the
   concentration was significantly lower in the deeper profile and in
   leachates. The results clearly showed that the application of biochar as
   a soil amendment can be used in alleviating the threat of pollution from
   manure borne progesterone. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biomass gasification shows a great potential to displace fossil fuels.
   In this study, the gasification of pelletized hard wood using a 10kW
   downdraft gasifier is investigated. The variations of pressure and
   temperature parameters during the gasification process with air as a
   reagent medium were controlled. The gasifier started in continuous mode
   to burn the wood pellet feedstock. The results from the continuous mode
   indicate average temperatures of 838 and 754 degrees C for combustion
   and reduction zones inside the gasifier, respectively, which shows a low
   temperature gasification process. Moreover, the pressure in the
   combustion zone varied on average from -1.30 to -1.64kPa, while the
   pressure on top of the main reactor showed average variation of less
   than 0.07kPa. The pressure drop is assumed to be caused by bridging of
   the feedstock, which results in a large part of the feedstock to not
   flow and be burnt inside the reactor. The shape of feedstock is
   theorized to be the major reason for the feedstock to bridge, with air
   leaks in the reactor resulting from sealing challenges intensifying the
   problem.}},

Title = {{Regional Estimation of Floods for Ungauged Sites Using Partial Duration
   Series and Scaling Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One of the main obstacles in making reliable predictions of extreme
   events is the apparent shortness of the time series available in
   hydrology. There is a common advantage of both regional flood-frequency
   analysis and partial duration series (PDS) in which both of them allow a
   reduction of uncertainty by introducing more data to the site of
   interest. Therefore, a new regional index flood method for ungauged
   sites based on the PDS model is presented. The PDS model considered in
   this case assumes a Poisson-distributed number of threshold exceedances
   and generalized Pareto-distributed peak magnitudes. A new objective
   approach for the selection of the threshold in the context of
   regionalization is introduced. This approach estimates a range of
   reasonable thresholds (or an average annual number of events) for every
   site. Consequently, the regional average annual number of events can be
   determined as a common value for all sites in the homogeneous region.
   The delineation of hydrologically homogeneous regions is determined
   using the scaling approach. The feasibility of the proposed method was
   assessed using the available daily flow series from 57 watersheds in
   Quebec (Canada). Furthermore, the new method is compared with two
   existing methods for regionalization: the region of influence and
   canonical correlation analysis methods. Results of the numerical
   application indicate that the quantile estimates obtained from the new
   method provide the best values of the performance criteria
   (e.g.,root-mean-square error). Hence, the new method not only eliminates
   subjective decisions but also greatly improves the predicted floods for
   ungauged sites. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Intracranial volume reflects the maximally attained brain size during
   development, and remains stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is
   highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined.
   In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five
   previously unknown loci for intracranial volume and confirmed two known
   signals. Four of the loci were also associated with adult human stature,
   but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting
   for height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head
   circumference (rho(genetic) = 0.748), which indicates a similar genetic
   background and allowed us to identify four additional loci through
   meta-analysis (N-combined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume
   were also related to childhood and adult cognitive function, and
   Parkinson's disease, and were enriched near genes involved in growth
   pathways, including PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings identify the

Abstract = {{Rainfall-induced landslides are a common occurrence in terrain with
   steep topography and soils that have degradable strength. Rainfall
   infiltration into a partially saturated slope of infinite extent can
   lead to either a decrease or complete elimination of soil suction,
   compromising the slopes' stability. In this research the rainfall
   infiltration coupled with deformation of a partially saturated soil
   slope during rainfall infiltration is analyzed. The limit equilibrium
   conditions and the shear strength relationship of a partially saturated
   soil are employed to develop an analytical solution for calculating the
   stability of an infinite partially saturated slope due to rainfall
   infiltration. The analytical solutions are able to consider the
   influence of the coupled effects on the stability of the slope. The
   factors that affect the safety of a partially saturated slope of
   infinite extent are discussed. The results indicate that the
   poro-mechanical coupling of water infiltration and deformation has an
   important effect on the stability of the infinite unsaturated slope. (C)

Title = {{Combination Therapies for Smoking Cessation A Hierarchical Bayesian
   Meta-Analysis}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1060-1071}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Context: Treatment guidelines recommend the use of combination therapies
   for smoking cessation, particularly behavioral therapy (BT) as an
   adjunct to pharmacotherapy. However, these guidelines rely on previous
   reviews with important limitations. This study's objective was to
   evaluate the efficacy of combination therapies compared with
   monotherapies, using the most rigorous data available.
   Evidence acquisition: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of
   pharmacotherapies, BTs, or both were conducted. The Cochrane Library,
   Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were systematically searched from
   inception to July 2015. Inclusion was restricted to RCTs reporting
   biochemically validated abstinence at 12 months. Direct and indirect
   comparisons were made in 2015 between therapies using hierarchical
   Bayesian models.
   Evidence synthesis: The search identified 123 RCTs meeting inclusion
   criteria (60,774 participants), and data from 115 (57,851 participants)
   were meta-analyzed. Varenicline with BT increased abstinence more than
   other combinations of a pharmacotherapy with BT (varenicline versus
   bupropion: OR = 1.56, 95\% credible interval {[}CrI] = 1.07, 2.34;
   varenicline versus nicotine patch: OR = 1.65, 95\% CrI = 1.10, 2.51;
   varenicline versus short-acting nicotine-replacement therapies: OR =
   1.68, 95\% CrI = 1.15, 2.53). Adding BT to any pharmacotherapy compared
   with pharmacotherapy alone was inconclusive, owing to wide CrIs (OR =
   1.17, CrI = 0.60, 2.12). Nicotine patch with short-acting
   nicotine-replacement therapy appears safe and increases abstinence
   versus nicotine-replacement monotherapy (OR = 1.63, CrI = 1.06, 3.03).
   Data are limited concerning other pharmacotherapy combinations and their
   safety and tolerability.
   Conclusions: Evidence suggests that combination therapy benefits may be
   less than previously thought. Combined with BT, varenicline increases
   abstinence more than other pharmacotherapy with BT combinations. (C)

Abstract = {{The quartz-crystal-microbalance-with-dissipation (QCM-D) has become a
   powerful tool for studying the bond viscoelasticity of biotic and
   abiotic colloidal particles adhering to substratum surfaces. A window
   equipped QCM-D allows high-throughput analysis of the average bond
   viscoelasticity, measuring over 106 particles simultaneously in one
   single experiment. Other techniques require laborious analyses of
   individual particles. In this protocol, the quantitative derivation of
   the spring-constant and drag-coefficient of the bond between adhering
   colloidal particles and substratum surfaces using QCM-D is explained for
   bacteria and silica particles, using the particle-mass derived for
   validation. Bond viscoelasticity is calculated using a coupled resonator
   model, paying special attention to the protocol for mathematical fitting
   needed to obtain reliable quantitative output. Knowledge of the
   viscoelasticity of the bond between colloidal particles and substratum
   surfaces facilitates development of new strategies to detach adhering
   particles from or retain them on a surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{There is a considerable performance gap between the current scalable
   audio coding schemes and a nonscalable coder operating at the same
   bitrate. This suboptimality results from the independent coding of the
   layers in these systems. One of the aspects that plays a role in this
   suboptimality is the entropy coding. In practical audio coding systems
   including MPEG advanced audio coding (AAC), the transform domain
   coefficients are quantized using an entropy-constrained quantizer.
   InMPEG-4 scalable AAC (S-AAC), the quantization and coding are performed
   separately at each layer. In case of Huffman coding, the redundancy
   introduced by the entropy coding at each layer is larger at lower
   quantization resolutions. Also, the redundancy for the overall coder
   becomes larger as the number of layers increases. In fact, there is a
   trade-off between the overall redundancy and the fine-grain scalability
   in which the bitrate per layer is smaller and more layers are required.
   In this paper, a fine-grain scalable coder for audio signals is proposed
   where the entropy coding of a quantizer is made scalable via joint
   design of entropy coding and quantization. By constructing a
   Huffman-like coding tree where the internal nodes can be mapped to the
   reconstruction points, the tree can be pruned at any internal node to
   control the rate-distortion (RD) performance of the encoder in a
   fine-grain manner. A set of metrics and a trellis-based approach is
   proposed to create a coding tree so that an appropriate path is
   generated on the RD plane. The results show the proposed method
   outperforms the scalable audio coding performed based on reconstruction
   error quantization as used in practical systems, e.g., in S-AAC.}},

Abstract = {{While both cost-sensitive learning and online learning have been studied
   separately, these two issues have seldom been addressed simultaneously.
   Yet, there are many applications where both aspects are important. This
   paper investigates a class of algorithmic approaches suitable for online
   cost-sensitive learning, designed for such problems. The basic idea is
   to leverage existing methods for online ensemble algorithms, and combine
   these with batch mode methods for cost-sensitive bagging/boosting
   algorithms. Within this framework, we describe several theoretically
   sound online cost-sensitive bagging and online cost-sensitive boosting
   algorithms, and show that the convergence of the proposed algorithms is
   guaranteed under certain conditions. We then present extensive
   experimental results on benchmark datasets to compare the performance of
   the various proposed approaches.}},

Abstract = {{We study distributed methods for online prediction and stochastic

   perform local computations and then communicate in order to aggregate
   information and synchronize their decision variables. Synchronization is
   accomplished through the use of a distributed averaging protocol. When
   an exact distributed averaging protocol is used, it is known that the
   optimal regret bound of O(root m) can be achieved using the distributed
   minibatch algorithm in {[}{''}Optimal distributed online prediction

   protocols and show that the optimal regret bound can also be achieved in
   this setting. In particular, we propose a gossip-based optimization
   method that achieves the optimal regret bound. The amount of
   communication required depends on the network topology through the
   second largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix of a random walk on
   the network. In the setting of stochastic optimization, the proposed
   gossip-based approach achieves nearly linear scaling: The optimization

   rounds, each of which involves O (log n) gossip iterations, when n nodes
   communicate over a well-connected graph.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, state estimation of a single degree of freedom flexible
   cable-actuated system governed by nonlinear equations of motion is
   considered. State estimation formulations are developed in discrete time
   using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an unscented Kalman filter
   (UKF). Measurements of the payload acceleration and either the angular
   position of one or both winches are obtained by an accelerometer mounted
   on the payload and angular winch encoders. These sensors are relatively
   small and inexpensive, and allow for operation in many different
   environments. This is an improvement over current estimation techniques
   for cable-actuated systems that typically rely on a position
   measurements of the payload that are obtained by large and expensive
   sensors that often only operate in a particular environment (e.g.,
   motion capture system, GPS receiver). An EKF and UKF are implemented to
   estimate the states of the system using a nonlinear dynamic model. A
   proportional-derivative-based controller from the literature is used for
   control. Estimation of the tension in each cable is also performed,
   which demonstrates that additional sensors (e.g., load cells) are not
   needed to obtain an accurate estimate of the cable tensions.
   Consideration of sensors with different sampling rates is also included
   in the EKF and UKF formulations. Simulation results using the EKF and
   UKF along with the proportional-derivative controller in discrete time
   are presented. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{We report a new sol-gel approach of synthesis of LiFePO4 (LFP) thin film

   aqueous lithium dihydrogen phosphate (LiH2PO4) deposited on fluorine tin
   oxide (Fro) glass substrate, followed by heating at 450 degrees C under
   nitrogen gas for 1 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that the LFP
   films have an orthorhombic crystal system with space group Pnma (62).
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows spherical LFP nanoparticles
   aggregates homogenously deposited all over the surface of FTO substrate

   charge-discharge measurements. The cycle life was evaluated by running
   1000 cycles of charge-discharge at a current density of 20 mu A/cm(2).

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess whether the dual-hormone (insulin
   and glucagon) artificial pancreas reduces hypoglycaemia compared with
   the single-hormone (insulin alone) artificial pancreas during two types
   of exercise.
   An open-label randomised crossover study comparing both systems in 17
   adults with type 1 diabetes (age, 37.2 +/- 13.6 years; HbA(1c,) 8.0 +/-
   1.0\% {[}63.9 +/- 10.2 mmol/mol]) during two exercise types on an
   ergocycle and matched for energy expenditure: continuous (60\% for 60
   min) and interval (2 min alternating periods at 85\% and 50\% for 40
   min, with two 10 min periods at 45\% at the start and end of the
   session). Blocked randomisation (size of four) with a 1:1:1:1 allocation
   ratio was computer generated. The artificial pancreas was applied from
   15:30 hours until 19:30 hours; exercise was started at 18:00 hours and
   announced 20 min earlier to the systems. The study was conducted at the
   Institut de recherches cliniques de Montr,al.
   During single-hormone control compared with dual-hormone control,
   exercise-induced hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose < 3.3 mmol/l with
   symptoms or < 3.0 mmol/l regardless of symptoms) was observed in four
   (23.5\%) vs two (11.8\%) interventions (p = 0.5) for continuous exercise
   and in six (40\%) vs one (6.25\%) intervention (p = 0.07) for interval
   exercise. For the pooled analysis (single vs dual hormone), the median
   (interquartile range) percentage time spent at glucose levels below 4.0
   mmol/l was 11\% (0.0-46.7\%) vs 0\% (0-0\%; p = 0.0001) and at glucose
   levels between 4.0 and 10.0 mmol/l was 71.4\% (53.2-100\%) vs 100\%
   (100-100\%; p = 0.003). Higher doses of glucagon were needed during
   continuous (0.126 +/- 0.057 mg) than during interval exercise (0.093 +/-
   0.068 mg) (p = 0.03), with no reported side-effects in all
   interventions.
   The dual-hormone artificial pancreas outperformed the single-hormone
   artificial pancreas in regulating glucose levels during announced
   exercise in adults with type 1 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{The application of mineral beneficiation techniques to valuable rare
   earth element (REE) bearing minerals requires a significant amount of
   research. A previous paper (Jordens et al., 2016) described a series of
   physical separation processes employed to pre-concentrate rare earth
   minerals (REM) and reject iron oxide minerals from the Nechalacho.
   Deposit. In addition to grade and recovery information it is important
   to understand the performance of these separations from a mineralogical
   perspective. Information on liberation, mineral associations, magnetic
   properties and size-by-size recoveries can be used to further improve
   process designs for this deposit.
   This work employs automated mineralogy (QEMSCAN), scanning electron
   microscopy and a vibrating sample magnetometer to characterise the
   products from laboratory gravity separation (Knelson and Falcon
   centrifugal concentrators) and magnetic separation (varying intensity
   wet drum magnetic separators). The information gathered is then used to
   identify the optimum fraction for downstream flotation separation. The
   selected flowsheet included a ICnelson centrifugal concentrator and low
   intensity drum magnetic separation resulting in a total rare earth oxide

Abstract = {{The beneficiation of rare earth element (REE) minerals may include many
   different beneficiation unit operations, but the final process choice
   typically depends on the inherent mineral characteristics. The
   Nechalacho REE deposit contains multiple low specific gravity,
   diamagnetic silicate gangue minerals (predominantly feldspars and
   quartz) and high specific gravity, iron oxide minerals (magnetite and
   hematite). The valuable REE minerals (REM) in the deposit consist of a
   variety of relatively high specific gravity, paramagnetic minerals. A
   process has been proposed to concentrate the value REM through a
   combination of gravity (rejecting silicate gangue) and magnetic
   (rejecting iron oxide gangue) separation steps prior to froth flotation.
   This work employed a laboratory-scale process including two different
   gravity separation steps (Knelson and Falcon centrifugal concentrators)
   followed by a series of varying intensity wet drum magnetic separation
   steps as well as dry induced roll magnetic separation and wet high
   intensity magnetic separation steps. The resultant fractions have been
   characterized by XRD, ICP-MS, and QEMSCAN to identify the optimum
   fraction for downstream flotation separation. The combination of a
   Knelson Concentrator with low intensity wet drum magnetic separation was
   found to efficiently concentrate REM while also rejecting high specific
   gravity iron oxide minerals. A novel finding from this study is the
   concentration of heavy REE-bearing zircon into coarse size fractions
   after grinding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{133-141}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In a flotation cell, bubble size is a function of both coalescence and
   breakup phenomena. Two phase tests, conducted in a conventional 5.5 L
   Denver mechanical flotation cell, studied the effect of impeller speed,
   gas flow rate and frother concentration on bubble size in various
   electrolyte-frother solutions. The addition of frother to a synthetic
   sea salt did reduce the measured bubble size (at certain mechanical
   conditions); whereas the effect of frother addition to NaCl was too
   small (when compared to measurement errors) to make significant
   conclusions. This led to more detailed CCC curves (0-50 ppm MIBC) for
   NaCl, NaCl + MgCl2, NaCl + CaSO4, and NaCl + KCl solutions, at constant
   electrolyte concentrations, to be conducted. They showed an increase in
   bubble size with the addition of MIBC. This was attributed to the
   saturation of frother at the air -water interface, reducing local
   surface tension gradients that help produce smaller bubbles. This
   occurrence is typically masked in traditional CCC curves due to the
   dominance of coalescence effects at low frother concentrations. (C) 2016

Title = {{A comparison of the predictability of batch flotation kinetic models}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{142-150}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Batch flotation test data of a mixture of pyrite and calcite were used
   to compare regression parameters of four kinetic model structures. The
   work included the use of unoxidized or a mixture of partially oxidized
   pyrite (by microwave irradiation). The objective of floating oxidized
   pyrite was to have mineral particles with different floatability, closer
   to a real situation. The models considered include: single rate
   constant, distributed rate constants (i.e. rectangular and gamma
   distributions), and a recently introduced approach based on fractional
   calculus. Such models were selected due to their good tradeoff between
   simplicity 1 and accuracy. The regressions were performed (1) taking all
   the data points and comparing the mean square error (MSE) and adjusted
   correlation factor (R-Adj(2)) as indicators of the goodness of fit; and
   (2) taking the first data points while neglecting the last ones (from 1
   to 3) and observing the variability of the model parameters and the
   prediction of maximum recovery (R infinity). For the latter regression
   scheme, besides MSE and R-Adj(2), a predictive factor, E, was defined by
   subtracting the final measured recovery from the calculation obtained by
   the model. This allowed to measure the ability of each model to
   extrapolate the omitted points on the recovery vs. time curve.
   Results from this study showed that the single constant model had a
   satisfactory performance with the advantage of having the least
   parameters compared to the other structures. The gamma model was
   effective and robust. The rectangular model gave an acceptable goodness
   of fit but overestimated the maximum and final recovery. Finally, the
   fractional calculus approach gave the best goodness of fit, overall, but
   failed in predicting the maximum recovery, which occurred when the
   derivative order was greater than 1. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Beneficiation of the Nechalacho rare earth deposit: Flotation response
   using benzohydroxamic acid}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{158-169}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rare earth minerals (REM) may be beneficiated using a variety of
   separation techniques with froth flotation being the most commonly
   applied in operating REM separation plants. Many different collectors
   have been tested with traditional REM such as bastnasite. The most
   successful are the hydroxamic acids. The Nechalacho deposit contains
   many REM for which there is minimal processing information in
   literature. Thus, experimental investigation into their flotation
   behaviour is required.
   This work focuses on understanding the effect of a benzohydroxamic acid
   collector on the flotation of a REM enriched pre-concentrate from the
   Nechalacho deposit (after lab-scale gravity and magnetic separation
   steps). The lab-scale flotation response of the REM is quantified using
   mass recoveries, water recoveries, QEMSCAN and chemical assay data and
   TOF-SIMS in order to study the recovery, entrainment and kinetics of
   different REM. Three different flotation schemes are investigated to
   determine the effect of a secondary addition of collector as well as the
   addition of lead ions, a known activator in hydroxamic acid flotation.
   It is important to note that the goal of this work is to determine
   fundamental flotation properties of the different REM in the Nechalacho
   deposit. As such, the process investigated here is not indicative in any
   way of the current process design for this deposit. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Pages = {{243-255}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the viscoelastically coupled size-dependent
   dynamics of a microbeam in the framework of the modified couple stress
   theory. The elastic and viscous components of the stress and deviatoric
   part of the symmetric couple stress tensors are obtained employing the
   Kelvin Voigt viscoelastic model. The size-dependent elastic potential
   energy is developed based on the modified couple stress theory. The work
   of the viscous components of the stress and deviatoric part of the
   symmetric couple stress tensors are formulated in terms of the system
   parameters. The work of an external excitation force as well as the
   kinetic energy of the system is obtained as functions of the
   displacement field. Hamilton's principle is employed, yielding the
   nonlinear equations for the longitudinal and transverse motions of the
   viscoelastic microbeam. A weighted residual method is then applied to
   the nonlinear equations of motion resulting in a high dimensional
   reduced-order system with finite degrees of freedom. This
   high-dimensional model is solved via use of a continuation method as
   well as a direct time-integration technique. The viscoelastically size
   -dependent nonlinear frequency- and force-responses are constructed and
   the effects of the simultaneous presence of viscoelastic energy
   dissipation mechanism and the length-scale parameter are examined. (C)

Abstract = {{The Upper Indus Basin (UIB), situated in the
   Himalaya-Karakoram-Hindukush (HKH) mountain ranges, is the major
   contributor to the supply of water for irrigation in Pakistan. Improved
   management of downstream water resources requires studying and comparing
   spatiotemporal changes in the snow cover and hydrological behavior of
   the river basins located in the HKH region. This study explored in
   detail the recent changes that have occurred in the Gilgit River basin
   (12,656 km(2); western sub-basin of UIB), which is characterized by a
   mean catchment elevation of 4250 m above sea level (m ASL). The basin's
   snow cover was monitored through the snow products provided by the MODIS
   satellite sensor, while analysis of its hydrological regime was
   supported by hydrological and climatic data recorded at different
   altitudes. The Gilgit basin findings were compared to those previously
   obtained for the lower-altitude Astore basin (mean catchment elevation =
   4100 m ASL) and the higher-altitude Hunza basin (mean catchment
   elevation = 4650 m ASL). These three catchments were selected because of
   their different glacier coverage, contrasting area distribution at high
   altitudes and significant impact on the Upper Indus River flow. Almost
   7, 5 and 33 \% of the area of the Gilgit, Astore and Hunza basins,
   respectively, are situated above 5000 m ASL, and approximately 8, 6 and
   25 \%, respectively, are covered by glaciers. The UIB region was found
   to follow a stable or slightly increasing trend in snow coverage and had
   a discharge dominated by snow and glacier melt in its western
   (Hindukush-Karakoram), southern (Western-Himalaya) and northern
   (Central-Karakoram) sub-basins.}},

Abstract = {{Electromechanical variable capacitors, or varactors, find a wide range
   of applications including sensing applications and the tuning of
   electrical circuit resonance. We demonstrate a nano-electromechanical
   graphene varactor, a variable capacitor wherein the capacitance is tuned
   by voltage controlled deflection of a dense array of suspended graphene
   membranes. The low flexural rigidity of graphene monolayers is exploited
   to achieve low actuation voltage and high tunable capacitance density in
   an ultra-thin structure. Large arrays comprising thousands of
   suspensions were fabricated to give a tunable capacitance of over 10 pF
   mm(-2). This capacitance density suggests that graphene offers a
   potential solution to the challenge of reducing the size of
   micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). A capacitance tuning of 55\% was
   achieved with a 10 V actuating voltage, exceeding the 50\% tuning limit
   of Hookean parallel plate pull-in without the use of complex mechanical
   schemes that occupy substrate area. Capacitor behavior was investigated
   experimentally, and described by a simple theoretical model. Mechanical
   properties of the graphene membranes were measured independently using
   atomic force microscopy. We present a comparison of state-of-the-art
   MEMS and graphene varactors. The quality factor of graphene varactors is
   limited by graphene sheet resistance, pull-in voltage can be improved
   with more aggressive scaling, while the power handling and cycling
   stability of graphene varactors remains unknown.}},

Title = {{Molecular dynamics on the self-assembly of mesogenic graphene precursors}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{189-199}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We characterize the spontaneous aggregation of Disodium Cfomoglycate
   (DSCG) in the isotropic phase of aqueous solutions, which is an
   archetypical mesogenic precursor for the supramolecular synthesis of
   graphenic carbons, using molecular dynamics simulations and
   thermodynamic scaling. DSCG belongs to a broader family of mesogenic
   precursors called lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLC). Previously
   reported experimental self-assembly features were quantitatively
   reproduced using a full atomistic representation. We find that the
   formation of hydrogen bonds between solvent water and mesogenic
   molecules strongly contributes to the self-assembly, a new discovery in
   LCLC self-assembly. We propose that aggregation is energetically driven
   by entropic forces which favor the formation of 7C-TC interactions
   within mesogens' polyaromatic cores by reorienting DSCG hydrophilic
   groups towards solvent molecules. We carried out different quantitative
   characterizations that support this mechanism, such as radial
   distribution function and hydrogen bond distribution analysis.
   Furthermore, conformation stability calculations were studied using
   metadynamics sampling technique. These results provide a significant
   contribution to the ongoing understanding of the self-assembly of LCLC
   required for the characterization and synthesis of highly ordered
   supramolecular graphenic materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To study the biological activity effects of femtosecond laser-induced
   structures on cell behavior, TA6V samples were micro-textured with
   focused femtosecond laser pulses generating grooves of various
   dimensions on the micrometer scale (width: 25-75 mu m; depth: 1-10 mu
   m). LIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures) were also
   generated during the laser irradiation, providing a supplementary
   structure (sinusoidal form) of hundreds of nanometers at the bottom of
   the grooves oriented perpendicular (perpendicular to LIPPS) or parallel
   (// LIPPS) to the direction of these grooves. C3H10 T1/2 murine
   mesenchymal stem cells were cultivated on the textured biomaterials. To
   have a preliminary idea of the spreading of biological media on the
   substrate, prior to cell culture, contact angle measurement were
   performed. This showed that the post-irradiation hydrophilicity of the
   samples can decrease with time according to its storage environment. The
   multiscale structuration either induced a collaborative or a competitive
   influence of the LIPSS and grooves on the cells. It has been shown that
   cells individually and collectively were most sensitive to microscale
   grooves which were narrower than 25 mu m and deeper than 5 pm with
   perpendicular to LIPPS. In some cases, cells were individually sensitive
   to the LIPSS but the cell layer organization did not exhibit significant
   differences in comparison to a non-textured surface. These results
   showed that cells are more sensitive to the nanoscale structures
   (LIPSS), unless the microstructures's size is close to the cell size and
   deeper than 5 mu m. There, the cells are sensitive to the microscale
   structures and go on spreading following these structures. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (ATAAs) can lead to a dissection or
   rupture of the aorta, causing death or disability of the patients.
   Surgical interventions used to treat this disease are associated with
   risks of mortality and morbidity. Several studies have investigated the
   rupture mechanisms of ATAAs; however, underlying reasons behind aortic
   rupture (failure) have not been fully elucidated and further
   investigations are necessary. The rupture of pathological aortic tissue
   is a local phenomenon resulting from defects or tears in the vessel
   wall. In this work, the toughness-based rupture properties of ATAAs have
   been examined.
   The toughness, biaxial tensile properties, and histological properties
   of aneurysmal and control human ascending thoracic aortas (ATAs) were
   characterized from four quadrants of surgically excised aortic rings.
   The aneurysmal tissue population included aortas from patients with
   bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) and tricuspid aortic valves (TAV). The
   toughness, incremental modulus, and thickness properties of the aortas
   were determined and compared regionally. Additionally, to further
   explore the rupture propensity of ATAAs, the inter-correlation of the
   toughness properties with histological characteristics have been
   explored. We found no correlation between toughness and incremental
   modulus. However, toughness decreased significantly with the amount of
   collagen. In the outer curvature, there was an increase in incremental
   modulus with collagen+elastin content, but a decrease in toughness.
   These results suggest tissue remodeling could affect toughness and
   stiffness differently in ascending aortic aneurysins. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bayesian models of cognition hypothesize that human brains make sense of
   data by representing probability distributions and applying Bayes' rule
   to find the best explanation for available data. Understanding the
   neural mechanisms underlying probabilistic models remains important
   because Bayesian models provide a computational framework, rather than
   specifying mechanistic processes. Here, we propose a deterministic
   neural-network model which estimates and represents probability
   distributions from observable events-a phenomenon related to the concept
   of probability matching. Our model learns to represent probabilities
   without receiving any representation of them from the external world,
   but rather by experiencing the occurrence patterns of individual events.
   Our neural implementation of probability matching is paired with a
   neural module applying Bayes' rule, forming a comprehensive neural
   scheme to simulate human Bayesian learning and inference. Our model also
   provides novel explanations of base-rate neglect, a notable deviation
   from Bayes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{619-647}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Software developers rely on a fast build system to incrementally compile
   their source code changes and produce modified deliverables for testing
   and deployment. Header files, which tend to trigger slow rebuild
   processes, are most problematic if they also change frequently during
   the development process, and hence, need to be rebuilt often. In this
   paper, we propose an approach that analyzes the build dependency graph
   (i.e., the data structure used to determine the minimal list of commands
   that must be executed when a source code file is modified), and the
   change history of a software system to pinpoint header file
   hotspots-header files that change frequently and trigger long rebuild
   processes. Through a case study on the GLib, PostgreSQL, Qt, and Ruby
   systems, we show that our approach identifies header file hotspots that,
   if improved, will provide greater improvement to the total future build
   cost of a system than just focusing on the files that trigger the
   slowest rebuild processes, change the most frequently, or are used the
   most throughout the codebase. Furthermore, regression models built using
   architectural and code properties of source files can explain 32-57 \%
   of these hotspots, identifying subsystems that are particularly
   hotspot-prone and would benefit the most from architectural refinement.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the relative
   humidity on the product quality during microwave drying process. A new
   microwave drying system with humidity control was developed. Twelve
   schemes were planned in the experiments, for the purpose of changing the
   relative humidity of the convection air. The relationship between the
   humidity and the drying rate as well as the product quality were
   discussed. Nonparametric ANOVA and multiple comparisons were conducted.
   Results showed that the complementary water method could provide the
   best product quality, followed by the accelerated and low rate air flow
   schemes. High flow rate and decelerated air schemes should be avoid if
   the product quality is of utmost consideration. The accelerated air
   schemes should be a compromise proposal if the drying rate is also
   concerned. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decades, the palm oil industry has been growing rapidly
   due to increasing demands for food, cosmetic, and hygienic products.
   Aside from producing palm oil, the industry generates a huge quantity of
   residues (dry and wet) which can be processed to produce biofuel. Driven
   by the necessity to find an alternative and renewable energy/fuel
   resources, numerous technologies have been developed and more are being
   developed to process oil-palm and palm-oil wastes into biofuel. To
   further develop these technologies, it is essential to understand the
   current stage of the industry and technology developments. The objective
   of this paper is to provide an overview of the palm oil industry, review
   technologies available to process oil palm and palm oil residues into
   biofuel, and to summarise the challenges that should be overcome for
   further development. The paper also discusses the research and
   development needs, technoeconomics, and life cycle analysis of biofuel
   production from oil-palm and palm-oil wastes. (C) 2016 BRTeam. All

Abstract = {{This paper experimentally demonstrates a design optimization of an
   evanescently-coupled waveguide germanium-on-silicon photodetector (PD)
   towards high-speed (> 30 Gb/s) applications. The resulting PD provides a
   responsivity of 1.09 A/W at 1550 nm, a dark current of 3.5 mu A and
   bandwidth of 42.5 GHz at 2 V reverse-bias voltage. To optimize the PD,
   the impact of various design parameters on performance is investigated.
   A novel optimization methodology for the PD's responsivity based on the
   required bandwidth is developed. The responsivity of the PD is enhanced
   by enlarging its geometry and using off-centered contacts on top of the
   germanium, while an integrated peaking inductor mitigates the inherent
   bandwidth reduction from the responsivity optimization. The performance
   of the optimized PD and the conventional, smaller size non-optimized PD
   is compared to validate the optimization methodology. The sensitivity of
   the optimized PD improves by 3.2 dB over a smaller size non-optimized
   PD. The paper further discusses the impact of top metal contacts on the
   photodetector's performance. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Volume = {{528}},
Pages = {{36-43}},

Abstract = {{Graphene nanoflakes (GNFs), a stack of 5-20 layers of graphene sheets,
   are generated here using methane decomposition in a thermal plasma
   followed by homogeneous nucleation of the 2-dimensional structures in
   the gas stream. The GNFs are functionalized with nitrogen and iron to
   improve their electrocatalytic activity. The iron functionalization step
   is carried out as a post-processing step within the same thermal plasma
   reactor used to grow the nanoparticles. Two different iron precursors
   are tested in the reactor, iron powder and iron (II) acetate solution.
   The iron source carried by a nitrogen flow is injected in the argon
   plasma, and parameters such as the plasma power, pressure, and the
   exposure time during functionalization are optimized for enhanced
   catalyst activity. Structure and composition of the resulting catalysts
   are characterized, and their electrocatalytic performances in terms of
   onset potential, half wave potential and current density show an
   increase compared to the non-functionalized GNFs. This study proves the
   ability to entirely produce a pure and highly crystalline graphene-based
   non-noble metal catalyst using a thermal plasma single batch process
   with simple precursors such as methane and nitrogen gas, and an iron
   powder or iron acetate solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{This study explores the possibility of making carbon-negative and
   cement-free construction blocks using steel slag as sole binder and
   blast furnace slag as lightweight aggregates through carbonation
   activation. Both steel slag and blast furnace slag are by-products of
   steel making process. The goal of the study is to develop a clean
   production that can utilize slag and carbon dioxide to produce
   environment friendly construction products. Carbonation activation was
   implemented during the curing of the blocks to accelerate early strength
   gain. The physical and durability of slag-bond concrete blocks were
   examined through their density, water absorption, compressive strength
   and freeze and thaw resistance. An economic analysis was performed and a
   carbon balance was computed to evaluate the feasibility of making
   carbon-negative and economically-competitive slag-bond blocks. This
   study demonstrates that the proposed process consumes no natural
   resources, produces no wastes, is capable for carbon sequestration and
   is a clean production. The slag-bond concrete block is a carbon-negative
   product In addition, slag-bond concrete block exhibited better
   mechanical and durability properties compared to the commercial cement
   block. The cost analysis suggests that slag-bond concrete blocks can be
   made at a lower cost compared to the commercial cement block if they are
   mass produced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{1560-1572}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Additive Manufacturing (AM) also known as 3D printing technology has
   drawn increasing attention from the industrial world. It provides the
   capability of freeform fabrication to achieve high complexity as well as
   significant reduction of a supply chain which further enhances the
   profit margin for manufacturers. However, while claiming on the
   advantage on the environmental aspect, there is very limited research on
   the environmental impact of AM technologies. Most of existing
   environmental assessment models for AM. processes are developed based on
   a general Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework. Due to the limited
   scope and boundary of these models, design results are usually taken as
   the input These existing models may work well for traditional
   manufacturing processes. However, when it comes to AM process, these
   methods are no longer valid, since the design freedoms which may have a
   great impact on sustainability are always neglected. To deal with this
   issue, a general framework which can integrate a design stage in LCA for
   minimizing the product environmental impact of AM process in particular
   for binder-jetting process is proposed. The detailed description of each
   major stage of the proposed framework is presented. This framework has
   been applied to evaluate the environmental impact of fabricating an
   engine bracket by binder jetting process. In this case study, a
   comparison of environmental impact between CNC and binder jetting
   fabrication process is made. The result shows that binder-jetting
   consumes significantly less energy and produce less CO2 to produce a
   topologically optimized part than CNC milling for the same product This
   case study demonstrates a key role of design optimization in the
   proposed framework. This proposed framework can be further modified for
   other typical AM process in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Several works in the past have attempted to correlate uniaxial strength
   and indentation hardness for a range of materials. The proportionality
   constant,of an indenter provides the basis to the hardness strength
   relation of a material. Sharp indenter tips like the cube-corner have
   gained popularity in high strain-rate microtesting. Owing to its low
   semi-angle, the proportionality constant of a cube-corner indenter tip
   considerably deviates from the ideal Tabor's hardness-strength relation.
   A two-dimensional wedge model obtained from the slip-line theory is
   utilized for computing the theoretical proportionality constant
   for{''}the cube-corner tip (similar to 1.81). The validity of computed
   theoretical proportionality factor for the cube-corner tip is assessed
   under a range of strain hardening conditions by the inclusion of
   representative strain under the indenter tip. Proportionality constant
   and representative strain relationship for a cube-corner indenter tip
   are assessed for both quasi-static and dynamic strain rate regimes using
   quasi-static and dynamic indentation hardness, along with quasi-static
   and dynamic stress-strain (sigma - epsilon) curves. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Methyl acrylate/acrylonitrile copolymers (MA/AN) were reactively
   compatibilized as the dispersed phase into poly(ethylene) (PE) for
   potential hydrocarbon barrier materials. The MA/AN was made reactive by
   including p-aminostyrene (PAS), yielding terpolymers (MA/AN/PAS) with
   pendant primary amine functionality (number average molecular weight M-n
   = 65-133 kg mol(-1), dispersity (D) 51.83-2.53, molar composition of PAS
   in copolymer F-PAS = 0.03-0.14, molar composition of AN5FAN50.27-0.52).
   The non-functional MA/AN and amino functional MA/AN/PAS were each melt
   blended into PE that was grafted with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MAnn) at
   200 degrees C at 70: 30 wt \% PE-g-MAnn: co/terpolymer. After extrusion,
   the dispersed phase particle size (volume to surface area diameter, (< D
   >(vs)) was coarse (12.6 mu m) for the non-reactive blend whereas it was
   much lower for the reactive blend (< D >(vs) 5 1.2 mu m). Coarsening
   after annealing at 150 degrees C was slow, but the domain sizes
   increased only slightly for both cases. The reactive blend was deemed
   sufficiently stable and thus was suitable as a candidate barrier
   material for further testing against olefins. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Dilute isotropic collagen solutions are usually flow processed into
   monodomain chiral nematic thin films for obtaining highly ordered
   materials by a multistep process that starts with complex inhomogeneous
   flow kinematics. Here we present rigorous theory and simulation of the
   initial precursors during flow steps in cholesteric collagen film
   formation. We first extract the molecular shape parameter and rotational
   diffusivity from previously reported simple shear data of dilute
   collagen solutions, where the former leads the reactive parameter
   (tumbling function) which determines the net effect of vorticity and
   strain rate on the average orientation and where the latter establishes
   the intensity of strain required for flow-birefringence, both crucial
   quantities for controlled film formation flow. We find that the tumbling
   function is similar to those of rod-like lyotropic liquid crystalline
   polymers and hence it is predicted that they would tumble in the ordered
   high concentration state leading to flow-induced texturing. The
   previously reported experimental data is well fitted with rotational
   diffusivities whose order of magnitude is consistent to those of other
   biomacromolecules. We then investigate the response of the tensor order
   parameter to complex flow kinematics, ranging from pure vorticity,
   through simple shear, to extensional flow, as may arise in typical flow
   casting and film flows. The chosen control variable to produce precursor
   cholesteric films is the director or average orientation, since the
   nematic order is set close to typical values found in concentrated
   cholesteric type I collagen solutions. Using the efficient four-roll
   mill kinematics, we summarize the para-nematic structure-flow process
   diagram in terms of the director orientation and flow type. Using
   analysis and computation, we provide a parametric envelope that is
   necessary to eventually produce well-aligned cholesteric films. We
   conclude that extensional flow is an essential ingredient of
   well-ordered film precursors with required Deborah numbers on the order
   of unity.}},

Title = {{Proposed modeling approach of welding procedures for heavy steel plates}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{18-30}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A numerical modeling approach is proposed to assess the effectiveness of
   automatic submerged arc welding procedures for steel plates with
   thickness larger than 50 mm. The scope of study includes partial joint
   penetration butt welds, their numerical analysis, and the subsequent
   development of welding recommendations for thick steel plates, with the
   ultimate objective to reduce the related industrial losses. The proposed
   approach consists of a heat-transfer numerical model that is integrated
   with a stress analysis model that was validated with measurements
   obtained from two heavy steel assemblies that were welded in a
   fabrication shop. The first consisted of two 75 mm thick plates welded
   in the flat position, for which temperature measurements were recorded.
   The proposed model shows good agreement with these measured temperature
   results. The second consisted of a built-up box column that also
   utilized 75 mm thick plates. This assembly experienced cracks near the
   welds after the completion of the welding procedures. Through a
   comprehensive investigation of the material properties of the steel
   plates it was confirmed that the material met the specifications in
   terms of minimum fracture strain elongation and fracture toughness. The
   model was used to successfully predict the crack initiation due to
   thermal stresses that were developed near the welds. The proposed model
   can potentially be employed to assess the defect limits found in current
   specifications for welded steel assemblies that utilize thick plates.

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{86-100}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the influence of headed crossties on the
   confinement of 200 MPa ultra-high strength concrete (UHSC) columns. A
   Total of six UHSC columns confined by headed crossties (deformed
   reinforcing bars with heads welded on both ends) and seismic crossties,
   detailed with 90 bend anchorages alternated end to end, were constructed
   and tested under pure axial load. The amount and yield strength of
   transverse reinforcement were varied to determine the efficiency of
   headed crossties on the confinement of the UHSC columns. The columns
   with seismic crossties exhibited some loss in confinement due to the
   loss of anchorage of the 90 hooks that opened up before significant
   yielding of the crossties could occur. The relatively small heads used
   are capable of developing the yield force of high-strength transverse
   reinforcement in the UHSC columns. The use of high-strength headed
   crossties resulted in improved confinement compared to columns with
   high-strength seismic crossties resulting in improved post-peak
   performance of UHSC columns. A prediction model that accounts for the
   additional confinement pressure due to the bearing of the heads, brittle
   cover spalling and the stress-strain relationship of UHSC was used to
   predict the axial load-strain behavior of the UHSC columns. (C) 2016

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{359-373}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents strategies for enhancing the transmission of
   ultra-high-strength concrete (UHSC) column loads through normal-strength
   concrete (NSC) slabs in the joint of slab-column connections. Parameters
   of the investigation were the ratio of column concrete strength to slab
   concrete strength (f(cc)'/f(cs)'), as well as the placement of steel
   fiber-reinforced concrete, and the installations of high-strength dowel
   bars and special structural steel inserts in the weak slab joint. The
   beneficial effects of using high-strength dowel bars and high-strength
   structural steel inserts on the ability to transmit axial loads from the
   UHSC columns through the weaker slabs were demonstrated. The benefits of
   placing steel fiber-reinforced concrete in the joint are not as
   significant as the additional high-strength steel reinforcement.
   Predictions of the effective concrete strengths using current code
   approaches and using equations proposed in the literature were compared
   to the experimental results. The results indicate that the design
   approach in the CSA Standard (CSA A23.3-14) and the method proposed by
   Kayani (1992), which is based on the a data fitting approach, provide
   reasonable lower bound predictions of the effective strength for the
   UHSC columns with weaker slab layers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Understanding the phase formation kinetics of nano-crystalline kesterite
   deposited on mesoscopic scaffolds via in situ multi-wavelength
   Raman-monitored annealing}},

Abstract = {{Kesterite, a highly promising photo-absorbing crystalline form of
   Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), has been prepared via various routes. However, the
   lack of in-depth understanding of the dynamic phase formation process of
   kesterite leads to difficulties in optimizing its annealing conditions,
   hence its light harvesting performance. In this paper, in situ Raman
   monitored-annealing is applied to study the phase formation kinetics of
   nano-crystalline kesterite from a precursor deposited on a TiO2
   mesoscopic scaffold. By performing in situ Raman annealing under
   different experimental conditions and wavelengths, several facts have
   been discovered: kesterite crystallization starts at as low as 170
   degrees C, but after short time annealing at 300 degrees C followed by
   cooling, the initially formed kesterite is found to decompose. Annealing
   at 400 degrees C or higher is proven to be sufficient for stabilizing
   the kesterite phase. Annealing at the higher temperature of 500 degrees
   C is necessary though to promote a complete reaction and thus eliminate
   the parasitic copper tin sulfide (CTS) impurity intermediates identified
   at lower annealing temperatures. More importantly, the real-time
   temperature dependence of Raman peak intensity enhancement, shift and
   broadening for CZTS is established experimentally at 500 degrees C for 1
   h, providing a valuable reference in future CZTS research. This work
   demonstrates the significance of using in situ Raman spectroscopy in
   elucidating the kesterite phase formation kinetics, a critical step
   towards full crystal phase control - a prerequisite for developing fully
   functional CZTS-based optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a theoretical study of surface state occupation
   statistics at semiconductor-liquid interfaces, as it pertains to the
   evolution of H-2 and O-2 through water splitting. Our approach combines
   semiclassical charge transport and electrostatics at the
   semiconductor-liquid junction, with a master rate equation describing
   surface state mediated electron/hole transfer. As a model system we have
   studied the TiO2-water junction in the absence of illumination, where it
   is shown that surface states might not always equilibrate with the
   semiconductor. Non-trivial electrostatics, for example including a
   shifting of the Mott-Schottky plateau in capacitive measurements, are
   explored when deep-level surface states partially equilibrate with the
   liquid. We also endeavor to explain observations of non-linearity
   present in Mott-Schottky plots, as they pertain to surface state
   occupation statistics. In general, it is intended that the results of
   this work will serve to further the use and development of quantitative
   device modeling techniques in the description of H-2 evolution at
   semiconductor-liquid junctions.}},

   a very low threshold current of 0.35 mA at room temperature. From the

Abstract = {{Syngas, the mixture of CO and H-2, is a key feedstock to produce
   methanol and liquid fuels in industry, yet limited success has been made
   to develop clean syngas production using renewable solar energy. We
   demonstrated that syngas with a benchmark turnover number of 1330 and a
   desirable CO/H-2 ratio of 1: 2 could be attained from
   photoelectrochemical CO2 and H2O reduction in an aqueous medium by
   exploiting the synergistic co-catalytic effect between Cu and ZnO. The
   CO/H-2 ratio in the syngas products was tuned in a large range between
   2: 1 and 1: 4 with a total unity Faradaic efficiency. Moreover, a high
   Faradaic efficiency of 70\% for CO was acheived at underpotential of 180
   mV, which is the lowest potential ever reported in an aqueous
   photoelectrochemical cell. It was found that the combination of Cu and
   ZnO offered complementary chemical properties that lead to special
   reaction channels not seen in Cu, or ZnO alone.}},

Abstract = {{Cold-spray involving particle and substrate that are of distinct

   contrast, physical trapping and mechanical interlocking play an
   important role for the hard/soft system. Employing a
   layered-particle/substrate model and a crater-particles model, we
   demonstrated the operation and playoff of different bonding mechanisms,
   and provided predictive assessments of the deposition efficiency that
   correspond well to experimental measurements. The present study offers
   key mechanistic insights towards rational process design of cold-spray.

Abstract = {{Dual-band fiber lasers are emerging as a promising technology to
   penetrate new industrial and medical applications from their dual-band
   properties, in addition to providing compactness and environmental
   robustness from the waveguide structure. Here, we demonstrate the use of
   a common graphene saturable absorber and a single gain medium (Tm3+:
   ZBLAN fiber) to implement (1) a dual-band fiber ring laser with
   synchronized Q-switched pulses at wavelengths of 1480 nm and 1840 nm,
   and (2) a dual-band fiber linear laser with synchronized mode-locked
   pulses at wavelengths of 1480 nm and 1845 nm. Q-switched operation at
   1480 nm and 1840 nm is achieved with a synchronized repetition rate from
   20 kHz to 40.5 kHz. For synchronous mode-locked operation, pulses with
   full-width at half maximum durations of 610 fs and 1.68 ps at
   wavelengths of 1480 nm and 1845 nm, respectively, are obtained at a
   repetition rate of 12.3 MHz. These dual-band pulsed sources with an
   ultra-broadband wavelength separation of similar to 360 nm will add new

Abstract = {{In conventional energy-dispersive spectroscopy/scanning-electron
   microscopy (EDS/SEM) analysis, the pear-shaped interaction volume of
   incident electrons in the bulk sample determines spatial resolution and
   the actual scope of EDS analysis is usually a few cubic microns.
   Lowering the accelerating voltage can reduce effectively the interaction
   volume of the electron beam. In this study, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation
   was used to analyze effectively the actual interaction between
   low-energy incident electrons and nanoparticles. MC x ray, a new Monte
   Carlo program, was used to further simulate EDS mapping of Ni
   nanoparticles on the top of an Al2O3 matrix at an accelerating voltage
   of 3 kV, and the theoretical spatial resolution was calculated to be
   approximately 10 nm. In addition, EDS mapping images of 17-nm Ni
   nanoparticles were successfully acquired at high spatial resolution
   similar to the theoretical value by adjusting the operating conditions
   for SEM-EDS analysis, including the use of immersion objective lens, the
   removal of electron trap and collimator, and the reduction of working
   distance as well as detector distance.}},

Abstract = {{Co-located and integrated observation of the surface and subsurface is
   necessary to characterize fault zone hydrogeology. The spectacular
   cliff-face exposure of the Champlain Thrust fault at Lone Rock Point,
   Vermont, and a nearby well-field site provides the opportunity for
   co-located structural and hydrogeologic field observations. We mapped
   the prominent structural features of the Champlain Thrust fault and
   discrete groundwater seeps in outcrop, and also drilled through the
   fault near the outcrop and determined aquifer parameters from aquifer
   pumping tests. In outcrop, the fault core thickness varies on the meter
   scale, splays out into multiple strands, and is offset by a minor normal
   fault. Groundwater seeps are prevalent in the heavily fractured
   footwall, but limited in the fault core and hanging wall, suggesting
   that at the cliff face the water table is generally near the fault core
   and groundwater flow in the hanging wall is limited. Enrichment of more
   soluble minerals in cemented fault rock associated with older strands of
   the fault system may play an important role in localizing karst features
   in the hanging wall. At the well-field site, the Champlain Thrust fault
   is offset significantly by a high-angle normal fault, the water table is
   near the surface, and aquifer pumping tests reveal a complex
   hydrogeologic system, with karst and steep fractures as strong hydraulic
   conduits in the hanging wall and fault core. The most salient features
   of the fault zone hydrogeology in the surface and subsurface data are
   different, but can be integrated into a preliminary conceptual model.
   Together, the surface and subsurface methods underscore and emphasize
   the complexity and heterogeneity of the hydrogeology of this low-angle
   sedimentary fault.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, power system planning practices are undergoing various
   transformations in an attempt to integrate efficiently significant
   amounts of low-carbon power generation technologies. At the heart of
   this efficient integration lies the need to plan for and exploit the
   available flexibility in power systems. In the past, the emphasis was on
   planning the capacity (i.e., power) of operating reserve requirements,
   in the form of categorized reserve types. Such approach was suitable for
   traditional power systems exhibiting low variability and uncertainty.
   The concept of power system flexibility is emerging as a way to
   emphasize the need to also consider the ramping capability of operating
   reserve needed to accommodate high variability and uncertainty arising
   from renewable energy integration. Prior considerations of power system
   flexibility, however, are found to be inadequate to handle
   energy-limited power system resources like energy storage assets and
   demand response. Hence, this paper sets to consider systematically
   energy limitations of operating reserve by proposing energy-based
   operating reserve definitions. We demonstrate the benefits of the new
   reserve definitions, using a receding-horizon economic dispatch
   integrating energy storage.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The adoption of cold-formed steel (CFS) profiles for residential
   buildings started in USA. Positive experiences in this field took place
   in other countries such as Australia, Canada and Japan. In Italy, where
   traditionally steel in residential buildings has a rather limited
   application, this type of construction has not yet found a significant
   use. The University of Trento has recently been involved in a research
   project focusing on the development of an innovative industrialized
   housing system composed of cold-formed steel profiles. In this
   framework, a study of the response of CFS shear walls was performed. The
   experimental part of the study comprised tests on the bare steel
   skeleton and on framedwalls sheathedwith cement board panels. Reversed
   cyclic testing of representative walls subjected to in-plane lateral and
   vertical loads was carried out. Themain features of the experimental
   study and the main results are presented and discussed. The performances
   of the different typologies of shear walls are compared in terms of
   resistance, stiffness, ductility parameters and energy dissipation
   capacity. The paper in its final part, focuses on the results of a study
   of the effectiveness of analytical methods available in literature and
   developed for wooden shear panels, for a reliable evaluation of the
   response of CFS shear walls. (C) 2016. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on

Abstract = {{A modelling study was performed to solve the heat and mass transfer
   problems between grain and the ambient air encountered during drying by
   microwave assisted hot-air dryer, under low microwave (MW) density of
   0.2 W/g. Canola (Brassica napus), soybean (Glycine max) and corn (Zea
   mays) seeds were chosen due to their inherent high oil content. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the effect of drying
   conditions on the structural characteristics of these oilseeds. A
   mathematical model was adapted to simulate drying of one seed of canola,
   soybean and corn. The process of water transfer was modelled based on
   the effect of vapour pressure on the water molecules inside the seed. It
   was observed that when the difference between the vapour pressure inside
   the grain and the surrounding air was higher than, the drying rate
   increased which led to cracks in the grain. Results showed that the
   drying rate decreased when the temperature of air inside the cavity of
   the microwave increased for all the oilseeds studied, because of the
   reduced differential vapour pressure between the grain and the ambient
   air. On the other hand, the drying rate increased if the temperature of
   the inlet air was reduced because the difference between the two
   pressures increased. It was concluded that by controlling the ambient
   air, the grains could be protected against popping and cracking because
   of lower vapour pressure differential during MW assisted hot-air drying.}},

Journal = {{APL PHOTONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{All-optical signal processing based on nonlinear optical effects allows
   for the realization of important functions in telecommunications
   including wavelength conversion, optical multiplexing/demultiplexing,
   Fourier transformation, and regeneration, amongst others, on ultrafast
   time scales to support high data rate transmission. In integrated
   photonic subsystems, the majority of all-optical signal processing
   systems demonstrated to date typically process only a single channel at
   a time or perform a single processing function, which imposes a serious
   limitation on the functionality of integrated solutions. Here, we
   demonstrate how nonlinear optical effects can be harnessed in a
   mode-selective manner to perform simultaneous multi-channel (two) and
   multi-functional optical signal processing (i.e., regenerative
   wavelength conversion) in an integrated silicon photonic device. This
   approach, which can be scaled to a higher number of channels, opens up a
   new degree of freedom for performing a broad range of multi-channel
   nonlinear optical signal processing functions using a single integrated
   photonic device. (C) 2016 Author(s). All article content, except where

Abstract = {{Mesh deformation schemes play an important role in numerical aerodynamic
   optimization. As the aerodynamic shape changes, the computational mesh
   must adapt to conform to the deformed geometry. This work presents an
   extension to an existing fast and robust radial basis function mesh
   movement scheme. Using a reduced set of surface points to define the
   mesh deformation increases the efficiency of the radial basis function
   method; however, it does so at the cost of introducing errors into the
   parameterization by not recovering the exact displacement of all surface
   points. A secondary mesh movement is implemented, within an
   adjoint-based optimization framework, to eliminate these errors. The
   mesh sensitivity is based on a combination of both the primary and
   secondary mesh movement schemes. The proposed scheme is demonstrated
   through three cases within a three-dimensional Euler flow: 1)the
   reduction of pressure drag at constant lift on the Onera M6 wing; 2) an
   inverse pressure design on the Onera M6; and 3) a drag minimization of
   the Boeing 747 wing-body aircraft.}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3330-3343}},

Abstract = {{Deployment algorithms proposed to improve coverage in sensor networks
   often rely on the Voronoi diagram, which is obtained by using the
   position information of the sensors. It is usually assumed that all
   measurements are sufficiently accurate, while in a practical setting,
   even a small measurement error may lead to significant degradation in
   the coverage performance. This paper investigates the effect of
   measurement error on the performance of coverage control in mobile
   sensor networks. It also presents a distributed deployment strategy,
   namely the Robust Max-Area strategy, which uses information on error
   bounds in order to move the sensors to appropriate locations. To this
   end, two polygons are obtained for each sensor, and it is shown that the
   exact Voronoi polygon (associated with accurate measurements) lies
   between them. A local spatial probability function is then derived for
   each sensor, which translates the available information about the error
   bound into the likelihood of the points being inside the exact Voronoi
   polygon. Subsequently, the deployment strategy positions each sensor
   such that the total covered area increases. The sensors' movements are
   shown to be convergent under the proposed strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a mobile sensor network that is used to monitor a moving target
   in a field with obstacles. In this paper, an efficient relocation
   technique that simultaneously maximizes the network lifetime is
   proposed. The main sources of energy consumption in the network are
   sensing, communication, and movement of the sensors. To account for this
   energy consumption, a graph is constructed with edges that are weighted
   based on the remaining energy of each sensor. This graph is subsequently
   employed to address the lifetime maximization problem by solving a
   sequence of shortest path problems. The proposed technique determines a
   near-optimal relocation strategy for the sensors as well as an
   energy-efficient route to transfer information from the target to
   destination. This near-optimal solution is calculated in every time
   instant using the information obtained through the previous time step.
   It is shown that by choosing appropriate parameters, sensors' locations
   and the communication route from target to destination can be
   arbitrarily close to their corresponding optimal choices at each time
   instant. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is anticipated to influence the reliability of overhead
   transmission and distribution lines through impacts on extreme weather
   events. Changes in the frequency and intensity of wind and ice storms
   may have a considerable effect on applied loads and can consequently
   affect the probability of structural failure of different components of
   the line. This study examines the reliability of transmission lines
   under a range of assumed changes in the mean and standard deviation of
   climatic variables affecting transmission lines such as annual extreme
   wind speed and ice thickness. The methodology used for the reliability
   analysis of transmission lines under current and future climatic
   conditions is based on the concepts of statistical learning theory. The
   sensitivity study provides the information required to improve the
   capacity of transmission lines and mitigate long-term risks from the
   effects of a changing climate. The results indicate that climate change
   as predicted by many researchers can significantly affect the
   reliability of existing transmission line systems. Hence, relying on the
   historic climatic data may not be sufficient to ensure an adequate
   reliability of transmission line systems in the future. The
   specification of design loads for the evaluation of existing lines or
   the design of new lines should consider both future climate models and
   historical climate data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shepperd et al. find that the reported performance of a defect
   prediction model shares a strong relationship with the group of
   researchers who construct the models. In this paper, we perform an
   alternative investigation of Shepperd et al.'s data. We observe that (a)
   research group shares a strong association with other explanatory
   variables (i.e., the dataset and metric families that are used to build
   a model); (b) the strong association among these explanatory variables
   makes it difficult to discern the impact of the research group on model
   performance; and (c) after mitigating the impact of this strong
   association, we find that the research group has a smaller impact than
   the metric family. These observations lead us to conclude that the
   relationship between the research group and the performance of a defect
   prediction model are more likely due to the tendency of researchers to
   reuse experimental components (e.g., datasets and metrics). We recommend
   that researchers experiment with a broader selection of datasets and
   metrics to combat any potential bias in their results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic procedure that can be used to create
   operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) for closed-loop operation
   using multiple low-gain stages to realize extremely high DC gain. Such
   devices are necessary to realize analog functions with demanding
   absolute accuracy requirements, e.g., high-resolution ADCs and DACs. The
   principle is based on the cascade of undamped integrators to realize
   large DC gains and a state-space derived controller to stabilize its
   operation in a closed-loop configuration. A programmable OTA fabricated
   in the IBM 130 nm CMOS process is used as a test vehicle to prove the
   design principle through its 2 to 5th-order realization. Measured data
   reveals DC gains ranging from 50 to 150 dB with a 3-dB bandwidth of 10
   kHz and a unity gain frequency of 10 MHz. While this paper demonstrates
   the design principles using CMOS integrated circuits, the principle is
   general and can be applied to any type of circuit technology in
   integrated or discrete implementation. Moreover, the methods are easily
   automated as the principles are based on closed-form formulae as opposed
   to iterative numerical search techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly stream-flow forecasting can yield important information for

   feedforward neural network (SLFNs) which randomly selects the input
   weights, hidden layer biases and analytically determines the output
   weights of the SLFNs. Based on the partial autocorrelation functions of
   historical stream-flow data, a set of five input combinations with
   lagged stream-flow values are employed to establish the best forecasting
   model. A comparative investigation is conducted to evaluate the
   performance of the ELM compared to other data-driven models: support
   vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network
   (GRNN). The forecasting metrics defined as the correlation coefficient
   (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-Ns), Willmott's Index (WI),
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) computed
   between the observed and forecasted stream-flow data are employed to
   assess the ELM model's effectiveness. The results revealed that the ELM
   model outperformed the SVR and the GRNN models across a number of
   statistical measures. In quantitative terms, superiority of ELM over SVR
   and GRNN models was exhibited by E-Ns = 0.578, 0.378 and 0.144, r =
   0.799, 0.761 and 0.468 and WI = 0.853, 0.802 and 0.689, respectively and
   the ELM model attained lower RMSE value by approximately 21.3\%
   (relative to SVR) and by approximately 44.7\% (relative to GRNN). Based
   on the findings of this study, several recommendations were suggested
   for further exploration of the ELM model in hydrological forecasting
   problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The application of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and
   steel fibers in prestressed concrete railway sleepers was investigated
   in this study. The use of GGBFS was considered as an eco-friendly
   material aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption as well
   as to enhance the durability performance of railway sleepers. Steel
   fibers improves the durability and structural performance in terms of
   crack control and reduction of spalling and can replace shear
   reinforcement. The mix proportions of the concrete incorporating GGBFS
   (56\% GGBFS) and GGBFS with steel fibers (56\% GGBFS and 0.75\% steel
   fibers) were determined through a series laboratory tests and a life
   cycle assessment. These mixes satisfied the requirements of the Korean
   Railway Standard and resulted in improved flexural capacity as well as
   less CO2 emissions compared with current railway sleepers. Using these
   mixes, a total of ninety prestressed concrete sleepers were produced in
   a factory under the same manufacturing process as current railway
   sleepers, and their mechanical properties as well as durability
   performance were evaluated. The mix with partial replacement of Type III
   Portland cement by GGBFS showed an improved resistance to chloride ion
   penetration and freeze-thaw cycles compared with the concrete used for
   current railway sleepers. However, these mixes were more vulnerable to
   carbonation. The mix with GGBFS and steel fibers (mix BSF) showed a
   slightly better durability performance than the mix with GGBFS only (mix
   BS), including better carbonation and freeze-thaw resistances. The mix
   BSF showed decreased chloride ion penetration depth than mix BS but
   showed a slightly higher chloride ion diffusion coefficient. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Dynamic analysis and trajectory tracking of a Tethered Space Robot (TSR)
   is investigated in this paper. A hybrid controller is used to perform
   the control task. It consists of two components, the first one deals
   with librational motion of the tether, while the second one takes care
   of the manipulator motion. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
   approach is used to control the tether libration; for this purpose, the
   libration is described by a single degree of freedom and the tether
   length rate is employed as the input to suppress the librational motion.
   A modified Computed Torque Method (CTM) is used to control the
   manipulator motion. The dynamic interaction between the manipulator
   motion and the librational motion is considered both in the system
   dynamics and control of the system. Using numerical simulations,
   performance of the proposed control system is evaluated for end-effector
   positioning as well as for trajectory tracking for two cases: a Low
   Earth Orbit (LEO) and the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). (C) 2016 IAA.

   soil aggregates are regulated by bacterial accessibility to different
   pore sizes. We evaluated the accessibility of the nonmotile
   hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium Dietzia mans (d = 1 pm in the stationary
   phase) to 0.4 mu m pores. A significant fraction (22\%) of the pore
   volume of the clayey soil from which the bacterium was isolated was
   associated with 0.4-1 mu m diameter pores. The entry of bacteria into
   the pores was observed by electron microscopy and by monitoring
   mineralization of {[}C-14]hexadecane placed well above membranes with
   fixed pore sizes (0.4 or 3 mu m), in a bioreactor. The membranes were
   used as a surrogate for soil pores of fixed diameters. When membranes
   were not wetted or were wetted with nonbiodegradable heptamethylnonane,
   bacteria did not penetrate pores even if they attached to the membrane.
   However, bacteria penetrated pores when membranes were wetted with
   hexadecane, as growth on hexadecane yielded a crowd of smaller
   rod-shaped cells (d(min) = 0.54 +/- 0.14 mu m) in biofilms formed on the
   membrane. A morphological progression with time from smaller, elongated
   cells in the early growth phase to cocci-shaped cells was observed. The
   results suggest proliferation accompanied by morphological changes as a
   mechanism of bacterial migration in submicrometer pores and
   low-permeability media.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing (AM), sometimes called three-dimensional (3D)
   printing, has attracted a lot of research interest and is presenting
   unprecedented opportunities in biomedical fields, because this
   technology enables the fabrication of biomedical constructs with great
   freedom and in high precision. An important strategy in AM of biomedical
   constructs is to mimic the structural organizations of natural
   biological organisms. This can be done by directly depositing cells and
   biomaterials, depositing biomaterial structures before seeding cells, or
   fabricating molds before casting biomaterials and cells. This review
   organizes the research advances of AM-based biomimetic biomedical
   constructs into three major directions: 3D constructs that mimic tubular
   and branched networks of vasculatures; 3D constructs that contains
   gradient interfaces between different tissues; and 3D constructs that
   have different cells positioned to create multicellular systems. Other
   recent advances are also highlighted, regarding the applications of AM
   for organs-on-chips, AM-based micro/nanostructures, and functional
   nanomaterials. Under this theme, multiple aspects of AM including
   imaging/characterization, material selection, design, and printing
   techniques are discussed. The outlook at the end of this review points
   out several possible research directions for the future.}},

Title = {{Investigation on the Regional Loss Factor and Its Anisotropy for Aortic
   Aneurysms}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An aortic aneurysm is a lethal arterial disease that mainly occurs in
   the thoracic and abdominal regions of the aorta. Thoracic aortic
   aneurysms are prevalent in the root/ascending parts of the aorta and can
   lead to aortic rupture resulting in the sudden death of patients.
   Understanding the biomechanical and histopathological changes associated
   with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (ATAAs), this study
   investigates the mechanical properties of the aorta during strip-biaxial
   tensile cycles. The loss factor-defined as the ratio of dissipated
   energy to the energy absorbed during a tensile cycle-the incremental
   modulus, and their anisotropy indexes were compared with the media fiber
   compositions for aneurysmal (n = 26) and control (n = 4) human ascending
   aortas. The aneurysmal aortas were categorized into the aortas with
   bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) and tricuspid aortic valves (TAV). The
   strip-biaxial loss factor correlates well with the diameter of the
   aortas with BAV and TAV (for the axial direction, respectively, R-2 =
   0.71, p = 0.0022 and R-2 = 0.54, p = 0.0096). The loss factor increases
   significantly with patients' age in the BAV group (for the axial
   direction: R-2 = 0.45, p = 0.0164). The loss factor is isotropic for all
   TAV quadrants, whereas it is on average only isotropic in the anterior
   and outer curvature regions of the BAV group. The results suggest that
   loss factor may be a useful surrogate measure to describe the
   histopathology of aneurysmal tissue and to demonstrate the differences
   between ATAAs with the BAV and TAV.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen-depleted hypoxic regions in the tumour are generally resistant to
   therapies(1). Although nanocarriers have been used to deliver drugs, the
   targeting ratios have been very low. Here, we show that the
   magneto-aerotactic migration behaviour(2) of magnetotactic bacteria(3),
   Magnetococcus marinus strain MC-1 (ref. 4), can be used to transport
   drug-loaded nanoliposomes into hypoxic regions of the tumour. In their
   natural environment, MC-1 cells, each containing a chain of magnetic
   iron-oxide nanocrystals(5), tend to swim along local magnetic field
   lines and towards low oxygen concentrations(6) based on a two-state
   aerotactic sensing system(2). We show that when MC-1 cells bearing
   covalently bound drug-containing nanoliposomes were injected near the
   tumour in severe combined immunodeficient beige mice and magnetically
   guided, up to 55\% of MC-1 cells penetrated into hypoxic regions of
   HCT116 colorectal xenografts. Approximately 70 drug-loaded nanoliposomes
   were attached to each MC-1 cell. Our results suggest that harnessing
   swarms of microorganisms exhibiting magneto-aerotactic behaviour can
   significantly improve the therapeutic index of various nanocarriers in
   tumour hypoxic regions.}},

   resistance has left its adoption stagnant in developing countries.
   Optimizing the successful adoption of mechanized processes in these

   some possible causes of perceived societal resistance to mechanized
   farming in light of the limited progress in the mechanisation of one of
   Africa's leading crops, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). Potential
   approaches to improving the development and adoption of mechanisation

   coefficients and sensitivity indices}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{193-204}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The crop-water production function quantitatively evaluates the
   relationship between seasonal water use and crop yield and is used to
   evaluate optimal irrigation depth and assess the potential of deficit
   and supplemental irrigation. A simple and easily applicable methodology
   to develop crop-and region-specific crop-water production functions
   using crop coefficients and sensitivity-indices is presented. Previous
   efforts to describe the crop-water production function have not
   accounted for the effects of the temporal distribution of water use and
   trivialize the associated variability in yields by assuming an optimized
   or arbitrary temporal distribution. The temporal distribution of water
   use throughout the growing season can significantly influence crop
   yield, and the ability of farmers to manage both the timing and amount
   of irrigation water may result in higher yields. We propose crop kites,
   a tool that explicitly acknowledges crop yield as a function of the
   temporal distribution of water use to both evaluate the complete space
   of water use and crop yield relationships, and extract from this space
   specific crop-water production functions. An example for winter wheat is
   presented using previously validated crop-specific sensitivity indices.
   Crop-water production functions are extracted from the crop kite related
   to specific irrigation schedules and temporal distributions of water
   use. Crop-water production functions associated with maximizing
   agricultural production agree with previous efforts characterizing the
   shape as a diminishing curvilinear function. Crop kites provide the
   tools for water managers and policy makers to evaluate crop-and
   region-specific agricultural production as it relates to water
   management and the associated economics, and to determine appropriate
   policies for developing and supporting the infrastructure to increase
   water productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: It is inconclusive as to whether benzodiazepines (BZDs) are
   related to cognitive deterioration in the elderly populations. Animal
   studies suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor agonists, such
   as BZDs, may prevent A beta-neurotoxicity and reduce beta-amyloid (A
   beta). However, no studies have investigated the effects of BZD use on A
   beta in humans. Methods: This cross-sectional, prospective study using
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sites in the United States
   and Canada on nondemented elderly adults between 55 and 90 years of age
   assessed cortical A beta levels by positron emission tomography
   radiotracer F-18-Florbetapir. Changes in global cognitive function and
   verbal memory performance over 2 years were assessed using scores on
   Montreal Cognitive Assessment and five domains of Rey AuditoryVerbal
   Learning Test, respectively. Results: Previous BZD users (N = 15) had
   lower cortical A beta levels in frontal (F(1, 26) = 8.82, p = 0.006),
   cingulate (F(1, 26) = 8.58, p = 0.007), parietal (F(1, 26) = 7.31, p =
   0.012), and temporal (F(1, 26) = 7.67, p = 0.010) regions compared with
   matched BZD nonusers (N = 15), after controlling for history of
   psychiatric disorders and antidepressant use. Also, no differences were
   found in global cognitive function and changes in cortical A beta over 2
   years between continuous BZD users (N = 15) and the matched nonuser
   group (N = 15). Conclusion: Previous BZD use was associated with lower
   cortical A beta levels in nondemented elderly control subjects. Future
   studies with larger samples are required to replicate our findings.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of noise maps to assess exposure to noise is often
   limited, especially in North American cities. We developed land use
   regression (LUR) models for LA(eq24h), L-night, and L-den to assess the
   long-term spatial variability of environmental noise levels in Montreal,
   Canada, considering various transportation noise sources (road, rail,
   and air). To explore the effects of sampling duration, we compared our
   LA(eq24h) levels that were computed over at least five complete
   contiguous days of measurements to shorter sampling periods (20 min and
   24 h). LUR models were built with General Additive Models using
   continuous 2-min noise measurements from 204 sites. Model performance
   (adjusted R-2) was 0.68, 0.59, and 0.69 for LA(eq24h), L-night, and
   L-den, respectively. Main predictors of measured noise levels were
   road-traffic and vegetation variables. Twenty-minute non-rush hour
   measurements corresponded well with LA(eq24h) levels computed over 5
   days at road-traffic sites (bias:- 0.7 dB(A)), but not at rail (-2.1
   dB(A)) nor at air (-2.2 dB(A)) sites. Our study provides important
   insights into the spatial variation of environmental noise levels in a
   Canadian city. To assess long-term noise levels, sampling strategies
   should be stratified by noise sources and preferably should include 1
   week of measurements at locations exposed to rail and aircraft noise.}},

Abstract = {{Hot forging of steel requires application of large strains, under which
   conditions, dynamic recrystallization (DRX) is expected to take place.
   In this study, torsion tests were carried out on a medium carbon
   vanadium microalloyed steel (38MnSiVS5) to simulate hot forging.
   Deformations were applied isothermally in the temperature range 900-1200
   A degrees C at strain rates of 0.1-10 s(-1) in order to observe for the
   occurrence of DRX and to investigate for the microstructural evolution
   during straining. The shape of the flow curves indicated that the
   recrystallization takes place during deformation. This was supported by
   optical microscopy performed on the quenched samples which displayed
   considerable amounts of recrystallized grains. It was shown that the
   grain size depends on straining conditions such as strain rate and
   temperature. Finally, it was revealed that these process parameters can
   considerably affect the evolution of microstructure of industrial grade
   steels by means of DRX.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges for deploying sustainable sanitation
   technologies and services around the world is financing. The present
   study applied both qualitative (key informant interviews) and
   quantitative (household survey) methods to explore sources of
   alternative financing in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, towards deploying
   sustainable sanitation technologies and services. Microfinance
   organizations, government subsidies and mining industries may represent
   potential sources of financing for the implementation of sustainable
   sanitation technologies and services in Mongolia. Moreover, building
   social capital among Ger residents and reinventing the idea of corporate
   WASH responsibility' could constitute new directions for the future.}},

Title = {{Back analysis of fault-slip in burst prone environment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},

Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{159-171}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In deep underground mines, stress re-distribution induced by mining
   activities could cause fault-slip. Seismic waves arising from fault-slip
   occasionally induce rock ejection when hitting the boundary of mine
   openings, and as a result, severe damage could be inflicted. In general,
   it is difficult to estimate fault-slip-induced ground motion in the
   vicinity of mine openings because of the complexity of the dynamic
   response of faults and the presence of geological structures. In this
   paper, a case study is conducted for a Canadian underground mine, herein
   called ``Mine-A{''}, which is known for its seismic activities. Using a
   microseismic database collected from the mine, a back analysis of
   fault-slip is carried out with mine-wide 3-dimensional numerical
   modeling. A back analysis is conducted to estimate the physical and
   mechanical properties of the causative fracture or shear zones. One
   large seismic event has been selected for the back analysis to detect a
   fault-slip related seismic event. In the back analysis, the shear zone
   properties are estimated with respect to moment magnitude of the seismic
   event and peak particle velocity (PPV) recorded by a strong ground
   motion sensor. The estimated properties are then validated through
   comparison with peak ground acceleration recorded by accelerometers.
   Lastly, ground motion in active mining areas is estimated by conducting
   dynamic analysis with the estimated values. The present study implies
   that it would be possible to estimate the magnitude of seismic events
   that might occur in the near future by applying the estimated properties
   to the numerical model. Although the case study is conducted for a
   specific mine, the developed methodology can be equally applied to other
   mines suffering from fault-slip related seismic events. (C) 2016

Title = {{Carbonation Curing of Precast Fly Ash Concrete}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The feasibility of carbonation curing of precast fly ash concrete is
   studied. If fly ash concrete can be produced by carbonation curing, the
   carbon footprint of the products can be significantly reduced. In this
   paper, the relationship between carbonation reaction and pozzolanic
   reaction was examined. After carbonation curing with different duration
   and fly ash content, the cement reaction degree was estimated through
   the equivalent nonevaporable water content, and the fly ash reaction
   degree was analyzed through a selective acid dissolution test. It was
   found that the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash in a fly ash-ordinary
   portland cement (OPC) system was hindered by early carbonation reaction.
   The higher the early carbonation degree, the lower the pozzolanic
   reaction of fly ash. In addition, fly ash-OPC paste was more reactive
   with carbon dioxide than plain cement paste. Therefore, controlled
   carbonation at an early age is necessary to trade off the carbon
   emission reduction with performance gain. The study shows that if fly
   ash content is limited to 20\% of cementitious material and carbonation
   curing duration is not to exceed 12h, fly ash concrete can be produced
   with higher early strength, comparable late strength, better durability
   performance, and a carbon emission reduction of 36\%. After subsequent
   hydration, carbonated fly ash concrete can have a pH value comparable
   with the hydration reference and can be used in precast concretes with
   steel reinforcement. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the complex features of blasting vibration damage assessment
   systems, a gradient boosted machine (GBM) model is developed for the
   classification of residential structure damage (RSD) due to blasting
   vibrations of open pit mining. Twelve indicators are defined as the
   indices for the prediction of RSD in the proposed model. These are: peak
   particle velocity, dominant frequency, dominant frequency duration,
   distance, maximum safe charge per delay, compressive strength of mortar
   joints, ratio of brick area to house area, height of residential house,
   roof structures, beam-column frames, quality of construction, and site
   conditions. The GBM model is achieved by training 108 sets of measured
   data of blasting vibration. A 10-fold cross-validation procedure was
   applied to determine the optimal parameter values during modeling, and
   an external testing set was employed to validate the prediction
   performance of the model. Two performance measures - classification
   accuracy rate and Cohen's kappa - have been employed. The analysis of
   accuracy together with kappa for the dataset demonstrate that the GBM
   model has high credibility as it achieves a comparable median
   classification accuracy rate and Cohen's kappa values of 91.7\% and
   0.875 for the prediction of RSD, respectively.}},

   in small heat-recirculating tubes}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{173}},
Pages = {{27-38}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of external heat loss on the slow
   propagation of strongly-burning flames inside narrow heat-recirculating
   tubes. The system is studied using a two-dimensional numerical model for
   reactive flow, including conjugate heat transfer, over a range of tube
   diameters spanning the micro- and the meso-scale. Increasing external
   heat loss decreases the propagation speed of the slowly propagating
   flames, leading to a transition from upstream to downstream propagation,
   until a heat loss limit is reached. Flames in micro-scale tubes are
   subjected to an extinction limit, while flames in larger diameter tubes,
   in the meso-scale range, are subjected to a blowout limit. While the
   absolute value of the external convective heat loss coefficient at the
   extinction/blowout limit increases with diameter, the dimensionless
   volumetric heat loss coefficient decreases with an increase in diameter
   until an approximately constant value, for the studied conditions, is
   reached at the blowout limit in the mesoscale range. Discrepancies in
   the predicted trends of 1-D and 2-D models indicate that 2-D effects
   play a significant role at larger diameters, not only at the meso-scale,
   but also in the upper-range of the micro-scale. These 2-D effects,
   associated with changes in flame shape that allow an increase in burning
   surface area, are seen to promote stability of the system. Results have
   implications on the choice of tube diameter to be used in the design of
   a stable burner optimized for heat transfer to an external heat load.

Title = {{Gas holdup estimation using Maxwell equation in flotation systems:
   Revisited}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{9-13}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Estimation of gas holdup from electrical conductivity measurements has
   been used in lab and industrial installations. The approach is based on
   the application of Maxwell's model, which relates the concentration of a
   dispersed phase in a continuous medium to measurements of the electrical
   conductivity of the dispersed phase, continuous medium and the resulting
   mixture (dispersion). When applied to inferring the collection zone gas
   holdup in a three phase system and to facilitate real-time on-line
   measurement, the slurry is assumed to behave as the continuous medium
   and gas bubbles as a non-conducting dispersed phase. This article
   derives an equation for estimating gas holdup in a three phase system,
   eliminating the assumption that the slurry behaves as a continuous
   medium but rather as a dispersion of non-conducting solid particles in
   water. In this formulation only water behaves as the continuous medium
   in the sense of Maxwell, and gas holdup in a three phase system is then
   calculated from the application of the Maxwell model twice: (1) to
   determine solid content in a two-phase system, and (2) to determine
   solid plus gas holdup in a three phase system. To validate the new
   equation and quantify the errors incurred by assuming slurry is the
   continuous phase a laboratory flotation cell was instrumented to
   continuously measure the conductivity of two and three phase dispersions
   with known solids contents. As the amount of gas in a lab flotation
   machine is difficult to measure directly or by another indirect
   technique such as using pressure signals, 2.5 mm dielectric plastic
   spheres having a density of ca. 1.3 g/cm(3) were used instead of air
   bubbles for validation. Experimental results demonstrated that the
   continuous medium assumption underestimates gas holdup and that the
   resulting bias error increases linearly with the solid content and
   decreases with the magnitude of gas holdup. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An industrial size vertical Direct Chill (DC) caster fitted with a
   porous filter above the mold is simulated by developing control volume
   finite difference based computational fluid dynamics code. Specifically,
   the 3-D laminar/turbulent melt flow in the sump and mushy zone
   solidification characteristics in the DC caster are modeled for
   aluminium alloy AA-1050. To account for the turbulence in the sump a
   popular version of the low Reynolds number kappa-omega model is
   employed. A single domain enthalpy-porosity approach is used to account
   for the solidification heat transfer of the above short solidification
   range alloy. The melt flows through the stainless steel porous filter
   placed near the top of the caster is modeled using the
   Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy equation and by invoking the local
   thermal equilibrium condition between the melt and the porous structure.
   The verified code is used to study the effects of casting speed and heat
   transfer coefficient in the metal-mold contact region on various aspects
   of this casting problem. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out by
   varying the latent heat of solidification of the said alloy. The
   predicted results are presented and discussed for the solid-shell
   thickness, the sump depth, the mushy layer thickness as well as for the
   temperature and velocity fields. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to improve hydrocolloid stability and siRNA
   transfection ability of a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based
   nano-carrier using a phospholipid-based amphiphilic polymer (PL-PEG) and
   cell penetrating peptide (CPPs). The dual functionalized nano-carrier is
   comprehensively characterized for its chemical structure, size, surface
   charge and morphology as well as thermal stability. The nano-carrier
   cytocompatibility, siRNA condensation ability both in the presence and
   absence of enzyme, endosomal buffering capacity, cellular uptake and
   intracellular localization are also assessed. The siRNA loaded
   nano-carrier is used for internalization to MCF-7 cells and its gene
   silencing ability is compared with AllStars Hs Cell Death siRNA as a
   model gene. The nano-carrier remains stable in biological solution,
   exhibits excellent cytocompatibility, retards the siRNA migration and
   protects it against enzyme degradation. The buffering capacity analysis
   shows that incorporation of the peptide in nano-carrier structure would
   increase the resistance to endo/lysosomal like acidic condition (pH 6-4)
   The functionalized nano carrier which is loaded with siRNA in an optimal
   N:P ratio presents superior internalization efficiency (82 +/- 5.1\%
   compared to HiPerFect (R)), endosomal escape quality and capable of
   inducing cell death in MCF7 cancer cells (51 +/- 3.1\% compared to
   non-treated cells). The success of siRNA-based therapy is largely
   dependent on the safe and efficient delivery system, therefore; the dual
   functionalized rGO introduced here could have a great potential to be
   used as a carrier for siRNA delivery with relevancy in therapeutics and
   clinical applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel PAM-4 12.5 Gbaud/s inter-coupling modulator based on a

   25Gb/sPAM-4optical signal is generated by driving the modulator with two

   reverse bias. Reverse bias operation mode of the modulator enables
   achieving an electro-optic (EO) bandwidth of approximately 14 GHz
   without preemphasis of the electrical driving signals or equalization
   techniques. This configuration successfully simplifies the operation of
   the modulator in generating PAM-4 signals without the need for a
   digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Experimental results show proper
   generation of a PRBS data stream. The proposed modulator has a compact
   footprint of 0.48 mm(2) with a bandwidth density of 52.08 Gb/s/mm(2).}},

   The optimized thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams are believed

   the use of physically meaningful parameters. The present Fe-Mn spinel
   solutions can be integrated into a larger spinel solution database,

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials such as nanosilver (AgNP) can be released into the aquatic
   environment through production, usage, and disposal. Sensitive and
   cost-effective methods are needed to monitor AgNPs in the environment.
   This work is hampered by a lack of sensitive methods to detect
   nanomaterials in environmental matrixes. The present study focused on
   the development, calibration and application of a passive sampling
   technique for detecting AgNPs in aquatic matrixes. A Carbon Nanotube
   Integrative Sampler (CNIS) was developed using multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) as the sorbent for accumulating AgNPs and other Ag
   species from water. Sampling rates were determined in the laboratory for
   different sampler configurations and in different aquatic matrixes. The
   sampler was field tested at the Experimental Lakes Area, Canada, in lake
   water dosed with AgNPs. For a configuration of the CNIS consisting of
   CNTs bound to carbon fiber (i.e. CNT veil) placed in Chemcatcher (R)
   housing, the time weighted average (TWA) concentrations of silver
   estimated from deployments of the sampler in lake mesocosms dosed with
   AgNPs were similar to the measured concentrations of ``colloidal
   silver{''} (i.e. <0.22 mu min size) in the water column. For a
   configuration of CNIS consisting of CNTs in loose powder form placed in
   a custom made housing that were deployed in a whole lake dosed with
   AgNPs, the estimated TWA concentrations of ``CNIS-labile Ag{''} were
   similar to the concentrations of total silver measured in the epilimnion
   of the lake. However, sampling rates for the CNIS in various matrixes
   are relatively low (i.e. 1-20 mL/day), so deployment periods of several
   weeks are required to detect AgNPs at environmentally relevant
   concentrations, which can allow biofilms to develop on the sampler and
   could affect the sampling rates. With further development, this novel
   sampler may provide a simple and sensitive method for screening for the
   presence of AgNPs in surface waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Substrate effect of coke particles on the structure and reactivity of
   coke/pitch mixtures in carbon anodes}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{123-131}},

Abstract = {{Carbon anodes, used in the Hall-Heroult electrolysis process, are
   subject to an overconsumption caused by CO2 attack. Several attempts
   have been made to understand the mechanism of CO2 gasification based on
   the study of the reactivity of anode cores or anode constituents (coke,
   pitch and binder matrix). In this study, the specific surface area and
   the pore volume of carbon anode and of three coke/pitch mixtures were
   measured to understand properly the CO2 reactivity. Anode sample and
   three recipes of coke/pitch mixtures (100/0; 95/5 and 85/15, w/w) with a
   particle size of -1.4 + 1.0 mm were prepared. Argon adsorption and
   mercury infiltration were used to characterize the pore size
   distribution of the four samples. The specific surface area of anode and
   partially covered coke materials (95/5) were superior to that of the
   uncovered and totally covered particles (12 m(2)/g vs. 0.5 m(2)/g).
   Although the pore volume of the uncovered coke was high (0.45 cm(3)/g),
   the pore volume of totally covered coke was low (0.35 cm(3)/g). The pore
   volume of anode and partially covered coke were similar (0.4 cm(3)/g). A
   TG instrument was used to determine the apparent reaction rates of the
   four samples at 960 degrees C under CO2 atmosphere. It was remarked that
   the apparent reaction rate of coke/pitch mixtures was reduced with
   increasing the pitch content. The anode had an apparent reaction rate
   above that of totally covered particles but below the partially covered
   particles. Based on the apparent reaction rate and the pore analysis,
   the structure of an anode can be considered as a mixture of coke
   particles with different levels of pitch penetration. The pitch
   distribution in an anode paste could prevent the preferential
   gasification of some particles, thus possibly reducing dusting
   phenomenon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A source-synchronous interconnect using mode-division multiplexing (MDM)
   for potential use in on-chip applications is experimentally demonstrated
   using a 3-mode 750 mu m Silicon photonics structure. Results are
   presented for simultaneous transmission of two data channels on two
   separate modes (bit error rate < 10(-12) at 10 Gb/s) sampled by an
   optically forwarded clock sent on a third separate mode. Performance
   assessment of the mode assignment for the clock is presented. The
   investigation shows that an optimum clock placement is important at
   wavelengths where modal crosstalk is higher. For example, at 1553 nm,
   the clock's jitter decreases from 45 ps down to 2.7 ps where the clock
   is encoded on a mode with high crosstalk (-18.6 dB) to one that has less
   crosstalk (-28.6 dB). At 1560 nm where modal crosstalk is better, the
   clock's jitter is 2.6 ps (-27.8 dB crosstalk) and 1.1 ps (-34 dB
   crosstalk) without and with optimum clock placement, respectively. With
   proper clock to mode assignment, the optical interconnect becomes
   functional across an optical bandwidth of 11 nm enabling
   MDM-wavelength-division multiplexing architectures.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Calcium silicate based cementitious materials are well known by its
   reactivity with carbon dioxide to produce high early strength through
   carbonation curing. Since the early strength gain is due to the reaction
   between calcium silicates and carbon dioxide, carbonation cement can be
   formulated with calcium silicates of any polymorph with reduced
   synthesizing temperature. Its early strength is expected from
   carbonation activation and late strength by hydration reaction. Such a
   cement can be made exclusively with industry wastes at low temperature.
   This paper is to examine the feasibility of synthesizing carbonation
   cement for carbonation process from two industry wastes: ladle slag
   fines for calcium and waste glass for silica. A synthesis process
   involving burning the mixture of ladle slag and waste glass was
   developed to produce low energy carbonation cement capable of gaining
   strength when activated by carbonation. The glass to slag ratio and
   clinkering temperature were determined based on carbonation and
   hydration strength of the binder. Performance was assessed by
   compressive strength tests, X-ray fluorescence analysis, X-ray
   diffraction analysis, and thermogravimetry analysis. The results
   suggested that supplementing the ladle slag with additions of waste
   glass had promoted the conversion of calcium to more value-added calcium
   silicate phases which could be activated by carbon dioxide to produce
   early strength. The carbonation cement so produced consumes no natural
   resources and has shown the potential for carbon sequestration.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{The Stiffness Damage Test (SDT) is an interesting tool for assessing
   damage in concrete affected by ASR. The use of a fixed loading level for
   stiffness damage testing, as previously suggested in the literature,
   limits its ability to reliably appraise the distress level of concrete
   samples, especially when different concrete strengths and aggregate
   types are used. Moreover, the test input and output parameters should be
   properly interpreted so that the SDT becomes a powerful diagnostic
   procedure. This paper presents an evaluation of the practical use of the
   SDT in engineering purposes. Results show that the use of output
   indices, i.e. SDI and PDI, instead of absolute output values, makes the
   procedure more diagnostic (i.e. not equal distress degrees can be easier
   distinguished) and less influenced by practical assumptions (e.g. choice
   of the loading level for stiffness damage testing). Based on the prior
   results, a step-by-step standard test procedure is proposed aiming to
   minimize the test variability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The nonlinear vibrations of a water-filled circular cylindrical shell
   subjected to radial harmonic excitation in the spectral neighbourhood of
   the lowest resonances are investigated experimentally and numerically by
   using a seamless aluminium sample. The experimental boundary conditions
   are close to simply supported edges. The presence of exact one-to-one
   internal resonance, giving rise to a travelling wave response around the
   shell circumference and non-stationary vibrations, is experimentally
   observed and the nonlinear response is numerically reproduced. The
   travelling wave is measured by means of state-of-the-art laser Doppler
   vibrometers applied to multiple points on the structure simultaneously.
   Chaos is detected in the frequency region where the travelling wave
   response is present. The reduced-order model is based on the Novozhilov
   nonlinear shell theory retaining in-plane inertia and the nonlinear
   equations of motion are numerically studied (i) by using a code based on
   arclength continuation method that allows bifurcation analysis in case
   of stationary vibrations, (ii) by a continuation code based on direct
   integration and Poincare maps that evaluates also the maximum Lyapunov
   exponent in case of non-stationary vibrations. The comparison of
   experimental and numerical results is particularly satisfactory. (C)

Abstract = {{Li2FeSiO4 (LFS) has drawn much attention as cathode for high capacity
   Li-ion batteries. Even though significant volume of study has been
   devoted to its crystal chemistry and electrochemistry, many questions
   relating to its Li-ion storage dynamics remain yet to be fully
   elucidated. In this context, synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and
   absorption spectroscopies are employed to characterize the phase
   stability and charge compensation mechanism in a metastable Li2FeSiO4
   nanostructured cathode as a function of state-of-charge (Li2-xFeSiO4, x
   = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0) and cycling at very low current. The results
   demonstrate (i) no detectable phase transition from monoclinic to
   orthorhombic phase during the first charge-discharge cycle but rather
   formation of antisite defects that progressively induce phase
   transformation after several electrochemical cycles; (ii)
   characteristics of solid solution Li-ion storage (Li2-xFeSiO4, x = 0-1);
   and (iii) the charge compensation for the first Li extraction does not
   come solely from the ferrous to ferric conversion, but interestingly
   from prominent participation of lattice oxygen as well that appears to
   destabilize the cycled LFS structure with significant performance
   implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate direct detection of single polarization and dual
   polarization PAM4 signals delivering 168 and 336 Gb/s below the KP4 FEC
   threshold of 2.2x10(-4). The 84 Gbaud 2 bits and 4 bits per symbol
   transceivers operate at a bit error rate (BER) that is compliant to the
   RS(544, 514) FEC encoding for error-free operation, as considered for
   next generation PAM4 400GBase Ethernet standard targeting data center
   applications. For the DP-PAM4 format, we show that the BER is
   independent of the state of polarization of the optical signal. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a
   single carrier delivering 336 Gb/s in direct detection at a BER
   compliant to the physical coding sublayer of 400GBASE interfaces.
   Finally, using an intensity modulator in series with a phase modulator,
   we demonstrate chromatic dispersion pre-compensation of 84 Gbaud PAM4
   signals, producing a 40-fold BER improvement after 10 km of single-mode
   fiber.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance natural materials such as bone, teeth or mollusk shells
   contain a large volume fraction of minerals to generate stiffness and
   hardness. They are also packed with weak interfaces, which generate
   nonlinear deformations and channel cracks into powerful toughening
   configurations. As a result, these natural materials achieve
   simultaneous stiffness, hardness and toughness, which are properties
   which are mutually exclusive in engineering materials. Following these
   concepts, we have engraved trenches with controlled patterns and depth
   in thin plates of aluminum oxide. The trenches can guide propagating
   cracks, which we use to implement toughening mechanisms and unusual
   deformation mechanisms. We present fracture results on samples with
   transverse interfaces and sinusoidal interfaces. We also explore
   interlocking-jigsaw like interfaces, which dissipate the most energy and
   produce the highest toughness. These interfaces also profoundly change
   the way the material deform in tension, by introducing controlled
   non-linear deformations accompanied with geometric hardening and
   frictional pullout, in an otherwise all-brittle material. (C) 2016

   coupling that gives rise to TED. The finite difference method is used to
   solve the nonlinear governing equation and estimate nonlinear TED in

   intercalation in multilayer (ML-) graphene oxide (GO) through in situ
   monitoring of probe molecule delivery via Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), focusing on the probe molecules ability to displace
   the naturally intercalated species in ML-GO. By monitoring changes
   occurring in the FTIR spectra in real time, we show that small molecules
   with the ability to form hydrogen bonds are strongly retained in ML-GO.
   These molecules can easily replace the intercalated CO2, while molecules
   incapable of hydrogen bonding are unable to do so, even if their size
   should allow them to intercalate between the ML-GO layers. These results
   provide direct evidence of the importance of hydrogen bonding, molecule
   size, and functional group orientation on the intercalation process and
   introduce in situ FTIR spectroscopy with probe molecules as a valuable
   technique to characterize ML-GO.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents applications of the modified 3D-SAM approach, a
   three-dimensional seismic assessment methodology for buildings directly
   based on in situ experimental modal tests to calculate global seismic
   demands and the dynamic amplification portion of natural torsion.
   Considering that the building modal properties change from weak to
   strong motion levels, appropriate modification factors are proposed to
   extend the application of the method to stronger earthquakes. The
   proposed approach is consistent with the performance-based seismic
   assessment approach, which entails the prediction of seismic
   displacements and drift ratios that are related to the damage condition
   and therefore the functionality of the building. The modified 3D-SAM is
   especially practical for structures that are expected to experience
   slight to moderate damage levels and in particular for post-disaster
   buildings that are expected to remain functional after an earthquake. In
   the last section of this paper, 16 low to mid-rise irregular buildings
   located in Montreal, Canada, and that have been tested under ambient
   vibrations are analyzed with the method, and the dynamic amplification
   portion of natural torsion of the dataset is reported and discussed. The
   proposed methodology is appropriate for large-scale assessments of
   existing buildings and is applicable to any seismic region of the world.

Abstract = {{This paper uses Biot's poroelasticity approach to examine the
   consolidation behaviour of a rigid foundation with a frictionless base
   in contact with a poroelastic halfspace. The mathematical development of
   the mixed boundary value problem involves a set of dual integral
   equations in the Laplace transform domain which cannot be conveniently
   solved by employing conventional procedures. In this paper, a numerical
   solution is developed using a scheme where the contact normal stress is
   approximated by a discretized equivalent. The influence of limiting
   drainage boundary conditions at the entire surface of the halfspace on
   the degree of consolidation of the rigid circular foundation is
   investigated. The results obtained in this study are compared with the

Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Muscovite mica is an industrial mineral used in many different
   applications including coatings, construction materials and polymers.
   This mineral is commonly beneficiated using froth flotation, especially
   when treating finer particle sizes. A common flotation scheme employs a
   cationic amine collector for mica, at alkaline pH, with a depressant
   added to depress some of the common gangue minerals in muscovite
   deposits such as quartz and feldspars. This work examines the effects of
   Custamine 8113 (collector) and Norlig-H (depressant) on the flotation of
   a muscovite ore from a mineralogical perspective using QEMSCAN. In
   addition to traditional grade-recovery curves for the various mineral
   components of the ore, the QEMSCAN data are used to look at:
   size-by-size flotation recoveries, particle size differences between
   flotation concentrates and tailings, and mineral liberation and
   association. The lab-scale flotation results are then compared to
   idealized size-by-size grade-recovery curves calculated from the
   measured QEMSCAN data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Thermal Expansion}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of architected materials, as
   opposed to that of conventional solids, can be tuned to zero by
   intentionally altering the geometry of their structural layout. Existing
   material architectures, however, achieve CTE tunability only with a
   sacrifice in structural efficiency, i.e. a drop in both their stiffness
   to mass ratio and strength to mass ratio. In this work, we elucidate how
   to resolve the trade-off between CTE tunability and structural
   efficiency and present a lightweight bi-material architecture that not
   only is stiffer and stronger than other 3D architected materials, but
   also has a highly tunable CTE. Via a combination of physical experiments
   on 3D fabricated prototypes and numeric simulations, we demonstrate how
   two distinct mechanisms of thermal expansion appearing in a tetrahedron,
   can be exploited in an Octet lattice to generate a large range of CTE
   values, including negative, zero, or positive, with no loss in
   structural efficiency. The novelty and simplicity of the proposed design
   as well as the ease in fabrication, make this bi-material architecture
   well-suited for a wide range of applications, including satellite
   antennas, space optical systems, precision instruments, thermal
   actuators, and MEMS.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an atomistic model of electromigration (EM) in metals based
   on a recently developed phase-field-crystal (PFC) technique. By coupling
   the PFC model's atomic density field with an applied electric field
   through the EM effective charge parameter, EM is successfully captured
   on diffusive time scales. Our framework reproduces the well-established
   EM phenomena known as Black's equation and the Blech effect, and also
   naturally captures commonly observed phenomena such as void nucleation
   and migration in bulk crystals. A resistivity dipole field arising from
   electron scattering on void surfaces is shown to contribute
   significantly to void migration velocity. With an intrinsic time scale
   set by atomic diffusion rather than atomic oscillations or hopping
   events, as in conventional atomistic methods, our theoretical approach
   makes it possible to investigate EM-induced circuit failure at atomic
   spatial resolution and experimentally relevant time scales.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) and
   sterically stabilized nanocrystalline cellulose (SNCC) have been
   studied. SNCC is produced by periodate oxidation of cellulose fibres and
   consists of a crystalline cellulose region from which dialdehyde
   modified cellulose chains are protruding from both ends. The morphology
   of SNCC can be controlled by the degree of oxidation, which depends on
   the amount of periodate and the reaction time. In this study, three
   SNCCs with different reaction times were prepared and their interactions
   with PCC particles were examined. These SNCC particles have similar
   diameters (5-10 nm) and their length is reduced with increasing reaction
   time, whereas the length of the protruding chains is increased.
   Adsorption isotherms of three SNCCs and dialdehyde modified cellulose
   (DAMC) on PCC particles were determined. It was found that DAMC had a
   higher affinity than SNCCs, and the affinity of SNCC increased with
   reaction time. This indicates that DAMC chains adsorb stronger than the
   crystalline region of SNCC on PCC. The PCC flocculation induced by three
   SNCCs was monitored by photometric dispersion analysis, which showed
   that SNCC particles could bridge PCC to induce flocculation at low
   dosages (above 1 mg/g). SNCC induced the maximum flocculation when its
   fractional coverage is above 50\%, implying that PCC particles coated by
   SNCC continue to flocculate, as observed experimentally. Further
   addition of SNCC to PCC suspensions results in slower flocculation rates
   and smaller floc sizes. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Previous experiments have shown that fungi use an efficient natural
   algorithm for searching the space available for their growth in
   micro-confined networks, e.g., mazes. This natural ``master{''}
   algorithm, which comprises two ``slave{''} sub-algorithms, i.e.,
   collision-induced branching and directional memory, has been shown to be
   more efficient than alternatives, with one, or the other, or both
   sub-algorithms turned off. In contrast, the present contribution
   compares the performance of the fungal natural algorithm against several
   standard artificial homologues. It was found that the space-searching
   fungal algorithm consistently outperforms uninformed algorithms, such as
   Depth-First-Search (DFS). Furthermore, while the natural algorithm is
   inferior to informed ones, such as A{*}, this under-performance does not
   importantly increase with the increase of the size of the maze. These
   findings suggest that a systematic effort of harvesting the natural
   space searching algorithms used by microorganisms is warranted and
   possibly overdue. These natural algorithms, if efficient, can be

Title = {{Impact of librarians on reporting of the literature searching component

Abstract = {{Objective: A critical element in conducting a systematic review is the
   identification of studies. To date, very little empirical evidence has
   been reported on whether the presence of a librarian or information
   professional can contribute to the quality of the final product. The
   goal of this study was to compare the reporting rigor of the literature
   searching component of systematic reviews with and without the help of a
   librarian.
   Method: Systematic reviews published from 2002 to 2011 in the twenty
   highest impact factor pediatrics journals were collected from MEDLINE.
   Corresponding authors were contacted via an email survey to determine if
   a librarian was involved, the role that the librarian played, and
   functions that the librarian performed. The reviews were scored
   independently by two reviewers using a fifteen-item checklist.
   Results: There were 186 reviews that met the inclusion criteria, and
   44\% of the authors indicated the involvement of a librarian in
   conducting the systematic review. With the presence of a librarian as
   coauthor or team member, the mean checklist score was 8.40, compared to
   6.61 (p<0.001) for reviews without a librarian.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that having a librarian as a coauthor or
   team member correlates with a higher score in the literature searching
   component of systematic reviews.}},

Title = {{Effects of Lane Width, Lane Position and Edge Shoulder Width on Driving
   Behavior in Underground Urban Expressways: A Driving Simulator Study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study tested the effects of lane width, lane position and edge
   shoulder width on driving behavior for a three-lane underground urban
   expressway. A driving simulator was used with 24 volunteer test
   subjects. Five lane widths (2.85, 3.00, 3.25, 3.50, and 3.75 m) and
   three shoulder widths (0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 m) were studied. Driving
   speed, lane deviation and subjective perception of driving behavior were
   collected as performance measures. The results show that lane and
   shoulder width have significant effects on driving speed. Average
   driving speed increases from 60.01 km/h in the narrowest lane to 88.05
   km/h in the widest lane. While both narrower lanes and shoulders result
   in reduced speed and lateral lane deviation, the effect of lane width is
   greater than that of shoulder width. When the lane and shoulder are
   narrow, drivers in the left or right lane tend to shy away from the
   tunnel wall, even encroaching into the neighboring middle lane. As the
   lane or shoulder gets wider, drivers tend to stay in the middle of the
   lane. An interesting finding is that although few participants
   acknowledged that lane position had any great bearing on their driving
   behaviors, the observed driving speed is statistically higher in the
   left lane than in the other two lanes when the lane width is narrow (in
   2.85, 3 and 3.25 m lanes). These findings provided support for amending
   the current design specifications of urban underground roads, such as
   the relationship between design speed and lane width, speed limit, and
   combination form of lanes.}},

Title = {{The role of amino acids in hydroxyapatite mineralization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{123}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Polar and charged amino acids (AAs) are heavily expressed in
   noncollagenous proteins (NCPs), and are involved in hydroxyapatite (HA)
   mineralization in bone. Here, we review what is known on the effect of
   single AAs on HA precipitation. Negatively charged AAs, such as aspartic
   acid, glutamic acid (Glu) and phosphoserine are largely expressed in
   NCPs and play a critical role in controlling HA nucleation and growth.
   Positively charged ones such as arginine (Arg) or lysine (Lys) are
   heavily involved in HA nucleation within extracellular matrix proteins
   such as collagen. Glu, Arg and Lys intake can also increase bone mineral
   density by stimulating growth hormone production. In vitro studies
   suggest that the role of AAs in controlling HA precipitation is affected
   by their mobility. While dissolved AAs are able to inhibit HA
   precipitation and growth by chelating Ca2+ and PO43- ions or binding to
   nuclei of calcium phosphate and preventing their further growth, AAs
   bound to surfaces can promote HA precipitation by attracting Ca2+ and
   PO43- ions and increasing the local supersaturation. Overall, the effect
   of AAs on HA precipitation is worth being investigated more, especially
   under conditions closer to the physiological ones, where the presence of
   other factors such as collagen, mineralization inhibitors, and cells
   heavily influences HA precipitation. A deeper understanding of the role
   of AAs in HA mineralization will increase our fundamental knowledge
   related to bone formation, and could lead to new therapies to improve
   bone regeneration in damaged tissues or cure pathological diseases
   caused by excessive mineralization in tissues such as cartilage, blood
   vessels and cardiac valves.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous TiO2 rutile particles with a cauliflower-like morphology and
   an internal structure of self-assembled nanoneedles were synthesized in
   a novel Ti-IV chloride aqueous-solution hydrolysis process. In an effort
   to make nanostructured rutile synthesis cost-effective and green, the
   process was conducted at steady-state in a continuously stirred tank
   reactor (CSTR) below 100 degrees C. High TiCl4 concentration 0.5-1m
   yielded rutile, while lowering the concentration to 0.1m led to the
   crystallization of brookite nanoplatelets. Apart from phase control,
   specific surface area of rutile may be tuned via TiCl4 concentration
   regulation from 85 to 500 m(2)g(-1). Investigation revealed that low
   pH/high TiIV concentration conditions favored direct nucleation of
   rutile nuclei during steady state that grow radially outward into
   nanoneedle structured cauliflower particles with nanoscale edgy surface.
   The unique steady-state produced mesoporous rutile particles were shown
   to have excellent light scattering properties in a bi-layer photoanode
   structure resulting in 42.5\% increase in photovoltaic efficiency.
   Brookite nanoplatelets were shown, in addition to their scattering
   properties, to exhibit stable Li-ion intercalation functionality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the design and implementation of a solid-state
   high-voltage, high-frequency pulse generator used to drive capacitive
   loads and particularly, nonequilibrium plasmas at atmospheric pressure.
   The generator is capable of producing open circuit pulses of 0-12 kV
   with a 300 ns duration (full-width at half-maximum) at a repetition
   frequency of 0-25 kHz. The working principles of the generator are
   presented, along with its electrical diagnostics to illustrate its
   operation with capacitive loads. The generator was applied to a
   pin-to-plane electrode configuration to generate a diffuse
   non-equilibrium plasma discharge with peak voltage of 12 kV. Energy
   deposition and average power required to drive the discharges in open
   air at 25 kHz were calculated to be 112 mu J/pulse and 2.80 W. The
   generator was also applied to lean, stagnation-plate stabilized V-shaped
   flames to increase their blowoff velocity. A 28\%-51\% increase of the
   blowoff velocity is observed using a discharge with the peak voltage of
   6.2 kV, and the repetition rate of 25 kHz.}},

Abstract = {{The study describes diffusion of elemental sodium into p-type samples of
   Bridgman-grown CuInSe2+x,causing a change from p-to n-type behavior at
   the surface and deep into the material. This resulted in the creation of
   Na is and Se 3d XPS peaks at binding energies of 1071 and 54.5 eV
   respectively, where the latter has been attributed to CuInSe2 itself.
   Subsequent annealing of the samples in air gave rise to a second Se 3d
   peak at 59 eV, attributed to Na2SeO3 by oxidation of Na2Se. However,
   SeO2 also gives a peak at about the same binding energy. The presence of
   the diffused-in Na up to about 10\% at the surface appears to promote
   the creation of a high ratio {[}Se]/{[}Cu] compound at the expense of
   the chalcopyrite at the sample surface. The diffused-in samples showed
   n/p homojunctions at depths of tens of microns for stoichiometric
   CuInSe2 and at smaller depths for CuInSe2.2, with excess Se content.
   Estimates of the diffusion coefficient for Na into the Bridgman samples
   at 250 degrees C were in the range of 10(-10)-10(-8) cm(2)/s. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{During gaze shifts, the eyes and head collaborate to rapidly capture a
   target (saccade) and fixate it. Accordingly, models of gaze shift
   control should embed both saccadic and fixation modes and a mechanism
   for switching between them. We demonstrate a model in which the eye and
   head platforms are driven by a shared gaze error signal. To limit the
   number of free parameters, we implement a model reduction approach in
   which steady-state cerebellar effects at each of their projection sites
   are lumped with the parameter of that site. The model topology is
   consistent with anatomy and neurophysiology, and can replicate eye-head
   responses observed in multiple experimental contexts: 1) observed gaze
   characteristics across species and subjects can emerge from this
   structure with minor parametric changes; 2) gaze can move to a goal
   while in the fixation mode; 3) ocular compensation for head
   perturbations during saccades could rely on vestibular-only cells in the
   vestibular nuclei with postulated projections to burst neurons; 4) two
   nonlinearities suffice, i.e., the experimentally-determined mapping of
   tectoreticular cells onto brain stem targets and the increased
   recruitment of the head for larger target eccentricities; 5) the effects
   of initial conditions on eye/head trajectories are due to neural circuit
   dynamics, not planning; and 6) ``compensatory{''} ocular slow phases
   exist even after semicircular canal plugging, because of
   interconnections linking eye-head circuits. Our model structure also
   simulates classical vestibulo-ocular reflex and pursuit nystagmus, and
   provides novel neural circuit and behavioral predictions, notably that
   both eye-head coordination and segmental limb coordination are possible
   without trajectory planning.}},

Abstract = {{Current literature suggests that the pathology of schizophrenia (SCZ)
   has developmental origins. However, the neurodevelopmental theory of SCZ
   cannot solely explain progressive neurodegenerative processes in the
   illness. There is evidence of accelerated cognitive decline and
   increased risk of dementia in elderly patients with SCZ. Investigating
   beta-amyloid (A beta), we conducted a systematic review focusing on A
   beta in patients with SCZ. An OVID literature search using PsychINFO,
   Medline, and Embase databases was conducted, looking for studies that
   compared A beta levels between patients with SCZ and either elderly
   control subjects, patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), or patients with
   other psychiatric illnesses. Among 14 identified studies, 11 compared A
   beta between SCZ and elderly control subjects, 7 between SCZ and AD, and
   3 between SCZ and other psychiatric illnesses. As a result, no evidence
   was found suggesting that A beta levels differ in patients with SCZ from
   elderly control subjects or patients with other psychiatric illnesses.
   All seven studies reported lower cortical A beta in patients with SCZ
   than patients with AD. Furthermore, three of the four studies, which
   investigated the relationship between A beta and cognitive impairment in
   SCZ, observed no association between two factors. The limitations of the
   included studies are small sample sizes, the inclusion of cerebrospinal
   fluid A beta or postmortem plaques rather than cortical A beta
   assessment in vivo, and the investigation of different brain regions. In
   conclusion, A beta deposition is not associated with cognitive decline
   in late-life SCZ. Future studies should investigate other
   neurodegenerative indicators in SCZ to better understand the
   pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this illness.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{10-19}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The study presents baseline data on local rice parboiling process and
   its energy supply, use and impacts in three communities in the Northern
   region of Ghana. The process as practiced is rudimentary and
   time-consuming requiring several hours of soaking and wood collection.
   Parboiling energy is supplied solely from wood which accounts for 11.9\%
   of the total rice processing cost. The average specific soaking energy
   per batch of 11 and 40 were estimated to be 16.5 and 8.4MJ/kg,
   respectively while that of steaming were 18.3 and 10.3MJ/kg,
   respectively. Energy consumption was mostly influenced by the amount of
   paddy processed and the steaming duration. These results imply that
   specific energy use in these communities are at least 7 times higher
   than the average parboiling energy reports in the literature and
   considerably reduces the income of parboilers. The use of improved
   stove, utilization of rice husk as an energy source and higher
   processing capacity are recommended interventions for reducing energy
   use and cost, mitigating the environmental and health impacts as well as
   improving rice productivity. (C) 2016 International Energy Initiative.

Title = {{Joint Transceiver Design Algorithms for Multiuser MISO Relay Systems

Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate a multiuser multiple-input single-output
   relay system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer,
   where the received signal is divided into two parts for information
   decoding and energy harvesting (EH), respectively. Assuming that both
   base station (BS) and relay station (RS) are equipped with multiple
   antennas, we study the joint transceiver design problem for the BS
   beamforming vectors, the RS amplify-and-forward transformation matrix,
   and the power splitting (PS) ratios at the single-antenna receivers. The
   aim is to minimize the total transmission power of the BS and the RS
   under both signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and EH constraints.
   First, an iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and
   with guaranteed convergence is proposed to successively optimize the
   transceiver coefficients. This AO-based approach is then extended into a
   robust transceiver design against norm bounded errors in channel state
   information (CSI), by using semidefinite relaxation and the S-procedure.
   Second, a novel design scheme based on switched relaying (SR) is
   proposed that can significantly reduce the computational complexity and
   overhead of the AO-based designs while maintaining a similar
   performance. In the proposed SR scheme, the RS is equipped with a
   codebook of permutation matrices. For each permutation matrix, a latent
   transceiver is designed, which consists of BS beamforming vectors,
   optimally scaled RS permutation matrix, and receiver PS ratios. For the
   given CSI, the optimal latent transceiver with the lowest total power
   consumption is selected for transmission. We propose concave-convex
   procedure-based and subgradient-type iterative algorithms, respectively,
   to design the latent transceivers under perfect and imperfect CSI.
   Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of all
   the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental task when reusing software artifacts is to determine the
   most appropriate artifact for the current reuse context. Goal modeling
   allows modelers to capture the advantages and disadvantages of reusable
   candidate artifacts, which in turn helps reason about the most
   appropriate candidate artifact. However, goal models are rarely used in
   isolation for the description of an artifact, but are combined with
   other models that impose additional constraints on the most appropriate
   candidate. Furthermore, reusable artifacts are assembled into reuse
   hierarchies to realize an application. This paper presents a novel goal
   model evaluation mechanism for the selection of the most appropriate
   candidate, which (i) takes into account additional configuration
   constraints expressed with feature models and run-time constraints
   expressed with workflow models that may affect the selection of reusable
   software artifacts, (ii) considers reuse hierarchies, and (iii)
   establishes a history of design decisions. Furthermore, a
   proof-of-concept implementation of the novel evaluation mechanism is

Abstract = {{The drying kinetics and mathematical modeling of hot-air drying of yam
   slices were investigated under two-stage relative humidity (RH) control
   strategy with 60 degrees C and 1.5 m/s as its constant drying
   temperature and air velocity, respectively. Results indicate high RH in
   the initial stage results in high sample's temperature that enhances
   water diffusion in the falling rate drying period. Within the scope of
   current work, change in RH in the later drying period has insignificant
   influence on sample's temperature rise while low RH can accelerate the
   drying rate. Compared to drying at constant 20\% RH at the same drying
   air temperature, the drying strategy of using 40\% RH over the first 15
   min and then lowing to 20\% RH for the remainder time yields a shorter
   drying time. Weibull model adequately described the moisture content
   variation with time for all experiments with the scale parameter ranging
   from 105.02 to 122.38 min and the values of shape parameters from 0.988
   to 1.183. The effective moisture diffusivity determined from the Weibull
   model varied from 2.032 to 2.610 x 10(-8) m(2)/s. The rehydration ratio
   increased as the overall drying time was reduced. Microstructure
   examination shows that higher RH in the initial drying stage can lead to
   a more porous microstructure which enhances drying, while fast drying
   rate in the initial drying period generates a crust layer which hinders
   drying.}},

Abstract = {{Fault-slip taking place in underground mines occasionally causes severe
   damage to mine openings as a result of strong ground motion induced by
   seismic waves arising from fault-slip. It is indicated from previous
   studies that intense seismic waves could be generated with the shock
   unloading of fault surface asperities during fault-slip. This study
   investigates the shock unloading with numerical simulation. A
   three-dimensional (3D) numerical model with idealized asperities is
   constructed with the help of discrete element code 3DEC. The
   idealization is conducted to particularly focus on simulating the shock
   unloading that previous numerical models, which replicate asperity
   degradation and crack development during the shear behavior of a joint
   surface in previous studies, fail to capture and simulate. With the
   numerical model, static and dynamic analyses are carried out to simulate
   unloading of asperities in the course of fault-slip. The results
   obtained from the dynamic analysis show that gradual stress release
   takes place around the center of the asperity tip at a rate of 45 MPa/ms
   for the base case, while an instantaneous stress release greater than 80
   MPa occurs near the periphery of the asperity tip when the contact
   between the upper and lower asperities is lost. The instantaneous stress
   release becomes more intense in the vicinity of the asperity tip,
   causing tensile stress more than 20 MPa. It is deduced that the tensile
   stress could further increase if the numerical model is discretized more
   densely and analysis is carried out under stress conditions at a great
   depth. A model parametric study shows that in-situ stress state has a
   significant influence on the magnitude of the generated tensile stress.
   The results imply that the rapid stress release generating extremely
   high tensile stress on the asperity tip can cause intense seismic waves
   when it occurs at a great depth. (C) 2016 Institute of Rock and Soil

   The effect of processing parameters, such as injection velocity and melt

   injection molded microparts was systematically investigated. The
   electrical conductivity of the microparts was measured in three
   perpendicular directions to determine anisotropy. Results showed that
   the measured conductivity is process-dependent and melt temperature is
   the main factor that affects the electrical conductivity of the
   resultant samples. Electrical conductivity increased with an incremental
   loading fraction of CNT, and the percolation threshold shifted to higher
   filler loading concentration which was ascribed to the very high shear
   rate in mu IM. In addition, Raman analysis, SEM observations, and
   simulation results indicated that CNT is preferentially oriented along
   the flow direction arising from the high shearing effect induced by mu

Title = {{Stretch-and-release fabrication, testing and optimization of a flexible
   ceramic armor inspired from fish scales}},
Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Protective systems that are simultaneously hard to puncture and
   compliant in flexion are desirable, but difficult to achieve because
   hard materials are usually stiff. However, we can overcome this
   conflicting design requirement by combining plates of a hard material
   with a softer substrate, and a strategy which is widely found in natural
   armors such as fish scales or osteoderms. Man-made segmented armors have
   a long history, but their systematic implementation in a modern and a
   protective system is still hampered by a limited understanding of the
   mechanics and the design of optimization guidelines, and by challenges
   in cost-efficient manufacturing. This study addresses these limitations
   with a flexible bioinspired armor based on overlapping ceramic scales.
   The fabrication combines laser engraving and a stretch-and-release
   method which allows for fine tuning of the size and overlap of the
   scales, and which is suitable for large scale fabrication. Compared to a
   continuous layer of uniform ceramic, our fish-scale like armor is not
   only more flexible, but it is also more resistant to puncture and more
   damage tolerant. The proposed armor is also about ten times more
   puncture resistant than soft elastomers, making it a very attractive
   alternative to traditional protective equipment.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports the catalytic conversion of corn starch into
   5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in the presence of AlCl3 center dot 6H(2)O
   in water-{[}Bmim]Cl/MIBK biphasic media. Among the varieties of corn
   starch investigated (regular, waxy, and native high amylose), a maximum
   of 64 wt \% HMF was obtained from waxy corn substrates within 20 min of
   reaction time at 140 degrees C. The HMF yield was comparable to the
   yield obtained from fructose and glucose which were of 70 and 68 wt \%
   respectively. Furthermore, MIBK effectively partitioned HMF from the
   aqueous to the organic phase, thereby preventing further HMF rehydration
   to levulinic acid (LA). Thus, negligible LA yields (0.1 wt \%) were
   detected in this system. Additionally, {[}Bmim]Cl and AlCl3 center dot
   6H(2)O can be recycled for several catalytic runs without compromising
   the HMF selectivity. In summary, the proposed process parameters are
   favorable to achieve high HMF yields from amylopectin-rich starches.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the non-orthogonal dynamic spectrum sharing for
   device-to-device (D2D) communications in the D2D underlaid cellular
   network. Our design aims to maximize the weighted system sum-rate under
   the constraints that: 1) each cellular or active D2D link is assigned
   one subband and 2) the required minimum rates for cellular and active
   D2D links are guaranteed. To solve this problem, we first characterize
   the optimal power allocation solution for a given subband assignment.
   Based on this result, we formulate the subband assignment problem by
   using the graph-based approach, in which each link corresponds to a
   vertex and each subband assignment is represented by a hyper-edge. We
   then propose an iterative rounding algorithm and an optimal
   branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm to solve the resulting graph-based
   problem. We prove that the iterative rounding algorithm achieves at
   least 1/2 of the optimal weighted sum-rate. Extensive numerical studies
   illustrate that the proposed iterative rounding algorithm significantly
   outperforms the conventional spectrum sharing algorithms and attains
   almost the same system sum-rate as the optimal BnB algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Large debris, including vehicles parked along floodplains, can cause
   severe damage and significant loss of life during urban area
   flash-floods. In this study, the authors validated and applied the
   Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model, developed in Amicarelli et
   al. (2015), which reproduces in 3D the dynamics of rigid bodies driven
   by free surface flows, to the design of flood mitigation measures. To
   validate the model, the authors compared the model's predictions to the
   results of an experimental setup, involving a dam breach that strikes
   two fixed obstacles and three transportable floating bodies. Given the
   accuracy of the results, in terms of water depth over time and the time
   history of the bodies' movements, the SPH model explored in this study
   was used to analyse the mitigation efficiency of a proposed structural
   intervention - the use of small barriers (groynes) to prevent the
   transport of floating bodies. Different groynes configurations were
   examined to identify the most appropriate design and layout for urban
   area flash flood damage mitigation. The authors found that groynes
   positioned upstream and downstream of each floating body can be
   effective as a risk mitigation measure for damage resulting from their
   movement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   accommodating the shear displacements and dilatation associated with the
   phase change. A metastable phase diagram is calculated for a 0.30 wt.\%

Abstract = {{Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is a powder metallurgy process that sinters
   powder materials within a short time by simultaneous application of
   electrical current and pressure. SPS differs from other conventional
   powder metallurgy processes by its heating mechanism, which is Joule
   heating of the sample within a graphite die. This study investigates the
   consolidation of aluminum powder by SPS. Different pressures were used
   and particle bonding evaluated by means of fracture surface analysis.
   Electrical resistance, obtained from online monitoring of the variation
   of voltage and current during the process, showed an enhanced descent at
   0.3 T (m), and the area under this drop was associated with ductility:
   the greater the area, the higher the ductility. This temperature
   corresponds to a significant increase in the hardness ratio of the oxide
   layer to aluminum, where breakdown of the oxide layer becomes easier,
   permitting enhanced metallurgical bonding between the powder particles.}},

Title = {{Fixation strength of four headless compression screws}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL ENGINEERING \& PHYSICS}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{To promote a quicker return to function, an increasing number of
   patients are treated with headless screws for acute displaced and even
   non-displaced scaphoid fractures. Therefore, it is imperative to
   understand and optimize the biomechanical characteristics of different
   implants to support the demands of early mobilization. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the biomechanical fixation strength of 4
   headless compression screws under distracting and bending forces. The
   Acutrak Standard, Acutrak Mini, Synthes 3.0, and Herbert-Whipple screws
   were tested using a polyurethane foam scaphoid fracture model. Implants
   were inserted into the foam blocks across a linear osteotomy. Custom
   fixtures applied pull-apart and four-point bending forces until implant
   failure. Pull-apart testing was performed in three different foam
   densities in order to simulate osteoporotic, osteopenic, and normal
   bone. The peak pull-apart forces varied significantly between implants
   and were achieved by (from greatest to least): the Acutrak Standard,
   Synthes 3.0, Acutrak Mini, and Herbert-Whipple screws. The fully
   threaded screws (Acutrak) failed at their proximal threads while the
   shanked screw (Synthes and Herbert Whipple) failed at their distal
   threads. Similarly, the screws most resistant to bending were (from
   greatest to least): the Acutrak Standard, Acutrak Mini, Herbert-Whipple,
   and Synthes. Although the amount of force required for pull-apart
   failure increased with each increasing simulated bone density (a
   doubling in density required triple the amount of pull apart force), the
   mode and sequence of failure was the same. Overall, the fully threaded,
   conical design of the Acutrak screws demonstrated superior fixation
   against pull-apart and bending forces than the shanked designs of the
   Synthes and Herbert-Whipple. We also found a strong relationship between
   simulated bone density and pull-apart force. (C) 2016 IPEM. Published by

Abstract = {{A layerwise theory within the framework of first-order shear deformation
   theory is introduced to investigate the postbuckling behavior and the
   delamination growth of geometrically imperfect composite plates. The
   Ritz method is adopted and the displacement fields are assumed in a form
   of polynomial series leading to a reduced computational cost. The
   proposed method is capable of predicting both the local buckling of the
   delaminated sublaminates and the global buckling of the plate. Two types
   of delaminations are considered: through-the-width and edge
   delaminations. To inhibit the penetration of delarninated domain,
   contact constraints are applied. The debonding of adjacent plies is
   modeled to illustrate the effect of delamination growth on the
   postbuckling response of the delaminated composite plate. A parametric
   study is carried out to investigate the influence of size and location
   of delamination as well as the amplitude of imperfection on the
   postbuckling behavior with concurrent propagation of delamination. A
   three dimensional finite element analysis is also implemented. A
   comparison study is conducted for numerical predictions of the developed
   theoretical model and implemented finite element simulation. It is found
   that the snap-back instability can occur during the delamination growth.
   Moreover, the results show that predictions based upon an analysis
   without consideration for the delamination growth could not be reliable.

Abstract = {{This paper presents visual observations aiming to clarify the underlying
   physics of surfactant effects on clathrate hydrate crystal growth at the
   interface between methane gas and water with surfactant. Sodium dodecyl
   sulfate (SDS), which is commonly used in industrial processes, was used
   in this study. Various SDS mass fractions from 0 to w(SDS) = 100 ppm
   with a step of size 10 ppm were examined, where w(SDS) represents the
   mass fraction of SDS aqueous solution. The crystal growth behavior and
   the crystal morphology of the methane hydrate at the interface varied
   depending on surfactant concentration and Delta T-sub. In systems with
   w(SDS) <= 20 ppm, the nucleation occurred on the droplet surface
   (gas/liquid interface), then grew laterally, and finally covered the
   whole droplet surface. On the contrary, at w(SDS) >= 30 ppm, the droplet
   shape was not maintained and enhanced hydrate crystal growth was
   observed compared to those systems with w(SDS) <= 20 ppm. Individual
   hydrate crystals at w(SDS) = 20 ppm were observed to be smaller than
   those in a pure water system at a given Delta T-sub, which is ascribed
   to the enhanced hydrate nucleation by the addition of SDS.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the effects of geological heterogeneity
   representation in a producing reservoir, when different stochastic
   simulation methods are used, so as to assess the consequent effects on
   flow responses for different enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques
   employed. First, the spatial heterogeneity of a fluvial reservoir is
   simulated using three different stochastic methods: (1) the well-known
   two-point sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS), (2) a multiple-point
   filter-based algorithm (FILTERSIM), and (3) a new alternative high-order
   simulation method that uses high-order spatial statistics (HOSIM).
   Numerical results show that SGS suffers from the inability of describing
   the highly permeable channel network whereas FILTERSIM better reproduces
   this connectivity. By means of the recent HOSIM, a more appropriate
   description of the curvilinear high-permeability channels is obtained.
   Second, the realizations generated above represent permeability fields
   in EOR numerical simulations. In particular, four different methods are
   considered, namely: (1) surfactant, (2) polymer, (3)
   alkaline-surfactant-polymer and (4) foam flooding processes. The
   numerical results show that properly reproducing the main geological
   features of the reference images has a higher impact if surfactant or
   alkaline chemicals are injected rather than polytner or foam. This is
   due to the fact that these latter chemicals act by mitigating the
   effects of heterogeneities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Domestication and intensive selective breeding of plants has triggered
   erosion of genetic diversity of important stress-related alleles.
   Researchers highlight the potential of using wild accessions as a gene
   source for improvement of cereals such as barley, which has major
   economic and social importance worldwide. Previously, we have
   successfully introduced the maize Ac/Ds transposon system for gene
   identification in cultivated barley. The objective of current research
   was to investigate the response of Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum wild
   barley accessions in tissue culture to standardize parameters for
   introduction of Ac/Ds transposons through genetic transformation. We
   investigated the response of ten wild barley genotypes for callus
   induction, regenerative green callus induction and regeneration of
   fertile plants. The activity of exogenous Ac/Ds elements was observed
   through a transient assay on immature wild barley embryos/callus whereby
   transformed embryos/calli were identified by the expression of GUS.
   Transient Ds expression bombardment experiments were performed on 352
   pieces of callus (3-5 mm each) or immature embryos in 4 genotypes of
   wild barley. The transformation frequency of putative transgenic callus
   lines based on transient GUS expression ranged between 72 and100 \% in
   wild barley genotypes. This is the first report of a transformation
   system in H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveA challenge in studying human salivary glands is to maintain
   the cells exvivo in their three-dimensional (3D) morphology with an
   intact native extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. This paper
   established a human salivary 3D organotypic slice culture model that
   could maintain its physiological functions as well as allowing a direct
   visualization of the cells.
   MethodsHuman salivary biopsies from six patients were embedded in
   agarose and submerged in cold buffer for thin (50m) sectioning using a
   vibratome. Salivary slices' were mechanically supported by a porous
   membrane insert that allowed an air-liquid interface and cultured in
   serum-free culture media. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis,
   physiological functions, and gene expression were assessed during 14days
   of culture.
   ResultsHuman salivary slices maintained cell survival (70-40\%) and
   proliferation (6-17\%) for 14days exvivo. The protein secretory
   (amylase) function decreased, but fluid (intracellular calcium
   mobilization) function was maintained. Acinar, ductal, and myoepithelial
   cell populations survived and maintained their 3D organization within
   the slice culture model.
   ConclusionThe human salivary slice culture model kept cells alive exvivo
   for 14days as well as maintaining their 3D morphology and physiological
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{A Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm based on eXtended Classifier
   System (XCS) is used to navigate a spherical robot. Traditional motion
   planning strategies rely on pre-planned optimal trajectories and
   feedback control techniques. The proposed learning agent approach enjoys
   a direct model-free methodology that enables the robot to function in
   dynamic and/or partially observable environments. The agent uses a set
   of guard-action rules that determines the motion inputs at each step.
   Using a number of control inputs (actions) and the developed RL scheme,
   the agent learns to make near-optimal moves in response to the incoming
   position/orientation signals. The proposed method employs an improved
   variant of the XCS as its learning agent. Results of several simulated
   experiments for the spherical robot show that this approach is capable
   of planning a near-optimal path to a predefined target from any given
   position/orientation.}},

Abstract = {{Phthalates are compounds used in polymers to increase their flexibility
   and are now ubiquitous in the environment as a result of widespread use.
   Because few studies have focused on the adverse effects of these
   chemicals in aquatic species, the present study aimed to determine the
   effects of phthalate diesters in amphibians. Western clawed frog
   (Silurana tropicalis) tadpoles were acutely exposed to water spiked with
   monomethyl phthalate (MMP; 1.3-1595.5mg/L), dimethyl phthalate (DMP;
   0.03-924.0mg/L), or dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP; 0.3-99.3mg/L). Because
   few studies have addressed the toxicity of these specific phthalates in
   most organisms, the present study used higher concentrations of these
   chemicals to determine their toxicity pathways in amphibians and at the
   same time investigate a suite of genes known to be altered by the
   well-studied phthalates. Both DMP and DCHP increased larval mortality
   (9.1-924.0mg/L DMP and 4.1-99.3mg/L DCHP), increased frequency of
   malformations in tadpoles (0.1-34.1mg/L DMP and 4.1-19.0mg/L DCHP), and
   up-regulated cellular stress-related messenger-RNA (mRNA) levels
   (4.1mg/L DCHP). To characterize the molecular toxicity pathway of these
   phthalates in tadpoles, transcriptome analysis was conducted using a
   custom microarray. Parametric analysis of gene set enrichment revealed
   important changes in the expression of genes related to drug metabolism
   and transport, liver metabolism, xenobiotic clearance, and xenobiotic
   metabolism after DMP and DCHP treatments, although these responses were
   less pronounced with MMP (the metabolite of DMP). The present study is
   one of the few studies that demonstrated complementarity between gene
   expression analysis and organismal effects. Environ Toxicol Chem

Abstract = {{Improved ice detachment failure criteria were implemented into the
   finite-element dynamic analysis of iced power transmission lines
   subjected to cable rupture shocks, which allows the study of the ice
   shedding effects that have been induced by the initial shocks. The
   modeling method is validated first experimentally by full-scale physical
   tests and then numerically by comparing with previous numerical methods.
   The case study shows that after considering the ice detachment failure
   subsequent to the initial rupture shock, the dynamic response of the
   iced line is significantly different from that obtained with previous
   iced line models that ignore the induced ice shedding effects. It shows
   that the previous equivalent density method tends to overestimate and
   the previous strain method tends to underestimate the maximum values and
   dynamic impact factors of cable tensions and insulator forces for the
   iced line following conductor breakage. It also shows that the
   cable-ground contact effect plays quite a different role in the bare
   cable model and iced line models. The proposed method can help improve
   the structure design of transmission lines and can also be used to study
   the dynamic response of lines subjected to other modes of line
   components failure, such as clamp slippage, insulator rupture, and tower
   deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Deoxidation equilibria in high-Mn- and high-Al-alloyed liquid steels
   were studied over the entire Fe-Mn-Al composition range by both
   experiments and thermodynamic modeling. Effect of Mn on the Al
   deoxidation equilibria in liquid iron was measured by the different
   experimental techniques depending on the Al content. In order to confirm
   the reproducibility of the experimental results, the deoxidation
   experiments were carried out reversibly from high oxygen state by
   addition of Al as a deoxidizer, and from low oxygen state by addition of
   Fe2O3 or MnO as an oxygen source. For the Al-rich side, CaO flux was
   added on top of liquid iron in order to remove suspended Al2O3
   inclusions in the melt. Based on the present experimental result and
   available critically evaluated literature data, the Al deoxidation
   equilibria in Fe-Mn-Al-O liquid alloy were thermodynamically modeled.
   The Modified Quasichemical Model was used in order to take into account
   a strong short-range ordering of atoms in molten state. Deoxidation
   equilibria and inclusion stability diagram for entire Fe-Mn-Al melt were
   successfully reproduced by the present model.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at capturing the determinants of near-road
   concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFP) using linear mixed-effects
   models, investigating the effects of meteorology, built environment, and
   traffic. In addition, the differences in the levels of UFP between both
   sides of the road were investigated. To reach these objectives, field
   measurements were conducted on 16 weekdays in the months of March and
   April 2015, along Papineau Avenue, a high-volume street in Montreal,
   Canada. Four sites were identified varying in land use, building height,
   and road characteristics. Air quality measurements were conducted at
   each location (on both sides of the road) for two consecutive hours, at
   four different times during the day and repeated four times, leading to
   a total of 16 visits per location. Traffic volume and composition was
   also recorded. On-site meteorological variables including wind speed,
   wind direction, temperature and relative humidity were collected using a
   portable weather station. Linear mixed-effects models with random
   intercept were developed for both dependent variables: the natural
   logarithm of the mean UFP concentration and the difference in UFP
   concentrations between two sides of the road. Lower temperatures and
   wind speeds were associated with increased UFP concentrations. Winds
   orthogonal to the road tended to increase UFP concentrations as well as
   the differences between both sides of the road. Finally, built
   environment variables such as the presence of open areas and buildings
   on both sides of the road, had a positive influence on the difference
   between UFP on the two sides. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effect of early carbonation curing on chloride penetration and
   weathering carbonation in concrete}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{516-526}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Early carbonation curing of concretes was developed for accelerating the
   strength gain and promoting carbon dioxide utilization in concrete.
   However, the effect of early carbonation curing on chloride penetration
   was not clear. it was reported that weathering carbonation of concrete
   could increase chloride penetration. The purpose of this paper is to
   examine if early carbonation curing would also accelerate the chloride
   penetration and the weathering carbonation depth in concrete during
   service. Both carbonation cured and hydration cured concretes with and
   without fly ash were exposed to two severe cyclic conditions: (1)
   chloride immersion/air drying cycles and (2) chloride
   immersion/accelerated weathering carbonation cycles. It was found
   through one-year cyclic tests that total chloride content was actually
   reduced by more than 50\% in concrete subjected to carbonation curing
   comparing to hydration reference. Reduction in free chloride
   (water-soluble) in carbonation cured concrete reached more than 60\%. It
   was also found that carbonation cured concrete was not more vulnerable
   to weathering carbonation. This was attributed to the carbonate-rich
   surface protective layer which was less permeable, less absorptive, and
   with comparable pH value, enabling the carbonation cured concretes
   higher resistance to chloride penetration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Recycling combustion ash for sustainable cement production: A critical
   review with data-mining and time-series predictive models}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{673-689}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Combustion is a complex process that produces energy as the goal and
   ashes as by-products. The ash of coal, biomass. and solid waste
   combustion can be used as pozzolans in blended cement due to the
   similarity of their physiochemical properties to conventional pozzolans
   (e.g. silica fume). This strategy effectively recycles pozzolanic-active
   combustion ash and replaces a significant proportion of Portland cement,
   which potentially reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cement
   production.. However, cement producers wishing to substitute
   pozzolanic-active ash for conventional pozzolans lack information on the
   pozzolanic activity (PA) of ash from diverse combustible materials. A
   data-mining model that can extract key information for predicting the PA
   of combustion ash is envisioned as a screening tool to assess the
   pozzolanic potential of candidate combustible materials prior to
   experimental work. Hence, the objectives of this chapter are, 1) to
   critically review the recent research progress in using various
   combustion ashes as pozzolans, including the mechanism of the pozzolanic
   reaction, sources of eligible materials, and methods of PA improvement,
   2) to create a data-mining artificial neural network (ANN) model for PA
   prediction built upon data reported in the scientific literature from
   1998 to 2015, and 3) to describe the effect of cement curing period on
   PA, based on a time series model. The ANN and time-series models
   developed in this study can accurately forecast the PA of combustion
   ashes during 3-90 d curing (R-2 = 0.8479-0.9914). We recommend these
   screening tools as rapid indicators of the pozzolanic potential of
   combustion ash prior to undertaking strength tests and other
   experimental testing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of fracture-induced weakening on coal mine gateroad stability}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{307-317}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The ground stability of gateroads is a major concern in underground coal
   mines, especially when the surrounding strata are weak and fractured.
   This paper presents a novel numerical modelling technique for gateroad
   stability analysis based on a case study conducted at Zhaogu No. 2 mine,
   China. Considering the occurrence of fracturing and its weakening effect
   on the stiffness of the rock mass, a tension weakening model is
   implemented into FLAC3D, whereby the stiffness of the rock mass is
   progressively decreased with the failure state. A relationship between
   the intensity of fractures and the residual strength of the rockmass is
   built in the numerical model. A parametric study of the
   tension-weakening model is carried out, and the results are compared to
   elastic-perfectly plastic and strain-softening models. It is shown that
   the tension-weakening model exhibits noticeable effects on ground
   deformation and rock support loading, which are observed from field
   measurements. Thus, the tension weakening model offers a more realistic
   simulation of the gateroad behavior than elastic-plastic and strain
   softening models. The proposed model can be utilized for other
   applications involving rock reinforcement of mine openings under similar
   geotechnical conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike traditional defect prediction models that identify defect-prone
   modules, Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction models identify
   defect-inducing changes. As such, JIT defect models can provide earlier
   feedback for developers, while design decisions are still fresh in their
   minds. Unfortunately, similar to traditional defect models, JIT models
   require a large amount of training data, which is not available when
   projects are in initial development phases. To address this limitation
   in traditional defect prediction, prior work has proposed cross-project
   models, i.e., models learned from other projects with sufficient
   history. However, cross-project models have not yet been explored in the
   context of JIT prediction. Therefore, in this study, we empirically
   evaluate the performance of JIT models in a cross-project context.
   Through an empirical study on 11 open source projects, we find that
   while JIT models rarely perform well in a cross-project context, their
   performance tends to improve when using approaches that: (1) select
   models trained using other projects that are similar to the testing
   project, (2) combine the data of several other projects to produce a
   larger pool of training data, and (3) combine the models of several
   other projects to produce an ensemble model. Our findings empirically
   confirm that JIT models learned using other projects are a viable
   solution for projects with limited historical data. However, JIT models
   tend to perform best in a cross-project context when the data used to
   learn them are carefully selected.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{496-512}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Plasticizers are indispensable additives providing flexibility and
   malleability to plastics. Among them, several phthalates, including di
   (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), have emerged as endocrine disruptors,
   leading to their restriction in consumer products and creating a need
   for new, safer plasticizers. The goal of this project was to use in
   vitro functional screening tools to select novel non-toxic plasticizers
   suitable for further in vivo evaluation. A panel of novel compounds with
   satisfactory plasticizer properties and biodegradability were tested,
   along with several commercial plasticizers, such as
   diisononyl-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH (R)). MEHP, the
   monoester metabolite of DEHP was also included as reference compound.
   Because phthalates target mainly testicular function, including androgen
   production and spermatogenesis, we used the mouse MA-10 Leydig and C18-4
   spermatogonial cell lines as surrogates to examine cell survival,
   proliferation, steroidogenesis and mitochondrial integrity. The most
   promising compounds were further assessed on organ cultures of rat fetal
   and neonatal testes, corresponding to sensitive developmental windows.
   Dose-response studies revealed the toxicity of most maleates and
   fumarates, while identifying several dibenzoate and succinate
   plasticizers as innocuous on Leydig and germ cells. Interestingly, DINCH
   (R), a plasticizer marketed as a safe alternative to phthalates, exerted
   a biphasic effect on steroid production in MA-10 and fetal Leydig cells.
   MEHP was the only plasticizer inducing the formation of multinucleated
   germ cells (MNG) in organ culture. Overall, organ cultures corroborated
   the cell line data, identifying one dibenzoate and one succinate as the
   most promising candidates. The adoption of such collaborative approaches
   for developing new chemicals should help prevent the development of
   compounds potentially harmful to human health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Nitrate contamination of groundwater is an environmental concern in
   intensively cultivated desert oases where this polluted groundwater is
   in turn used as a major irrigation water resource. However, nitrate
   fluxes from root zone to groundwater are difficult to monitor in this
   complex system. The objectives of this study were to validate and apply
   the WHCNS (soil Water Heat Carbon Nitrogen Simulator) model to simulate
   water drainage and nitrate leaching under different irrigation and
   nitrogen (N) management practices, and to assess the utilization of
   groundwater nitrate as an approach to remediate nitrate contaminated
   groundwater while maintain crop yield. A two-year field experiment was
   conducted in a corn field irrigated with high nitrate groundwater (20 mg
   N L-1) in Alxa, Inner Mongolia, China. The experiment consisted of two
   irrigation treatments (I-std, standard, 750 mm per season; I-csv,
   conservation, 570 mm per season) factorially combined with two N
   fertilization treatments (N-std, standard, 138 kg ha(-1); N-csv,
   conservation, 92 kg ha(-1)). The validated results showed that the WHCNS
   model simulated values of crop dry matter, yield, soil water content and
   soil N concentration in soil profile all agreed well with the observed
   values. Compared to the standard water management (I-std), the simulated
   drainage and nitrate leaching decreased about 65\% and 59\%,
   respectively, under the conservation water management (I-csv) Nearly
   55\% of input N was lost by leaching under the IstaNstd and IstdNav
   treatments, compared to only 26\% under the IcsvNstd and IcsvNcsv
   treatments. Simulations with more than 240 scenarios combing different
   levels of irrigation and fertilization indicated that irrigation was the
   main reason leading to the high risk of nitrate leaching, and the
   nitrate in irrigation groundwater can be best utilized without corn
   yield loss when the total irrigation was reduced from the current 750 mm
   to 491 mm. This reduced irrigation rate facilitated the use of
   approximately 42 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) of nitrate from groundwater, which
   would gradually improve the groundwater quality. Future field studies on
   nitrate leaching in this area are suggested to investigate water and N
   dynamics under irrigation rates near 490 mm per season. (C) 2016

Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{484-497}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Biochar, a solid porous material obtained from the carbonization of
   biomass under low or no oxygen conditions, has been proposed as a
   climate change mitigation tool because it is expected to sequester
   carbon (C) for centuries and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   from soils. This review aimed to identify key biochar properties and
   production parameters that have an effect on these specific applications
   of the biochar. Moreover, mechanisms involved in interactions between
   biochar and soils were highlighted. Following a compilation and
   comparison of the characteristics of 76 biochars from 40 research
   studies, biochars with a lower N content, and consequently a higher C/N
   ratio (>30), were found to be more suitable for mitigation of N2O
   emissions from soils. Moreover, biochars produced at a higher pyrolysis
   temperature, and with O/C ratio <0.2, H/C-org ratio <0.4 and volatile
   matter below 80\% may have high C sequestration potential. Based on
   these observations, biochar production and application to the field can
   be used as a tool to mitigate climate change. However, it is important
   to determine the pyrolysis conditions and feedstock needed to produce a
   biochar with the desired properties for a specific application. More
   research studies are needed to identify the exact mechanisms involved
   following biochar amendment to soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Frothers are widely used in flotation to help generate small bubbles,
   with coalescence prevention generally considered the predominant
   mechanism. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the presence
   of frothers also reduces the size of bubbles at the initial formation
   stage. One possible explanation is that frothers introduce a surface
   tension gradient-driven stress, which increases instabilities along the
   air/water interface: increasing the number of instabilities along the
   surface of a finite-volume air mass means that more small bubbles will
   break away. The magnitude of surface tension gradient, and thus number
   of instabilities, is related to frother concentration. This paper
   investigates the effect of increasing frother concentration on the size
   of bubble formed. The hypothesis tested is that while low concentration
   may sustain gradients, at high concentration mass transfer may be
   sufficient to damp them. The finding is that with an increase in frother
   concentration the bubble size initially decreased to a minimum then
   increased supporting the hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The addition of frothers in the flotation process has a significant
   effect on the hydrodynamic properties of the pulp phase as well as the
   stability of the froth phase. Some flotation collectors have been
   reported to have similar hydrodynamic effects, but there are few
   published quantitative studies. In this paper, the pure forms of the
   main families of sulfhydryl collectors from thiophosphates, xanthates
   and xanthate derivatives are tested. The aim was to determine the
   hydrodynamic properties of each reagent and to examine frother-collector
   interactions in terms of hydrodynamics. Experiments were carried out in
   a two phase air-water system using a 3 in. diameter column. Gas holdup
   (epsilon(g)) and foam height (Hf) were measured to construct
   hydrodynamic characterization curves. The collectors tested have varied
   hydrodynamic activity with the xanthogen subgroup of collectors showing
   different degrees of hydrodynamic activity depending on their structure.
   In general, sulfhydryl collectors used in salt formulations showed very
   little hydrodynamic activity, while the oily collectors showed varied
   hydrodynamic effects from frother-type behavior to defoaming. In all
   frother-collector blends tested, a variable degree of foam stability
   loss was observed with this effect more pronounced in blends of weak
   frother and collector. A slight increase in epsilon(g) was measured for
   almost all of the collector-frother blends. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents an indirect method for determining the local gas
   holdup in the collection zone of flotation machines. The method includes
   a linear model to describe the gas holdup as a function of the
   superficial gas velocity and the percent area, defined as the 2D area
   fraction occupied by bubbles in binary images. Such images were recorded
   using a bubble viewer. More than 250 images of bubbles were processed to
   obtain suitable percent area estimations. The ability of the model to
   describe local gas holdup was tested at laboratory and industrial scale.
   The latter included self-aerated and forced-air mechanical cells from
   8.5 m(3) to 300 m(3) and industrial columns from 42 m(3) to 160 m(3).
   The model was able to estimate the gas holdup ranging from 2.5\% to 15\%
   in laboratory and from 6.0\% to 21.0\% in industrial machines. As a
   result, a database of industrial gas holdup is presented, which includes
   8 copper concentrators. The proposed methodology is a promising tool for

Abstract = {{This study is part of our investigation into the frother
   structure-property relationship, here focusing on aliphatic alcohols.
   The structure variation is the length of the alkyl chain (C4 to C7), and
   position of the methyl branch (-CH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) group in five-
   and six-carbon alcohols. The property was bubble rise velocity. Single
   bubble velocity profiles were determined in a 350 cm water column.
   Velocity at 300 cm as a function of concentration is determined and the
   concentration to reach minimum velocity at 300 cm (CMV) estimated. The
   most significant effect is the chain length which decreases CMV by about
   one order of magnitude for each additional carbon. The next strongest
   effect is the methyl branch position which decreases CMV as it is moved
   away from the hydroxyl group. The least effect is the position of OH
   which nevertheless systematically decreases CMV as it is moved from
   position C-3 to C-1 (i.e., from the center to the terminus of the
   molecule). An argument based on surfactant molecule packing on the
   bubble surface is proposed to account for the effect on CMV. From the
   results the structure of the most effective aliphatic alcohol frother is
   suggested. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) is a powerful technique for
   characterizing the physicochemical properties of a wide variety of
   materials. The behaviour of minerals in the flotation process is
   directly related to their wettability, which can be described by surface
   free energy. In this work, the adsorption of copper and xanthate on
   hydrophilic pyrite, prepared under different conditions, was studied
   using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and IGC. Microflotation
   experiments were also conducted to determine flotation recovery. The XPS
   analyses confirmed the presence of copper (I) and xanthate compounds on
   the surface of treated samples. The surface energy and work of adhesion
   to water decreased, while the flotation recovery increased due to
   treatment.
   IGC has been shown to have the capability of characterizing mineral
   surfaces, pre- and post-treatment. It enabled the observation of the
   changes in physicochemical properties of pyrite surface due to surface
   modification at different conditions. Moreover, combining the
   microflotation recovery of the samples with IGC results confirmed the
   correlation between surface energy and flotation response. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The importance of lignocellulosic biomass as important bioresources that
   can be utilized in many forms has increased in the last few decades.
   Cassava peels, a lignocellulosic biomass discarded during cassava
   processing, are commonly found in the tropics and several other
   countries around the world due to the popularity of cassava as an
   important calorie source. Interestingly however, a lot of energy
   deprived, oil dependent countries are also amongst the highest producer
   of this biomass. Hence, this review explores the suitability of cassava
   peels as a lignocellulosic biomass substrate for the production of
   bioethanol. Special consideration to the properties of the biomass drive
   the conceptualized plant design while conditions for optimal production
   and salient economic considerations are discussed. A cellulosic
   biorefinery of this type is expected to help in harnessing the presently
   improperly managed agricultural processing byproduct with a view to
   reducing dependence on fossil fuels, which are totally non-renewable and
   have damaging effects on the environment especially in developing
   countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The melting of frozen water droplets is a fundamental and ubiquitous
   process and the study of the transport processes occurring within the
   system during phase change is essential to understanding the forces that
   govern it. Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can be added to liquid
   systems prior to crystallization in order to modify the properties of
   the phase change process and of the liquid or solid systems themselves.
   In this study, the melting behavior of frozen sessile droplets composed
   of water and 50 ppm of either functionalized or non-functionalized
   aqueous MWCNTs is investigated. Droplets are thawed from their base on a
   hydrophobic substrate set to temperatures between 1 and 30 degrees C.
   Tracking of MWCNT clusters during melting shows convective fluid motion
   occurring within the liquid melt at temperatures above 5 degrees C. This
   circulation is contingent on the presence of the ice phase above. The
   internal fluid dynamics are attributed predominantly to thermocapillary
   effects as a result of temperature induced surface tension gradients
   along the air/liquid interface in the melt. Further, the melting times
   of MWCNT-containing systems were longer than pure water samples. These
   results highlight new and important mechanisms driving the melting
   processes within water droplet systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental non-linear vibrations of thin rectangular
   plates and curved panels subjected to out-of-plane harmonic excitation
   are investigated. Experiments have been performed on isotropic and
   laminated sandwich plates and panels with supported and free boundary
   conditions. A sophisticated measuring technique has been developed to
   characterize the non-linear behavior experimentally by using a Laser
   Doppler Vibrometer and a stepped-sine testing procedure. The theoretical
   approach is based on Donnell's non-linear shell theory (since the tested
   plates are very thin) but retaining in-plane inertia, taking into
   account the effect of geometric imperfections. A unified energy approach
   has been utilized to obtain the discretized non-linear equations of
   motion by using the linear natural modes of vibration. Moreover, a
   pseudo arc-length continuation and collocation scheme has been used to
   obtain the periodic solutions and perform bifurcation analysis.
   Comparisons between numerical simulations and the experiments show good
   qualitative and quantitative agreement. It is found that, in order to
   simulate large-amplitude vibrations, a damping value much larger than
   the linear modal damping should be considered. This indicates a very
   large and non-linear increase of damping with the increase of the
   excitation and vibration amplitude for plates and curved panels with
   different shape, boundary conditions and materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A non-linear identification technique based on the harmonic balance
   method is presented to obtain the damping ratio and non-linear
   parameters of isotropic and laminated sandwich rectangular plates and
   curved panels, subjected to harmonic excitation orthogonal to the
   surface. The response of structures under consideration is approximated
   by a single-degree of freedom Duffing oscillator accounting for viscous
   damping, quadratic and cubic non-linear stiffness. The method uses
   experimental frequency-amplitude data and a least-squares technique to
   identify parameters and reconstruct frequency-response curves by
   spanning the excitation frequency in the neighborhood of the lowest
   natural frequencies. In particular, an iterative procedure is
   implemented to construct the mean displacement and identify the damping
   ratio. Close agreement is seen between the reconstructed non-linear
   frequency-amplitude curves, the experimental data and the results of the
   reduced-order model obtained in part 1 of the present study (Alijani et
   al., 2015 pp. The proposed identification technique confirms the very
   large increase of damping during large-amplitude vibrations, as observed
   in part 1 of the present study, and demonstrates a non-linear
   correlation between damping, vibration amplitude and excitation level.

   containing 3 wt pct aluminum and 3 wt pct silicon were subjected to
   different annealing treatments in the present study. The evolution of
   the microstructure in terms of austenite transformation upon reheating
   and the subsequent austenite decomposition during quenching was
   investigated. Manganese content of the steels prevailed the
   microstructural response. The microstructure of the leaner alloy with 7
   wt pct Mn (7Mn) was substantially influenced by the annealing
   temperature, including the variation of phase constituents, the
   morphology and composition of intercritical austenite, the M-s

   variations of intercritical annealing temperature. Austenite formation
   from hot band ferrite-pearlite/bainite mixtures was very rapid during
   annealing at 1273 K (1000 A degrees C), regardless of Mn contents.
   Austenite growth was believed to be controlled at early stages by carbon
   diffusion following pearlite/bainite dissolution. The redistribution of
   Mn in ferrite and particularly in austenite at later stages was too
   subtle to result in a measureable change in austenite fraction. Further,
   the hot band microstructure of both steels contained a large fraction of
   coarse-grained delta-ferrite, which remained almost unchanged during
   intercritical annealing. A recently developed thermodynamic database was
   evaluated using the experimental data. The new database achieved a
   better agreement with the experimental results for the 7Mn steel
   compared with the existing commercial TCFE database; however, some
   discrepancy in the predicted phase fractions and compositions still
   existed. The phase transformation behavior of the two steels during
   annealing and its implication on the design of high aluminum-silicon
   medium manganese steels were discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder
   with cognitive, motor, and emotional symptoms. The thalamus and basal
   ganglia form circuits with the cortex supporting all three of these
   behavioral domains. Abnormalities in the structure of subcortical
   regions may suggest atypical development of these networks, with
   implications for understanding the neural basis of ASD symptoms.
   Findings from previous volumetric studies have been inconsistent. Here,
   using advanced surface-based methodology, we investigated localized
   differences in shape and surface area in the basal ganglia and thalamus
   in ASD, using T1-weighted anatomical images from the Autism Brain
   Imaging Data Exchange (373 male participants aged 7-35 years with ASD
   and 384 typically developing). We modeled effects of diagnosis, age, and
   their interaction on volume, shape, and surface area. In participants
   with ASD, we found expanded surface area in the right posterior thalamus
   corresponding to the pulvinar nucleus, and a more concave shape in the
   left mediodorsal nucleus. The shape of both caudal putamen and pallidum
   showed a relatively steeper increase in concavity with age in ASD.
   Within ASD participants, restricted, repetitive behaviors were
   positively associated with surface area in bilateral globus pallidus. We
   found no differences in overall volume, suggesting that surface-based
   approaches have greater sensitivity to detect localized differences in
   subcortical structure. This work adds to a growing body of literature
   implicating corticobasal ganglia-thalamic circuits in the
   pathophysiology of ASD. These circuits subserve a range of cognitive,
   emotional, and motor functions, and may have a broad role in the complex
   symptom profile in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Progress on a construction project can be derailed if its timetable is

   preferable to minimize the pending time of the service request rather

   developed which minimizes and distributes the pending times uniformly,
   using a least deviation method to prioritize possible sequences
   according to the pending time for each requested crane service. An
   improved harmony search based on the power index method was then used to
   search for the sequence which led to the least deviation of priorities
   from their mean values. The efficiency of the proposed method was tested
   on a benchmark from the literature which involved solving 10, 50 or 100
   service request problems. The proposed method achieved distribution of
   the deviation of pending times by approximately 40\%, 50\% and 10\%,

Abstract = {{There has been significant recent interest in combining radiation
   therapy and photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment. One proposed
   method involves conjugating photosensitizers (PS) to scintillating
   nanoparticles. However, the production of nanoscintillators that are
   stable in biological media is problematic since many of the commonly
   used compositions chelate phosphate. In this paper, the problem was
   solved by first synthesizing LaF3 nanoparticles, followed by surface
   modification with alendronate, which serves as a stable anchor for
   conjugation of molecules of interest. The nanoparticles had an average
   diameter of 4 nm, and were doped with either Ce3+, Tb3+, or both. In
   every case, a LaF3 shell was added. In subsequent steps, poly(ethylene)
   glycol (PEG) and photosensitizers (either chlorin e6 or rose bengal)
   were covalently linked to the alendronate ligand via an amide bond. This
   new formulation is stable in several solutions and buffers used commonly
   in the laboratory for cell culture. Moreover, cellular uptake and lack
   of toxicity up to a concentration of 50 mu M were observed in B16 murine
   melanoma cells. Energy transfer between the doped nanoparticle core and
   the conjugated photosensitizers was demonstrated using UV excitation,
   and scintillation was demonstrated using x-rays. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The dynamic stability in parametric resonance of a Timoshenko microbeam
   subject to a time-dependent axial excitation load (comprised of a mean
   value along with time-dependent variations) is analysed in the
   subcritical regime. Based on the modified couple stress theory,
   continuous expressions for the elastic potential and kinetic energies
   are developed using kinematic and kinetic relations. The continuous
   model of the system is obtained via use of Hamilton's principal. A model
   reduction procedure is carried out by applying the Galerkin scheme, in
   conjunction with an assumed-mode technique, yielding a high-dimensional
   second-order reduced-order model. A liner analysis is carried out upon
   the linear part of this model in order to obtain the linear natural
   frequencies and critical buckling loads. For the system in the
   subcritical regime, the parametric nonlinear responses are analysed by
   exciting the system at the principal parametric resonance in the first
   mode of transverse motion; this analysis is performed via use of a
   continuation technique, the Floquet theory, and a direct time
   integration method. Results are shown in the form of parametric
   frequency-responses, parametric force-responses, time traces,
   phase-plane diagrams, and fast Fourier transforms. The validity of the
   numerical simulations is tested via comparing our results, for simpler
   models for buckling response, with those given in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The eigenstrain theory is widely used to study inelastic responses of
   several classes of materials subjected to phase transformation, thermal
   expansion, and other multiphysics excitations. In this paper, we focus
   on electrically conducting cellular solids and examine their
   magnetoelastic responses when used as a core of a sandwich cylinder
   subjected to an eigenstrain and an external magnetic field. The cylinder
   comprises layers of either solid or cellular material and undergoes
   either plane strain or plane stress conditions in both time-harmonic and
   transient states. We use direct homogenization techniques (standard
   mechanics and micromechanical models) along with Bessel, Struve, and
   Lommel functions to study the roles that cell topology, relative
   density, eigenstrain, and bonding interface play on the magnetoelastic
   responses of the sandwich cylinder. The results show that relative
   density, cell topology, and magnetic field are the factors that most
   contribute to control the sandwich response. We also show that a careful
   tailoring of relative density and cell topology can lead to the
   simultaneous weight and overall stress reduction with improved natural
   frequency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Discharge forecasting using an Online Sequential Extreme Learning
   Machine (OS-ELM) model: A case study in Neckar River, Germany}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{433-445}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Flood forecasting in natural rivers is a complicated procedure because
   of uncertainties involved in the behaviour of the flood wave movement.
   This leads to complex problems in hydrological modelling which have been
   widely solved by soft computing techniques. In real time flood
   forecasting, data generation is continuous and hence there is a need to
   update the developed mapping equation frequently which increases the
   computational burden. In short term flood forecasting where the accuracy
   of flood peak value and time to peak are critical, frequent model
   updating is unavoidable. In this paper, we studied a new technique:
   Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) which is capable of
   updating the model equation based on new data entry without much
   increase in computational cost. The OS-ELM was explored for use in flood
   forecasting on the Neckar River, Germany. The reach was characterized by
   significant lateral flow that affected the flood wave formation. Hourly
   data from 1999-2000 at the upstream section of Rottweil were used to
   forecast flooding at the Oberndorf downstream site with a lead time of
   1-6 h. Model performance was assessed by using three evaluation
   measures: the coefficient of determination (R-2), the Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency coefficient (NS) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). The
   performance of the OS-ELM was comparable to those of other widely used

Abstract = {{An analytical model for the calculation of fluid temperature profiles in
   geothermal boreholes with multiple U-tubes is presented. A linear system
   of first order differential equations is built based on a steady-state
   thermal resistances approach to the heat transfer between the U-tube
   pipes and the borehole wall. Analytical expressions for fluid
   temperature profiles are provided for boreholes with arbitrary borehole
   wall temperature profiles as well as piece-wise uniform and uniform
   borehole wall temperature for different U-tube configurations:
   independent, parallel and series. The analytical model is coupled to a
   finite line source model of the heat transfer between the borehole and
   the ground. Fluid and borehole wall temperature profiles are solved
   simultaneously using numerical Laplace transforms to consider the time
   variation of the temperatures and heat extraction rates. Results are
   verified against a finite difference model of the borehole. Differences
   between the fluid temperatures calculated with the numerical and
   analytical models are smaller than 0.003 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Magnesium-based alloys are attractive candidate materials for medical
   applications. Our earlier work showed that the ternary Mg-0.3Sr-0.3Ca
   alloy exhibits slower degradation rates than both binary-Mg-Sr and Mg-Ca
   alloys. The ternary alloy immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) forms a
   compact surface layer of corrosion products that we hypothesized to be a
   Sr-substituted hydroxyapatite (HA). The main objectives of the current
   work are to understand the bio-degradation mechanism of Mg-0.3Sr-0.3Ca,
   to identify the exact nature of its protective layer and to evaluate the
   in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the alloy for cardiovascular
   applications. To better simulate the physiological. environment, the
   alloy was immersed in SBF which was daily refreshed. Raman spectroscopy
   and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the formation of a
   thin, Sr-substituted HA layer at the interface between the alloy and the
   corrosion products. In vitro biocompatibility evaluated via indirect
   cytotoxicity assays using HUVECs showed no toxicity effect and ions
   extracted from Mg-0.3Sr-0.3Ca in fact increased the viability of HUVECs
   after one week. In vivo tests were performed by implanting a tubular
   Mg0.3Sr-0.3Ca stent along with a WE43 control stent into the right and
   left femoral artery of a dog. Post implantation and histological
   analyses showed no thrombosis in the artery with Mg-0.3Sr-0.3Ca stent
   after 5 weeks of implantation while the artery implanted with WE43 stent
   was extensively occluded and thrombosed. Microscopic observation of the
   Mg-0.3Sr-0.3Ca implant-tissue interface confirmed the in situ formation
   of Sr-substituted HA on the surface during in vivo test. These results
   show that the interfacial layer protects the surface of the
   Mg0.3Sr-0.3Ca alloy both in vitro and in vivo, and is the key factor in
   the bio-corrosion resistance of the alloy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{MagnesiumAZ31alloy sheets were rolled at a high speed of 1000 m/min(HSR)
   and a low speed of 15 m/min(LSR) at 100 degrees C to a reduction of
   30\%. The as-rolled microstructures were heavily twinned and shear
   banded at both speeds. Annealing was performed on the as-rolled sheets
   at three different temperatures (200, 350 and 500 degrees C) for
   increasing time intervals. Texture weakening was achieved after
   annealing of both HSRed and LSRed sheets due to static recrystallization
   (SRX) on twins and shear bands. This, in turn, greatly improved the
   ductility of the sheets. It was found that the intensities of the basal
   texture of the HSRed specimens were lower than those of the LSRed
   specimens at as-rolled and all annealed conditions. This is related to
   the higher amount of contraction twins and more < c+a > slips activated
   during HSR. Correlation of the maximum intensity of the basal texture
   with softening/recrystallization fraction was found to be involved in
   two weakening stages. During the first stage, nucleation on twins and
   shear bands was the dominant mechanism for texture weakening, while
   growth of the non-basal grains was responsible for the second stage of
   texture weakening. Interestingly, it was found that the weakest texture
   was attained after annealing at 500 degrees C for 5 min in the HSRed
   specimen, which can be related to thermal activation of more random
   nucleation sites and preferential grain growth of the non-basal oriented
   grains. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of sample produced by
   laser powder deposition using blended powders of Mar M247 and Amdry DF3
   were studied in the as-deposited and heat treated conditions. In the
   as-deposited condition, continuous (Cr, W) borides and gamma-Ni3B
   eutectics were observed to segregate in the interdendritic regions.
   After the two-step aging treatment, the low melting point gamma-Ni3B
   eutectics re-melted. Small size gamma-gamma' eutectics and discrete W
   borides formed during re-solidification. The gamma' strengthening phase
   that precipitated out homogeneously in the dendritic cores had an
   average diameter of 102 +/- 26 nm. When annealing was attempted before
   the aging treatment, both gamma-Ni3B eutectics and the surrounding
   dendrites re-melted, contributing to the coarsening of the gamma-gamma'
   eutectics and the discrete W borides. Gamma prime precipitates with
   average diameter of 106 30 nm were observed. This microstructure
   evolution from the re-melting of gamma-Ni3B eutectics and development of
   gamma-gamma' eutectics eradicated the risk of strain-age cracks during
   the two tested heat treatments by backfilling. The coarsening kinetics
   of gamma' precipitates in the two heat treated conditions was modeled
   and showed a good agreement with the experimental observation. The
   microhardness results showed that the as-deposited condition possessed
   the highest hardness attributed to the continuous feature of the
   secondary phases, while the two heat treated conditions presented
   similar hardness owing to the similar size and volume fraction of gamma'
   precipitates. The tensile test results at both ambient and elevated
   temperatures indicated that the two types of heat treatments increased
   the tensile properties, especially ductility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   for Between-Group Comparisons in fMRI}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely used to study
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity. However, the
   application of ICA in multi-group designs is not straightforward. We
   have recently developed a new method named ``shared and specific
   independent component analysis{''} (SSICA) to perform between-group
   comparisons in the ICA framework. SSICA is sensitive to extract those
   components which represent a significant difference in functional
   connectivity between groups or conditions, i.e., components that could
   be considered ``specific{''} for a group or condition. Here, we
   investigated the performance of SSICA on realistic simulations, and task
   fMRI data and compared the results with one of the state-of-the-art
   group ICA approaches to infer between-group differences. We examined
   SSICA robustness with respect to the number of allowable extracted
   specific components and between-group orthogonality assumptions.
   Furthermore, we proposed a modified formulation of the
   back-reconstruction method to generate group-level t-statistics maps
   based on SSICA results. We also evaluated the consistency and
   specificity of the extracted specific components by SSICA. The results
   on realistic simulated and real fMRI data showed that SSICA outperforms
   the regular group ICA approach in terms of reconstruction and
   classification performance. We demonstrated that SSICA is a powerful
   data-driven approach to detect patterns of differences in functional
   connectivity across groups/conditions, particularly in model-free
   designs such as resting-state fMRI. Our findings in task fMRI show that
   SSICA confirms results of the general linear model (GLM) analysis and
   when combined with clustering analysis, it complements GLM findings by
   providing additional information regarding the reliability and
   specificity of networks.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of interfacial screening on electron transfer (ET) at
   ultrashort time scales is theoretically investigated on redox active
   monolayers by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The charging current
   associated with the nanosecond screening process is an important
   experimental determinant in finding both the reorganization energy
   (lambda) and electronic coupling (vertical bar M vertical bar) through
   ultrafast methods. On the one hand, time dependent decay of the charging
   current mitigates its impact on the current contribution from faradaic
   processes, while on the other hand, allowing substantial decay
   translates into a reduced upper-bound of applicable scan rates, which
   are crucial for ultrafast characterization. Analysis of the decay in the
   charging current suggests that the desired screening may be achieved for
   relatively weakly coupled systems within the charging time constant. For
   weakly coupled systems, the scan rate corresponding to nanoscale
   charging time constants appears to be suitable for the ultrafast
   investigation of ET characteristics. Moreover, the level of screening
   achieved at nanosecond decay times is shown to change with the coverage
   of electrode surface by monolayers; which appears to be accompanied by
   sharp drops in the time constant during successive saturation of
   interfacial layers by supporting ions (SI). These observations are
   expected to help design electrochemical device systems with interfaces
   capable of high faradaic efficiency at ultrafast limits.}},

   significant generation of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (PFOA) at a
   yield of 30 mol \% by day 180. The biotransformation of perfluorooctane
   sulfonamide quaternary ammonium salt (PFOSAmS) was very slow with
   unobservable change of the spiked mass; yet the generation of
   perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) at a yield of 0.3 mol \% confirmed the
   biotransformation of PFOSAmS. Three novel biotransformation
   intermediates were identified for PFOAAmS and three products including
   perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) for PFOSAmS through high-resolution
   mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and t-MS2 fragmentation. The
   significantly slower PFOSAmS biotransformation is hypothesized to be due
   to its stronger sorption to soil owing to a longer perfluoroalkyl chain
   and a bulkier sulfonyl group, when compared to PFOAAmS. This study has
   demonstrated that despite overall high stability of QACs and their
   biocide nature, the ones with perfluoroalkyl chains can be substantially
   biotransformed into perfluoroalkyl acids in aerobic soil.}},

   demonstrated that within the wavelength range of 1555 nm to 1573 nm the

Abstract = {{Scheduling production in open-pit mines is characterized by uncertainty
   about the metal content of the orebody (the reserve) and leads to a
   complex large-scale mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem. In
   this paper, a two-phase solution approach based on Rockafellar and Wets'
   progressive hedging algorithm (PH) is proposed. PH is used in phase I
   where the problem is first decomposed by partitioning the set of
   scenarios modeling metal uncertainty into groups, and then the
   sub-problems associated with each group are solved iteratively to drive
   their solutions to a common solution. In phase II, a strategy exploiting
   information obtained during the PH iterations and the structure of the
   problem under study is used to reduce the size of the original problem,
   and the resulting smaller problem is solved using a sliding time window
   heuristic based on a fix-and-optimize scheme. Numerical results show
   that this approach is efficient in finding near-optimal solutions and
   that it outperforms existing heuristics for the problem under study. (C)

Abstract = {{Quantitative measurement of drug consumption biomarkers in wastewater
   can provide objective information on community drug use patterns and
   trends. This study presents the measurement of alcohol consumption in 20
   cities across 11 countries through the use of wastewater-based
   epidemiology (WBE), and reports the application of these data for the
   risk assessment of alcohol on a population scale using the margin of
   exposure (MOE) approach. Raw 24-h composite wastewater samples were
   collected over a one-week period from 20 cities following a common
   protocol. For each sample a specific and stable alcohol consumption
   biomarker, ethyl sulfate (EtS) was determined by liquid chromatography
   coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The EtS concentrations were used
   for estimation of per capita alcohol consumption in each city, which was
   further compared with international reports and applied for risk
   assessment by MOE. The average per capita consumption in 20 cities
   ranged between 6.4 and 44.3 L/day/1000 inhabitants. An increase in
   alcohol consumption during the weekend occurred in all cities, however
   the level of this increase was found to differ. In contrast to
   conventional data (sales statistics and interviews), WBE revealed
   geographical differences in the level and pattern of actual alcohol
   consumption at an inter-city level. All the sampled cities were in the
   ``high risk{''} category (MOE < 10) and the average MOE for the whole
   population studied was 2.5. These results allowed direct comparisons of
   alcohol consumption levels, patterns and risks among the cities. This
   study shows that WBE can provide timely and complementary information on
   alcohol use and alcohol associated risks in terms of exposure at the
   community level. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study develops a new size-dependent nonlinear model for the
   analysis of the behaviour of carbon nanotube-based resonators. In
   particular, based on modified couple stress theory, the fully nonlinear
   equations of motion of the carbon nanotube-based resonator are derived
   using Hamilton's principle, taking into account both the longitudinal
   and transverse displacements. Molecular dynamics simulation is then
   performed in order to verify the validity of the developed
   size-dependent continuum model at the nano scale. The nonlinear partial
   differential equations of motion of the system are discretized by means
   of the Galerkin technique, resulting in a high-dimensional reduced order
   model of the system. The pseudo-arclength continuation technique is
   employed to examine the nonlinear resonant behaviour of the carbon
   nanotube-based resonator. A new universal pull-in formula is also
   developed for predicting the occurrence of the static pull-in and
   validated using numerical simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present work, graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) were grown at both low
   and high levels of nitrogen functionalization and subsequently put
   through a wet-chemical method to add iron functionalities to the surface
   and create active catalyst centers. No mechanical treatments are used in
   order to minimize the formation of defects on the GNFs and evaluate if
   iron-nitrogen-GNF edges or surface sites can generate catalytic activity
   rather than the macropore structures holding these functionalities on
   porous carbon black. The catalysts produced under various synthesis
   routes were characterized and screened for their performance as an
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. Characterization included an
   electrochemical study, an examination of the carbon and nitrogen content
   and bonding structure, in addition to Raman analysis and the calculation
   of the BET surface areas. It was found that samples that were both
   treated with iron acetate and put through pyrolysis produced the most
   active samples. These samples were composed of graphitic carbon and
   contained a large amount of pyridinic nitrogen. Additionally, when
   working with GNFs generated with high levels of nitrogen, no extra
   nitrogen source was needed during the iron incorporation step. This
   study further develops the GNF-based catalyst already seen to be a
   suitable ORR catalyst for the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell.

Title = {{Use of an Enactive Insole for Reducing the Risk of Falling on Different
   Types of Soil Using Vibrotactile Cueing for the Elderly}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Our daily activities imply displacements on various types of soil. For
   persons with gait disorder or losing functional autonomy, walking on
   some types of soil could be challenging because of the risk of falling
   it represents.
   Methods
   In this paper, we present, in a first part, the use of an enactive shoe
   for an automatic differentiation of several types of soil. In a second
   part, using a second improved prototype (an enactive insole), twelve
   participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) and nine age-matched controls
   have performed the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test on six types of soil with
   and without cueing. The frequency of the cueing was set at 10\% above
   the cadence computed at the lower risk of falling (walking over the
   concrete). Depending on the cadence computed at the lower risk, the
   enactive insole activates a vibrotactile cueing aiming to improve gait
   and balance control. Finally, a risk index is computed using gait
   parameters in relation to given type of soil.
   Results
   The frequency analysis of the heel strike vibration allows the
   differentiation of various types of soil. The risk computed is
   associated to an appropriate rhythmic cueing in order to improve balance
   and gait impairment. The results show that a vibrotactile cueing could
   help to reduce the risk of falling.
   Conclusions
   Firstly, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the risk of
   falling while walking on different types of soil using vibrotactile
   cueing. We found a significant difference and a significant decrease in
   the computed risks of falling for most of types of soil especially for
   deformable soils which can lead to fall. Secondly, heel strike provides
   an approximation of the impulse response of the soil that can be
   analyzed with time and frequency-domain modeling. From these analyses,
   an index is computed enabling differentiation the types of soil.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been linked to cancer progression
   but are difficult to isolate, as they are very rare and heterogeneous,
   covering a range of sizes and expressing different molecular receptors.
   Filtration has emerged as a simple and powerful method to enrich CTCs
   but only captures cells above a certain size regardless of molecular
   characteristics. Here, we introduce antibody-functionalized microfilters
   to isolate CTCs based on both size and surface receptor expression. We
   present a 3D printed filtration cartridge with microfabricated polymer
   filters with 8, 10, 12, 15, or 20 mu m-diameter pores. Pristine filters
   were used to optimize sample dilution, rinsing protocol, flow rate, and
   pore size, leading to >80\% for the recovery of spiked cancer cells with
   very low white blood cell contamination (<1000). Then, filters were
   functionalized with antibodies against either epithelial cell adhesion
   molecule (EpCAM) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the
   cartridges were used to enrich breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7) and renal
   (786-O, A-498) cancer cells expressing various levels of EpCAM and EGFR.
   Cancer cells were spiked into human blood, and when using filters with
   antibodies specific to a molecular receptor expressed on a cell,
   efficiency was increased to >96\%. These results suggest that filtration
   can be optimized to target specific CTC characteristics such as size and
   receptor expression and that a diverse range of CTCs may be captured
   using particular combinations of pore size, filtration parameters, and
   antibody functionalization.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) and
   electrosterically stabilized nanocrystalline cellulose (ENCC), dissolved
   carboxylated cellulose (DCC), and a mixture of DCC and ENCC have been
   studied. ENCC can be produced by periodate, chlorite and TEMPO
   oxidations of cellulose fibers. It has a large surface area, a high
   carboxylated content and can be used as a high-performance reinforcement
   material. It is likely to effectively bind and flocculate with PCC to
   improve the properties of filled paper. Dissolved carboxylated cellulose
   (DCC) is produced together with ENCC in the oxidation reactions, and
   also has a high charge density.
   The flocculation of PCC induced by ENCC/DCC was measured by photometric
   dispersion analysis (PDA). It was demonstrated that ENCC or DCC adsorbed
   first on PCC particle surfaces due to electrostatic attractions, and
   subsequently ENCC or DCC induces flocculation between PCC. The repulsive
   electrostatic force reduces to zero when the isoelectric point of PCC
   particles is reached, allowing attractive van de Waals forces to
   dominate, resulting in maximum PCC flocculation. After the charge
   neutralization point was reached, more dissolved carboxylated cellulose
   adsorbed on the PCC particles, resulting in net negative charges on PCC
   surfaces, and dispersion of flocs due to electrostatic repulsion. For
   mixtures of dissolved carboxylated cellulose (DCC) and ENCC, DCC
   adsorbed faster on PCC than ENCC. Excess ENCC resulted in the exchange
   of DCC with ENCC, with ENCC particles able to bridge PCC. This mechanism
   was proved by photometric dispersion analysis and dynamic light
   scattering experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the nonlinear buckling and postbuckling
   characteristics of piezoelectric cylindrical nanoshells subjected to an
   axial compressive mechanical load and an electrical load in the presence
   of surface free energy effects. The electrical field is applied along
   the transverse direction. A size-dependent shell model is adopted based
   on the Gurtin-Murdoch elasticity theory and von Karman geometrical
   nonlinearity. To satisfy the balance conditions on the surfaces of the
   nanoshell, a linear variation is considered for the normal stress of the
   bulk through the thickness. A boundary layer theory is employed
   including surface energy effects in conjunction with the effects of
   nonlinear prebuckling deformation, large deflections in the postbuckling
   regime and initial geometrical imperfections. Afterwards, a two-stepped
   singular perturbation technique is employed to obtain the size-dependent
   critical buckling load and the associated postbuckling equilibriumpath
   for alternative electric loadings. It is found that the surface free
   energy and electrical load can cause an increase or decrease on the
   critical buckling load and the associated postbuckling strength of a
   nanoshell depending on the sign of surface properties and applied
   voltage. These anticipations are the same for the both perfect and
   imperfect piezoelectric nanoshells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A critical evaluation and thermodynamic modeling for thermodynamic
   properties of all oxide phases and phase diagrams in the Mn-O system are
   presented. Optimized Gibbs energy parameters for the thermodynamic
   models of the oxide phases were obtained which reproduce all available
   and reliable experimental data within error limits from 298 K (25
   degrees C) to above the liquidus temperature at compositions covering
   from MnO to MnO2, and oxygen partial pressure from 10(-15) to 10(2)
   (bar). The optimized thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams are
   believed to be the best estimates presently available. Two spinel phases
   (alpha- and beta-Mn3O4) were modeled using Compound Energy Formalism
   (CEF) with the use of physically meaningful parameters. Valence states
   of the spinels are interpreted based on the available thermopower
   measurement, for which Mn4+ was considered in the cubic spinel
   (beta-Mn3O4). The present Mn3O4 spinel solutions can be integrated into
   a larger spinel solution database, which has been already developed. The
   database of the model parameters can be used along with a software for
   Gibbs energy minimization in order to calculate any type of phase
   diagram sections and thermodynamic properties. (C) ASM International

Abstract = {{This paper presents an intelligent protection scheme for microgrid using
   combined wavelet transform and decision tree. The process starts at
   retrieving current signals at the relaying point and preprocessing
   through wavelet transform to derive effective features such as change in

   the features are extracted against faulted and unfaulted situations for
   each-phase, the data set is built to train the decision tree (DT), which
   is validated on the unseen data set for fault detection in the
   microgrid. Further, the fault classification task is carried out by
   including the wavelet based features derived from sequence components
   along with the features derived from the current signals. The new data
   set is used to build the DT for fault detection and classification. Both
   the DTs are extensively tested on a large data set of 3860 samples and
   the test results indicate that the proposed relaying scheme can
   effectively protect the microgrid against faulty situations, including

Abstract = {{Large amount of methane are released in the mining face area during
   active mining operation. To maintain safe working condition in the
   mining face and to maximize the potential usage of methane released from
   the mining face, an effective methane enhanced gas recovery strategy is
   essential. This study addresses the air flow and methane dispersion in
   the mining face and strategies to mitigate and enhance methane gas
   recovery for energy sources by using ventilation system. The
   investigated strategies involve installation of a suction duct and
   combination of brattice and suction duct. The aim is to collect
   methane-rich ventilation air via additional exhaust (suction) duct
   rather than disperse it and collect it later from the main exhaust
   shaft. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is utilized to
   investigate and examine the effectiveness of these strategies which will
   be evaluated in term of methane concentration in the mining face and at
   the outlet of suction duct. The effect of suction duct height, setback
   distance and suction velocity on the methane mitigation and recovery are
   also evaluated. The result indicates that suction-brattice configuration
   results in better methane control but yields lower methane concentration
   collected at the suction duct outlet. Among the studied parameters,
   suction velocity has significant influence while suction duct height and
   setback distance have marginal effect. The proposed strategies are
   potential to be applied in underground coal mine for methane mitigation
   and recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Clathrate hydrate promotion research has often focused on hydrate growth
   rate differentiation, however little work has been done to understand
   the kinetics of dissolution. The dissolution of gas into the bulk liquid
   phase is of great importance to hydrate growth, as it is the first step
   in hydrate formation. Furthermore, understanding the influence of
   additives on hydrate systems may provide significant insight into the
   mechanisms of their function. The effect of the hydrate promoter sodium
   dodecyl sulphate (SDS) on methane dissolution was thus investigated at
   the three-phase (H-Lw-V) equilibrium condition of 275.1 K and 3145 kPa.
   Experiments with concentrations of SDS ranging from 0.01 mM to 4 mM were
   conducted. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects on
   the methane equilibrium saturation values as well as the kinetics of
   dissolution. The effects on saturation were found to be negligible. The
   rate of dissolution was measured using a first-order response model and
   the time constant tau (tau). It was found that the values of tau for SDS
   increased with an increasing loading of 0.01 mM -0.75 mM and then
   plateaued for concentrations ranging between 0.75 and 4 mM producing a
   sigmoidal trend. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Longitudinal motion of the artery, a cyclical, bidirectional movement of
   the wall in the long axis of the artery, has recently gained interest in
   the characterization of artery function. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate longitudinal motion in patients with internal carotid
   atherosclerotic plaques. Speckle tracking ultrasound was used to assess
   common carotid artery wall motion in 12 patients with carotid plaque
   causing either moderate (50\%-79\%) or severe (80\%-99\%) stenosis based
   on the North American Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, and 23 healthy
   participants. Although healthy individuals were found to have a
   retrograde wall motion pattern, a distinct anterograde pattern was noted
   with plaque presence. Importantly, patients with severe plaque stenosis
   had greater anterograde motion (0.53 +/- 0.36 mm) than those with
   moderate stenosis (0.17 +/- 0.15 mm) (p < 0.05), likely owing to high
   wall shear stresses associated with greater peak systolic velocities at
   the site of stenosis (severe: 342.0 +/- 99.4 cm/s, moderate: 177.5 +/-
   31.2 cm/s, p < 0.01). There were no differences in peak systolic
   velocities at plaque-free segments between plaque groups (severe: 80.2
   +/- 24.8 cm/s, moderate: 92.7 +/- 23.0 cm/s). Blood flow at stenotic
   areas better predicted motion than plaque-free segments. We conclude
   that the presence of carotid plaque can have significant influence on
   longitudinal motion, with significantly greater anterograde
   displacements with increased stenosis. Future studies are needed to
   further investigate carotid artery wall mechanics. (E-mail: stella.

Abstract = {{Background: Despite technological advances, the accuracy of continuous
   glucose monitoring (CGM) systems may not always be satisfactory with
   rapidly changing glucose levels, as is notable during exercise. We
   compare the performance of two current and widely used CGM systems,
   Dexcom G4 Platinum (Dexcom) and Medtronic Paradigm Veo Enlite system
   (Enlite), during both rest and exercise in adults with type 1 diabetes
   (T1D).
   Research Design and Methods: Paired sensor and plasma glucose (PG)
   values (total of 431 data pairs for Dexcom and 425 for Enlite) were
   collected from 17 adults (37.3 +/- 13.6 years) with T1D. To evaluate and
   compare the accuracy of sensor readings, criteria involving sensor bias
   (sensor minus PG levels), absolute relative difference (ARD), and
   percentage of readings meeting International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) criteria were considered.
   Results: Both Dexcom and Enlite performed equally well during the rest
   period, with respective mean/median biases of -0.12/-0.02mmol/L versus
   -0.18/-0.40 (P = 0.78, P = 0.66) mmol/L and ARDs of 13.77/13.34\% versus
   12.38/11.95\% (P = 0.53, P = 0.70). During exercise, sensor bias
   means/medians were -0.40/-0.21 mmol versus -0.26/-0.24mmol/L (P = 0.67,
   P = 0.62) and ARDs were 22.53/15.13\% versus 20.44/14.11\% (P = 0.58, P
   = 0.68) for Dexcom and Enlite, respectively. Both sensors demonstrated
   significantly lower performance during exercise; median ARD comparison
   at rest versus exercise for both Dexcom and Enlite showed a P = 0.02.
   More data pairs met the ISO criteria for Dexcom and Enlite at rest,
   73.6\% and 76.9\% compared with exercise 48.2\% and 53.9\%.
   Conclusion: Dexcom and Enlite demonstrated comparable overall
   performances during rest and physical activity. However, a lower
   accuracy was observed during exercise for both sensors, necessitating a
   fine-tuning of their performance with physical activity.}},

Abstract = {{This numerical study investigated the effects of different reinforcing
   details in beam-column joints on the blast resistance of the joints. Due
   to increasing manmade and/or natural high rate accidents such as impacts
   and blasts, the resistance of critical civil and military infrastructure
   or buildings should be sufficiently obtained under those high rate
   catastrophic loads. The beam-column joint in buildings is one of
   critical parts influencing on the resistance of those buildings under
   extreme events such as earthquakes, impacts and blasts. Thus, the
   details of reinforcements in the joints should be well designed for
   enhancing the resistance of the joints under the events. Parameters
   numerically investigated in this study include diagonal, flexural, and
   shear reinforcing steel bars. The failure mechanism of the joints could
   be controlled by the level of tensile stress of reinforcing steel bars.
   Among various reinforcing details in the joints, diagonal reinforcement
   in the joints was found to be most effective for enhancing the
   resistance under blast loads. In addition, shear reinforcements also
   produced favourable effects on the blast resistance of beam-column
   joints.}},

Abstract = {{Thiol (SH)-terminated surfaces have been progressively gaining interest
   over the past years as a consequence of their widespread potential
   applications. Here, SH-terminated thin films have been prepared by
   ``co-polymerizing{''} gas mixtures comprising ethylene (C2H4) or
   butadiene (C4H6) with hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This has been accomplished
   by either vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation of the flowing gas
   mixtures with near-monochromatic radiation from a Kr lamp, or by
   low-pressure r.f. plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).
   Varying the gas mixture ratio, R, allows one to control the films'
   sulfur content as well as the thiol concentration {[}-SH]. The deposits
   were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), before and
   after chemical derivatization with N-ethylmaleimide, and by ATR FTIR.
   VUV- and plasma-prepared coatings were found to possess very similar
   structures and characteristics, showing chemically bonded sulfur
   concentrations, {[}S], up to 48 at\% and {[}-SH] up to 3\%. All coatings
   remained essentially unchanged in thickness after immersion in water for
   24 h.}},

Abstract = {{If transit agencies wish to retain and attract riders, they need to
   provide reliable and efficient services. Transit agencies tend to run
   high-frequency bus routes during peak hours, and in many cities,
   different routes can also overlap along major corridors. In some
   instances, consecutive buses can arrive at a shared stop simultaneously
   or one bus may arrive while another bus is currently servicing the stop.
   This phenomenon, known as bus bunching, can delay buses and passengers,
   and is usually inefficient. In this study, we attempt to understand how
   bus bunching from the same or different routes can impact bus
   operations, specifically dwell and running times. This research uses
   stop-level records obtained from automatic vehicle location (AVL) and
   automatic passenger counter (APC) systems from TriMet, Portland, OR.
   Using linear modeling, we find that bus bunching increases both dwell
   and running times. Specifically, when different routes bunch or are
   scheduled to arrive at a bus stop within a short time frame, or when
   buses from the same route arrive with a short time frame, dwell times
   increase by similar to 10 s. Similarly, bus bunching from the same route
   or different route prolongs running times by similar to 40 s. Our
   findings suggest that bus schedulers and operators should consider
   adding more time between consecutive buses from different routes at
   shared stops to minimize the negative impacts that we observed from bus
   bunching.}},

Journal = {{FOOD BIOSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Many plants which are rich in phenolic compounds possess several health
   benefits, such as preventing urinary tract infections, stomach ulcers,
   and dental diseases. These phenolic compounds are generally stable and
   bioactive when present in plants. However, they are prone to degradation
   after extraction, which is a challenge when processing foods.
   Encapsulation is a process where the compounds of interest are enveloped
   by one or a mixture of polymers referred as matrix materials. It
   protects phenolic compounds from a relatively rapid degradation and
   helps to control the release of these compounds. Proteins are natural
   food grade polymers which are used as encapsulating matrices and do have
   a wide range of applications, especially in the food industry. In this
   review, the major phenolic compounds that are present in plants are
   outlined. The encapsulation methods and recent researches performed to
   encapsulate phenolic compounds present in plants using protein matrices
   are critically discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is evaluate the influence of welding conditions on
   abrasive wear resistance in coating of Fe-Cr-C. The metal base used in
   this investigation was the steel SAE 1020 and as welded metal the
   selfshilded tubular wires of Fe-Cr-C with 1.6 mm of diameter. The
   welding parameter such as amperage, voltage, welding speed, wire feed
   speed and the distance between the point and samples were kept constant
   by varying the electrode inclination and the number of layers deposited.
   These resulted in four different weld conditions: pulling and pushing
   the weld pool and hardfacing formed with 1 end 2 layers. Their
   influences on dilution, microhardness and microstructure were evaluated
   and correlated with the abrasive wear according to the standard tests
   methods for abrasion measurements through the usage of dry sand/rubber
   wheel apparatus, ASTM G-65-04. The results showed that the wear
   resistance of the four different conditions was affected by dilution,
   microstructure morphology and carbide volume fraction. The best
   conditions for hardfacing deposition were for pushing the torch and two
   layers added.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dot (QD) sensitized TiO2 is considered as a highly promising
   photoanode material for photo electrochemical (PEC) solar hydrogen
   production. However, due to its limited stability, the photoanode
   suffers from degradation of its long-term PEC performance. Here, we
   report the design and characterization of a high-efficiency and
   long-term stable Pt-free PEC cell. The photoanode is composed of a
   mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle film sensitized with ``giant{''} core@shell
   QDs for PEC solar hydrogen generation. The thick shell enhances light
   absorption in the visible range, increases the stability of the QDs and
   does not inhibit charge separation, injection and transport, needed for
   proper operation of the device. We prepared thin films of Cu2S
   nanoflakes through a simple and reproducible procedure, and used them as
   counter-electrodes replacing the standard Pt film, resulting in
   equivalent performances of the PEC cell. We obtained an unprecedented
   photocurrent density (similar to 10 mA/cm(2)) for ``giant{''} QDs based
   PEC devices (and corresponding H-2 generation) and a very promising
   stability, indicating that the proposed cell architecture is a good
   candidate for long-term stable QD-based PEC solar hydrogen generation.

   the aqueous leaching-alcohol precipitation method, and the morphological
   and thermal degradation characteristics of the amylose and amylopectin
   obtained were studied. A comparison of the results of acid-catalysed
   hydrolysis of the original starch and the fractions showed that
   differences in granule size, solubility, and susceptibility to acid
   hydrolysis are the main factors affecting LA yields. Amylopectin yielded
   LA at faster rates at 150 and 165 degrees C than amylose, which is a
   factor that may influence the selection of starches for the production

Abstract = {{In this paper, Lagrange's equations along with the Ritz method are used
   to obtain the equation of motion for a flexible, slender cylinder
   subjected to axial flow. The cylinder is supported only by a
   translational and a rotational spring at the upstream end, and at the
   free end, it is terminated by a tapering end-piece. The equation of
   motion is solved numerically for a system in which the translational
   spring is infinitely stiff, thus acting as a pin, while the stiffness of
   the rotational spring is generally non-zero. The dynamics of such a
   system with the rotational spring of an average stiffness is described
   briefly. Moreover, the effects of the length of the cylinder and the
   shape of the end-piece on the critical flow velocities and the modal
   shapes of the unstable modes are investigated.}},

Title = {{On the Convergence of Alternating Direction Lagrangian Methods for
   Nonconvex Structured Optimization Problems}},

Abstract = {{Nonconvex and structured optimization problems arise in many engineering
   applications that demand scalable and distributed solution methods. The
   study of the convergence properties of these methods is, in general,
   difficult due to the nonconvexity of the problem. In this paper, two
   distributed solution methods that combine the fast convergence
   properties of augmented Lagrangian-based methods with the separability
   properties of alternating optimization are investigated. The first
   method is adapted from the classic quadratic penalty function method and
   is called the alternating direction penalty method (ADPM). Unlike the
   original quadratic penalty function method, where single-step
   optimizations are adopted, ADPM uses an alternating optimization which,
   in turn, makes it scalable. The second method is the well-known
   alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). It is shown that
   ADPM for nonconvex problems asymptotically converges to a primal
   feasible point under mild conditions and an additional condition
   ensuring that it asymptotically reaches the standard first-order
   necessary conditions for local optimality is introduced. In the case of
   the ADMM, novel sufficient conditions under which the algorithm
   asymptotically reaches the standard first-order necessary conditions are
   established. Based on this, complete convergence of the ADMM for a class
   of low-dimensional problems is characterized. Finally, the results are
   illustrated by applying ADPM and ADMM to a nonconvex localization
   problem in wireless-sensor networks.}},

   characterize the optimal power allocation of the cellular links to
   transform the original resource allocation problem into the joint
   subchannel and power allocation problem for D2D links. We then propose
   three resource allocation algorithms with different complexity levels,
   namely, dual-based, branch-and-bound (BnB), and relaxation-based
   rounding (RBR) algorithms. While the dual-based algorithm solves the
   problem by using the dual decomposition method, the BnB and RBR
   algorithms tackle the problem by employing the relaxation approach. We
   establish the strong performance guarantees for the proposed algorithms
   through theoretical analysis. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a channel code for vector perturbation (VP) precoded

   applying a semi-analytic technique based on extrinsic information

   BICM-ID-based VP precoded system, and we compare it with the sum
   capacity of the dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme. Our investigation shows
   that under perfect channel state information (CSI), the sum rate of the
   proposed system grows linearly over the number of users, which is the
   same growth of the DPC. Under quantized CSI and finite-rate feedback, a
   linear increase in feedback overhead per user is necessary to maintain
   such a linear sum-rate growth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an analog-to-stochastic converter using a magnetic
   tunnel junction (MTJ) device for vision chips based on stochastic
   computation. Stochastic computation has been recently exploited for
   area-efficient hardware implementation, such as low-density parity-check
   decoders and image processors. However, power-and-area hungry two-step
   (analog-to-digital and digital-to-stochastic) converters are required
   for the analog to stochastic signal conversion. To realize a one-step
   conversion, an MTJ device is used as it inherently exhibits a
   probabilistic switching behavior between two resistance states.
   Exploiting the device-based probabilistic behavior, analog signals can
   be directly and area efficiently converted to stochastic signals to
   mitigate the signal-conversion overhead. The analog-to-stochastic signal
   conversion is theoretically described and the conversion characteristic
   is evaluated using device and circuit parameters. In addition, the
   resistance variability of the MTJ device is considered in order to
   compensate the variability effect on the signal conversion. Based on the
   theoretical analysis, the analog-to-stochastic converter is designed in
   90-nm CMOS and 100-nm MTJ technologies and is verified using a SPICE
   simulator (NS-SPICE) that handles both transistors and MTJ devices.}},

Abstract = {{License plate recognition (LPR) sensors are embedded camera systems that
   monitor road traffic. When a vehicle passes by a sensor, the vehicle's
   license plate, the location, and the time of observation are recorded.
   Given a stream of such observations from a collection of sensors spread
   around the road network, our goal is to detect convoys: groups of two or
   more vehicles traveling with highly correlated trajectories. Some of the
   main challenges with modeling and processing data from LPR sensors
   include that the data-gathering process is event-driven, thus data are
   not regularly sampled in time or space. Also, an appropriate definition
   of convoy should be relative to background traffic patterns, which are
   temporally and spatially varying. This paper proposes novel models for
   LPR observations of traffic which are well suited for online convoy
   detection. Baseline traffic is modeled as following a mixture of
   semi-Markov processes, and specific models for temporal and spatial
   correlation of observations of vehicles traveling in a convoy are
   introduced. These models are used within a sequential hypothesis testing
   framework to obtain a system for real-time convoy detection. The model
   of baseline traffic may be of independent interest for forecasting road
   traffic patterns. Experiments with an extensive simulated dataset
   illustrate the performance of the scheme and offer insights into the
   tradeoffs between detection rate, false alarm rate, and the expected
   number of observations required to detect a convoy.}},

Abstract = {{We consider hybrid automatic repeat and request (HARQ) schemes in the
   uplink of a multicell multiuser single-input multiple-output system with
   large-scale antenna arrays at the base station (BS) for improving the
   spectral efficiency while limiting the number of retransmissions.
   Assuming a zero-forcing receiver at each BS and that each BS knows only
   the channel gains of users in its own cell, we derive the expressions
   for the outage probability and long-term average transmission rate
   (LATR) of the Type-I HARQ, HARQ with chase-combining (HARQ-CC), and HARQ
   with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR). We then formulate the optimal
   rateselection problems for the three schemes and provide methods to find
   a solution. Since the optimal-rate selection methods for the HARQ-CC and
   HARQ-IR schemes are computationally intensive, we propose sub-optimal
   rate-selection methods, which yield a closer LATR performance to that of
   the optimal methods. For the Type-I HARQ and HARQ-IR, we also present a
   parameterization-based method showing the approximate relation between
   the expressions of the optimized-LATR, optimal rate, and number of
   antennas. Illustrative results show that the HARQ-IR has significant
   gain over HARQ-CC and Type-I HARQ in terms of LATR, while Type-I HARQ
   yields practically similar performance to HARQ-CC as the number of
   antennas at the BS increase.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine whether patients
   undergoing the Ross procedure with bicuspid aortic valves have pulmonary
   artery biomechanical properties different from those with tricuspid
   valves.
   METHODS: Thirty-two pulmonary arteries and 20 aortas were obtained from
   patients undergoing the Ross procedure at the time of surgery, from a
   cohort of 32 patients. The aortic valve was tricuspid in 5 patients
   (16\%), bicuspid in 18 patients (56\%) and unicuspid in 9 patients
   (28\%). Histological analysis and ex vivo equi-biaxial tensile testing
   completed within 8 hours of surgery were used to evaluate differences in
   patient groups and between the pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta.
   RESULTS: There was no difference in thickness among pulmonary arteries
   when compared according to aortic valve phenotype (P = 0.94). There was
   no difference in the tensile tissue properties among aortas and
   pulmonary arteries when compared according to aortic valve phenotype, in
   either the circumferential or longitudinal axis. When compared according
   to the main surgical indication, pulmonary artery walls from patients
   with pure aortic regurgitation were less stiff than their counterparts
   (aortic regurgitation: 0.055 +/- 0.037 MPa, aortic stenosis: 0.103 +/-
   0.051 MPa, mixed disease: 0.110 +/- 0.044 MPa and aortic valve
   endocarditis: 0.216 +/- 0.033 MPa, P = 0.002). There was no difference
   in the number of elastic lamellae in pulmonary artery specimens from the
   three different aortic valve phenotypes, as well as in the aortic
   specimens.
   CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed in the
   biomechanical properties of pulmonary arteries when compared according
   to aortic valve phenotype.}},

Title = {{Cocaine cue-induced dopamine release in the human prefrontal cortex}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Background Accumulating evidence indicates that drug-related cues can
   induce dopamine (DA) release in the striatum of substance abusers.
   Whether these same cues provoke DA release in the human prefrontal
   cortex remains unknown.
   Methods We used high-resolution positron emission tomography with
   {[}F-18]fallypride to measure cortical and striatal DA D2/3 receptor
   availability in the presence versus absence of drug-related cues in
   volunteers with current cocaine dependence.
   Results Twelve individuals participated in our study. Among participants
   reporting a craving response (9 of 12), exposure to the cocaine cues
   significantly decreased {[}F-18]fallypride binding potential (BPND)
   values in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and striatum. In all 12
   participants, individual differences in the magnitude of craving
   correlated with BPND changes in the medial orbitofrontal cortex,
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and striatum.
   Consistent with the presence of autoreceptors on mesostriatal but not
   mesocortical DA cell bodies, midbrain BPND values were significantly
   correlated with changes in BPND within the striatum but not the cortex.
   The lower the midbrain D2 receptor levels, the greater the striatal
   change in BPND and self-reported craving.
   Limitations Limitations of this study include its modest sample size,
   with only 2 female participants. Newer tracers might have greater
   sensitivity to cortical DA release.
   Conclusion In people with cocaine use disorders, the presentation of
   drug-related cues induces DA release within cortical and striatal
   regions. Both effects are associated with craving, but only the latter
   is regulated by midbrain autoreceptors. Together, the results suggest
   that cortical and subcortical DA responses might both influence
   drug-focused incentive motivational states, but with separate regulatory
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The human vocal folds (VFs) undergo complex biomechanical stimulation
   during phonation. The aim of the present study was to develop and
   validate a phono-mimetic VF flow perfusion bioreactor, which mimics the
   mechanical microenvironment of the human VFs in vitro. The bioreactor
   uses airflow-induced self-oscillations, which have been shown to produce
   mechanical loading and contact forces that are representative of human
   phonation. The bioreactor consisted of two synthetic VF replicas within
   a silicone body. A cell-scaffold mixture (CSM) consisting of human VF
   fibroblasts, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, and a polyethylene glycol
   cross-linker was injected into cavities within the replicas. Cell
   culture medium (CCM) was perfused through the scaffold by using a
   customized secondary flow loop. After the injection, the bioreactor was
   operated with no stimulation over a 3-day period to allow for cell
   adaptation. Phonation was subsequently induced by using a variable speed
   centrifugal blower for 2 h each day over a period of 4 days. A similar
   bioreactor without biomechanical stimulation was used as the
   nonphonatory control. The CSM was harvested from both VF replicas 7 days
   after the injection. The results confirmed that the phono-mimetic
   bioreactor supports cell viability and extracellular matrix proteins
   synthesis, as expected. Many scaffold materials were found to degrade
   because of challenges from phonation-induced biomechanical stimulation
   as well as due to biochemical reactions with the CCM. The bioreactor
   concept enables future investigations of the effects of different
   phonatory characteristics, that is, voice regimes, on the behavior of
   the human VF cells. It will also help study the long-term functional
   outcomes of the VF-specific biomaterials before animal and clinical
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a collaborative optimization
   framework in combination with a variable-complexity modeling technique
   for the multidisciplinary coupling analysis and design of a shrouded
   turbine blade. The multidisciplinary optimization design of the shrouded
   turbine blade involves a high-fidelity detailed computational model and
   medium-fidelity models, which can become prohibitively expensive. In
   this investigation, a variable-complexity modeling methodology is
   introduced, where low-fidelity models and a scaling function are used to
   approximate the medium-and high-fidelity models through the optimizers
   in an inner-loop optimization to reduce computational expense. The
   optimization framework developed includes the collaborative optimization
   process, parametric modeling of the shrouded turbine blade,
   fluid-structure interaction solver using arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
   formulation, an adaptive hexahedral structure mesh generator by
   establishing virtual blocks and parametric fixed points, and a
   variable-complexity modeling method combining the multiplicative and
   additive corrections to manage three levels of fidelity models. On the
   shrouded turbine-blade design problem, it achieves a feasible optimizer
   only calling nine high-fidelity analyses. Response surface model
   variation and cross-validation tests are performed to verify the
   predictive power of the response surface model in the multidisciplinary
   design optimization process of the shrouded turbine blade.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative governance entails a shift in emphasis from government
   control toward voluntary arrangements directly involving non-state
   stakeholders in decision-making. However, the sources of legitimacy for
   novel institutions such as collaborative water governance remain
   unclear. Three levels of decision-making that are highly relevant to
   understanding legitimacy in these contexts are identified and used to
   assess the legitimacy of collaborative water governance in Quebec,
   Canada. Using Beetham's dimensions of legitimacy - legality,
   justification and consent - the sources and deficits of legitimacy are
   identified through 35 in-person interviews with local stakeholders,
   watershed organization staff and provincial policy-makers. Findings
   illustrate the diverse sources of legitimacy, but also a disconnect
   between what constitutes legitimacy according to local stakeholders and
   the provincial government. Deficits in legitimacy include lack of
   implementation, misfit between collaborative governance and existing
   representative government, and lack of consent from the Quebec
   government. However, although collaborative governance may not be
   appropriate for all contexts, it addresses important social needs that
   government cannot and therefore has high potential to complement the
   roles of existing institutions. Providing several novel insights, this
   multi-level perspective illustrates how legitimacy can be used to
   understand the challenges of complex sociological phenomena such as
   collaborative governance.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a family of architectures for polar decoders
   using a reduced-complexity successive-cancellation decoding algorithm
   that employs unrolling to achieve extremely high throughput values while
   retaining moderate implementation complexity. The resulting
   fully-unrolled, deeply-pipelined architecture is capable of achieving a
   coded throughput in excess of 1 Tbps on a 65 nm ASIC at 500 MHz-three
   orders of magnitude greater than current state-of-the-art polar
   decoders. However, unrolled decoders are built for a specific, fixed
   code. Therefore we also present a new method to enable the use of
   multiple code lengths and rates in a fully-unrolled polar decoder
   architecture. This method leads to a length-and rate-flexible decoder
   while retaining the very high speed typical to unrolled decoders. The
   resulting decoders can decode a master polar code of a given rate and
   length, and several shorter codes of different rates and lengths. We
   present results for two versions of a multi-mode decoder supporting
   eight and ten different polar codes, respectively. Both are capable of a
   peak throughput of 25.6 Gbps. For each decoder, the energy efficiency
   for the longest supported polar code is shown to be of 14.8 pJ/bit at
   250 MHz and of 8.8 pJ/bit at 500 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States' Corn Belt, conversion of tile-drained fields under
   a corn (Zea tizays L.) soybean (Glycine max {[}L.] Merr.) rotation to
   pastureland or prairie has significantly improved environmental quality,
   but may have altered the local hydrologic cycle: A recently developed
   rangeland management tool, the Great Plains Framework for Agricultural
   Resource Management in Rangelands (GPFARM-Range) model was calibrated
   with measured data (2006 to 2009) to simulate the hydrologic cycle of
   subsurface drained pastureland and thereafter predict the potential
   impacts of climate change on the hydrologic cycle. Soil water content
   and tile drainage flow data were collected (2006 to 2009) from
   subsurface drained pastureland plots near Gilmore City, Iowa, which had
   been converted from a corn soybean rotation in 2005. The model does not
   have a tile drainage module, therefore, simulated water seepage below
   the root zone was compared with measured tile flow. Based on the
   percentage of bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), and
   index of agreement (IoA), the GPFARM-Range model was found to be
   accurate in simulating both annual subsurface drainage (PBIAS = 1.2\%,
   NSE = 0.76, and IoA = 0.91) and soil water storage (PBIAS = 0.54\%, NSE
   = 0.74, and IoA = 0.91). Due to the lack of a formal tile drainage
   module, the timing of drainage on a monthly basis was not well
   simulated. Compared to the. hydrologic cycle under historical climate,
   the simulation demonstrated 13.9\% increase in subsurface drainage and
   1.9\% increase in evapotranspiration (ET) under a climate change regime
   (from 2045 to 2064). This study suggests that, after parameterization,
   the GPFARM-Range model can be used to estimate water balance on a yearly
   basis for a tile-drained pastureland, but that a tile drainage module is
   needed to improve the model performance in predicting tile flow in a
   timely manner.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing focus on the development of bioactive scaffolds for
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine that mimic the native
   nanofibrillar extracellular matrix. Solution blow spinning (SBS) is a
   rapid, simple technique that produces nanofibers with open fiber
   networks for enhanced cell infiltration. In this work, highly porous
   bioactive fibers were produced by combining SBS with thermally induced
   phase separation. Fibers composed of poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) and
   dimethyl carbonate were sprayed directly into a cryogenic environment
   and subsequently lyophilized, rendering them highly porous. The surface
   areas of the porous fibers were an order of magnitude higher in
   comparison with smooth control fibers of the same diameter (43.5
   m(2).g(-1) for porous fibers produced from 15\% w/v PLA in dimethyl
   carbonate) and exhibited elongated surface pores. Macroporous scaffolds
   were produced by spraying water droplets simultaneously with fiber
   formation, creating a network of fibers and ice microspheres, which act
   as in situ macroporosifiers. Subsequent lyophilization resulted in
   three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds formed of porous nanofibers with
   interconnected macropores due to the presence of the ice spheres.
   Nanobioactive glass was incorporated for the production of 3D
   macroporous, bioactive, therapeutic-ion-releasing scaffolds with
   potential applications in non-load-bearing bone tissue engineering. The
   bioactive characteristics of the fibers were assessed in vitro through
   immersion in simulated body fluid. The release of soluble silica ions
   was faster for the porous fibers within the first 24 h, with
   confirmation of hydroxyapatite on the fiber surface within 84 h.}},

Title = {{Agricultural robots for field operations: Concepts and components}},
Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{94-111}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This review investigates the research effort, developments and
   innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, and the
   associated concepts, principles, limitations and gaps. Robots are highly
   complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated
   and correctly synchronised to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and
   successfully transfer the required information. Extensive research has
   been conducted on the application of robots and automation to a variety
   of field operations, and technical feasibility has been widely
   demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to
   operate in unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality
   of work achieved by current methods and means. To assimilate robotic
   systems, technologies must be developed to overcome continuously
   changing conditions and variability in produce and environments.
   Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such
   environments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being
   inherently safe and reliable human safety, and preservation of the
   environment, the crop and the machinery are mandatory. Despite much
   progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not yet
   commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including
   sensors, fusion algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the
   dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments. Intensive
   research is needed on integrating human operators into the system
   control loop for increased system performance and reliability. System
   sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and
   components. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and
   execute agricultural tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary
   sensors for adequate localisation and sensing abilities, developing
   simple manipulators for each agricultural task, developing path
   planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments
   besides open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators
   in this complex and highly dynamic situation. Crown Copyright (C) 2016

Title = {{Classification of Rockburst in Underground Projects: Comparison of Ten
   Supervised Learning Methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Rockburst prediction is of crucial importance to the design and
   construction of many underground projects. Insufficient knowledge, lack
   of characterizing information, and noisy data restrain rock mechanics
   engineers from achieving optimal prediction results. In this paper, a
   data set of 246 rockburst events was examined for rockburst
   classification using supervised learning (SL) methods. The data set was
   analyzed with 8 potentially relevant indicators. Eleven algorithms from
   10 categories of SL algorithms were evaluated for their ability to learn
   rockburst, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
   discriminant analysis (QDA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis
   (PLSDA), naive Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer
   perceptron neural network (MLPNN), classification tree (CT), support
   vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient-boosting machine
   (GBM). The data set was randomly split into two parts: training (70\%)
   and test (30\%). A 10-fold cross-validation (CV) method was applied
   during modeling, and an external testing set was employed to validate
   the prediction performance of the SL models. Two accuracy measures for
   multiclass problems were employed: classification rate and Cohen's
   Kappa. The accuracy analysis, together with Cohen's kappa and a
   nonparametric statistical test for the rockburst data set, revealed that
   the best models for the prediction of rockburst were GBM and RF when
   compared with other learning algorithms. (C) 2016 American Society of

Abstract = {{The effective scheduling of irrigation requires knowledge of a crop's
   consumptive water use according to its metabolic activities. Conversely,
   to know a crop's consumptive water use, one must know its exact
   evapotranspiration (ET) rate. Although the United Nations' Food and
   Agricultural Organization (FAO) has recommended using the standard
   Penman-Monteith method to determine crop ET (ETcrop), the method's
   intricacies render it impractical to use in the field in predicting
   agricultural and irrigation requirement-based water needs. The present
   study investigated the use of a new approach, extreme learning machines
   (ELMs), for estimating ETcrop using climatic variables such as
   temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, sunshine hours, and wind
   speed. ELM is a single, hidden layer, feed-forward network that provides
   a unified learning platform with widespread types of feature mappings.
   It can also be applied in regression. This study compares results
   obtained using the standard Penman-Monteith method, ELM, artificial
   neural networks (ANNs), genetic programming (GP), and support vector
   machines (SVMs). Results suggest that ELM can predict ET more quickly
   and accurately than all other techniques tested. An ELM with sigmoid
   transfer function predicted ET with greater accuracy than a hard limit
   transfer function.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation of vegetable oils is generally treated as an apparent
   first order kinetic reaction. This study investigated the deterioration
   of crude palm oil (CPO), refined canola oil (RCO) and their blend
   (CPO:RCO 1:1 w/w) during 20 h of successive deep-fat frying at 170, 180
   and 190 A degrees C. Kinetics of changes in oil quality indices, namely,
   free fatty acid (FFA), peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (p-AV),
   total polar compounds (TPC) and color index (CI) were monitored. The
   results showed that FFA and PV accumulation followed the kinetic first
   order model, while p-AV, TPC and CI followed the kinetic zero order
   model. The concentration and deterioration rate constants k, increased
   with increasing temperatures. This effect of temperature was modeled by
   the Arrhenius equation. The results showed that PV had the least
   activation energies E (a) (kJ/mol) values of 5.4 +/- 1 (RCO), 6.6 +/-
   0.7 (CPO) and 11.4 +/- 1 (blend). The highest E (a) requirement was
   exhibited by FFA with a range of 31.7 +/- 3-76.5 +/- 7 kJ/mol for the
   three oils. The overall E (a) values showed that the stability of the
   blend was superior and not just intermediate of CPO and RCO. The
   correlation of the other oil quality indices with TPC indicated a
   positive linear correlation. The p-AV displayed the strongest
   correlation, with mean correlation coefficient r (s) of 0.998 +/- 0.00,
   0.994 +/- 0.00 and 0.999 +/- 0.00 for CPO, RCO and blend, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Plants must meet mechanical as well as physiological and reproductive
   requirements for survival. Management of internal and external stresses
   is achieved through their unique hierarchical architecture. Stiffness is
   determined by a combination of morphological (geometrical) and
   compositional variables that vary across multiple length scales ranging
   from the whole plant to organ, tissue, cell and cell wall levels. These
   parameters include, among others, organ diameter, tissue organization,
   cell size, density and turgor pressure, and the thickness and
   composition of cell walls. These structural parameters and their
   consequences on plant stiffness are reviewed in the context of work on
   stems of the genetic reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis),
   and the suitability of Arabidopsis as a model system for consistent
   investigation of factors controlling plant stiffness is put forward.
   Moving beyond Arabidopsis, the presence of morphological parameters
   causing stiffness gradients across length-scales leads to beneficial
   emergent properties such as increased load-bearing capacity and
   reversible actuation. Tailoring of plant stiffness for old and new
   purposes in agriculture and forestry can be achieved through
   bioengineering based on the knowledge of the morphological and
   compositional parameters of plant stiffness in combination with gene
   identification through the use of genetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies investigating patients with schizophrenia often
   report appreciable volumetric reductions and cortical thinning, yet the
   cause of these deficits is unknown. The association between subcortical
   and cortical structural alterations, and glutamatergic neurometabolites
   is of particular interest due to glutamate's capacity for neurotoxicity;
   elevated levels may be related to neuroanatomical compromise through an
   excitotoxic process. To this end, we explored the relationships between
   glutamatergic neurometabolites and structural measures in
   antipsychotic-naive patients experiencing their first non-affective
   episode of psychosis (FEP). Sixty antipsychoticnaive patients with FEP
   and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent a magnetic
   resonance imaging session, which included a T1-weighted volumetric image
   and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the precommissural dorsal
   caudate. Group differences in precommissural caudate volume (PCV) and
   cortical thickness (CT), and the relationships between glutamatergic
   neurometabolites (ie, glutamate+glutamine (Glx) and glutamate) and these
   structural measures, were examined. PCV was decreased in the FEP group
   (p<0.001), yet did not differ when controlling for total brain volume.
   Cortical thinning existed in the FEP group within frontal, parietal,
   temporal, occipital, and limbic regions at a 5\% false discovery rate.
   Glx levels were negatively associated with PCV only in the FEP group (p
   = 0.018). The observed relationship between Glx and PCV in the FEP group
   is supportive of a focal excitotoxic mechanism whereby increased levels
   of glutamatergic markers are related to local structural losses. This
   process may be related to the prominent structural deficits that exist
   in patients with schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of hydrogen charging on the mechanical response of FCC Ni
   and Pd under nanoindentation are systematically investigated by
   molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations consider a random H
   distribution and time scales prevent any diffusion of H during the
   simulations. Hydrogen charging is then found to reduce the threshold
   load for dislocation nucleation, i.e., the pop-in load, but only to a
   limited extent. After pop-in, the indentation response is largely
   independent of the presence of H. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen
   charging on the pop-in load originates only from the hydrogen-induced
   swelling of the lattice. That is, H does not directly influence
   dislocation nucleation, either in terms of facilitating initial slip or
   interacting with the nascent dislocation(s). These findings suggest that
   rate dependent processes, either associated with fluctuating nucleation
   or H transport, are necessary to interpret experimental observations of
   hydrogen-influenced reductions in the pop-in load. (C) 2016 Acta

Abstract = {{Microbial etiology for anti-osteoclastic drug-related osteonecrosis of
   the jaw (ARONJ) was suggested. This study investigates any link between
   bacteria colonizing ARONJ sites and other oral cavity sites. Microbiota
   samples of 10 ARONJ patients were collected from the exposed bone,
   adjacent teeth, contralateral teeth, and tongue. DNA checker-board
   hybridization was used for microbiota analysis with 43 genomic DNA
   probes prepared from humanoral bacterial (38) and candida (5) species,
   using Socransky's bacterial complexes as a guide. The frequency and the
   mean proportion of each bacterial species were used. Eikenella
   corrodens, Streptococcus constellatus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were
   dominant in the ARONJ sites and detected in most teeth samples.
   Staphylococcus aureus was also dominant in the ARONJ sites and tongue.
   Significant correlations were found between the mean proportions of
   bacterial species colonizing adjacent teeth, contralateral teeth, and
   tongue (p < 0.001, R-2 > 0.69). No significant correlation (p > 0.05,
   R-2 < 0.025) was found between bacteria colonizing ARONJ sites and other
   evaluated sites. Within the study limitations, it was concluded that the
   primary sources of microorganisms colonizing ARONJ sites could be other
   sites such as teeth and tongue. The microbial profile of the necrotic
   bone is predominantly colonized with bacteria from Socransky's green and
   orange complexes, as well as with species associated with bone
   infections.}},

Title = {{Information-seeking behaviour and information needs of LGBTQ health
   professionals: a follow-up study}},
Journal = {{HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{204-221}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundExcept for one study in 2004, the literature has no data on
   the information-seeking behaviour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
   and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) health professionals. After a decade of
   change for LGBTQ people, and the growth of electronic information
   sources and social networks, it is appropriate to revisit this subject.
   ObjectivesTo gain an updated understanding of the information-seeking
   behaviour of LGBTQ health professionals and of how medical libraries can
   provide a culturally competent service to such users.
   MethodsA mixed-methods approach was adopted combining a Web-based
   questionnaire with email follow-up discussions. One hundred and
   twenty-three complete responses were received, mostly from the USA and
   Canada, between November 2012 and October 2013.
   ResultsLGBTQ health professionals remain more comfortable seeking LGBTQ
   health information from a medical librarian whom they know to be LGBTQ
   because they perceive LGBTQ librarians as more likely to have specialist
   knowledge, or through concern that non-LGBTQ librarians may be more
   likely to react in a stigmatising or discriminatory way. The study also
   provides evidence suggesting that online chat has marginal appeal for
   respondents seeking LGBTQ health information, despite its anonymity.
   Medical libraries seeking to demonstrate their cultural competency
   should provide visible evidence of this, such as through the creation of
   dedicated resource lists, promotion of LGBTQ literature on the library's
   website, and display of other symbols or statements supporting
   diversity.
   ConclusionOpportunities exist for LGBTQ health professionals and medical
   librarians to work together to ensure that medical libraries are
   culturally competent and welcoming spaces for LGBTQ patrons, that
   library collections match their needs, and in the creation of guides to
   ensure maximum access to the results of LGBTQ health research. Medical
   libraries should also consider nominating and, if necessary, training a
   specialist in LGBTQ health information. Such measures are more likely to
   be successful than reliance on online chat, despite contrary suggestions
   in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the multiuser multiple-input single-output
   (MISO) interference channel where the received signal is divided into
   two parts for information decoding and energy harvesting (EH),
   respectively. The transmit beamforming vectors and receive power
   splitting (PS) ratios are jointly designed in order tominimize the total
   transmission power subject to both signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio (SINR) and EH constraints. Most joint beamforming and power
   splitting (JBPS) designs assume that perfect channel state information
   (CSI) is available; however CSI errors are inevitable in practice. To
   overcome this limitation, we study the robust JBPS design problem
   assuming a norm-bounded error (NBE) model for the CSI. Three different
   solution approaches are proposed for the robust JBPS problem, each one
   leading to a different computational algorithm. Firstly, an efficient
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based approach is presented to solve the
   highly non-convex JBPS problem, where the latter can be formulated as a
   semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. A rank-one recovery method is
   provided to recover a robust feasible solution to the original problem.
   Secondly, based on second order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation, we
   propose a low complexity approach with the aid of a closed-form robust
   solution recovery method. Thirdly, a new iterative method is also
   provided which can achieve near-optimal performance when the SDR-based
   algorithm results in a higher-rank solution. We prove that this
   iterative algorithm monotonically converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
   (KKT) solution of the robust JBPS problem. Finally, simulation results
   are presented to validate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at analysing the nonlinear size-dependent dynamics of a
   microcantilever based on the modified couple stress theory. Since one
   end of the microcantilever is free to move, the system undergoes large
   deformations; this necessitates the application of a nonlinear theory
   which is capable of taking into account curvature-related and inertial
   related nonlinearities. The expressions for the kinetic and potential
   energies are developed on the basis of the modified couple stress
   theory. The energy terms are balanced by the work of a base excitation
   by means of Hamilton's principle, yielding the continuous model for the
   system motion. Based on a weighted-residual method, this continuous
   model is reduced and then solved via an eigenvalue analysis (for the
   linear analysis) and a continuation method (for the nonlinear analysis);
   stability analysis is performed via the Floquet theory. It is shown that
   each source of nonlinearity, in the presence of the length-scale
   parameter, has a significant effect on the system dynamics. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, the nonlinear size-dependent static and dynamic
   behaviours of a microelectromechanical system under an electric
   excitation are investigated. A microcantilever is considered for the
   modelling of the deformable electrode of the MEMS. The governing
   equation of motion is derived based on the modified couple stress theory
   (MCST), a non-classical model capable of capturing small-size effects.
   With the aid of a high-dimensional Galerkin scheme, the nonlinear
   partial differential equation governing the motion of the deformable
   electrode is converted into a reduced-order model of the system. Then,
   the pseudo-arclength continuation technique is used to solve the
   governing equations. In order to investigate the static behaviour and
   static pull-in instabilities, the system is excited only by the
   electrostatic actuation (i.e., a DC voltage). The results obtained for
   the static pull-in instability predicted by both the classical theory
   and MCST are compared. In the second stage of analysis, the nonlinear
   dynamic behaviour of the deformable electrode due to the AC harmonic
   actuation is investigated around the deflected configuration,
   incorporating size dependence.}},

   correlation was observed between the mean proportions of species
   colonizing BRONJ-like lesions and the teeth of experimental rats (r =

   colonizing the teeth of control rats compared to experimental rats (P <

   in mandibular (P = 0.001) and maxillary (P = 0.108) tooth sockets of
   experimental rats. BRONJ-like lesions were colonized mainly by
   non-pathogenic bacteria. ZA+DX administered to rats at doses equivalent
   to those given to cancer patients resulted in changes to the oral

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{325}},
Pages = {{641-645}},

Abstract = {{Crystalline lithium disulfide (Li2S2) is identified, for the first time,
   as a transient species in the lithium sulfur cell, by using an operando
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The observed XRD pattern precisely
   matches with the predicted pattern based on the density function theory.
   The formation of Li2S2 crystals is repetitively found in the highly
   concentrated (7 M Li+) electrolyte at high voltage region (>2 V) near
   the end of the first charge cycle and before the end of the second
   discharge cycle. These conditions indicate that crystalline Li2S2 exists
   in the non-equilibrium regime. The formation of crystalline Li2S2 under
   only the specified conditions suggests that it is not formed as an
   intermediate discharge product, contrary to what is generally believed,
   but as a transient species by the disproportionation reaction from
   higher order polysulfides which is facilitated by the
   ``solvent-in-salt{''} conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Ae(3)}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{151-233}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic transformation of austenite to ferrite at temperatures above
   the Ae(3) temperature was first investigated by Yada and co-workers in
   the late 1980s. This phenomenon has now been observed right up to the
   delta ferrite formation temperature. The basic principles of dynamic
   transformation are reviewed, together with recent advances in the
   understanding of this mechanism. The transformation product that forms
   has been identified as Widmanstatten ferrite, which nucleates
   displacively and whose growth is accompanied by carbon diffusion. It
   forms in pairs of self-accommodating plates of near-identical
   orientation. The similar orientations of the plates allow them to
   coalesce on continued straining or holding at temperature, leading to
   the presence of polygonal grains as well as plates. The critical strain
   for the initiation of dynamic transformation is usually detected using
   double differentiation; results obtained by researchers on different
   steels are reviewed, together with observations obtained during the
   torsion simulation of strip and plate rolling. The thermodynamics of
   dynamic transformation are examined in detail, with attention paid to
   three recent approaches, the: (i) stored energy, (ii) stress activation,
   and (iii) phase softening models. It is concluded that the phase
   softening model provides the most accurate description of the
   transformation of the models proposed recently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study describes a comparison of smoked foils from five different

   spacing. Histograms, variance, and the autocorrelation function (ACF)

   first digitized then separated into left-running and right-running waves
   for subsequent analysis. The five mixtures showed different degrees of
   irregularity in the analysis of the histograms and the ACF of the
   spacing of the transverse waves. The dominant mode was readily found
   from the peak in the histogram and the first peak in the ACF result. The
   spacing of the main transverse waves provided by the histogram and the
   first peak of the ACF were much closer to the spacing of the transverse
   waves measured by eye for stable mixtures than for unstable ones due to
   their stronger dominant mode. In certain cases, other modes besides the
   dominant one were observed, such as two peaks in the histogram and other
   large peaks in the ACF result. Variance was used as a quantitative
   measurement of the cellular pattern irregularity level.}},

Abstract = {{The Mach reflection of cellular detonation waves on a wedge is
   investigated numerically in an attempt to elucidate the effect of
   cellular instabilities on Mach reflection, the dependence of
   self-similarity on the thickness of a detonation wave, and the initial
   development of the Mach stem near the wedge apex. A two-step
   chain-branching reaction model is used to give a thermally neutral
   induction zone followed by a chemical reaction zone for the detonation
   wave. A sufficiently large distance of travel of the Mach stem is
   computed to observe the asymptotic behavior in the far field. Depending
   on the scale at which the Mach reflection process occurs, it is found
   that the Mach reflection of a cellular detonation behaves essentially in
   the same way as a planar ZND detonation wave. The cellular
   instabilities, however, cause the triple-point trajectory to fluctuate.
   The fluctuations are due to interactions of the triple point of the Mach
   stem with the transverse waves of cellular instabilities. In the
   vicinity of the wedge apex, the Mach reflection is found to be
   self-similar and corresponds to that of a shock wave of the same
   strength, since the Mach stem is highly overdriven initially. In the far
   field, the triple-point trajectory approaches a straight line,
   indicating that the Mach reflection becomes self-similar asymptotically.
   The distance of the approach to self-similarity is found to decrease
   rapidly with decreasing thickness of the detonation front.}},

Abstract = {{This comment points out the large discrepancy between the predictions of
   the recently published model by Storozhev and Yermakov (Storozhev and
   Yermakov, Combust. Flame 162 (2015) 4129-4137) and the large body of
   accumulated literature on aluminum combustion. Their model predicts
   burning times between 40-63 ms for a cloud of nanometric aluminum
   particles (20 or 50 nm) burning in steam at initial temperatures around
   2300 K. These predictions are roughly two orders of magnitude larger
   than the measured combustion times of micron and submicron aluminum
   particles from various experiments, which are on the order or. hundreds
   of microseconds to milliseconds. Experimentally measured flame speeds of
   aluminum flames in the products of hydrocarbon flames, and the burn
   rates of metal-water propellants, also point to much faster burning
   rates of aluminum particles in steam than predicted by this model. As
   such, the predictions of the model by Storozhev and Yermakov cannot be
   reconciled with the available experimental evidence. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Antimony (Sb) is an impurity element that is increasingly encountered in
   the mineral processing/metallurgical industries of gold, copper and
   lead. Its occurrence in metallurgical feedstocks is in the form of
   various antimony minerals with stibnite, Sb2S3, being the most important
   one. During processing antimony is mobilized reporting to waste solid
   tailings or effluent streams. This becomes a matter of concern since
   antimony is similar to arsenic in many respects, both sharing similar
   chemical properties as well as toxicity and thus have negative
   environmental implications, especially in the context of industrial
   effluents and their treatment. This review summarizes the available
   literature on antimony in the environment and its removal with emphasis
   on effluent treatment. Antimony speciation as well as oxidation was
   presented at various conditions (pH, Eh, temperature, and concentration)
   to provide a basis of its aqueous behavior, an important foundation for
   industrial effluent treatment. For immobilizing antimony in the
   environment via precipitation from effluents several mineral candidates
   were identified of which schafarzikite, FeSb2O4, and tripuhyite, FeSbO4,
   were proposed as very attractive due to their very low antimony
   solubility (<1 mg L-1). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{14-20}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In mineral flotation, frothers are used to produce fine bubbles, reduce
   bubble rise velocity, and stabilize the froth, three properties that
   enhance the flotation process. These properties depend on the frother
   structure and this paper is part of an investigation into the frother
   structure-property relationship. The property here is bubble rise
   velocity and the structural variation is alkyl chain length of two
   frother families, alcohols and polyglycols. Single bubble rise velocity
   profiles were determined in a 350 cm column. Velocity at 300 cm as a
   function of concentration is determined and as a measure of the impact
   of structure on reduction in bubble rise velocity the concentration at
   minimum velocity (CMV) is estimated. The effect of increasing alkyl
   chain length is to decrease CMV by about ca. 90\% in alcohols and ca.
   70\% in polyglycols for every one carbon addition. Taking log CMV as a
   function of the number of carbons in the alkyl chain gives a series of
   self-similar linear plots. An argument relating bubble rise velocity to
   surfactant molecule packing on the bubble surface is proposed. (C) 2016

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{66-73}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we describe the synthesis and characterization of a
   homologous series of linear polyglycol-based frothers comprising alkyl,
   propoxy (propylene oxide, PO), and ethoxy (ethylene oxide, EO) groups.
   The identities were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy and total organic carbon analysis. Characterization used
   three parameters, bubble size, gas holdup and water overflow rate,
   measured in a bubble column. The results indicate that increasing number
   of PO groups led to significant decrease in bubble size, and increase in
   gas holdup and water overflow rate. Increasing the alkyl chain length,
   gave similar but less pronounced trends; the least effect was increasing
   the number of EO groups. Changing the relative position of the PO and EO
   group had a significant effect on all three parameters. To account for
   the effect of PO/EO position, a mechanism based on effect of structure
   on molecule packing at the air/water interface is proposed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A continuous flow solution unit was designed and built with a sole
   purpose of achieving better hydrodynamic control during the osmotic
   dehydration pre-treatment process. The initial study was set up to
   calibrate the flow meter at different sucrose solutions at different
   concentrations and temperatures to obtain a flow velocity range between
   1.5 to 3.5 mm/s. In this study, broccoli stalk slices were used to
   investigate the effect of the flow velocity on mass transfer kinetics
   and compared with static condition. Further, the optimization of this
   equipment system was performed to achieve higher water loss with minimal
   solute gain as pre-drying condition. Comparative studies between static
   and dynamic conditions show that flow velocity helps in faster rate of
   water removal with lower solute gain during the osmotic dehydration
   process of broccoli stalk slices. The optimum condition was found to be
   at a temperature of 30 A degrees C with concentration of 54 A degrees
   Brix for 120 min of immersion time at flow velocity of 3.5 mm/s.}},

Abstract = {{Downscaling of climate projections is the most adapted method to assess
   the impacts of climate change at regional and local scales. This study
   utilized both spatial and temporal downscaling approaches to develop
   intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relations for sub-daily rainfall
   extremes in the Perth airport area. A multiple regression-based
   statistical downscaling model tool was used for spatial downscaling of
   daily rainfall using general circulation models (GCMs) (Hadley Centre's
   GCM and Canadian Global Climate Model) climate variables. A simple
   scaling regime was identified for 30minutes to 24hours duration of
   observed annual maximum (AM) rainfall. Then, statistical properties of
   sub-daily AM rainfall were estimated by scaling an invariant model based
   on the generalized extreme value distribution. RMSE, Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency coefficient and percentage bias values were estimated to
   check the accuracy of downscaled sub-daily rainfall. This proved the
   capability of the proposed approach in developing a linkage between
   large-scale GCM daily variables and extreme sub-daily rainfall events at
   a given location. Finally IDF curves were developed for future periods,
   which show similar extreme rainfall decreasing trends for the 2020s,
   2050s and 2080s for both GCMs.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of contact forces during an impact requires the use of
   continuous force-based methods. An accurate prediction of the impact
   force demands the identification of the contact parameters on a
   case-by-case basis. In this paper, the preimpact effective kinetic
   energy is put forward as an indicator of the intensity of the impact
   force along the contact normal direction. This represents a part of the
   total kinetic energy of the system that is associated with the subspace
   of constrained motion defined by the impact constraints at the moment of
   contact onset. Its value depends only on the mechanical parameters and
   the configuration of the system. We illustrate in this paper that this
   indicator can be used to characterize the impact force intensity. The
   suitability of this indicator is confirmed by numerical simulations and
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{As biocomposites are highly sensitive to water absorption, the aim of
   this study was to compare the physical properties two biocomposites: (1)
   a flax/bio-based epoxy (Entropy SUPER SAP CLR/INS) and (2) a
   flax/polyurethane (HENKEL LOCTITE MAX 3). Both materials were reinforced
   with 14 layers of flax (TEXONIC twill 2 x 2) and manufactured using a
   resin transfer moulding process. Post-cured composite samples were aged
   at 90\% RH and 30 degrees C for various periods of time up to 720 h. The
   results showed that both composites followed a Fickian diffusion
   behaviour. Water had a plasticizing effect on the composites and it
   changed their failure mode. This effect took longer to appear for the
   polyurethane composites. The chemical bonds between the hydroxyl groups
   of the fibres and the isocyanate lead to a stronger interface which
   improved the mechanical properties (short beam and compressive
   strengths) as compared to the flax/bio-epoxy composites. (C) 2016

Title = {{Cost-benefit analysis of various California renewable portfolio standard

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{1122-1132}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs') require a certain fraction of the
   electricity generated for a given region be produced from renewable
   resources. California's RPS mandates that by 2020, 33\% of the
   electricity sold in the state must be generated from renewables. Such
   mandates have important implications for the electricity sector as well
   as for the whole society. In this paper, we estimate the costs and
   benefits of varying 2020 California RPS targets on electricity prices,
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, criteria pollutant emissions, the
   electricity generation mix, the labor market, renewable investment
   decisions, and social welfare. We have extended the RPS Calculator
   model, developed by Energy and Environmental Economics (E3) Inc., to
   account for distributions of fuel and generation costs, to incorporate
   demand functions, and to estimate the effects of RPS targets on GHG
   emissions, criteria pollutant emissions, and employment. The results of
   our modeling provide the following policy insights: (1) the average 2020
   electricity price increases as the RPS target rises, with values ranging
   between \$0.152 and \$0.175/kW h (2008 dollars) for the 20\% RPS to 50\%
   RPS, respectively; (2) the 33\% and 50\% RPS targets decrease the GHG
   emissions by about 17.6 and 35.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
   equivalent (MMTCO(2)e) relative to the 20\% RPS; (3) the GHG emission
   reduction costs of the RPS options are high (\$71-\$94 per ton) relative
   to results from policy options other than RPS or prices that are common.
   in the carbon markets; and (4) a lower target (e.g., a 27\% RPS)
   provides higher social welfare than the 33\% RPS (mandate) under low and
   moderate CO2 social costs (lower than \$35/ton); while a higher RPS
   target (e.g., 50\%) is more beneficial when using high CO2 social costs
   or rapid renewable technology diffusion. However, under all studied
   scenarios, the mandated 33\% RPS for California would not provide the
   best cost/benefit values among the possible targets and would not
   maximize the net social benefit objective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The potential of NIR hyperspectral images of fresh, frozen, and

   and Gabor filtered mean spectra of fresh, frozen, and frozen-thawed pork
   were calculated and their first derivatives at selected optimal
   wavelengths were used to establish multiple linear regression (MLR)
   models. The MLR models based on the first derivative of Gabor filtered
   mean spectra produced best results for both IMF content prediction and
   marbling score assessment. Models were used to visualize fat
   distribution in pork loin. The current study therefore demonstrated the

   had significantly lower (P < 0.05) in vitro protein digestibility, in
   comparison with the other coagulants. Protein degradation occurred more
   rapidly at the initial phase of gastric digestion for the gel prepared
   with GDL rather than that of MgCl2, whereas both gels possessed an
   undigested 25 kDa band at the end of intestinal digestion. Also, smaller
   peptides (<10 kDa) gradually increased during the digestion and GDL gel
   reached the highest peptide content of 3.73 mg/ml after GIS. MTGase gel
   possessed the least peptide amount and free amino acid content at the
   end of GIS. The results demonstrated structure of soy protein network
   assembled by different coagulant had vital influence on the protein
   bioaccessibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the role played by starch composition and heating
   media in the synthesis of the promising biorefinery chemical levulinic
   acid (LA). Three corn starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios
   were converted to LA using both microwave and conventional oil bath
   heating. The results obtained for the different reaction temperatures
   and times were used to calculate kinetic parameters using a
   multireaction model. It was observed that the long preheating and
   cooling times employed in microwave heating led to equivalent reaction
   temperatures below the set temperatures, and this in turn affected the
   product distributions via changes in the reaction kinetics. At low
   reaction temperatures, high amylopectin waxy corn starch gave higher LA
   yields than normal or high-amylose corn starch. Similarly, LA yields
   were higher at lower temperatures for oil bath heating than for
   microwave heating. The maximum LA yield obtained was around 53-55\% for
   all substrates and for both heating media, but was obtained for a
   shorter reaction time and at a lower equivalent temperature in the case
   of microwave heating.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle-liquid crystal (NP-LC) composites based on hydrogen bonding
   were explored using a model system. The ligand shells of 3 nm diameter
   zirconium dioxide nanoparticles (ZrO2 NPs) were varied to control their
   interaction with 4-n-hexylbenzoic acid (6BA). The miscibility and effect
   of the NPs on the nematic order as a function of particle concentration
   was characterized by polarized optical microscopy (POM), fluorescence
   microscopy and H-2 NMR spectroscopy. Nonfunctionalized ZrO2 NPs have the
   lowest miscibility and strongest effect on the LC matrix due to
   irreversible binding of 6BA to the NPs via a strong zirconium
   carboxylate bond. The ZrO(2)NPs were functionalized with
   6-phosphonohexanoic acid (6PHA) or 4-(6-phosphonohexyloxy)benzoic acid
   (6BPHA) which selectively bind to the ZrO2 NP surface-via the phosphonic
   acid groups. The miscibility was increased by controlling the
   concentration of the pendant CO2H groups by adding hexylphosphonic acid
   (HPA) to act as a spacer group. Fluorescence microscopy of lanthanide
   doped ZrO2 NPs showed no aggregates in the nematic phase below the NP
   concentration where aggregates are observed in the isotropic phase. The
   functionalized NPs preferably concentrate into LC defects and any
   remaining isotropic liquid but are still present throughout the nematic
   liquid at a lower concentration.}},

   microwire is also pumped in the nonlinear optics regime, showing
   multiple-orders of four-wave mixing and supercontinuum generation
   spanning from 1.0 mu m to >4.3 mu m. We conclude that with such a

Volume = {{503}},

Abstract = {{Small bubbles play the critical role in flotation of providing the large
   interfacial area for collecting and transporting selected (hydrophobic)
   mineral particles. The generation of these bubbles is a physical process
   chemically assisted by addition of surfactants (frothers). The prime
   action of frothers is commonly considered to be coalescence inhibition.
   In contrast, the possible role of frothers in the initial air break-up
   has attracted little attention. In this paper, we investigate the effect
   of frothers on break-up. An experimental setup was designed to isolate
   break-up from coalescence. Single bubbles were produced through
   mechanically-induced deformation of a trapped air volume, the design
   aiming to mimic the break-up of the air cavity behind an impeller blade
   in a mechanical flotation machine. The results show that the bubble size
   produced at break-up is strongly affected by the presence of frother,
   but weakly by the input mechanical energy and the volume of trapped air.
   The proposed mechanism is that frothers induce surface tension gradients
   which increase the instabilities along the air/water interface. For a
   finite air volume, increasing the number of instabilities means that
   more and smaller bubbles will break away. Frothers of different types
   and concentrations were tested. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   mixing strategies were used: (S1) direct mixing of all three components,
   (S2) mixing C30B and PLA followed by mixing with PBAT, and (S3) mixing
   C30B and PBAT followed by mixing with PLA. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and

   study the C30B dispersion and the blend morphology. Small amplitude
   oscillatory shear (SAOS) and stress growth tests were also conducted to
   investigate the nanocomposites and blend rheological properties and
   morphological stability under shear flow. With 1 wt\% C30B, the
   nanoparticles were located at the PLA-PBAT interface for all mixing
   routes, which was favorable for morphology stabilization. The average
   PBAT droplet-diameter was reduced from 1.30 mm for the neat PLA-PBAT
   blend to 0.75, 0.85, and 0.70 mm for blend nanocomposites depending on
   the mixing strategy used. Under shearing at 0.01 s(-1), droplet
   coalescence did not occur due to the presence of C30B at the interface
   of the polymer phases. On the other hand, in blends containing 5 wt\%
   C30B, the location of the nanoparticles and the occurrence of

Abstract = {{Person re-identification is defined as re-identifying individuals across
   different camera views. This is a very challenging problem since the
   appearance of a person can vary significantly due to cross-camera
   changes in viewpoint, pose and illumination. To model the transition
   between camera views, distance metric learning has been widely used in
   person re-identification and shown to be effective. However, using one
   specific metric often suffers from over-fitting and may not be
   sufficient enough to cope with the cross-camera variations of all
   different individuals. In this Letter, a powerful metric fusion method
   is proposed to combine multiple given distance metrics. Specifically, we
   represent given metrics as different graphs and then formulate the
   fusion problem as a graph-based learning framework. In this way, our
   framework can efficiently integrate the complementary information
   provided by different input metrics.}},

Title = {{Phase Transfer of Palladized Nanoscale Zerovalent Iron for Environmental

Abstract = {{Palladium-doped nanoscale zerovalent iron (Pd-NZVI) has been shown to
   degrade environmental contaminants such as trichloroethene (TCE) to
   benign end-products through aqueous phase reactions. In this study we
   show that rhamnolipid (biosurfactant)-coated Pd-NZVI (RL-Pd-NZVI) when
   reacted with TCE in a 1-butanol organic phase with limited amounts of
   water results in 50\% more TCE mass degradation per unit mass of
   Pd-NZVI, with a 4-fold faster degradation rate (k(obs) of 0.413 day(-1)
   in butanol organic phase versus 0.099 day(-1) in aqueous phase).
   RL-Pd-NZVI is preferentially suspended in water in biphasic organic
   liquid-water systems because of its hydrophilic nature. We demonstrate
   herein for the first time that their rapid phase transfer to a
   butanol/TCE organic phase can be achieved by adding NaCl and creating
   water-in-oil emulsions in the organic phase. The significant enhancement
   in reactivity is caused by a higher electron release (3e(-) per mole of
   Fe-0) from Pd-NZVI in the butanol organic phase compared to the same
   reaction with TCE in the aqueous phase (2e(-) per mole of Fe-0). XPS
   characterization studies of Pd-NZVI show Fe-0 oxidation to Fe(III)
   oxides for Pd-NZVI reacted with TCE in the butanol organic phase
   compared to Fe(II) oxides in the aqueous phase, which accounted for
   differences in the TCE reactivity extents and rates observed in the two
   phases.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon photonic interconnect (SPI) is an attractive alternative for the
   power-hungry and low-bandwidth metallic interconnect in multiprocessor
   systems-on-chip (MPSoCs). When employing SPIs for wavelength-division
   multiplexing (WDM)-based applications, it is essential to precisely
   align the central wavelengths of different photonic devices (e.g.,
   photonic switches) to achieve a reliable communication. However, SPIs
   are sensitive to fabrication nonuniformity (a.k.a. fabrication process
   variation), which results in wavelength mismatches between devices, and
   hence performance degradation in SPIs. This work presents a
   computationally efficient and accurate bottom-up approach to study the
   impact of fabrication process variations on passive silicon photonic
   devices and interconnects. We first model the impact of process
   variations at the component level (i.e., strip waveguides), then at the
   device level (i.e., add-drop filters and photonic switches), and finally
   at the system level (i.e., passive WDM-based SPIs). Numerical
   simulations are performed not only to evaluate the accuracy of our
   method, but also to demonstrate its high-computational efficiency.
   Furthermore, our study includes the design, fabrication, and analysis of
   several identical microresonators to demonstrate process variations in
   silicon photonics fabrication. The efficiency of our proposed method
   enables its application to large-scale passive SPIs in MPSoCs, where
   employing time-consuming numerical simulations is not feasible.}},

Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{It is often useful that an imaging data format can afford rich metadata,
   be flexible, scale to very large file sizes, support multi-modal data,
   and have strong inbuilt mechanisms for data provenance. Beginning in
   1992, MINC was developed as a system for flexible, self-documenting
   representation of neuroscientific imaging data with arbitrary
   orientation and dimensionality. The MINC system incorporates three broad
   components: a file format specification, a programming library, and a
   growing set of tools. In the early 2000's the MINC developers created
   MINC 2.0, which added support for 64-bit file sizes, internal
   compression, and a number of other modern features. Because of its
   extensible design, it has been easy to incorporate details of provenance
   in the header metadata, including an explicit processing history, unique
   identifiers, and vendor-specific scanner settings. This makes MINC ideal
   for use in large scale imaging studies and databases. It also makes it
   easy to adapt to new scanning sequences and modalities.}},

Title = {{Cranberry-derived proanthocyanidins impair virulence and inhibit quorum
   sensing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Bacteria have evolved multiple strategies for causing infections that
   include producing virulence factors, undertaking motility, developing
   biofilms, and invading host cells. N-acylhomoserine lactone
   (AHL)-mediated quorum sensing (QS) tightly regulates the expression of
   multiple virulence factors in the opportunistic pathogenic bacterium
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, inhibiting QS could lead to health
   benefits. In this study, we demonstrate an anti-virulence activity of a
   cranberry extract rich in proanthocyanidins (cerPAC) against P.
   aeruginosa in the model host Drosophila melanogaster and show this is
   mediated by QS interference. cerPAC reduced the production of
   QS-regulated virulence determinants and protected D. melanogaster from
   fatal infection by P. aeruginosa PA14. Quantification of AHL production
   using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed that cerPAC
   effectively reduced the level of AHLs produced by the bacteria.
   Furthermore, monitoring QS signaling gene expression revealed that AHL
   synthases LasI/RhlI and QS transcriptional regulators LasR/RhlR genes
   were inhibited and antagonized, respectively, by cerPAC. Molecular
   docking studies suggest that cranberry-derived proanthocyanidin binds to
   QS transcriptional regulators, mainly interacting with their ligand
   binding sites. These findings provide insights into the underlying
   mechanisms of action of a cerPAC to restrict the virulence of P.
   aeruginosa and can have implications in the development of alternative
   approaches to control infections.}},

Title = {{Characterization Methodology for Biological Plywoods Based on
   Characteristic Cross-Section Patterns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{241-250}},

Abstract = {{Biological plywoods are solid analogues of liquid crystalline phases
   whose building blocks, including cellulose, collagen and chitin, present
   multifunctionality, providing in some cases protection, camouflage,
   self-healing and/or adaptability to the surrounding environment. The 3D
   ordered structure is the main factor for these fascinating properties,
   and the assessment of the structure-property relationship will be a
   powerful tool in terms of future material design and innovation.
   Cross-section observations lead to characteristic patterns depending on
   the specific arrangement of the plywood's building blocks. Twisted
   plywood architectures, known as the Bouligand structure, lead to the
   widely observed arced patterns which can be ideal or nonideal depending
   on whether the relationship between the twist angle and the spatial
   coordinate is linear or not. The latter is the case of nonideal and the
   projected arcs to the incision plane do not have a constant periodicity.
   On the other hand, orthogonal plywoods project into herringbone patterns
   when the incision angle is adequate. In either case, arcs or
   herringbones, key characteristic variables, have been identified that
   provide quantitative means that relate them to structural variables such
   as the pitch and the helix location. Based on this quantitative
   information we proposed a methodology to characterize the plywoods when
   these characteristic patterns are accessible. The method has been
   validated using in-vivo and in-silico observations, where the latter
   were obtained using Mayavi, a general purpose 3D visualization software.
   In this article we present a new analysis of plywoods' mechanics using
   Krenchel's formalism and we give a broad and unifying vision of our
   recent findings regarding cross-section reconstruction techniques of
   several biological plywoods along with recommendations that increase
   accuracy in the predictions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines various parameters that provide a measure of
   spectral shape and studies how they relate to the potential of ground
   motion records to cause the collapse of a given structure. It is shown
   that when measuring the ground motion intensity by the spectral
   acceleration at the first-mode period of the structure, Sa(T-1), records
   causing collapse at low ground motion intensities typically have
   significantly different spectral shapes than those that do not cause
   collapse until much higher ground motion intensities. A spectral shape
   typical of damaging records is identified, and a metric for quantifying
   the spectral shape of a record called SaRatio is proposed and evaluated.
   SaRatio is defined as the ratio between Sa(T-1) and the average spectral
   value over a period range. The ability of SaRatio to predict the
   collapse intensity, i.e. the minimum intensity at which a given ground
   motion causes the collapse of a given structure, is compared to other
   recently proposed spectral shape metrics including epsilon (epsilon),
   eta (eta) and Np. The results demonstrate that SaRatio is typically a
   much better predictor of collapse intensity than other spectral shape
   metrics. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The combined use of P- and S-wave seismic reflection data is appealing
   for providing insights into active petroleum systems because P-waves are
   sensitive to fluids and S-waves are not. The method presented herein
   relies on the simultaneous acquisition of P-and S-wave data using a
   vibratory source operated in the inline horizontal mode. The combined
   analysis of P-and S-wave reflections is tested on two potential
   hydrocarbon seeps located in a prospective area of the St. Lawrence
   Lowlands in Eastern Canada. For both sites, P-wave data indicate local
   changes in the reflection amplitude and slow velocities, whereas S-wave
   data present an anomalous amplitude at one site. Differences between
   P-and S-wave reflection morphology and amplitude and the abrupt decrease
   in P-velocity are indirect lines of evidence for hydrocarbon migration
   toward the surface through unconsolidated sediments. Surface-gas
   analysis made on samples taken at one potential seeping site reveals the
   occurrence of thermogenic gas that presumably vents from the underlying
   fractured Utica Shale forming the top of the bedrock. The 3C shear data
   suggest that fluid migration locally disturbs the elastic properties of
   the matrix. The comparative analysis of P-and S-wave data along with 3C
   recordings makes this method not only attractive for the remote
   detection of shallow hydrocarbons but also for the exploration of how
   fluid migration impacts unconsolidated geologic media.}},

Abstract = {{The single-sensor probability hypothesis density (PHD) and cardinalized
   probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filters have been developed in the
   literature using the random finite set framework. The existing
   multisensor extensions of these filters have limitations such as
   sensor-order dependence, numerical instability, or high computational
   requirements. In this paper, we derive update equations for the
   multisensor CPHD filter. The multisensor PHD filter is derived as a
   special case. Exact implementation of the multisensor CPHD involves sums
   over all partitions of the measurements from different sensors and is
   thus intractable. We propose a computationally tractable approximation
   that combines a greedy measurement partitioning algorithm with the
   Gaussian mixture representation of the PHD. Our greedy approximation
   method allows the user to control the trade-off between computational
   overhead and approximation accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The analytical model developed by Gurney is a seminal tool for analyzing
   the acceleration of metal flyers driven by detonating high explosives.
   Despite the continued relevance of this model, relatively few
   experimental validations over a wide range of flyer-to-charge mass
   ratios exist in the open literature. The current study presents
   experimental results for planar aluminum flyers propelled by a
   conventional explosive over a range of mass ratios varying from 4.65 to
   0.03. Flyer velocity was measured via Heterodyne Laser Velocimetry
   (PDV), permitting a continuous measurement of the acceleration process.
   Measured flyer velocities are compared to terminal velocity estimations
   from the Gurney model. Experimental terminal velocities are compared to
   the open face and asymmetric sandwich Gurney models. Excellent agreement
   is observed for terminal velocity predictions considering the gasdynamic
   simplifications inherent in the model formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) microfluidic devices provide a
   reliable label-free separation method for detection of circulating tumor
   cells (CTCs) in blood samples based on their biophysical properties. In
   this paper, we proposed an effective design of the DLD microfluidic
   device for the CTC separation in the blood stream. A typical DLD array
   is designed and numerical simulations are performed to separate the CTC
   and leukocyte (white blood cells) in different fluid flow conditions.
   Fluid-Solid Interaction method is used to investigate the behaviour of
   these deformable cells in fluid flow. In this study, the effects of
   critical parameters affecting cell separation in the DLD microfluidic
   devices (e.g. flow condition, cell deformability, and stress) have been
   investigated. The obtained results show that unlike leukocytes, the
   CTC's motion is independent of the flow condition and is laterally
   displaced even in higher Reynolds number. Larger cells (CTCs) cannot
   intercept the low-velocity fluid near the wall of the posts; thus, they
   move faster and become separated from leukocytes. To reduce the cellular
   stress during separation process, which causes increase of cell
   viability and more effective design of microfluidic device, the results
   obtained here may be used as a significant design parameter for the DLD
   fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an improved model predictive control (MPC) of the modular
   multilevel converter (MMC) with reduced computational burden is
   proposed. A mathematical model of the MMC system based on the sum and
   difference of arm voltages are derived. Instead of determining the
   switching state of individual submodule (SM), the voltage levels of MMC
   are considered as control options based on the assumption that the SM
   capacitor voltages are well balanced. The further reduction of
   calculation effort is realized by using the tolerance band of capacitor
   voltages. The proposed MPC has a hierarchical structure. The cost
   function taking into account the ac-side current control, circulating
   current elimination and arm energy balancing is presented. The optimal
   voltage level, selected by the cost function, provides the voltage
   reference for the pulse width modulation modulator. The SM capacitor
   voltage balancing is done using a separate control loop. The proposed
   control strategy is investigated using an MMC high-voltage direct
   current system with 200 SMs in each arm in real-time simulation and
   hardware-in-the-loop tests. The performance of proposed method is
   verified by both steady-state and transient-state operations.}},

   proposed to obtain a reduced order model based on LM interpolation while
   still maintaining the passivity of the macromodel. This is achieved by
   first relaxing the passivity requirement during the order selection
   process; then a new passivity enforcement scheme with significantly
   improved speed and convergence properties is applied. The proposed
   approach results in a significantly reduced macromodel size while
   maintaining accuracy and passivity conditions. The efficiency of the new

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Polymer based kinetic hydrate inhibitors are increasingly used in the
   oil and gas industry to prevent hydrate formation. It is well known that
   the effectiveness of inhibitors decreases as the driving force for
   hydrate formation increases. The current study assesses whether the
   inhibitory effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) can be completely masked
   by high driving forces for hydrate growth. Methane hydrate kinetic
   experiments were performed with solutions of pure water and 0.007 wt\%
   PVP in water at 277 K and pressures ranging from 23.83 MPa to 31.33 MPa.
   Results showed that as the driving force for hydrate formation
   increases, the effect of PVP as a hydrate growth inhibitor diminishes
   and may be entirely masked for a significant amount of time. With the
   current system, hydrate growth appeared uninhibited at subcoolings
   greater than 17.4 K (2633 MPa). The time of uninhibited growth was found
   to increase linearly with subcooling to a maximum of 537 s at a 19 K
   subcooling (3133 MPa). Under such high driving forces, inhibitory
   effects have been shown to take time to manifest themselves, indicating
   that under these conditions additives have no effect on hydrate
   nucleation but solely on hydrate growth following nucleation. (C) 2016

Title = {{Atomistic modeling of structure II gas hydrate mechanics:
   Compressibility and equations of state}},
Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This work uses density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the poorly
   characterized structure II gas hydrates, for various guests (empty,
   propane, butane, ethane-methane, propane-methane), at the atomistic
   scale to determine key structure and mechanical properties such as
   equilibrium lattice volume and bulk modulus. Several equations of state
   (EOS) for solids (Murnaghan, Birch-Murnaghan, Vinet, Liu) were fitted to
   energy-volume curves resulting from structure optimization simulations.
   These EOS, which can be used to characterize the compressional behaviour
   of gas hydrates, were evaluated in terms of their robustness. The
   three-parameter Vinet EOS was found to perform just as well if not
   better than the four-parameter Liu EOS, over the pressure range in this
   study. As expected, the Murnaghan EOS proved to be the least robust.
   Furthermore, the equilibrium lattice volumes were found to increase with
   guest size, with double-guest hydrates showing a larger increase than
   single-guest hydrates, which has significant implications for the widely
   used van der Waals and Platteeuw thermodynamic model for gas hydrates.
   Also, hydrogen bonds prove to be the most likely factor contributing to
   the resistance of gas hydrates to compression; bulk modulus was found to
   increase linearly with hydrogen bond density, resulting in a
   relationship that could be used predictively to determine the bulk
   modulus of various structure II gas hydrates. Taken together, these
   results fill a long existing gap in the material chemical physics of
   these important clathrates. (C) 2016 Author(s). All article content,

Abstract = {{Self-organized AlGaN nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy have attracted
   significant attention for deep ultraviolet optoelectronics. However, due
   to the strong compositional modulations under conventional nitrogen rich

   improved compositional uniformity can be achieved in a new growth
   paradigm, wherein a precise control on the optical bandgap of ternary
   AlGaN nanowires can be achieved by varying the substrate temperature.

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The recently developed SWATDRAIN model was employed to assess the impact
   of controlled drainage on the water table dynamics, subsurface drainage,
   and surface runoff in an agricultural watershed in Ontario, Canada.
   Controlled drainage was defined with a depth of 1.0 m to restrict flow
   at the drain outlet to maintain the water table at 0.5 m below the
   surface level during the winter (November-April) and at 0.6 m during the
   summer (June-August) months. The effects of the absence, or
   implementation, of drainage water management were predicted for the
   3-year period of 1991-1993. Implementing controlled drainage resulted in
   a 16\% reduction in the mean annual drain flow, while increasing surface
   runoff by as much as 71 \%. This indicates that overall watershed
   hydrology could be significantly impacted by the implementation of
   controlled drainage. This research demonstrates the SWATDRAIN model's
   ability to predict the controlled drainage in small agricultural
   watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{The undesirable flavor compounds diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are
   vicinal diketones (VDKs) formed by extracellular oxidative
   decarboxylation of intermediate metabolites of the isoleucine, leucine

   Saccharomyces and enzymatically converted to acetoin and
   3-hydroxy-2-pentanone, respectively. Purification of a highly enriched
   diacetyl reductase fraction from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in conjunction
   with mass spectrometry identified Old Yellow Enzyme (Oye) as an enzyme
   capable of catalyzing VDK reduction. Kinetic analysis of recombinant
   Oye1p, Oye2p and Oye3p isoforms confirmed that all three isoforms
   reduced diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in an NADPH-dependent reaction.
   Transcriptomic analysis of S. cerevisiae (ale) and S. pastorianus

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the evolution of urban cycling in Montreal,
   Canada and its link to both built environment indicators and bicycle
   infrastructure accessibility. The effect of new cycling infrastructure
   on transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is then explored.
   More specifically, we aim at investigating how commuting cycling modal
   share has evolved across neighborhood built-environment typologies and
   over time in Montreal, Canada. For this purpose, automobile and bicycle
   trip information from origin destination surveys for the years 1998,
   2003 and 2008 are used. Neighborhood typologies are generated from
   different built environment indicators (population and employment
   density, land use diversity, etc.). Furthermore, to represent the
   commuter mode choice (bicycle vs automobile), a standard binary logit
   and simultaneous equation modeling approach are adopted to represent the
   mode choice and the household location. Among other things, we observe
   an important increase in the likelihood to cycle across built
   environment types and over time in the study region. In particular,
   urban and urban-suburb `neighborhoods have experienced an important
   growth over the 10 years, going from a modal split of 2.8-5.3\% and
   1.4-3.0\%, respectively. After controlling for other factors, the model
   regression analysis also confirms the important increase across years as
   well as the significant differences of bicycle ridership across
   neighborhoods. A statistically significant association is also found
   between the index of bicycle infrastructure accessibility and bike mode
   choice - an increase of 10\% in the accessibility index results in a
   3.7\% increase in the ridership. Based on the estimated models and in
   combination with a GHG inventory at the trip level, the potential impact
   of planned cycling infrastructure is explored using a basic scenario. A
   reduction of close to 2\% in GHG emissions is observed for an increase
   of 7\% in the length of the bicycle network. Results show the important
   benefits of bicycle infrastructure to reduce commuting automobile usage
   and GHG emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pore network modeling is used to model water invasion and multiphase
   transport through compressed PEFC gas diffusion layers. Networks are
   created using a Delaunay tessellation of randomly placed base-points
   setting the pore locations and its compliment, the Voronoi diagram, is
   used to define the location of fibers and resultant pore and throat
   geometry. The model is validated in comparison to experimental capillary
   pressure curves obtained on compressed and uncompressed materials.
   Primary drainage is simulated with an invasion percolation algorithm
   that sequentially invades pores and throats separately with excellent
   agreement to experimental data, but required a slight modification to
   account for the higher aspect ratio of compressed pores. Compression is
   simulated by scaling the through-plane coordinates in a uniform manner
   representing a GDL wholly beneath the current-collector land. The
   relative permeability and diffusivity show some dependence on uniform
   compression. In-plane porosity variations introduced by land-channel
   compression are also investigated which have a marked effect on the
   limiting current. Saturation at breakthrough does not appear to be
   dependent on compression. However, a more important parameter, namely
   the peak saturation, is shown to influence the fuel cell performance and
   is dependent on the percolation inlet conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP),
   estimating the delay's bias is a problem that appears in both one-way
   (using transparent devices) or two-way message exchange mechanisms. For
   estimating the offset via the two-way message exchange mechanism, it is
   usually assumed that the expected value of delays in forward and reverse
   directions are equal. However, this is not a realistic assumption for
   packet-based wide area networks, where delays in down-link and up-link
   directions may have a significant difference. In this work, we propose a
   solution to estimate the random delay's bias and improve the
   synchronization accuracy of IEEE 1588. Our method is easy to implement
   and is compatible with the current version of the protocol. We compared
   our results to no bias correction and the Boot-strap method. In addition
   to the improvement in synchronization accuracy, our method allows us to
   update the slave clock recursively. The proposed method works well even
   in the presence of large frequency offsets and can also be implemented
   by using different filters.}},

   ae25\% dead chains) which is common for methacrylate/styrene
   copolymerizations by NMP. The resulting final block copolymers were
   determined to be methacrylate-rich (molar ratio XMA/S ae3.3 to 5.5) by
   H-1 NMR and the resulting glass transition temperature (T (g)) of the
   chain-extended segments were found to be similar to the coresponding
   pure poly(methacrylate)s. NMP allows the controlled placement of

Title = {{Defining the neuroanatomic basis of motor coordination in children and

Abstract = {{Background When children have marked problems with motor coordination,
   they often have problems with attention and impulse control. Here, we
   map the neuroanatomic substrate of motor coordination in childhood and
   ask whether this substrate differs in the presence of concurrent
   symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Method Participants were 226 children. All completed Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)-based
   assessment of ADHD symptoms and standardized tests of motor coordination
   skills assessing aiming/catching, manual dexterity and balance. Symptoms
   of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) were determined using
   parental questionnaires. Using 3 Tesla magnetic resonance data, four
   latent neuroanatomic variables (for the cerebral cortex, cerebellum,
   basal ganglia and thalamus) were extracted and mapped onto each motor
   coordination skill using partial least squares pathway modeling.
   Results The motor coordination skill of aiming/catching was
   significantly linked to latent variables for both the cerebral cortex (t
   = 4.31, p < 0.0001) and the cerebellum (t = 2.31, p = 0.02). This effect
   was driven by the premotor/motor cortical regions and the superior
   cerebellar lobules. These links were not moderated by the severity of
   symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. In categorical
   analyses, the DCD group showed atypical reduction in the volumes of
   these regions. However, the group with DCD alone did not differ
   significantly from those with DCD and co-morbid ADHD.
   Conclusions The superior cerebellar lobules and the premotor/motor
   cortex emerged as pivotal neural substrates of motor coordination in
   children. The dimensions of these motor coordination regions did not
   differ significantly between those who had DCD, with or without
   co-morbid ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{Here we present a high-throughput, parallelized cytoindentor for local
   compression of live cells. The cytoindentor uses convex lens-induced
   confinement (CLiC) to indent micrometer-sized areas in single cells
   and/or populations of cells with submicron precision. This is
   accomplished using micropatterned poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) films
   that are adhered to a convex lens to create arrays of extrusions
   referred to here as ``posts.{''} These posts caused local deformation of
   subcellular regions without any evidence of cell lysis upon CLiC
   indentation. Our micropost arrays were also functionalized with
   glycoproteins, such as fibronectin, to both pull and compress cells
   under customized confinement geometries. Measurements of Chinese hamster
   ovary (CHO-K1) cell migration trajectories and oxidative stress showed
   that the CLiC device did not damage or significantly stress the cells.
   Our novel tool opens a new area of investigation for visualizing
   mechanobiology and mechanochemistry within living cells, and the
   high-throughput nature of the technique will streamline investigations
   as current tools for mechanically probing material properties and
   molecular dynamics within cells, such as traditional cytoindentors and
   atomic force microscopy (AFM), are typically restricted to single-cell
   manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{In order to reduce interference to primary users and provide better
   performance of detection probability and channel capacity in multi-user
   cooperative spectrum sensing networks, a high capacity spectrum sensing
   framework is proposed based on the analysis of amplification factors on
   the performance of detection probability and channel capacity. Thanks to
   the energy concentration property of chirp signals in the Fractional
   Fourier Transform (FrFT) domain, sinusoidal signal and different chirp
   signals are utilized for primary user and cognitive users, respectively.
   Hence, spectrum sensing and signal transmission can be performed
   simultaneously in our proposed framework. Simulation results show that
   compared with the previous relay-based framework, the modified
   cooperative spectrum sensing framework can improve the detection
   probability significantly, and the channel capacity can also be
   improved. Moreover, the amplification factor can be used to realize the
   tradeoff between detection probability and channel capacity in our
   proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{Zero shear viscosity data of an amorphous polycarbonate (PC) were
   obtained by pressure-sweep tests at seven pressures from 1 to 700 bar,
   at 160, 180, 200, 220, and 240 A degrees C above the glass transition
   temperature T (g) . Independent shifts of the logarithmic zero shear
   viscosity and of the pressure were performed in order to build an
   empirical master curve at the reference temperature T (0) = 240 A
   degrees C. On the basis of a Vogel-type model, analytical expressions
   which fit the empirical logarithmic zero shear viscosity and the
   pressure shift factors were obtained. Additionally, a general equation
   of the zero shear viscosity as a function of pressure at any reference
   temperature was deduced. It is shown that the temperature dependence of
   the zero shear viscosity follows the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF)
   equation, with a pressure dependence parameter B(P) = B(0), B(0) = 02.87
   from which it is obtained that the pressure dependence of fractional
   free volume of PC at the glass transition temperature is f(T (g) , P) =

Abstract = {{The glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) gene is a major determinant of
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory
   neurotransmitter modulating local neuronal circuitry. GABAergic
   dysfunction and expression of GAD1 have been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and in working memory impairment. We
   examined the influence of the functional GAD1 rs3749034 variant on white
   matter fractional anisotropy (FA), cortical thickness, and working
   memory performance in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls
   (N=197). Using transcranial magnetic stimulation with
   electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), we subsequently examined the effect of
   rs3749034 on long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in schizophrenia patients and
   healthy controls (N= 66). We found that the rs3749034 T-allele carrier
   risk group had lower voxel-wise FA in the prefrontal cortex region
   (PFWE-corrected <0.05) but not cortical thickness. Mixed-model
   regression revealed a significant effect on attentional processing and
   working memory across four performance measures (F-1,F-182 = 11.5, P =
   8x10(-4)). FA in the prefrontal cortex was associated with digit-span
   performance. Voxel-wise mediation analysis revealed that the effect GAD1
   on poorer digit-span performance statistically predicted the lower white
   matter FA (PFWE-corrected <0.05). In exploratory analysis, we found a
   prominent GAD1 genotype-by-diagnosis interaction on DLPFC LICI (F-1,F-56
   = 14.3, P=4.1 x 10(-4)). Our findings converge on variation in GAD1 gene
   predicting a susceptibility mechanism that affects white matter FA,
   GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission in the DLPFC, and working memory
   performance. Furthermore, via voxel mediation of FA and TMS-EEG
   intervention, we provide evidence for a potentially causal mechanism
   through which aberrant DLPFC GABA signaling may contribute to working
   memory dysfunction.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The adoption of cold-formed steel (CFS) profiles for residential
   buildings started in USA. Positive experiences in this field took place
   in other countries such as Australia, Canada and Japan. In Italy, where
   traditionally steel in residential buildings has a rather limited
   application, this type of construction has not yet found a significant
   use. The University of Trento has recently been involved in a research
   project focusing on the development of an innovative industrialized
   housing system composed of cold-formed steel profiles. In this
   framework, a study of the response of CFS shear walls was performed. The
   experimental part of the study comprised tests on the bare steel
   skeleton and on framed walls sheathed with cement board panels. Reversed
   cyclic testing of representative walls subjected to in-plane lateral and
   vertical loads was carried out. The main features of the experimental
   study and the main results are presented and discussed. The performances
   of the different typologies of shear walls are compared in terms of
   resistance, stiffness, ductility parameters and energy dissipation
   capacity. The paper in its final part, focuses on the results of a study
   of the effectiveness of analytical methods available in literature and
   developed for wooden shear panels, for a reliable evaluation of the
   response of CFS shear walls. (C) 2016 The Institution of Structural

Abstract = {{There is an emerging interest in the aerospace industry to manufacture
   components with intricate geometries using discontinuous fibre
   carbon/polyether-ether-ketone moulding systems (obtained by cutting

   termed randomly oriented strand composites and is appealing for
   structural applications as it bridges the gap between the lack of
   formability of continuous fibre composites and the lack of performance
   of short fibre composites. The objective of this study was to
   investigate mechanical properties (tensile, compressive, shear and
   fatigue) of randomly oriented strand composites and to quantify the
   effect of strand size on their properties. Overall, properties were
   found to be highly variable and dependent on the strand length.
   Interestingly, tensile, compressive and shear strength had similar
   magnitudes and exhibited the same failure mechanisms (strand fracture
   and debonding). This experimental work expands the knowledge base for
   randomly oriented strand composite materials.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion of heat injected from a line source into turbulence
   generated by regular and fractal grids with the same solidity and inlet
   velocity was investigated experimentally with particular interest in the
   effects of grid geometry and relative location of the source on the
   width of the thermal plume and the mixing efficiency. These grids
   included one fractal square grid (FSG) and three regular square grids
   with mesh sizes that were comparable to the first (RG160), second (RG80)
   and fourth (RG18) iterations of the fractal grid. The heated line source
   was inserted on the centre plane of the grids, spanning the entire width
   of the wind tunnel at either of two downstream locations, an upstream
   location or a location nearly coincident with a grid. It was found that,
   in all cases examined, RG160 produced the strongest diffusion of the
   thermal plume and the highest level of scalar mixing. These observations
   were consistent with the evolution of the corresponding turbulent
   diffusivities, which, according to Taylor's theory of diffusion, are the
   product of the transverse turbulence intensity and the integral length
   scale. We argue that to maximise scalar diffusion and mixing of a scalar
   released from a concentrated source inside a duct, one should prefer a
   regular grid over a fractal square grid; we also recommend the use of a
   grid with a mesh size roughly equal to half the height of the duct and
   placed at approximately one duct height upstream of the source.}},

Abstract = {{Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) have long been considered as highly
   effective biocides; however, the lack of suitable methods for loading
   CuNPs onto polymeric membranes is recognized as being one of the primary
   reasons for the limited research concerning their application in
   membrane industries. A highly efficient spray- and spin-assisted
   layer-by-layer (SSLbL) method was developed to functionalize the TFC
   polyamide RO membranes with controllable loading of CuNPs for biofouling
   control. The SSLbL method was able to produce a uniform bilayer of
   polyethyleneimine-coated CuNPs and poly(acrylic) acid in less than 1
   min, which is far more efficient than the traditional dipping approach
   (25-60 min). The successful loading of CuNPs onto the membrane surface
   was confirmed by XPS analysis. Increasing the number of bilayers from 2
   to 10 led to an increased quantity of CuNPs on the membrane surface,
   from 1.75 to 23.7 mu g cm(-2). Multi-layer coating exhibited minor
   impact on the membrane water permeation flux (13.3\% reduction) while
   retaining the original salt rejection ability. Both static bacterial
   inactivation and cross-flow filtration tests demonstrated that CuNPs
   could significantly improve anti-biofouling property of a polyamide
   membrane and effectively inhibit the permeate flux reduction caused by
   bacterial deposition on the membrane surface. Once depleted, CuNPs can
   also be potentially regenerated on the membrane surface via the same
   SSLbL method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A universal equation for computing the beam broadening of incident
   electrons in thin films is presented. This equation is based on the
   concepts of anomalous diffusion with the Hurst exponent H. When the
   thickness to elastic mean free path ratio, t/lambda, is greater than 1,
   the Hurst exponent goes to 0.5 and this random walk behavior leads to
   the Goldstein et al. 111 beam broadening equation when non-relativistic
   screened Rutherford elastic cross-sections are used. When t/lambda << 1,
   the lack of elastic collisions for the electron trajectories gives an H
   exponent of 1 and a different beam broadening equation is obtained. A
   general equation to compute the beam broadening that takes into account
   the variation of H with t/lambda is presented and this equation was
   fitted and validated with Monte Carlo simulations of electron
   trajectories in thin films. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Load sharing between an adhesive bond and a bolted connection in a
   hybrid bonded/bolted joint has been experimentally demonstrated in
   previous studies using a low modulus adhesive. The possibility of
   sharing load between the two joining mechanisms can potentially result
   in a joint having higher static and fatigue strength compared to the
   underlying bonded and bolted joint separately. However, in such designs,
   despite using a low modulus adhesive, substantial load sharing seems to
   occur only after the adhesive in the hybrid joint has yielded. This
   limits the load sharing capability of the hybrid joint. In order to
   improve the load sharing, a new design using an interference-fit bolt
   instead of the conventional neat-fit or clearance fit bolt for hybrid
   joints has been investigated using a three-dimensional finite element
   model in this study. The interference fit hybrid joint model showed 10\%
   higher load sharing at equivalent load levels and activation of load
   sharing between the bolt and the adhesive as soon as the joint is
   loaded, a capability not achieved through conventional hybrid joint
   designs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-reactor gastrointestinal model was used to digest a mixture of
   pure polyphenol compounds, including non-flavonoid phenolic acids
   (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid) and a flavonoid (rutin)
   to identify phenolic metabolites and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and
   compare relative antioxidant capacities following a 24 h digestion.
   Biotransformation of these polyphenols occurred in the colonic
   compartments generating phenylpropionic, benzoic, phenylacetic and
   cinnamic acids. Total SCFAs increased in all colonic vessels with a rise
   in the proportion of propionic to acetic acid. Antioxidant capacity
   increased significantly in all compartments, but first in the stomach,
   small intestine and ascending colon. After 24 h, the colonic vessels
   without parent polyphenols, but containing new metabolites, had
   antioxidant capacities similar to the stomach and small intestine,
   containing parent compounds. Biotransformation of pure polyphenols
   resulted in different phenolic metabolite and SCFAs profiles in each
   colonic segment, with important health implications for these colonic
   compartments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{25-35}},

Abstract = {{Although high volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete has shown benefits for mass
   concrete such as dams, the calcium leaching in these hydraulic
   structures becomes a concern. This paper presents a study on leaching
   behavior of HVFA concrete on both macroscopic and microscopic scales.
   The fly ash was added to replace cement at weight ratios ranging from
   30\% to 70\%. Two curing ages, 28 days and 90 days, were tested. An
   accelerated electrochemical leaching test was developed to investigate
   leaching characteristics of HVFA mixtures. Leaching calcium contents,
   compressive strengths and pore structures were examined. Microstructural
   changes of HVFA concretes after leaching tests were analyzed through
   FT-IR, Si-29 NMR and SEM/EDX techniques. It was found that addition of
   fly ash into cement could effectively enhance the leaching resistance of
   cement based materials, but the contents of fly ash should be limited
   not to exceed 50\% of cementitious materials. Fly ash replacement
   ranging from 40\% to 60\% produced optimal pore structure that is
   beneficial to leaching resistance. The fly ash addition also increased
   condensation polymerization of C-S-H and increased Q(1)/Q(2) ratio,
   leading to a more stable and durable C-S-H gel structure. (c) 2016

Title = {{Subwavelength grating enabled on-chip ultra-compact optical true time
   delay line}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{An optical true time delay line (OTTDL) is a basic photonic building
   block that enables many microwave photonic and optical processing
   operations. The conventional design for an integrated OTTDL that is
   based on spatial diversity uses a length-variable waveguide array to
   create the optical time delays, which can introduce complexities in the
   integrated circuit design. Here we report the first ever demonstration
   of an integrated index-variable OTTDL that exploits spatial diversity in
   an equal length waveguide array. The approach uses subwavelength grating
   waveguides in silicon-on-insulator (SOI), which enables the realization
   of OTTDLs having a simple geometry and that occupy a compact chip area.
   Moreover, compared to conventional wavelength-variable delay lines with
   a few THz operation bandwidth, our index-variable OTTDL has an extremely
   broad operation bandwidth practically exceeding several tens of THz,
   which supports operation for various input optical signals with broad
   ranges of central wavelength and bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two modifications to reduce the complexity of
   the subcarrier-multiplexing (SCM) based digital backpropagation (DBP)
   for high symbol rate SCM systems. The first one is to reduce the number
   of interfering subcarriers (RS-SCMDBP) when evaluating the
   cross-subcarrier nonlinearity (CSN). The second one is to replace the
   original frequency domain CSN filters with the infinite impulse response
   (IIR) filters (IIRRS-SCM-DBP) in the CSN compensation. The performance
   of the proposed schemes are numerically evaluated in three-channel
   dual-polarization (DP) 16QAM wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
   transmissions. The aggregate symbol rate for each channel is 120 GBaud
   and the transmission distance is 1600 km. For the SCM system with 16
   subcarriers, the IIR-RS-SCM-DBP with only 4 interfering subcarriers and
   2 steps can achieve a 0.3 dB Q-factor improvement in the WDM
   transmission. Compared to the original SCM-DBP, the proposed
   IIR-RS-SCM-DBP reduces the complexity by 48\% at a performance loss of
   only 0.07 dB. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

   Segmentation during Label Fusion}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in multi atlas based algorithms address many of the
   previous limitations in model-based and probabilistic segmentation
   methods. However, at the label fusion stage, a majority of algorithms
   focus primarily on optimizing weight-maps associated with the atlas
   library based on a theoretical objective function that approximates the
   segmentation error. In contrast, we propose a novel
   method-Autocorrecting Walks over Localized Markov Random Fields
   (AWoL-MRF)-that aims at mimicking the sequential process of manual
   segmentation, which is the gold-standard for virtually all the
   segmentation methods. AWoL-MRF begins with a set of candidate labels
   generated by a multi-atlas segmentation pipeline as an initial label
   distribution and refines low confidence regions based on a localized
   Markov random field (L-MRF) model using a novel sequential inference
   process (walks). We show that AWoL-MRF produces state-of-the-art results
   with superior accuracy and robustness with a small atlas library
   compared to existing methods. We validate the proposed approach by
   performing hippocampal segmentations on three independent datasets: (1)
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI), (2) First Episode
   Psychosis patient cohort, and (3) A cohort of preterm neonates scanned
   early in life and at term equivalent age. We assess the improvement in
   the performance qualitatively as well as quantitatively by comparing
   AWoL-MRF with majority vote, STAPLE, and Joint Label Fusion methods.
   AWoL-MRF reaches a maximum accuracy of 0.881 (dataset 1), 0.897 (dataset
   2), and 0.807 (dataset 3) based on Dice similarity coefficient metric,
   offering significant performance improvements with a smaller atlas
   library (< 10) over compared methods. We also evaluate the diagnostic
   utility of AWoL-MRF by analyzing the volume differences per disease
   category in the ADNI1: Complete Screening dataset. We have made the
   source code for AWoL-MRF public at:

Abstract = {{Creep-fatigue experiments have been conducted in nickel-based superalloy
   GH720Li at an elevated temperature of 650 degrees C with a stress ratio
   of 0.1, based on which, different dwell times at the maximum loading
   were applied to investigate the effect of dwell time on the
   creep-fatigue behaviors. The tested specimens were cut from the rim
   region of an actual turbine disc in the hoop direction. The grain size
   and precipitates of the GH720Li superalloy were examined through
   scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. Experimental data shows creep-fatigue
   life-time decreases as the dwell time prolongs. Further, different
   scattering was observed in the creep-fatigue lifetime at different dwell
   times. Then a probabilistic model based on the applied mechanical work
   density (AMWD), with a linear heteroscedastic function that evaluates
   the non-constant deviation in the creep-fatigue lifetime, was formulated
   to describe the dependence of creep-fatigue lifetime on the dwell time.
   Finally, the possible microscopic mechanism of the creep-fatigue
   behavior has been discussed by SEM with EDS on the fracture surfaces.

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{274}},

Abstract = {{We developed a continuous, nonlinear model (FLOG-CN) linking carbon
   mineralization and nitrogen mineralization-immobilization with respect
   to time that successfully reproduced the complex CO2-C and SMN dynamics
   for a collection of 70 paired C and N soil datasets. Application of the
   model to diverse C and N datasets showed that incorporating latency into
   the model of C mineralization, and using C to drive N dynamics, allows
   heterogeneous data from many different soil amendments to be described
   by the same model. We successfully modeled complex CO2-C and SMN
   dynamics of widely different shapes and from a variety of soil
   amendments containing plant and animal residues. The re-interpretation
   of these datasets with the FLOG-CN models improved the quantitative
   analysis of C and N dynamics, yielding new insights into how amendment
   characteristics and experimental conditions influence the timing and
   quantity of C and N mineralized. Model parameters were responsive to
   varying soil characteristics (pH, C, N, C:N), amendment N:C, amendment
   rate, incubation temperature, and N additions. Stepwise regression was
   used to predict model parameters using metadata available for 56 of
   these datasets. Significant relationships were developed to estimate
   model parameters independently using measured system properties or other
   model parameters that could be independently estimated. Estimates of C
   and N dynamics both fell along a 1:1 line indicating that the model
   parameters could be adequately described by the measured properties, but
   the available metadata was not able to describe C dynamics with high
   precision. Nitrogen mineralization-immobilization was strongly related
   to amendment N:C, and switched between the two processes at an amendment
   N:C between 0.077 and 0.085 (C:N between 11.7 and 12.9). We believe that
   the modeling approach described here will allow quantitative and
   objective comparisons of diverse C and N datasets that have been
   hindered by subjective descriptions of the past. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Evidence-based practice, research utilization, and knowledge translation
   in chiropractic: a scoping review}},
Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Evidence-based practice (EBP) gaps are widespread across
   health disciplines. Understanding factors supporting the uptake of
   evidence can inform the design of strategies to narrow these EBP gaps.
   Although research utilization (RU) and the factors associated with EBP
   have been reported in several health disciplines, to date this area has
   not been reviewed comprehensively in the chiropractic profession. The
   purpose of this review was to report on the current state of knowledge
   on EBP, RU, and knowledge translation (KT) in chiropractic.
   Methods: A scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework was
   used to systematically select and summarize existing literature.
   Searches were conducted using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms
   from the earliest date available in each database to May 2015.
   Quantitative and thematic analyses of the selected literature were
   conducted.
   Results: Nearly 85 \% (56/67) of the included studies were conducted in
   Canada, USA, UK or Australia. Thematic analysis for the three categories
   (EBP, RU, KT) revealed two themes related to EBP (attitudes and beliefs
   of chiropractors; implementation of EBP), three related to RU (guideline
   adherence; frequency and sources of information accessed; and perceived
   value of websites and search engines), and three related to KT
   (knowledge practice gaps; barriers and facilitators to knowledge use;
   and selection, tailoring, and implementation of interventions). EBP gaps
   were noted in the areas of assessment of activity limitation,
   determination of psychosocial factors influencing pain, general health
   indicators, establishing a prognosis, and exercise prescription. While
   most practitioners believed EBP and research to be important and a few
   studies suggested that traditional and online educational strategies
   could improve patient care, use of EBP and guideline adherence varied
   widely.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that the majority of chiropractors hold
   favourable attitudes and beliefs toward EBP. However, much remains to be
   done for chiropractors to routinely apply evidence into clinical
   practice. Educational strategies aimed at practicing chiropractors can
   lead to more EBP and improved patient care. The chiropractic profession
   requires more robust dissemination and implementation research to
   improve guideline adherence and patient health outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a hitless flexible coherent transceiver enabled by a novel
   modulation format identification (MFI) scheme for dynamic agile optical
   networks. The modulation format transparent digital signal processing
   (DSP) is realized by a block-wise decision-directed least-mean-square
   (DD-LMS) equalizer for channel tracking, and a pilot symbol aided
   superscalar phase locked loop (PLL) for carrier phase estimation (CPE).
   For the MFI, the modulation format information is encoded onto the pilot
   symbols initially used for CPE. Therefore, the proposed MFI method does
   not require extra overhead. Moreover, it can identify arbitrary
   modulation formats including multi-dimensional formats, and it enables
   tracking of the format change for short data blocks. The performance of
   the proposed hitless flexible coherent transceiver is successfully
   evaluated with five modulation formats including QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM,
   Hybrid QPSK/8QAM and set-partitioning (SP)-512-QAM. We show that the
   proposed MFI method induces a negligible performance penalty. Moreover,
   we experimentally demonstrate that such a hitless transceiver can adapt
   to fast block-by-block modulation format switching. Finally, the
   performance improvement of the proposed MFI method is experimentally
   verified with respect to other commonly used MFI methods. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Systematic experiments for fatigue crack growth (FCG) rate on compact
   tension (CT) specimens have been conducted in nickel-based superalloy
   GH4169 at a broad range of temperatures with a frequency of 10 Hz and a
   stress ratio of 0.1. In order to investigate the crack closure behavior,
   FCG experiments at stress ratio of 0.5 were also performed by comparing
   with the results at stress ration of 0.1. CT specimens were cut from
   three typical locations of an actual forged turbine disc to investigate
   the effect of grain size on the FCG behaviors. The grain size
   distribution, precipitates and fracture surface characteristics at
   different locations of the turbine disc were examined through optical
   microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning
   electronic microscope (SEM) analyses. Digital image correlation (DIC),
   optical interferometry and oxide film measurements were carried out to
   investigate the presence and inducement of the crack closure. Then a
   modified FCG model, with a distribution factor that evaluates the
   scattering in the FCG rate, was formulated to describe the dependence of
   FCG rate on grain size. Finally, the possible microscopic mechanisms to
   explain the grain size effect on the FCG behaviors based on crack
   deflection and blockage, and the crack closure inducements involving
   plasticity and oxide were discussed in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into energy-rich
   products can potentially address some of the critical challenges we face
   today, including energy resource shortages and greenhouse gas emissions.
   Our ab initio calculations show that CO2 molecules can be spontaneously
   activated on the clean nonpolar surfaces of wurtzite metal nitrides, for
   example, Ga(In)N. We have further demonstrated the photoreduction of CO2
   into methanol (CH3OH) with sunlight as the only energy input. A
   conversion rate of CO2 into CH3OH (similar to 0.5 mmol g(cat)(-1) h-(1))
   is achieved under visible light illumination (>400 nm). Moreover, we
   have discovered that the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction can
   be drastically enhanced by incorporating a small amount of Mg dopant.
   The definitive role of Mg dopant in Ga(In)N, at both the atomic and
   device levels, has been identified. This study reveals the potential of
   III-nitride semiconductor nanostructures in solar-powered reduction of
   CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels.}},

   the solution. Different meta-heuristic techniques and their applications
   to mine production scheduling are discussed. A meta-heuristic approach,
   a combination of heuristic memory and simulated annealing, as
   demonstrated by means of a case study, takes a sub-optimal solution and
   improves it over time; thus it provides the best solution that it finds

Abstract = {{Topologically interlocked material (TIM) systems are load-carrying
   assemblies of unit elements interacting by contact and friction. TIM
   assemblies have emerged as a class of architectured materials with
   mechanical properties not ordinarily found in monolithic solids. These
   properties include, but are not limited to, high damage tolerance,
   damage confinement, adaptability, and multifunctionality. The review
   paper provides an overview of recent research findings on TIM
   manufacturing and TIM mechanics. We review several manufacturing
   approaches. Assembly manufacturing processes employ the concept of
   scaffold as a unifying theme. Scaffolds are understood as auxiliary
   support structures employed in the manufacturing of TIM systems. It is
   demonstrated that the scaffold can take multiple forms. Alternatively,
   processes of segmentation are discussed and demonstrated. The review on
   mechanical property characteristics links the manufacturing approaches
   to several relevant material configurations and details recent findings
   on quasi-static and impact loading, and on multifunctional response.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Treelike structures abound in natural as well as man-made transport
   systems, which have fascinated multidisciplinary researchers to study
   the transport phenomena and properties and understand the transport
   mechanisms of treelike structures for decades. The fluid flow and heat
   transfer in treelike networks have received an increasing attention over
   the past decade as the highly efficient transport processes observed in
   natural treelike structures can provide useful hints for optimal
   solutions to many engineering and industrial problems. This review paper
   attempts to present the background and research progress made in recent
   years on the transport phenomenon in treelike networks as well as
   technological applications of treelike structures. The subtopics
   included are optimization of branching structures, scaling laws of
   treelike networks, and transport properties for laminar flow, turbulent
   flow, heat conduction, and heat convection in treelike networks.
   Analytical expressions for the effective transport properties have been
   derived based on deterministic treelike networks, and the effect of
   branching parameters on the transport properties of treelike networks
   has also been discussed. Furthermore, numerical simulation results for
   treelike microchannel networks are presented as well. The proposed
   transport properties may be beneficial to understand the transport
   mechanisms of branching structures and promote the applications of
   treelike networks in engineering and industry.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the performance analysis of a
   decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative relaying (CR) scheme over channels
   impaired by bursty impulsive noise. Although the Middleton class-A model
   and the Bernoulli-Gaussian model give good results to generate a sample
   distribution of impulsive noise, they fail in replicating the bursty
   behavior of impulsive noise, as encountered for instance within power
   substations. To deal with that, we adopt a two-state Markov-Gaussian
   process for the noise distribution. For this channel, we evaluate the
   bit error rate performance of direct transmission (DT) and a DF relaying
   scheme using M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) modulation in the presence
   of Rayleigh fading with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) receiver. From the
   obtained results, it is seen that the DF CR scheme in bursty impulsive
   noise channel still achieves the space diversity and performs
   significantly better than DT under the same power consumption. Moreover,
   the proposed MAP receiver attains the lower bound derived for DF CR
   scheme and leads to large performance gains compared with the
   conventional receiving criteria, which were optimized for additive white
   Gaussian noise channel and memoryless impulsive noise channel.}},

Abstract = {{Research on and commercial development of the artificial pancreas (AP)
   continue to progress rapidly, and the AP promises to become a part of
   clinical care. In this report, members of the JDRF Artificial Pancreas
   Project Consortium in collaboration with the wider AP community 1)
   advocate for the use of continuous glucose monitoring glucose metrics as
   outcome measures in AP trials, in addition to HbA(1c), and 2) identify a
   short set of basic, easily interpreted outcome measures to be reported
   in AP studies whenever feasible. Consensus on a broader range of
   measures remains challenging; therefore, reporting of additional metrics
   is encouraged as appropriate for individual AP studies or study groups.
   Greater consistency in reporting of basic outcome measures may
   facilitate the interpretation of study results by investigators,
   regulatory bodies, health care providers, payers, and patients
   themselves, thereby accelerating the widespread adoption of AP
   technology to improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of an experimental evaluation of the
   permeability of the heterogeneous argillaceous limestone from the
   Cobourg formation located in southern Ontario, Canada. The low
   permeability of the limestone necessitated the development of
   experimental techniques for effectively measuring the permeability of
   the rock. In particular, we examine the results of pressurization of a
   fluid-filled co-axial cylindrical cavity of finite length cored into a
   150 mm diameter cylinder of the Cobourg Limestone. The orientation of
   the cavity is either normal to or along the nominal stratifications
   identified by the argillaceous partings separating the quartzitic
   phases. Both steady state and transient tests are used to estimate the
   permeability of the Cobourg Limestone. The paper also investigates the
   influence of a nominal axial load on the permeability of the rock.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the internal energy transfer and modal
   interactions in the dynamical behavior of slightly curved microplates.
   Employing the third-order shear deformation theory, the microplate model
   is developed taking into account geometric nonlinearities as well as the
   modified couple stress theory; the initial curvature is modeled by an
   initial imperfection in the out-of-plane direction. The in-plane
   displacements and inertia are retained, and the coupled out-of-plane,
   rotational, and in-plane motion characteristics are analyzed.
   Specifically, continuous models are developed for kinetic and potential
   energies as well as damping and external works; these are balanced and
   reduced via Lagrange's equations along with an assumed-mode technique.
   The reduced-order model is then solved numerically by means of a
   continuation technique; stability analysis is performed by means of the
   Floquet theory. The possibility of the occurrence of modal interactions
   and internal energy transfers is verified via a linear analysis on
   different natural frequencies of the system. The nonlinear resonant
   response of the system is obtained for the cases with internal energy
   transfer, and energy transfer mechanisms are analyzed; as we shall see,
   the presence of an initial curvature affects the system dynamics
   substantially. The importance of taking into account small-size effects
   is also shown by discovering this fact that both the linear and
   nonlinear internal energy transfer mechanisms are shifted substantially
   if this effect is ignored.}},

   Extensible Microbeams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims at analyzing the coupled nonlinear dynamical behavior of
   geometrically imperfect shear deformable extensible microbeams based on
   the third-order shear deformation and modified couple stress theories.
   Using Hamilton's principle and taking into account extensibility, the
   three nonlinear coupled continuous expressions are obtained for an
   initially slightly curved (i.e., a geometrically imperfect) microbeam,
   describing the longitudinal, transverse, and rotational motions. A
   high-dimensional Galerkin scheme is employed, together with an
   assumed-mode technique, in order to truncate the continuous system with
   an infinite number of degrees of freedom into a discretized model with
   sufficient degrees of freedom. This high-dimensional discretized model
   is solved by means of the pseudo-arclength continuation technique for
   the system at the primary resonance, and also by direct time-integration
   to characterize the dynamic response at a fixed forcing amplitude and
   frequency; stability analysis is conducted via the Floquet theory. Apart
   from analyzing the nonlinear resonant response, the linear natural
   frequencies are obtained via an eigenvalue analysis. Results are shown
   through frequency-response curves, force-response curves, time traces,
   phase-plane portraits, and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). The effect of
   taking into account the length-scale parameter on the coupled nonlinear
   dynamic response of the system is also highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{III-nitride semiconductors hold tremendous promise for realizing high

   photoelectrodes generally exhibit very low photocurrent densities, due

   separation. Here, we show that In0.5Ga0.5N nanowires with nearly
   homogeneous indium distribution can be achieved by plasma-assisted
   molecular beam epitaxy. Under AM1.5G one sun illumination, the InGaN
   nanowire photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 7.3 mA/cm(2) at
   1.2 V (vs. NHE) in 1M HBr. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency is
   above 10\% at 650 nm, which is significantly higher than previously

Abstract = {{Introduction: Surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy relies on
   the identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and often requires
   intracranial EEG (iEEG). We have developed a new approach for
   non-invasive magnetic and electric source imaging of the SOZ (MSI-SOZ
   and ESI-SOZ) from ictal magnetoencephalography (MEG) and EEG recordings,
   using wavelet-based Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM) method. We
   compared the performance of MSI-SOZ and ESI-SOZ with interictal spike
   source localization (MSI-spikes and ESI-spikes) and clinical
   localization of the SOZ (i.e., based on iEEG or lesion topography,
   denoted as clinical-SOZ). Methods: A total of 46 MEG or EEG seizures
   from 13 patients were analyzed. wMEM was applied around seizure onset,
   centered on the frequency band showing the strongest power change.
   Principal component analysis applied to spatiotemporal reconstructed
   wMEM sources (0.4-1 s around seizure onset) identified the main spatial
   pattern of ictal oscillations. Qualitative sublobar concordance and
   quantitative measures of distance and spatial overlaps were estimated to
   compare MSI/ESI-SOZ with MSI/ESI-Spikes and clinical-SOZ. Results:
   MSI/ESI-SOZ were concordant with clinical-SOZ in 81\% of seizures (MSI
   90\%, ESI 64\%). MSI-SOZ was more accurate and identified sources closer
   to the clinical-SOZ (P = 0.012) and to MSI-Spikes (P = 0.040) as
   compared with ESI-SOZ. MSI/ESI-SOZ and MSI/ESI-Spikes did not differ in
   terms of concordance and distance from the clinical-SOZ. Conclusions:
   wMEM allows non-invasive localization of the SOZ from ictal MEG and EEG.
   MSI-SOZ performs better than ESI-SOZ. MSI/ESI-SOZ can provide important
   additional information to MSI/ESI-Spikes during presurgical evaluation.

Title = {{Conflict Management in Participatory Approaches to Water Management: A
   Case Study of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River Regulation}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The International Joint Commission (IJC) has been involved in a 14-year
   effort to formulate a new water regulation plan for the Lake Ontario St.
   Lawrence River ({''}LOSLR{''}) area that balances the interests of a
   diverse group of stakeholders including shipping and navigation,
   hydropower, environment, recreational boating, municipal and domestic
   water supply, First Nations, and shoreline property owners. It has
   embraced the principles of collaborative and participatory management
   and, applying a Shared Visioning Planning (SVP) approach, has worked
   closely with stakeholders throughout all stages of this process;
   however, conflicts between competing stakeholders have delayed and
   complicated this effort. The overarching aim of this paper is to
   consider the extent to which the SVP approach employed by the IJC was
   effective in managing conflict in the LOSLR context. Audio recordings
   and transcriptions of public and technical hearings held by the IJC in
   2013 have been systematically analysed using stakeholder mapping and
   content analysis methods, to gain insight into the stakeholder universe
   interacting with the IJC on Plan 2014. The principal conclusions of this
   paper are that (a) the Shared Vision Planning approach employed by the
   IJC had some significant successes in terms of conflict
   management-particularly notable is the success that has been achieved
   with regards to integration of First Nation concerns; (b) there is a
   distinct group of shoreline property owners, based in New York State,
   who remain opposed to Plan 2014-the IJC's public outreach and
   participation efforts have not been successful in reconciling their
   position with that of other stakeholders due to the fact that this
   stakeholder group perceive that they can only lose out from any
   regulation change and are therefore unlikely to be motivated to engage
   productively in any planning dialogue; and (c) a solution would require
   that the problem be reframed so that this stakeholder can see that they
   do in fact have something to gain from a successful resolution, which
   may necessitate bringing the prospect of compensation to the table.}},

Abstract = {{A critical component in the interpretation of earthquake ground motions
   is the role that site effects play. In eastern Canada, the sediment
   layers which overlie glaciated bedrock produce strong and highly
   variable site responses. We use horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) response
   spectral ratios as the indicator variable by which to characterize the
   salient characteristics of site response. We show that site response can
   bemodeled using two key descriptive variables that are readily
   obtainable: (1) peak frequency (f(peak)), as determined from H/V or
   sediment depth; and (2) overall sediment type (or stiffness). We use
   these variables to create a preliminary model of site amplification that
   can be used in the development of ground-motion prediction equations
   (GMPEs) and in regional-scale ShakeMap-type applications. The key to the
   site characterization is the relationship between f(peak) and sediment
   thickness (depth-to-bedrock), which we derive using H/V data from
   earthquakes in the region, combined with compiled geophysical logs and a
   digital sediment thickness map from the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS).
   The OGS map also provides information on surficial sediment type, which
   is correlated with peak amplitudes (A(peak)) of response. H/V-spectral
   shapes may be associated with four main site categories, which in
   decreasing order of stiffness are: bedrock, till, sand/clay, and organic
   sediment/fill. The peak amplitudes of response are generally shown to
   increase as stiffness decreases, at least for the weak motions that are
   the focus of this study. We model site response by defining a generic
   site amplification curve, which is dependent only on f(peak) and site
   category. These site amplification curves can be applied in the
   development of regional GMPEs, and in the construction of near-real-time
   ShakeMaps.}},

Abstract = {{Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) with kesterite crystal structure is considered a
   promising semiconductor material for photovoltaics due to its excellent
   optical properties and nontoxic, earth-abundant components. In this
   work, the nanoscale coating of CZTS on anatase mesoscopic films is
   studied to build an absorber (kesterite)-conductor (anatase) photoanode
   structure with high composition uniformity a challenge for complex
   absorbers like quaternary CZTS. To this end, we first develop a
   three-step binary chalcogenide solution deposition-exchange sequence for
   precursor preparation that is followed by in-depth analysis of the
   deposit-forming chemical reactions and characterization of elemental
   distribution and composition control. Then, crystallization is induced
   by annealing at 500 degrees C for 1 h, followed by an additional
   hydrochloric acid etching step to remove secondary binary phases and
   surface imperfections leading to improved composition of a CZTS/TiO2
   film as a candidate for use in kesterite-sensitized solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Orthorhombic lepidocrocite-type lithium titanate hydrates (LTH), as one
   important member among two-dimensional (2D) materials, have drawn much
   attention due to their potential applications in nanoelectronics, energy
   conversion, and energy storage devices. However, only a few efforts have
   focused on an anisotropic growth mechanism that determines the formation
   kinetics of LTH and/or even their derivatives. In this context, in situ
   Raman observation was employed to the isothermal crystallization of LTH
   nanosheet crystals from amorphous precursor precipitates. During
   isothermal crystallization, the formation of monolayered LTH nuclei is
   controlled by oxygen diffusion with an activation energy of 0.72 eV;
   anisotropic growth along (010) planes induces an interblocking effect
   among LTH nanosheet crystals, which limits their size up to 50 nm. The
   nucleation-growth crystallization kinetics of LTH nanosheets were
   accurately interpreted by the modified Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov
   (JMAK) model, which considered their anisotropic 2D growth. Beyond LTH,
   the present study that combines in situ spectroscopic monitoring with
   kinetic modeling paves the way toward deeper comprehension and ultimate
   control of the growth kinetics of 2D titanate materials.}},

Abstract = {{Operation of full-duplex systems requires efficient mitigation of the
   self-interference signal caused by the simultaneous
   transmission/reception. In this paper, we propose a maximum-likelihood
   (ML) approach to jointly estimate the self-interference and intended
   channels by exploiting its own known transmitted symbols and both the
   known pilot and unknown data symbols from the other intended
   transceiver. The ML solution is obtained by maximizing the ML function
   under the assumption of Gaussian received symbols. A closed-form
   solution is first derived, and subsequently, an iterative procedure is
   developed to further improve the estimation performance at
   moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We establish the initial
   condition to guarantee the convergence of the iterative algorithm to the
   ML solution. In the presence of considerable phase noise from the
   oscillators, a phase noise estimation method is proposed and combined
   with the ML channel estimator to mitigate the effects of the phase
   noise. Illustrative results show that the proposed methods offer good
   cancelation performance close to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).}},

Abstract = {{We consider a cooperative wireless network comprised of a source, a
   destination, and multiple relays operating in the presence of an
   eavesdropper, which attempts to tap the source-destination transmission.
   We propose a multirelay selection scheme for protecting the source
   against eavesdropping. More specifically, multirelay selection allows
   multiple relays to simultaneously forward the source's transmission to
   the destination, differing from the conventional single-relay selection,
   where only the best relay is chosen to assist in the transmission from
   the source to the destination. For the purpose of comparison, we
   consider the classic direct transmission and single-relay selection as
   benchmark schemes. We derive closed-form expressions of the intercept
   probability and the outage probability for the direct transmission, as
   well as for the single-relay and multirelay selection schemes over
   Rayleigh fading channels. It is demonstrated that as the outage
   requirement is relaxed, the intercept performance of the three schemes
   improves, and vice versa, implying that there is a
   security-versus-reliability tradeoff (SRT). We also show that both the
   single-relay and multirelay selection schemes outperform the direct
   transmission in terms of SRT, demonstrating the advantage of the relay
   selection schemes for protecting the source's transmission against the
   eavesdropping attacks. Finally, upon increasing the number of relays,
   the SRTs of both the single-relay and multirelay selection schemes
   significantly improve, and as expected, multirelay selection outperforms
   single-relay selection.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless technologies and vehicle-mounted or wearable medical sensors
   are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications. However, a
   critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare
   scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by radio
   frequency transmission. A high level of EMI may lead to a critical
   malfunction of medical sensors, and in such a scenario, a few users who
   are not transmitting emergency data could be required to reduce their
   transmit power or even temporarily disconnect from the network in order
   to guarantee the normal operation of medical sensors as well as the
   transmission of emergency data. In this paper, we propose a joint power
   and admission control algorithm to schedule the users' transmission of
   medical data. The objective of this algorithm is to minimize the number
   of users who are forced to disconnect from the network while keeping the
   EMI on medical sensors at an acceptable level. We show that a fixed
   point of proposed algorithm always exists, and at the fixed point, our
   proposed algorithm can minimize the number of low-priority users who are
   required to disconnect from the network. Numerical results illustrate
   that the proposed algorithm can achieve robust performance against the
   variations of mobile hospital environments.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a bioinert thermoplastic that
   has been investigated for its potential use in craniofacial
   reconstruction; however, its use in clinical practice is limited by a
   poor integration with adjacent bone upon implantation. To improve the
   bone-implant interface, two strategies have been employed: to modify its
   surface or to impregnate PEEK with bioactive materials. This study
   attempts to combine and improve upon the two approaches by modifying the
   internal structure into a trabecular network and to impregnate PEEK with
   mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, we compare the newly designed PEEK
   scaffolds' interactions with both bone-derived (BMSC) and adipose (ADSC)
   stem cells.
   Design Customized PEEK scaffolds were designed to incorporate a
   trabecular microstructure using a computer-aided design program and then
   printed via selective laser sintering (SLS), a 3D-printing process with
   exceptional accuracy. The scaffold structure was evaluated using
   microCT. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate
   scaffold morphology with and without mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
   Adipose and bone marrow mesenchymal cells were isolated from rats and
   cultured on scaffolds. Cell proliferation and differentiation were
   assessed using alamarBlue and alkaline phosphatase assays, respectively.
   Cell morphology after one week of co-culturing cells with PEEK scaffolds
   was evaluated using SEM.
   Results SLS 3D printing fabricated scaffolds with a porosity of
   36.38\%6.66 and density of 1.309g/cm(2). Cell morphology resembled
   viable fibroblasts attaching to the surface and micropores of the
   scaffold. PEEK scaffolds maintained the viability of both ADSCs and
   BMSCs; however, ADSCs demonstrated higher osteodifferentiation than
   BMSCs (p<0.05).
   Conclusions This study demonstrates for the first time that SLS 3D
   printing can be used to fabricate customized porous PEEK scaffolds that
   maintain the viability of adipose and bone marrow-derived MSCs and
   induce the osteodifferentiation of the adipose-derived MSCs. The
   combination of 3D printed PEEK scaffolds with MSCs could overcome some
   of the limitations using PEEK biopolymers for load-bearing bone
   regeneration in craniofacial reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Blends containing 75 wt. \% of an amorphous polylactide ( PLA) with two
   different molecular weights and 25 wt. \% of a poly{[}( butylene
   adipate)-co-terephthalate] ( PBAT) were prepared using either a
   Brabender batch mixer or a twin-screw extruder. These compounds were
   selected because blending PLA with PBAT can overcome various drawbacks
   of PLA such as its brittleness and processability limitations. In this
   study, we investigated the effects of varying the molecular weight of
   the PLA matrix and of two different mixing processes on the blend
   morphology and, further, on droplet coalescence during shearing. The
   rheological properties of these blends were investigated and the
   interfacial properties were analyzed using the Palierne emulsion model.
   Droplet coalescence was investigated by applying shear flows of 0.05 and
   0.20 s(-1) at a fixed strain of 60. Subsequently, small amplitude
   oscillatory shear tests were conducted to investigate changes in the
   viscoelastic properties. The morphology of the blends was also examined
   using scanning electron microscope ( SEM) micrographs. It was observed
   that the PBAT droplets were much smaller when twin-screw extrusion was
   used for the blend preparation. Shearing at 0.05 s(-1) induced
   significant droplet coalescence in all blends, but coalescence and
   changes in the viscoelastic properties were much more pronounced for the
   PLA-PBAT blend based on a lower molecular weight PLA. The viscoelastic
   responses were also somehow affected by the thermal degradation of the
   PLA matrix during the experiments. (C) 2016 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible natural armors from fish, alligators or armadillo are
   attracting an increasing amount of attention from their unique and
   attractive combinations of hardness, flexibility and light weight. In
   particular, the extreme contrast of stiffness between hard plates and
   surrounding soft tissues give rise to unusual and attractive mechanisms,
   which now serve as model for the design of bio-inspired armors. Despite
   a growing interest in bio-inspired flexible protection, there is little
   guidelines as to the choice of materials, optimum thickness, size, shape
   and arrangement for the protective plates. In this work, we focus on a
   failure mode we recently observed on natural and bio-inspired scaled
   armors: the unstable tilting of individual scales subjected to
   off-centered point forces. We first present a series of experiments on
   this system, followed by a model based on contact mechanics and
   friction. We condense the result into a single stability diagram which
   capture the key parameters that govern the onset of plate tilting from a
   localized force. We found that the stability of individual plates is
   governed by the location of the point force on the plate, by the
   friction at the surface of the plate, by the size of the plate and by
   the stiffness of the substrate. We finally discuss how some of these
   parameters can be optimized at the design stage to produce bio-inspired
   protective systems with desired combination of surface hardness,
   stability and flexural compliance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Multicolor single InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire light emitting diodes (LEDs)
   were fabricated on the same substrate using selective area epitaxy. It
   is observed that the structural and optical properties of InGaN/GaN
   quantum dots depend critically on nanowire diameters. Photoluminescence
   emission of single InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire structures exhibits a
   consistent blueshift with increasing nanowire diameter. This is
   explained by the significantly enhanced indium (In) incorporation for
   nanowires with small diameters, due to the more dominant contribution
   for In incorporation from the lateral diffusion of In adatoms. Single
   InGaN/GaN nanowire LEDs with emission wavelengths across nearly the
   entire visible spectral were demonstrated on a single chip by varying
   the nanowire diameters. Such nanowire LEDs also exhibit superior
   electrical performance, with a turn-on voltage similar to 2 V and
   negligible leakage current under reverse bias. The monolithic
   integration of full-color LEDs on a single chip, coupled with the
   capacity to tune light emission characteristics at the single nanowire
   level, provides an unprecedented approach to realize ultrasmall and
   efficient projection display, smart lighting, and on chip spectrometer.}},

Title = {{1D Current Source Density (CSD) Estimation in Inverse Theory: A Unified
   Framework for Higher-Order Spectral Regularization of Quadrature and

Abstract = {{Estimation of current source density (CSD) from the low-frequency part
   of extracellular electric potential recordings is an unstable linear
   inverse problem. To make the estimation possible in an experimental
   setting where recordings are contaminated with noise, it is necessary to
   stabilize the inversion. Here we present a unified framework for zero-
   and higher-order singular-value-decomposition (SVD)based spectral
   regularization of 1D (linear) CSD estimation from local field
   potentials. The framework is based on two general approaches commonly
   employed for solving inverse problems: quadrature and basis function
   expansion. We first show that both inverse CSD (iCSD) and kernel CSD
   (kCSD) fall into the category of basis function expansion methods. We
   then use these general categories to introduce two new estimation
   methods, quadrature CSD (qCSD), based on discretizing the CSD integral
   equation with a chosen quadrature rule, and representer CSD (rCSD), an
   even-determined basis function expansion method that uses the problem's
   data kernels (representers) as basis functions. To determine the best
   candidate methods to use in the analysis of experimental data, we
   compared the different methods on simulations under three regularization
   schemes (Tikhonov, tSVD, and dSVD), three regularization parameter
   selection methods (NCP, L-curve, and GCV), and seven different a priori
   spatial smoothness constraints on the CSD distribution. This resulted in
   a comparison of 531 estimation schemes. We evaluated the estimation
   schemes according to their source reconstruction accuracy by testing
   them using different simulated noise levels, lateral source diameters,
   and CSD depth profiles. We found that ranking schemes according to the
   average error over all tested conditions results in a reproducible
   ranking, where the top schemes are found to perform well in the majority
   of tested conditions. However, there is no single best estimation scheme
   that outperforms all others under all tested conditions. The unified
   framework we propose expands the set of available estimation methods,
   provides increased flexibility for 1D CSD estimation in noisy
   experimental conditions, and allows for a meaningful comparison between
   estimation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) reinforced by nanoclay platelets exhibits

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used in a large number of consumer
   products due to their antimicrobial and antifungal properties, and these
   materials may be discharged into municipal wastewater. Wastewater
   treatment, including advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), may modify the
   forms of silver in wastewater before they are discharged into surface
   waters. In addition, little is known about the changes in AgNPs that
   occur in natural waters under different environmental conditions. In
   this project, we utilized single particle ICP-MS (spICP-MS) and dynamic
   light scattering (DLS) analytical techniques to evaluate changes in the
   number and size of AgNPs in laboratory experiments with milliQ water
   under different environmental conditions, as well as during ozonation.
   Changes in the number and size of AgNPs determined by spICP-MS were
   evidence of altered stability of the nanoparticles. Increased rates of
   dissolution occurred under extremes of pH. Lower temperature decreased
   the rate of dissolution of AgNP relative to the dissolution in
   treatments at room temperature. The addition of chloride resulted in the
   loss of AgNPs from suspension due to agglomeration and precipitation.
   Ozonation led to a rapid decline in the number and size of AgNPs, as
   indicated by both spICP-MS and DLS analysis. An increase in the
   concentration of dissolved silver in the ozone treatments was evidence
   that changes in particle size were a result of oxidative dissolution of
   AgNPs to silver ion.}},

Abstract = {{Potentially hazardous near-Earth objects which can impose a significant
   threat on life on the planet have generated a lot of interest in the
   study of various asteroid deflection strategies. There are numerous
   asteroid deflection techniques suggested and discussed in the
   literature. This paper is focused on one of the non-destructive asteroid
   deflection strategies by attaching a long tether-ballast system to the
   asteroid. In the existing literature on this technique, very simplified
   models of the asteroid-tether-ballast system including a point mass
   model of the asteroid have been used. In this paper, the dynamical
   effect of using a finite size asteroid model on the asteroid deflection
   achieved is analyzed in detail. It has been shown that considering the
   finite size of the asteroid, instead of the point mass approximation,
   can have significant influence on the deflection predicted. Furthermore
   the effect of the tether-deployment stage, which is an essential part of
   any realistic asteroid deflection mission, on the predicted deflection
   is studied in this paper. Finally the effect of cutting the tether on
   the deflection achieved is analyzed and it has been shown that depending
   on the orbital properties of the asteroid as well as its size and
   rotational rate, cutting the tether at an appropriate time can increase
   the deflection achieved. Several numerical examples have been used in
   this paper to elaborate on the proposed technique and to quantitatively
   analyze the effect of different parameters on the asteroid deflection.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of alkane and alcohol molecular structures on nitric oxide
   (NO) pollutant formation trends is investigated through the study of
   C-1-C-3 alkanes and alcohols in premixed stagnation flames at
   atmospheric pressure. The flame diagnostics consist of one-dimensional
   (1-D) Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) for measurements of NO
   and CH concentrations, 1-D NO-LIF thermometry, and 1-D Particle Tracking
   Velocimetry (PTV) for the determination of flame reactivity and burning
   rates. The results show that alcohols produce less NO than their alkane
   equivalents. This behaviour is linked to the lower flame temperatures of
   alcohol flames and the tendency of alcohols to produce lower
   concentrations of the CH radical, due to inhibition of the formation of
   methyl groups. These trends are captured in the available thermochemical
   models; however, there are discrepancies regarding the formation
   pathways of NO and its intermediates which are linked to variability in
   model rate coefficients. Further adjustments to all of the
   thermochemical models are needed to accurately capture the nature of NO,
   pollutant formation in premixed alkane and alcohol flames, and this
   experimental study provides target data for this effort (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Objectives: Newborn hearing screening includes testing with otoacoustic
   emissions and the auditory brain stem response. Unfortunately, both
   tests are affected by the presence of material in the ear canal and
   middle ear such as vernix, meconium, and amniotic fluid. The objective
   of this study was to determine to what extent occlusion of the ear canal
   as seen on otoscopy affects wideband energy reflectance measurements in
   newborns. A secondary objective was to obtain additional normative
   wideband reflectance data in newborns.
   Methods: Newborns from a well-baby nursery were enrolled. Wideband
   energy reflectance measurements and otoscopy were done immediately after
   the hearing screening. Occlusion of the ear canal as seen on otoscopy
   was described on a scale of 0-100\%.
   Results: A total of 156 babies were enrolled (mean age = 25 hours). A
   statistically significant difference in the reflectance at ambient
   pressure was found between the 0-70\% and 80-100\% occlusion groups.
   There was no significant difference in reflectance between the right and
   the left ears. The median reflectance pattern generally followed that of
   previous studies but in certain frequency regions the present
   reflectance values were higher.
   Conclusion: A significant increase in reflectance occurs when 70\%-80\%
   of the ear-canal diameter is occluded. Taking otoscopy findings into
   account may improve the interpretation of reflectance measurements.
   However, further studies are required to better establish the
   relationship between canal occlusion and reflectance. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   signaEuro parts per thousand 0 A degrees C, over the period of 1961 to

   67 \% of stations, days when T (d min) a parts per thousand currency
   signaEuro parts per thousand 0 A degrees C showed a significant negative
   trend, while only 40 \% of stations showed a significant positive trend
   in days when T (d max) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand

   1967 and 1975, according to the station, while the downward trend in T
   (d min) became significant between 1962 and 1974 for the same stations.
   Changes in precipitation type across most parts of the country show a
   high correlation with these temperature trends, especially with the
   negative trend in T (d min). This suggests that future climatological
   and hydrological alterations within the country, along with ensuing
   climatic issues (e.g., change in precipitation, drought, etc.) will
   require a great deal more attention.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{There is an emerging interest in the aerospace industry to manufacture
   composite components with intricate geometries. One way to do this is by
   using a bulk moulding compound which consists of strands of
   unidirectional carbon-fibre tape. This material system is termed
   randomly-oriented strand (ROS) composites. The great design potential of
   ROS composites has been demonstrated in the literature, but the
   modelling techniques for this material are in their infancy. This paper
   proposes a stochastic 2D modelling technique for predicting strength of
   ROS composites from the mechanical properties of the individual strands.
   This model is representative of the microstructure and the
   through-the-thickness fracture morphologies characteristic to ROS
   composites. Classical laminate theory and Hashin's criteria are used to
   predict strand breakage, while interlaminar strength and fracture
   toughness are implemented to account for strand debonding. The model
   successfully predicts the strength of ROS composites, captures the
   effect of strand size on properties, depicts heterogeneous nature of the
   material, and demonstrates that failure follows the ``weakest-link{''}
   principle. It also indicates that thermoplastic ROS composites are
   superior to their thermoset (e.g. epoxy) counterparts. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Abstract = {{Functional hubs are defined as the specific brain regions with dense
   connections to other regions in a functional brain network. Among them,
   connector hubs are of great interests, as they are assumed to promote
   global and hierarchical communications between functionally specialized
   networks. Damage to connector hubs may have a more crucial effect on the
   system than does damage to other hubs. Hubs in graph theory are often
   identified from a correlation matrix, and classified as connector hubs
   when the hubs are more connected to regions in other networks than
   within the networks to which they belong. However, the identification of
   hubs from functional data is more complex than that from structural
   data, notably because of the inherent problem of multicollinearity
   between temporal dynamics within a functional network. In this context,
   we developed and validated a method to reliably identify connectors and
   corresponding overlapping network structure from resting-state fMRI.
   This new method is actually handling the multicollinearity issue, since
   it does not rely on counting the number of connections from a
   thresholded correlation matrix. The novelty of the proposed method is
   that besides counting the number of networks involved in each voxel, it
   allows us to identify which networks are actually involved in each
   voxel, using a data-driven sparse general linear model in order to
   identify brain regions involved in more than one network. Moreover, we
   added a bootstrap resampling strategy to assess statistically the
   reproducibility of our results at the single subject level. The unified
   framework is called SPARK, i.e. SParsity-based Analysis of Reliable
   k-hubness, where k-hubness denotes the number of networks overlapping in
   each voxel. The accuracy and robustness of SPARK were evaluated using
   two dimensional box simulations and realistic simulations that examined
   detection of artificial hubs generated on real data. Then, test/retest
   reliability of the method was assessed using the 1000 Functional
   Connectome Project database, which includes data obtained from 25
   healthy subjects at three different occasions with long and short
   intervals between sessions. We demonstrated that SPARK provides an
   accurate and reliable estimation of k-hubness, suggesting a promising
   tool for understanding hub organization in resting-state fMRI. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, we estimated the transportation-related emissions of
   nitrogen oxides (NOx) at an individual level for a sample of the
   Montreal population. Using linear regression, we quantified the
   associations between NOx emissions and selected individual attributes.
   We then investigated the relationship between individual emissions of
   NOx and exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations derived from a
   land-use regression model. Factor analysis and clustering of land-uses
   were used to test the relationships between emissions and exposures in
   different Montreal areas. We observed that the emissions generated per
   individual are positively associated with vehicle ownership, gender, and
   employment status. We also noted that individuals who live in the
   suburbs or in peripheral areas generate higher emissions of NOx but are
   exposed to lower NO2 concentrations at home and throughout their daily
   activities. Finally, we observed that for most individuals, NO2
   exposures based on daily activity locations were often slightly more
   elevated than NO2 concentrations at the home location. We estimated that
   between 20\% and 45\% of individuals experience a daily exposure that is
   largely different from the concentration at their home location. Our
   findings are relevant to the evaluation of equity in the generation of
   transport emissions and exposure to traffic-related air pollution. We
   also shed light on the effect of accounting for daily activities when
   estimating air pollution exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Laser powder deposition was performed on a substrate of Inconel 738
   using blended powders of Mar M247 and Amdry DF3 with a ratio of 4:1 for
   repairing purposes. In the as-deposited condition, continuous secondary
   phases composed of gamma-Ni3B eutectics and discrete (Cr, W)B borides
   were observed in inter-dendritic regions, and time-dependent nucleation
   simulation results confirmed that (Cr, W)B was the primary secondary
   phase formed during rapid solidification. Supersaturated solid solution
   of B was detected in the gamma solid solution dendritic cores. The
   Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi model was performed to predict the interfacial
   morphology and correlate the solidification front velocity (SFV) with
   dendrite tip radius. It was observed from high-resolution scanning
   electron microscopy that the dendrite tip radius of the upper region was
   in the range of 15 to 30 nm, which yielded a SFV of approx 30 cm/s. The
   continuous growth model for solute trapping behavior developed by Aziz
   and Kaplan was used to determine that the effective partition
   coefficient of B was approximately 0.025. Finally, the feasibility of
   the modeling results were rationalized with the Clyne-Kurz segregation
   simulation of B, where Clyne-Kurz prediction using a partition
   coefficient of 0.025 was in good agreement with the electron probe
   microanalysis results.}},

Abstract = {{Mineral flotation is a particle separation process based on selective
   collection on the surface of bubbles leading to formation of
   bubble-particle aggregates. The separation is driven by natural or
   induced hydrophobicity of exposed mineral areas on the particle surface.
   Performance depends on the size range of the bubble population, which in
   most cases is controlled by addition of frothers. Measurement of frother
   concentration would help achieve this control objective. A previously
   developed colorimetric technique suitable for on-site use has been
   refined to increase analysis rate and reproducibility, particularly for
   low-solubility frothers. The refinements include the sample preparation
   procedure, wavelength range for spectra collection, and criteria for
   selecting calibration standard concentrations and wavelengths. The
   refined technique is demonstrated to be robust, reliable, and accurate,
   with a daily analysis rate up to 20 samples while remaining suitable for
   on-site analyses. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium/solid polymer electrolyte (SPE)/sulfur cells were studied in
   operando by two techniques: Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and
   ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis). During the
   operation of the cell, extensive polysulfide dissolution in the solid
   polymer electrolyte (cross-linked polyethylene oxide) leads to the
   formation of a catholyte. A clear micrograph of the thick passivation
   layer on the sulfur-rich anode and the decreased SPE thickness by
   cycling confirmed the failure mechanism; the capacity decays by reducing
   the amount of active material, and by contributing to a charge
   inhibiting mechanism called polysulfide shuttle. The formation of
   elemental sulfur is clearly visible in real time during the charge
   process beyond 2.3 V. The non-destructive in operando UV-vis study also
   shows the presence of characteristic absorption peaks evolving with
   cycling, demonstrating the accumulation of various polysulfide species,
   and the predominant formation of S-4(2-) and of S-6(2-) during discharge
   and charge, respectively. This finding implies that the charge and
   discharge reactions are not completely reversible and proceed along
   different pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{As research in 2-D materials evolves toward combinations of different
   materials, interesting electronic and spintronic properties are
   revealed{''} and may be exploited in future devices. A way to combine
   materials is the formation of spatially periodic domain boundaries in an
   atom-thick monolayer: as shown in recent reports, when these domains are
   made of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, the resulting superlattice
   has half-metallic properties in which one spin component is
   (semi)metallic and the other is semiconductor. We explore here the range
   of spin-dependent electronic properties that such superlattices can
   develop for different type of domain boundaries, domain widths, and
   values of tensile strain applied to the monolayer. We show evidence of
   an interplay between strain and domain width in determining the
   electronic properties: while for armchair boundaries the bandgap is the
   same for both spin components, superlattices with zigzag boundaries
   exhibit rich spin-dependent behavior, including different bandgaps for
   each spin component, half-metallicity, and reversal of half-metallicity.
   These findings can lead to new ways of controlling the spintronic
   properties in hybrid-domain monolayers, which may be exploited in
   devices based on 2-D materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a quasi-steady-state modeling approach for an
   approximation of long-term frequency dynamics in power systems. A
   specific phenomenon of concern is an onset of frequency swings during
   load/generation imbalance scenarios. The effects of system voltage
   characteristics, system inertia, and, more importantly, damping
   controllers are explained and quantified using the described
   quasi-steady-state models. Application of the methodology to a
   14-generator benchmark system demonstrates that described models are
   suitable for simulation of different disturbance scenarios that can
   trigger frequency instability. Moreover, linearization of the proposed
   models can provide convenient means for impact assessment and
   coordinated design of damping controllers. To demonstrate this,
   coordinated tuning of multiband power system stabilizers to improve
   frequency dynamics has been performed and validated through nonlinear
   simulations using a commercial transient stability software.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A new crack propagation modeling method via the finite element method is
   developed based on the strong discontinuity approach in this study. The
   proposed method is capable of modeling a crack within a bilinear
   quadrilateral element without adding extra degrees-of-freedom in order
   to introduce a new crack. This is done by introducing constraint
   equations to extrapolate the strain fields of adjacent element to the
   element containing a crack. Then the constraint equations are used to
   eliminate the degrees-of-freedom of slave nodes located at the crack
   faces. The errors due to no-additional degrees-of-freedom are checked by
   L2-norm, stresses, and strain energy release rate. The errors are
   compared to those of standard finite element method and are not
   significantly large for practical uses. To assess the proposed crack
   growth modeling method, delamination as an interlaminar crack in
   laminated composites is simulated in a double cantilever beam and
   compared to that of VCCT for Abaqus (R). The load-opening displacement
   curves are in good agreement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Lithium iron orthosilicate (Li2FeSiO4) is an important alternative
   cathode for next generation Li-ion batteries due to its high theoretical
   capacity (330 mA h/g). However, its development has faced great
   challenges arising from significant structural complexity, including the
   disordered arrangement/orientation of Fe/Si tetrahedra, polytypes and
   its poorly understood Li storage and transport properties. In this
   context, ab-initio calculations are employed to investigate the phase
   stability and Li diffusion profiles of both monoclinic (P2(1)) and
   orthorhombic (Pmn2(1)) Li2FeSiO4 orthosilicates. The calculations
   demonstrate that formation of Li Fe antisites can induce a metastability
   competition between both phases, with neither dominating across nearly
   the entire discharging profile from Li2FeSiO4 through to LiFeSiO4.
   Furthermore, structural instability is shown to be a serious concern at
   discharge concentrations below LiFeSiO4 (1 Li extraction) due to the
   shared occupation of Li donated electrons with oxygen 2p orbitals -
   rather than the hypothesized transition to a tetravalent Fe4+ state.
   This finding is further supported by diffusion calculations that have
   determined a high activation energy barrier towards fast charging and
   rapid phase transitions. In summary, these theoretical results provide
   critical and timely insight into the structural dynamics of lithium iron
   orthosilicate, in pursuit of high energy density cathodes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Materials sharing the hollandite structure were widely reported as fast
   ionic conductors. However, the ionic conductivity of KAlSi3O8 hollandite
   (K-hollandite), which can be formed during the subduction process, has
   not been investigated so far. Here first-principles calculations are
   used to investigate the potassium ion (K+) transport properties in
   K-hollandite. The calculated K+ migration barrier energy is 0.44 eV at a
   pressure of 10 GPa, an energy quite small to block the K+ migration in
   K-hollandite channels. The calculated ionic conductivity of K-hollandite
   is highly anisotropic and depends on its concentration of K+ vacancies.
   About 6\% K+ vacancies in K-hollandite can lead to a higher conductivity
   compared to the conductivity of hydrated wadsleyite and ringwoodite in
   the mantle. K+ vacancies being commonly found in many K-hollandite
   samples with maximum vacancies over 30\%, the formation of K-hollandite
   during subduction of continental or alkali-rich oceanic crust can
   contribute to the high conductivity anomalies observed in subduction
   zones.}},

   pyrochlores: A quasi-harmonic approximation based on stable phonon modes}},

Abstract = {{Rare-earth (RE) pyrochlores are considered as promising candidate
   materials for the thermal barrier coating. In this study, we performed
   first-principles calculations, augmented by quasi-harmonic phonon
   calculations, to investigate the thermal expansion behaviors of several
   RE2Zr2O7 (RE = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) pyrochlores. Our findings show that
   RE2Zr2O7 pyrochlores exhibit lowlying optical phonon frequencies that
   correspond to RE-cation rattling vibrational modes. These frequencies
   become imaginary upon volume expansion, preventing correct determination
   of the free energy versus volume relation and thereby quantification of
   thermal expansion using QH phonon calculations. To address this
   challenge, we proposed a QH approximation approach based on stable
   phonon modes where the RE-cation rattling modes were systematically
   eliminated. This approach is shown to provide accurate predictions of
   the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of RE2Zr2O7 pyrochlores, in
   good agreement with experimental measurements and data from
   first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, we showed
   that the QH Debye model considerably overestimates the magnitudes and
   wrongly predicts the trend for the CTEs of RE2Zr2O7 pyrochlores.

Abstract = {{We designed a versatile inorganic probe based on functionalized TiO2
   nanoparticles for labeling immunoreagents and developing immunological
   tests. Similarly to enzymatic probes traditionally used in immunoassay,
   the TiO2 probe could be covalently linked to antigens or antibodies and
   exploited as the signal reporter in immunoassays. The TiO2 probe allowed
   revealing the rate of antigen-antibody complex formation by promoting
   the oxidation of a suitable chromogenic substrate with absorption in the
   visible. We demonstrated the suitability of the TiO2 probe as a label
   for immunoassay by coupling it to human serum albumin and developing a
   direct competitive as-say to measure micro-and macro-albuminuria for
   diabetes diagnosis. The developed TiO2-based assay showed high
   sensitivity (detection limit 1.4 mg l(-1)), wide dynamic range (61270 mg
   l(-1)) and acceptable precision (within-and between-assay coefficient of
   variation \%< 20\%) and accuracy (75-95 \%) for measuring albumin in
   human urine. The method is fully compatible with materials and equipment
   of standard enzyme immunoassay (except for the need of UV irradiation),
   while the inorganic probe is more robust towards chemical and physical
   conditions and shows better long term stability compared to enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the mechanisms of nanoparticle (NP) interactions with cell
   membranes is key to understanding potential NP cytotoxicity and
   applications as nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery. To elucidate
   these mechanisms of interaction, supported phospholipid bilayers (SPBs)
   are commonly used as models of cell: membranes. However, SPBs are soft
   thin films, and, as such, their properties can be significantly affected
   by the underlying substrate. Free-floating cell membranes would be best
   modeled by weakly adhered SPBs; thus, we propose a method for tailoring
   the interfacial interaction of an electrically charged SPB-substrate
   system based on modulations in the solution chemistry. Using the
   dissipation signal of the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   monitoring (QCM-D), we show that the method can be used to tailor
   SPB-substrate interactions without the loss of its structural integrity.
   To demonstrate the application of die method, SPBs are exposed to
   cationic and anionic polystyrene latex NPs. These studies reveal that
   the bilayer response to the modulations in the interfacial interaction
   with its underlying substrate can be used as a sensitive tool to probe
   the integrity of SPBs upon exposure to NPs. As expected, anionic NPs
   tend to impart no significant damage to the anionic bilayers, whereas
   cationic NPs can be detrimental to bilayer integrity. This, is the first
   report of a QCM-D based method to probe bilayer integrity following
   exposure to NPs. Importantly, the degree of SPB interaction with its
   underlying substrate is shown to be a critical factor in the kinetics of
   bilayer disruption by cationic NPs, whereby weakly adhered bilayers are
   prone to, significantly faster breakup. Since free-floating cell
   membranes are better represented by a weakly adhered SPB, the results of
   this work critically influence paradigms in experimental studies
   involving SPBs as models for cell membranes.}},

Abstract = {{The current Work emphasizes the preparation, characterization,
   retyclability, stability, and mechanistic study of nanosized Fe3+-doped
   TiO2 photocatalyst. The structural, optical, and photocatalytic
   properties of undoped and doped TiO2 were Studied by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), N-2
   absorption-desorption, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS),
   photoluminescence (PL), electron spin resonance (ESR), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy. XRD
   analysis showed that prepared powders with different iron content (200)
   100, 50, and 25 molar ratios) consisted of only anatase phase. FTIR
   study confirmed the chelation of acetate with titanium precursor
   through, the bidentate,bridge mode; as a result, the condensation
   pathways ate effectively altered by the acetate ligands favoring the
   formation of the anatase phase, this result gives further confirmation
   to the XRD analysis. A decrease in charge carrier recombination rate and
   the presence Of oxygen vacancies and related Ti3+ centers in the
   prepared photocatalysts were confirmed through PL and EPR, spectroscopic
   studies. XPS results have indicated the presence of dopant electronic
   states (Fe3+, Fe2+ and Fe4+), which could be due to substitution of Fe3+
   ions in-place of Ti4+ in the crystal lattice. UV-vis DRS spectrum showed
   that undoped TiO2 exhibits an absorption edge in the UV region, the
   position of which was shifted toward the visible region on incorporation
   of Fe3+ into it. This red shift of the optical absorption in doped, TiO2
   was the outcome of d-d transition of Fe3+ (T-2(2g) --> (2)A(2g),
   T-2(1g)) and the charge transfer transition between interacting iron
   ions (Fe3+ + Fe3+ --> Fe4+ + Fe2+). These Fe3+ 3d states in addition to
   oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ centers create band states, thereby favoring
   the electronic transition to these levels and resulting in narrowing of
   TiO2 band gap. A direct confirmation is the increase in the magnitude of
   Urbach energy with the lowering in the band gap of Fe3+-TiO2. The
   production of hydroxyl radicals (OH- + h(+) --> OH center dot) which are
   the main scavengers for the photogenerated holes (h(+)) was monitored by
   a PL technique using terephthalic acid (TA). The observed trend was
   TFe50 > TFe100 > TFe25 > TFe200 > TiO2, implying-that the TFe50 powder
   produced an enhanced amount of OH center dot radicals under light
   irradiation, which helps in its highest photocatalytic activity against
   the degradation of methylene blue and 4-chlorophenol under UV and
   visible light irradiation.}},

Abstract = {{The steady-state displacements and moments in a Bernoulli-Euler beam of
   finite width and infinite extent, resting on a poroelastic halfspace and
   subjected to a concentrated load moving at a constant velocity, were
   investigated using the concept of the equivalent stiffness of the
   halfspace. Expressions for the equivalent stiffness of the saturated
   poroelastic halfspace interacting with the infinite beam of finite width
   were derived analytically using a contour integration procedure. The
   influence of adhesion and drainage effects between the beam and the
   halfspace surface is accounted for by considering ``bounding
   techniques{''} for prescribing the boundary conditions at the interface.
   Comparisons have been made between situations for the elastic and
   poroelastic halfspace with regard to their equivalent stiffness and the
   dynamic responses of the beam for different velocities of the moving
   load. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Early age carbonation curing for precast reinforced concretes}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{134-143}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Carbonation is considered detrimental to reinforced concrete. However if
   carbonation is performed at early age through curing, the process could
   be beneficial. This paper is to present a study on a unique process that
   is developed for early age carbonation curing of precast reinforced
   concrete to maximize the performance improvement and the carbon storage
   capacity. The process includes vibration casting, in mold curing,
   off-mold preconditioning, carbonation curing and subsequent hydration.
   It was found that a carbon uptake of 16\% based on the cement content
   could reduce concrete pH to 9.2 on the surface and maintain pH of 13.0
   at core immediately after 12 h carbonation. The subsequent hydration was
   able to increase the pH on surface over 12.3 which was comparable to
   hydration reference. The carbonated concrete had shown more resistance
   to permeation by having a higher electrical resistivity on surface and
   was not more vulnerable to weathering carbonation. The off-mold
   preconditioning in open air caused no shrinkage cracking because of the
   controlled evaporation rate. The process makes concrete a sandwich
   structure with carbonate-rich surface which is responsible for strength
   gain, carbon storage and durability enhancement and is suitable for
   precast reinforced concrete production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The layered semiconductor black phosphorus has attracted attention as a
   2D atomic crystal that can be prepared in ultrathin layers for operation
   as field-effect transistors. Despite the susceptibility of black
   phosphorus to photo-oxidation, improvements to the electronic quality of
   black phosphorus devices has culminated in the observation of the
   quantum Hall effect. In this paper, we demonstrate the room-temperature
   operation of a dual-gated black phosphorus transistor operating as a
   velocity-modulated transistor, whereby modification of hole density
   distribution within a black phosphorus quantum well leads to a twofold
   modulation of hole mobility. Simultaneous modulation of Schottky-barrier
   resistance leads to a fourfold modulation of transconductance at a fixed
   hole density. Our work explicitly demonstrates the critical role of
   charge-density distribution upon charge carrier transport within 2D
   atomic crystals.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},

Volume = {{371}},
Pages = {{252-276}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Circular cylindrical shells with flexible boundary conditions conveying
   pulsatile flow and subjected to pulsatile pressure are investigated. The
   equations of motion are obtained based on the nonlinear Novozhilov shell
   theory via Lagrangian approach. The flow is set in motion by a pulsatile
   pressure gradient. The fluid is modeled as a Newtonian pulsatile flow
   and it is formulated using a hybrid model that contains the unsteady
   effects obtained from the linear potential flow theory and the pulsatile
   viscous effects obtained from the unsteady time-averaged Navier-Stokes
   equations. A numerical bifurcation analysis employs a refined reduced
   order model to investigate the dynamic behavior. The case of shells
   containing quiescent fluid subjected to the action of a pulsatile
   transmural pressure is also addressed. Geometrically nonlinear vibration
   response to pulsatile flow and transmural pressure are here presented
   via frequency-response curves and time histories. The vibrations
   involving both a driven mode and a companion mode, which appear due to
   the axial symmetry, are also investigated. This theoretical framework
   represents a pioneering study that could be of great interest for
   biomedical applications. In particular, in the future, a more refined
   model of the one here presented will possibly be applied to reproduce
   the dynamic behavior of vascular prostheses used for repairing and
   replacing damaged and diseased thoracic aorta in cases of aneurysm,
   dissection or coarctation. For this purpose, a pulsatile time-dependent
   blood flow model is here considered by applying physiological waveforms
   of velocity and pressure during the heart beating period. This study
   provides, for the first time in literature, a fully coupled
   fluid-structure interaction model with deep insights in the nonlinear
   vibrations of circular cylindrical shells subjected to pulsatile
   pressure and pulsatile flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (PADs) represent a promising
   platform technology for point-of-care diagnosis. Highly sensitive,
   rapid, and easy-to-perform immunoassays implemented on PADs are
   desirable to fulfill the promise of the PAD technology. This article
   reports the first microfluidic paper-based origami nanobiosensor
   (origami PAD), which integrates zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs) and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) biosensing mechanism, for
   label-free, ultrasensitive immunoassays. The EIS mechanism features
   simple and label-free assay operations which take less than 25 min to be
   finished, while the ZnO NWs allow covalent bonding for immobilizing
   probe proteins and improve the biosensing performance with such features
   as high surface-area-to-volume ratios and high sensitivity to surface
   binding. The calibration of the device reveals an ultralow limit of
   detection (LOD) of 60 fg mL(-1) (>100 times lower than those of existing
   PADs) for rabbit immunoglobulin G in phosphate-buffered saline. The
   detection of human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen in human serum
   with a low LOD of 300 fg mL(-1) (>33 times lower than that of a
   commercial p24 antigen test kit) is also demonstrated. This novel PAD
   design offers ultrahigh sensitivity, short assay time, and ease of
   operation, and thus possesses significant potential for low-cost, rapid
   molecular diagnosis of early-stage diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Surface immobilized bacteriophages (phages) are increasingly used as
   biorecognition elements on bacterial biosensors (e.g., on acoustical,
   electrical, or optical platforms). The phage surface density is a
   critical factor determining a sensor's bacterial binding efficiencies;
   in fact, phage surface densities that are too low or too high can result
   in significantly reduced bacterial binding capacities. Identifying an
   optimum phage surface density is thus crucial when exploiting the
   bacteriophages' bacterial capture capabilities in biosensing
   applications. Herein) we investigated surface immobilization of the
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa specific E79 (tailed) phage and the Salmonella
   Typhimurium specific PRD1 (nontailed) phage and their subsequent
   bacterial capture abilities using quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The QCM-D was used in two experimental
   setups: (i) a conventional setup and (ii) a combined setup with
   ellipsometry. Both setups were exploited to link the phages'
   immobilization behaviors to their bacterium capture efficiency. While
   E79 displayed characteristic optima in both the mechanical (QCM-D) and
   the optical (ellipsometry) data that coincided with its specific
   bacterial capture optimum, no optima were observed during PRD1
   immobilization. The characteristic optima suggests that the E79 phage
   undergoes a surface rearrangement event that changes the hydration state
   of the phage film, thereby impairing the E79 phage's ability to capture
   bacteria. However, the absence of such optima during deposition of the
   nontailed PRD1 phage suggests that other mechanisms may also lead to
   reduced bacterial capture by surface immobilized bacteriophages.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates heat transfer performance and entropy generation of
   laminar flow in coiled tubes with various cross-sections geometries i.e.
   circular, ellipse and square, relatives to the straight tubes of similar
   cross-sections. A computational fluid dynamics model is developed and
   validated against empirical correlations. Good agreement is obtained
   within range of Reynolds and Dean numbers considered. Effect of
   geometry, wall temperature, Reynolds number and heating/cooling mode
   were examined. To evaluate the heat transfer performance of the coiled
   tube configurations, a parameter referred as Figure of Merit (FoM) is
   defined as the ratio heat transfer rate to the required pumping power.
   In addition, exergy analysis is carried out to examine the inefficiency
   of the coiled tube configurations. The results indicate that coiled
   tubes provide higher heat transfer rate. In addition, it was found to be
   more efficient as reflected by lower entropy generation as compared to
   straight tubes. Among the studied cross-section, square cross-section
   generates the highest entropy, followed by ellipse and circular
   counterpart. Entropy production from heat transfer contribution is two
   order-of-magnitude higher than that of entropy contribution from viscous
   dissipation. Cooling case produces slightly higher entropy than heating
   counterpart. Finally, this study can provide practical guideline to
   design more efficient coiled heat exchanger. Crown Copyright (C) 2016

   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The amide I region between the
   wavelengths 1700-1600 cm(-1) of the spectra were studied for different
   thermal and high electric field treatments. Within thermal treatments,
   both hot air roasting and microwave processing treatments were
   evaluated. Hot air treatments were performed at temperatures of 50, 75,
   and 100 degrees C from 15, 30, and 45 min while the microwave treatments
   were conducted at the same temperatures, but for 5, 10, 15, and 20 min.
   Three experimental conditions were evaluated for the electric field
   intensity of 10, 15, and 20 kV for 60, 120, and 180 min. Changes were
   observed at 1654-1650 cm(-1), indicating conformational changes in the
   alpha-helix secondary structure. Similar changes were observed at
   various other wavelengths indicating changes in the 3/10 helix,
   beta-sheets and random coils present in the protein. With an increase in
   the treatment time, the secondary structure reorganizations increased
   with the creation of new random coils and aggregated strands.
   Curve-fitting using Gaussian band shapes further supported the
   observations. In vitro protein digestibility studies were also performed
   and the protein changes also supported the observations from the
   spectra.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a high electric field on secondary structure conformation

Abstract = {{Combining high strength, hardness and high toughness remains a
   tremendous challenge in materials engineering. Interestingly nature
   overcomes this limitation, with materials such as bone which display
   unusual combinations of these properties in spite of their weak
   constituents. In these materials, highly mineralized ``building-blocks''
   provide stiffness and strength, while weak interfaces between the blocks
   channel non-linear deformation and trigger powerful toughening
   mechanisms. This strategy is also exploited in multilayered ceramics,
   fiber-reinforced composites, and more recently in
   topologically-interlocked materials. In this work we apply these
   concepts to the toughening of glass panels by incorporating internal
   architectures carved within the material using three-dimensional laser
   engraving. Glass is relatively stiff and hard but it has no
   microstructure, no inelastic deformation mechanism, low toughness and
   poor resistance to impacts. We demonstrate how introducing controlled
   architectures in glass completely changes how this material deforms and
   fails. In particular, our new architectured glass panels can resist
   about two to four times more impact energy than plain glass. Our
   architectured glass also displays nonlinear deformation, progressive
   damage and failure contained within a few building blocks. This work
   demonstrates how micro-architecture, bio-inspiration and top-down
   fabrication strategies provide new pathways to transform the mechanics
   and performance of materials and structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objectives of this work is develop an innovative multidisciplinary
   methodology to estimate shelter needs and evacuation scenarios in the
   event of a major earthquake in a region of moderate seismic activity
   that never experienced such an event in modern history. Shelter demand
   is estimated through a binary discrete choice model based on a carefully
   designed survey using methodologies developed by seismologists,
   structural engineers, urban planners and transportation engineers. For
   each scenario, shelter allocation is based on the spatial distribution
   of damage and population. The methodology is demonstrated for the city
   of Montreal which is located in a moderately active seismic region. The
   results of the choice model are compared to those obtained with the
   HAZUS methodology which underestimates shelter needs. The study finds
   that the factors influencing evacuation decisions in HAZUS are also
   important for Montreal; however, other additional variables such as road
   condition, distance between home and shelter, power outage, and number
   of children are also significant. The traffic model is applied after the
   earthquake for the most vulnerable areas in Montreal. The OREMS software
   is used to simulate traffic behavior during emergency evacuations and
   identifies evacuation links with potential traffic congestion. The
   traffic performance of highways is better than arterial roads in the
   highly vulnerable areas. Most of the main roads and access roads in the
   Plateau Mont-Royal and Cote-de-Neiges boroughs are highly congested in
   the aftermath of earthquake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tether-nets are one of the more promising methods for the active removal
   of space debris. The aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of this
   type of systems in space, which is still not well-known and the
   simulation of which has multiple outstanding issues. In particular, the
   focus is on the deployment and capture phases of a net-based active
   debris removal mission, and on the effect of including the bending
   stiffness of the net threads on the dynamical characteristics of the net
   and on the computational efficiency. Lumped-parameter modeling of the
   net in Vortex Dynamics, without bending stiffness representation, is
   introduced first and validated then, against results obtained with an
   equivalent model in Matlab, using numerical simulations of the
   deployment phase. A model able to reproduce the bending stiffness of the
   net in Vortex Dynamics is proposed, and the outcome of a net deployment
   simulation is compared to the results of simulation without bending
   stiffness. A simulation of net-based capture of a derelict spacecraft is
   analyzed from the point of view of evaluating the effect of modeling the
   bending stiffness. From comparison of simulations with and without
   bending stiffness representation, it is found that bending stiffness has
   a significant influence both on the simulation results and on the
   computation time. When bending stiffness is included, the net is more
   resistant to the changes in its shape caused both by the motion of the
   corner masses (during deployment) and by the contact with the debris
   (during capture). (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The transport properties and mechanisms of fractured porous media are
   very important for oil and gas reservoir engineering, hydraulics,
   environmental science, chemical engineering, etc. In this paper, a
   fractal dual-porosity model is developed to estimate the equivalent
   hydraulic properties of fractured porous media, where a fractal
   tree-like network model is used to characterize the fracture system
   according to its fractal scaling laws and topological structures. The
   analytical expressions for the effective permeability of fracture system
   and fractured porous media, tortuosity, fracture density and fraction
   are derived. The proposed fractal model has been validated by
   comparisons with available experimental data and numerical simulation.
   It has been shown that fractal dimensions for fracture length and
   aperture have significant effect on the equivalent hydraulic properties
   of fractured porous media. The effective permeability of fracture system
   can be increased with the increase of fractal dimensions for fracture
   length and aperture, while it can be remarkably lowered by introducing
   tortuosity at large branching angle. Also, a scaling law between the
   fracture density and fractal dimension for fracture length has been
   found, where the scaling exponent depends on the fracture number. The
   present fractal dual-porosity model may shed light on the transport
   physics of fractured porous media and provide theoretical basis for oil
   and gas exploitation, underground water, nuclear waste disposal and
   geothermal energy extraction as well as chemical engineering, etc.}},

Title = {{Incorporating the impact of spatio-temporal interactions on bicycle
   sharing system demand: A case study of New York CitiBike system}},

Abstract = {{Recent success of bicycle-sharing systems (BSS) have led to their growth
   around the world. Not surprisingly, there is increased research towards
   better understanding of the contributing factors for BSS demand.
   However, these research efforts have neglected to adequately consider
   spatial and temporal interaction of BSS station's demand (arrivals and
   departures). It is possible that bicycle arrival and departure rates of
   one BSS station are potentially inter connected with bicycle flow rates
   for neighboring stations. It is also plausible that the arrival and
   departure rates at one time period are influenced by the arrival and
   departure rates of earlier time periods for that station and neighboring
   stations. Neglecting the presence of such effects, when they are
   actually present will result in biased model estimates. The major
   objective of this study is to accommodate for spatial and temporal
   effects (observed and unobserved) for modelling bicycle demand employing
   data from New York City's bicycle-sharing system (CitiBike). Towards
   this end, spatial error and spatial lag models that accommodate for the
   influence of spatial and temporal interactions are estimated. The
   exogenous variables for these models are drawn from BSS infrastructure,
   transportation network infrastructure, land use, point of interests, and
   meteorological and temporal attributes. The results provide strong
   evidence for the presence of spatial and temporal dependency for BSS
   station's arrival and departure rates. A hold out sample validation
   exercise further emphasizes the improved accuracy of the models with
   spatial and temporal interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Mode Optical Microdisks}},
Journal = {{BIOSENSORS-BASEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) microresonators have recently been studied
   as a means to achieve real-time label-free detection of biological
   targets such as virus particles, specific DNA sequences, or proteins.
   Due to their high quality (Q) factors, WGM resonators can be highly
   sensitive. A biosensor also needs to be selective, requiring proper
   functionalization of its surface with the appropriate ligand that will
   attach the biomolecule of interest. In this paper, WGM microdisks are
   used as biosensors for detection of Staphylococcus aureus. The
   microdisks are functionalized with LysK, a phage protein specific for
   staphylococci at the genus level. A binding event on the surface shifts
   the resonance peak of the microdisk resonator towards longer
   wavelengths. This reactive shift can be used to estimate the surface
   density of bacteria that bind to the surface of the resonator. The limit
   of detection of a microdisk with a Q-factor around 10(4) is on the order
   of 5 pg/mL, corresponding to 20 cells. No binding of Escherichia coli to
   the resonators is seen, supporting the specificity of the
   functionalization scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a clinical prototype with a wearable patient
   interface for microwave breast cancer detection. The long-term aim of
   the prototype is a breast health monitoring application. The system
   operates using multistatic time-domain pulsed radar, with 16 flexible
   antennas embedded into a bra. Unlike the previously reported,
   table-based prototype with a rigid cup-like holder, the wearable one
   requires no immersion medium and enables simple localization of breast
   surface. In comparison with the table-based prototype, the wearable one
   is also significantly more cost-effective and has a smaller footprint.
   To demonstrate the improved functionality of the wearable prototype, we
   here report the outcome of daily testing of the new, wearable prototype
   on a healthy volunteer over a 28-day period. The resulting data (both
   signals and reconstructed images) is compared to that obtained with our
   table-based prototype. We show that the use of the wearable prototype
   has improved the quality of collected volunteer data by every
   investigated measure. This work demonstrates the proof-of-concept for a
   wearable breast health monitoring array, which can be further optimized
   in the future for use with patients with various breast sizes and tissue
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents and analyzes the design of a 1-V ultra-low power,
   compact, and wideband low-noise amplifier (LNA). The proposed LNA uses
   common-gate (CG) NMOS and PMOS transistors as input devices in a
   complementary current-reuse structure. Low power input matching is
   achieved by employing an active shunt-feedback architecture while the
   current of the feedback stage is also reused by the input transistor to
   improve the current efficiency of the LNA. A forward body biasing (FBB)
   scheme is exploited to tune the feedback coefficient. The complementary
   characteristics of the input stage leads to partial second-order
   distortion cancellation. The proposed inductorless LNA is implemented in
   an IBM 0.13-mu m 1P8M CMOS technology and occupies only 0.0052 mm(2).
   The measured LNA has a 12.3-dB gain 4.9-dB minimum noise figure (NF)
   input referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) of -10 dBm and
   0.1-2.2-GHz bandwidth (BW), while consuming only 400 mu A from a 1-V

Abstract = {{This paper presents a complete methodology to model, design, and
   implement wide tuning-range phase-locked loops (PLLs) using a top-down
   approach. Mathematical equations that illustrate the contribution of the
   different sources of noise in the PLL are presented. Behavioral models
   that encompass the nonidealities of the PLL components are described
   using Verilog-A language. The PLL components are designed, and the noise
   performance of each component is evaluated using transistor-level
   simulations. The extracted jitter from the individual blocks is used to
   find the overall system noise. The proposed methodology considers the
   variations in the loop dynamics due to changes in the voltage-controlled
   oscillator gain and noise, frequency divider ratio, and charge pump
   current. While optimizing the PLL for maximum tuning range, the
   methodology also considers the tradeoff between the noise, speed, and
   reference spurs attenuation. The design and implementation of an
   integer-N frequency synthesizer PLL that covers a continuous frequency
   range from 156.25 MHz to 10 GHz using a 65-nm CMOS technology is
   demonstrated in this paper. Measurement results to verify the accuracy
   of the models and to validate the predictions made by the simulations

Abstract = {{Current software projects deal with exceptions in implementation and
   maintenance phases without a clear definition of exception handling
   policies. We call an exception handling policy the set of design
   decisions that govern the use of exceptions in a software project.
   Without an explicit exception handling policy, developers can remain
   unaware of the originally intended use of exceptions. In this paper, we
   present Exception Handling Policies Language (EPL), a domain-specific
   language to specify and verify exception handling policies. The
   evaluation of EPL was based on a user-centric observational study and
   case studies. The user-centric study was performed to observe how
   potential users of the language actually use it. With this study, we
   could better understand the trade-offs related to different language
   design decisions based on concrete and well-documented observations and
   experiences reported by participants. We identified some language
   characteristics that hindered its use and that motivated new language
   constructs. In addition, we performed case studies with one open-source
   project and two industry-strength systems to investigate how specifying
   and verifying exception handling policies may assist in detecting
   exception handling problems. The results show that violations of
   exception handling policies help to indicate potential faults in the
   exception handling code.}},

Abstract = {{This paper has two objectives: (i) to introduce a new approach in order
   to gain widespread support for road pricing; and (ii) to develop a
   detailed social welfare analysis for road pricing schemes. We first
   describe our novel approach that stimulates public support for road
   pricing, which we refer to as an investment public-private partnership,
   or IP3. This approach returns a significant portion of the economic
   value created by road pricing back to the citizens who own the newly
   priced facility. We then present a social welfare framework that
   estimates the benefits and costs of using the IP3 approach on an urban
   transportation network. A P3 project's impact on overall social welfare
   provides a more comprehensive evaluation criterion than the often-used
   Value for Money (VfM) analysis. Apart from several theoretical studies,
   a detailed social welfare analysis that includes all major P3 project
   stakeholders is absent from the literature. We use Fresno, California as
   our case study in order to conduct a welfare analysis on IP3s. Our
   results show that system-optimal tolling favors average users, but that
   government and consequently taxpayers should pay for costly tolling
   systems (negative profits). In contrast, unlimited profit-maximizing
   tolls raise substantial profits for government, for the infrastructure's
   citizen-owners, and for the private sector, but the average user is
   worse off. From a social-welfare perspective, one should search for a
   Pareto improvement under which all major stakeholders are better off.
   Our estimates indicate that a mixed public and private tolling scheme
   offers such an improvement. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Stochastic frontier estimation of budgets for Kuhn-Tucker demand
   systems: Application to activity time-use analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{117-133}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We propose a stochastic frontier approach to estimate budgets for the
   multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. The approach
   is useful when the underlying time and/or money budgets driving a choice
   situation are unobserved, but the expenditures on the choice
   alternatives of interest are observed. Several MDCEV applications
   hitherto used the observed total expenditure on the choice alternatives
   as the budget to model expenditure allocation among choice alternatives.
   This does not allow for increases or decreases in the total expenditure
   due to changes in choice alternative specific attributes, but only
   allows a reallocation of the observed total expenditure among different
   alternatives. The stochastic frontier approach helps address this issue
   by invoking the notion that consumers operate under latent budgets that
   can be conceived (and modeled) as the maximum possible expenditure they
   are willing to incur. The proposed method is applied to analyze the
   daily out-of-home activity participation and time-use patterns in a
   survey sample of non-working adults in Florida. First, a stochastic
   frontier regression is performed on the observed out-of-home activity
   time expenditure (OH-ATE) to estimate the unobserved out-of-home
   activity time frontier (OH-ATF). The estimated frontier is interpreted
   as a subjective limit or maximum possible time individuals can allocate
   to out-of-home activities and used as the time budget governing
   out-of-home time-use choices in an MDCEV model. The efficacy of this
   approach is compared with other approaches for estimating time budgets
   for the MDCEV model, including: (a) a log-linear regression on the total
   observed expenditure for out-of-home activities and (b) arbitrarily
   assumed, constant time budgets for all individuals in the sample. A
   comparison of predictive accuracy in time-use patterns suggests that the
   stochastic frontier and log-linear regression approaches perform better
   than arbitrary assumptions on time budgets. Between the stochastic
   frontier and log-linear regression approaches, the former results in
   slightly better predictions of activity participation rates while the
   latter results in slightly better predictions of activity durations. A
   comparison of policy simulations demonstrates that the stochastic
   frontier approach allows for the total out-of-home activity time
   expenditure to either expand or shrink due to changes in
   alternative-specific attributes. The log-linear regression approach
   allows for changes in total time expenditure due to changes in
   decision-maker attributes, but not due to changes in
   alternative-specific attributes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the modal interactions in the nonlinear,

   plate theory as well as Kirchhoff's hypotheses by means of the Lagrange
   equations. The equations of motions are solved using the
   pseudo-arclength continuation technique and direct time-integration
   method. The system parameters are tuned to the values associated with
   modal interactions, and then nonlinear resonant responses and energy
   transfer are analysed. Nonlinear motion characteristics are shown in the
   form of frequency-response and force-response curves, time histories,
   phase-plane portraits, and fast Fourier transforms.}},

Abstract = {{Boussinesq's problem for the indentation of an isotropic, homogeneous

   indentation in the presence of the interior loading is referred to as
   the Boussinesq-Mindlin problem, which has important applications in the
   area of geomechanics. The Boussinesq-Mindlin problem, which represents a
   self-stressing loading configuration, serves as a useful model for
   interpreting the mechanics of indentation of geologic media for purposes

   coefficients into the diffusion combination step and update the
   combination weights dynamically in the face of randomly changing
   neighborhoods due to fading conditions. When channel state information
   (CSI) is unavailable, we determine the equalization factors from
   pilot-aided channel coefficient estimates. The analysis reveals that by
   properly monitoring the CSI over the network and choosing sufficiently
   small adaptation step-sizes, the diffusion strategies are able to
   deliver satisfactory performance in the presence of fading and path

Abstract = {{The tethered formation and the coulomb formation are two important
   concepts in constructing satellite formation architecture, and they have
   the advantage that the relative motion between satellites can be
   maintained quite accurately with minimal active control. In this study,
   a formation termed the ``coulomb tether double-pyramid{''} is proposed
   to combine the best features of the tethered formation and the coulomb
   formation. Chief and deputy satellites are charged bodies and located in
   the Earth-facing plane normal to the geostationary orbit, with the chief
   at the center. Each deputy is connected with two anchor satellites via a
   massless, straight tether, such that the Earth-facing plane can be
   maintained by using gravity-gradient torques. First, the equations of
   motion are obtained via Lagrange equations. Then, the charges and tether
   extensions necessary to support a Hill-frame stationary formation are
   analytically determined. Finally, open-loop charge control strategies
   are designed to maintain the spinning formation or carry out
   reconfiguration. The proposed coulomb tether double-pyramid formation
   has great potential to enhance the surveillance and imaging of Earth
   objects in future missions.}},

Abstract = {{Human serum albumin nanoparticles (HSA-NPs) are widely-used drug
   delivery systems with applications in various diseases, like cancer. For
   intravenous administration of HSA-NPs, the particle size, surface
   charge, drug loading and in vitro release kinetics are important
   parameters for consideration. This study focuses on the development of
   stable HSA-NPs containing the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) via the
   emulsion-solvent evaporation method using a high-pressure homogenizer.
   The key parameters for the preparation of PTX-HSA-NPs are: the starting
   concentrations of HSA, PTX and the organic solvent, including the
   homogenization pressure and its number cycles, were optimized. Results
   indicate a size of 143.4 +/- 0.7 nm and 170.2 +/- 1.4 nm with a surface
   charge of -5.6 +/- 0.8 mV and -17.4 +/- 0.5 mV for HSA-NPs and
   PTX-HSA-NPs (0.5 mg/mL of PTX), respectively. The yield of the
   PTX-HSA-NPs was similar to 93\% with an encapsulation efficiency of
   similar to 82\%. To investigate the safety and effectiveness of the
   PTX-HSA-NPs, an in vitro drug release and cytotoxicity assay was
   performed on human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). The PTX-HSA-NPs
   showed dose-dependent toxicity on cells of 52\%, 39.3\% and 22.6\% with
   increasing concentrations of PTX at 8, 20.2 and 31.4 mu g/mL,
   respectively. In summary, all parameters involved in HSA-NPs'
   preparation, its anticancer efficacy and scale-up are outlined in this

Title = {{Effects of thermal and electric fields on soybean trypsin inhibitor
   protein: A molecular modelling study}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{9-20}},

Abstract = {{This study uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in investigating the
   unusual stability of Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor (STI) protein. The
   effects of temperature and oscillating electric fields (0.5 V/nm and
   2.45 GHz) have been used to perform simulations using GROMACS software.
   The conformational changes in the protein were studies using root mean
   square deviations and secondary structure analysis (STRIDE). It was
   found that significant rearrangements took place within the protein
   especially in `turns' and `coils', but the core structure was stable
   under external stresses because of the antiparalle beta-sheet structure.
   This study also provides evidence that the aromatic residues play a
   major role in stabilizing the STI protein using Solvent Accessible
   Surface Area (SASA) analysis. Ramachandran plots were also used to
   analyze the stability of the molecules obtained on treatment with
   temperatures (300 K to 393 K) and oscillating electric fields.
   Industrial relevance: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques have
   been applied to visualize and predict the behaviour of proteins during
   food processing, and changes in their structure under the influence of
   external field stress.
   This study can be used to understand the changes at molecular level that
   could help industrialists to design processing methods with increased
   nutritive and sensory appeal of food products. This work can also
   contribute to the optimization of process parameters to enhance the
   functional properties of protein and increase protein digestibility. (C)

Abstract = {{To assess the effect of strain and strain rate on texture evolution of

   Samples were prepared in the extrusion direction (ED) and normal

   and with different strain rates of 0.01 sec(-1) and 1 sec(-1) and
   different strains. Microstructural observation and texture investigation
   show that at early stages of deformation, extension twins lead to the
   development of strong basal texture intensity along rolling direction
   (RD) in ED samples and contraction twins result in texture evolution
   along transverse direction (TD) in ND samples. Also, microstructural
   investigation at high strains reveals that dynamic recrystallization
   occurs in both samples and consequently the basal texture intensity has
   been decreased. (C) 2016 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on

Abstract = {{Atomistic simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) are emerging as a

   computing the loss tangent with an estimated uncertainty of 7\%. The
   dissipation spectrum displays a sharp peak at 50 K and a broad peak at
   around 160 K. Damping is a weak function of frequency at room
   temperature, and the loss tangent has a remarkably high value of similar
   to 0.01. In contrast, at low temperatures (15 K), the loss tangent
   increases monotonically from 4 x 10(-4) to 4 x 10(-3) as the frequency
   increases from 2 GHz to 50 GHz. The mechanisms of dissipation are

Title = {{Diagenesis-inspired reaction of magnesium ions with surface enamel
   mineral modifies properties of human teeth}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{174-183}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mineralized tissues such as teeth and bones consist primarily of highly
   organized apatitic calcium phosphate crystallites within a complex
   organic matrix. The dimensions and organization of these apatite
   crystallites at the nanoscale level determine in part the physical
   properties of mineralized tissues. After death, geological processes
   such as diagenesis and dolomitization can alter the crystallographic
   properties of mineralized tissues through cycles of dissolution and
   re-precipitation occurring in highly saline environments. Inspired by
   these natural exchange phenomena, we investigated the effect of
   hypersalinity on tooth enamel. We discovered that magnesium ions reacted
   with human tooth enamel through a process of dissolution and
   re-precipitation, reducing enamel crystal size at the surface of the
   tooth. This change in crystallographic structure made the teeth harder
   and whiter. Salt-water rinses have been used for centuries to ameliorate
   oral infections; however, our discovery suggests that this ancient
   practice could have additional unexpected benefits.
   Statement of Significance
   Here we describe an approach inspired by natural geological processes to
   modify the properties of a biomineral- human tooth enamel. In this study
   we showed that treatment of human tooth enamel with solutions saturated
   with magnesium induced changes in the nanocrystals at the outer surface
   of the protective enamel layer. As a consequence, the physical
   properties of the tooth were modified; tooth microhardness increased and
   the color shade became whiter, thus suggesting that this method could be
   used as a clinical treatment to improve dental mechanical properties and
   esthetics. Such an approach is simple and straightforward, and could
   also be used to develop new strategies to synthesize and modify
   biominerals for biomedical and industrial applications. (c) 2016 Acta

Abstract = {{Seismic fragility curves provide a powerful tool to assess the
   reliability of structures. However, conventional fragility analysis of
   structures comprising a large number of components requires enormous
   computational efforts. In this paper, the application of probabilistic
   support vector machines (PSVM) for the system fragility analysis of
   existing structures is proposed. It is demonstrated that support vector
   machine based fragility curves provide accurate predictions compared to
   rigorous methodologies such as component based fragilities developed by
   Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed method is applied to an existing
   bridge structure in order to develop fragility curves for serviceability
   and collapse limit states. In addition, the efficiency of using the PSVM
   method in the application of vector-valued ground motion intensity
   measures (IM) as well as traditional single-valued IM are investigated.
   The results obtained from an incremental dynamic analysis of the
   structure are used to train PSVMs. The application of PSVM in binary and
   multi-class classifications is used for the fragility analysis and
   reliability assessment of the bridge structure.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the role of waves in the development of the
   instability of an unbounded transverse mixing layer in shallow waters.
   In supercritical state waves become significant. The matching of the
   wave-like asymptotic solution in the far field to the solutions near the
   inflection and the returning surfaces poses a difficult mathematical
   problem. We therefore conducted numerical simulations to find solutions
   directly from the shallow water equations. The simulations found that
   the growing waves in the unstable current had a consistent structure
   throughout the linear stage of the instability's development. The
   excitation, reflection, and transmission of waves produced a modulating
   instability that maintained a consistent structure as the amplitude of
   the instability increased over many orders of magnitude. This role of
   the waves on the supercritical instability, as delineated by our
   numerical simulations, is not solely describable by the classical
   analytical method.}},

   control and reduction of the loading of chemicals to water bodies
   requires knowledge on the contribution of agricultural systems to water
   pollution under different cropping management practices. In this study,
   DRAINMOD model was implemented to predict the effects of conventional
   tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) treatments on water table depth, tile
   effluent and NO3-N losses through subsurface drainage from a 14 ha
   agricultural field at the Green Belt Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food
   Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. During the study period, flow was
   significantly higher under NT than CT mainly during the snowmelt and
   spring periods. Total nitrate loss under NT was higher than CT but the
   difference was not significant during the 4 years of study period. The
   climate change scenario of PRECIS was then applied to assess the effect
   of tillage practices under future climate change. In the future, the
   changes in climate will result in a significant increase in flow and
   nitrate under both NT and CT practices. It was also noted that, in
   future, NO3-N losses under no till treatment are expected to be
   significantly higher than those under conventional tillage practices in
   future. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Novel Record-Extension Technique for Water Quality Variables Based on
   L-Moments}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{227}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Extension of hydrological or water quality records at short-gauged
   stations using information from another long-gauged station is termed
   record extension. The ordinary least squares regression (OLS) is a
   traditional and commonly used record-extension technique. However, OLS
   is more appropriate for the substitution of scattered missing values
   than for record-extension as the OLS provides extended records with
   underestimated variance. Underestimation of the variance of the extended
   records leads to underestimation of high percentiles and overestimation
   of low percentiles given that the data is normally distributed, The
   Maintenance of Variance Extension techniques (MOVE) have the advantage
   of maintaining the variance in the extended records. However, the OLS
   and MOVE techniques are sensitive to the presence of outliers. Two new
   record-extension techniques with the advantage of being robust in the
   presence of outliers were recently proposed by the authors: the robust
   line of organic correlation (RLOC) and modified version of the
   Kendall-Theil Robust line (KTRL2). In this study a new robust technique
   is proposed. The new regression technique based on L-moments (LMOM) is a
   modified version of the RLOC and uses the same intercept as that of RLOC
   and KTRL2 while the estimated slope is based on the second L-moment. An
   empirical examination of the preservation of the water quality variable
   characteristics was carried out using water quality records from the
   Nile Delta water quality monitoring network in Egypt. A comparison
   between nine record extension techniques (OLS, MOVE I to MOVE4, KTRL,
   KTRL2, RLOC and LMOM) was performed to examine the extended records for
   bias and standard error in their statistical moment estimates and over
   the full range of percentiles. Results showed that the proposed LMOM
   technique outperforms other techniques by producing extended records
   that preserve variance as well as extreme percentiles.}},

Title = {{A system dynamics based socio-hydrological model for agricultural
   wastewater reuse at the watershed scale}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{89-107}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop and verify a socio-hydrological
   model using system dynamics (SD), thereby combining a deterministic
   conceptual hydrological model and a social model incorporating
   population, land use, economics, technology, and policy dimensions.
   Applied to a central South Korean watershed where wastewater is reused
   for paddy irrigation, the present model was verified in terms of
   structure and behavior. Structural validity was confirmed when expected
   simulation sensitivity and consistency criteria were met during behavior
   sensitivity and extreme conditions tests. The model's behavioral
   validity in predicting hydrological processes including
   evapotranspiration, stream flow, and groundwater level, was also
   confirmed as the calibrated model performance during the validation
   period showed good agreement with those of the Soil and Water Assessment
   Tool (SWAT) model, validated for the study watershed, as well as
   observed groundwater levels. The values of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
   (E-NS), percent bias (PBIAS), and R-2 which compared model results with
   those of the SWAT model were 0.77,3.0\%, and 0.79, respectively, for the
   evapotranspiration, and 0.69, 1.4\%, and 0.75, respectively, for the
   stream flow, while the generated and observed groundwater levels
   exhibited a linear relationship with an R-2 value of 0.70. The validated
   model indicated that urbanization within the study watershed could lead
   to increased stream flow and greater wastewater reuse. Instream flow
   regulation led to a decrease in stream flow tied to a lower base flow,
   and a decrease in social benefits associated with a decline in
   wastewater reuse. An assessment was made of the SD-based
   socio-hydrological model's usefulness when acting as an element of an
   integrated framework in providing a better understanding of small-scale
   socio-hydrological systems' interactions and the underlying causes of
   general trends and problems. SD-based socio-hydrological modeling was
   deemed a suitable decision-support framework for designing water
   resource policies contributing to successful integrated water resources
   management practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cranberry derivatives enhance biofilm formation and transiently impair

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Proteus mirabilis is a major cause of catheter-associated urinary tract
   infection (CAUTI), emphasizing that novel strategies for targeting this
   bacterium are needed. Potential targets are P. mirabilis
   surface-associated swarming motility and the propensity of these
   bacteria to form biofilms that may lead to catheter blockage. We
   previously showed that the addition of cranberry powder (CP) to lysogeny
   broth (LB) medium resulted in impaired P. mirabilis swarming motility
   over short time periods (up to 16 h). Herein, we significantly expanded
   on those findings by exploring (i) the effects of cranberry derivatives
   on biofilm formation of P. mirabilis, (ii) whether swarming inhibition
   occurred transiently or over longer periods more relevant to real
   infections (similar to 3 days), (iii) whether swarming was also blocked
   by commercially available cranberry juices, (iv) whether CP or cranberry
   juices exhibited effects under natural urine conditions, and (v) the
   effects of cranberry on medium pH, which is an indirect indicator of
   urease activity. At short time scales (24 h), CP and commercially
   available pure cranberry juice impaired swarming motility and repelled
   actively swarming bacteria in LB medium. Over longer time periods more
   representative of infections (similar to 3 days), the capacity of the
   cranberry material to impair swarming diminished and bacteria would
   start to migrate across the surface, albeit by exhibiting a different
   motility phenotype to the regular ``bull's-eye{''} swarming phenotype of
   P. mirabilis. This bacterium did not swarm on urine agar or LB agar
   supplemented with urea, suggesting that any potential application of
   anti-swarming compounds may be better suited to settings external to the
   urine environment. Anti-swarming effects were confounded by the ability
   of cranberry products to enhance biofilm formation in both LB and urine
   conditions. These findings provide key insights into the long-term
   strategy of targeting P. mirabilis CAUTIs.}},

Title = {{Does ``lie to me{''} lie to you? An evaluation of facial clues to
   high-stakes deception}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{52-68}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{During a forensic interview, high-stakes deception is very prevalent
   notwithstanding the heavy consequences that may result. Studies have
   shown that most untrained people cannot perform well in discerning liars
   and truth-tellers.
   Some psychological studies have stated that certain facial actions are
   more difficult to inhibit if the associated facial expressions are
   genuine. Similarly, these facial expressions are equally difficult to
   fake. This has cast light on the possibility that deception could be
   detected by analyzing these facial actions. However, to the best
   knowledge of the authors, there is no computer vision research that has
   attempted to discriminate high-stakes deception from truth using facial
   expressions. Therefore, this paper aims to test the validity of facial
   clues to deception detection in high-stakes situations using computer
   vision approaches.
   We also note that only a limited number of the existing databases have
   been collected specifically for deception detection studies and none of
   them were obtained from real-world situations. In this paper we present
   a video database of actual high-stakes situations, which we have created
   using YouTube.
   We have adopted 2D appearance-based methods as the methodology to
   characterize the 3D facial features. Instead of building a 3D head model
   as is the current trend, we have extracted invariant 2D features that
   are related to the 3D characteristic from nine separate facial regions
   by using dynamic facial analysis: eye blink, eyebrow motion, wrinkle
   occurrence and mouth motion. Then these cues are integrated to form a
   facial behavior pattern vector. A Random Forest was trained using the
   collected database and applied to classify the facial patterns into
   deceptive and truthful categories.
   Despite the many uncontrolled factors (illumination, head pose and
   facial occlusion) contained in the videos in our database, we have
   achieved an accuracy of 76.92\% when discriminating liars from truth
   tellers using methods based on both micro-expressions and ``normal{''}
   facial expressions. The results have shown that using facial clues for
   automated lie detection is very promising from the point of view of
   practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of core losses in electrical steel laminations is
   considered an essential step in the machine design process. Accordingly,
   the calibration of the tangential field sensor for measurements of
   magnetic field strength H is of importance in core loss measurements for
   estimation of electrical machine efficiency. Due to the stray field
   between the lamination surface and the tangential coil, a concern is
   raised regarding the certainty of the measured field. This paper
   presents a reliable technical approach to calibrate the tangential field
   sensor used in the investigation of core losses in electrical machine
   laminations, which compensates for the drop in the actual field value.
   The proposed approach is based on developing a magnetizing circuit,
   which consists of two test laminations. An array of Hall Effect sensors
   is used in this study as a reference for the tangential field. The
   calibration results show that the magnetic field strength measured at
   the specimen surface by the tangential coil is scaled down by 4.57\% of
   the actual field. The results are verified experimentally and validated
   by finite-element simulations. Based on the obtained results, a
   correction factor is applied on pulsating and rotational core losses to
   attain more accurate data.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of the consequences of nonnative fish introductions address
   only direct effects rather than cascading effects on lower trophic
   levels or other ecosystem compartments. These trophic cascades have not
   been studied in comparison to the effects of a functionally similar
   native species nor with consideration of bottom-up forces (e.g.,
   nutrient supply). The Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is an invasive
   benthic predator that can deplete local populations of grazers,
   potentially generating substantive increases in benthic algal biomass.
   Here, we tested, with a factorial experimental design, the influence of
   Round Gobies on the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up forces
   in benthic communities by manipulating consumer type (Round Goby or
   native Logperch (Percina caprodes), snails only, or controls where
   snails and fish were absent), nutrient addition, and the presence of an
   invasive suspension feeder (Quagga Mussel {[}Dreissena bugensis]) in
   freshwater mesocosms. We also investigated how these perturbations
   affect phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. We observed stronger
   top-down forces in the presence of Round Gobies vs native Logperch, and
   these forces resulted in reduced grazer abundance and a concomitant
   increase in benthic algal abundance. However, when Quagga Mussels were
   present, bottom-up forces dominated. Round Gobies had a significantly
   greater positive effect on phytoplankton than did native Logperch. Our
   results highlight the importance of measuring top-down and bottom-up
   forces in comparison with a trophically similar native species to
   elucidate the ramifying effects of a nonnative predator on food webs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes a number of key findings that affect the use of
   linear and nonlinear analysis procedures for the seismic evaluation of
   steel frame buildings with supplemental damping devices and in
   particular, buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) and nonlinear viscous
   dampers (NVDs). The assessment is based on a comparison of various
   engineering demand parameters (EDPs) with experimental data obtained
   from a series of full-scale shaking table tests of a five-story steel
   building equipped with BRBs and NVDs. It is shown that: (1) there is no
   clear advantage between three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D)
   analyses in the prediction of the dynamic behavior of regular plan view
   steel frame buildings regardless of the damper type; (2) incorporating
   the brace and nonlinear viscous damper axial flexibility in the
   analytical model of the test structure with NVDs significantly improves
   the overall numerical predictions; and (3) the current effective damping
   ratio recommended by ASCE 41-13 as part of linear static procedures for
   the evaluation of frame buildings with BRBs or NVDs may not be
   conservative enough. A new performance-based design tool called
   performance-spectra (P-Spectra) is able to reliably predict the EDPs of
   interest. The P-Spectra tool is also able to validate the efficiency of
   various damper solutions on the dynamic performance of the test
   structure. It is demonstrated that P-Spectra can be employed to predict
   estimates of potential residual deformations that traditional linear and
   nonlinear static procedures cannot. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fluid-saturated materials are encountered in several areas of
   engineering and biological applications. Geologic media saturated with
   water, oil and gas and biological materials such as bone saturated with
   synovial fluid, soft tissues containing blood and plasma and synthetic
   materials impregnated with energy absorbing fluids are some examples. In
   many instances such materials can be examined quite successfully by
   appeal to classical theories of poroelasticity where the skeletal
   deformations can be modelled as linear elastic. In the case of soft
   biological tissues and even highly compressible organic geological
   materials, the porous skeleton can experience large strains and, unlike
   rubberlike materials, the fluid plays an important role in maintaining
   the large strain capability of the material. In some instances, the
   removal of the fluid can render the geological or biological material
   void of any hyperelastic effects. While the fluid component can be
   present at various scales and forms, a useful first approximation would
   be to treat the material as hyperelastic where the fabric can experience
   large strains consistent with a hyperelastic material and an independent
   scalar pressure describes the pore fluid response. The flow of fluid
   within the porous skeleton is defined by Darcy's law for an isotropic
   material, which is formulated in terms of the relative velocity between
   the pore fluid and the porous skeleton. It is assumed that the form of
   Darcy's law remains unchanged during the large strain behaviour. This
   approach basically extends Biot's theory of classical poroelasticity to
   include finite deformations. The developments are used to examine the
   poro-hyperelastic behaviour of certain one-dimensional problems. (C)

Abstract = {{Mixtures of partially carboxymethylated softwood kraft pulp fibers (CMF)
   and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) are made into CMF/CMC ``composite{''}
   films without mechanical fibrillation or high temperature pressing.
   Drying conditions largely influence the physical appearance of the pulp
   fibers upon carboxymethylation, as an efficient and complete structural
   collapse of the swollen fibers is required to achieve transparency.
   Ethanol dried CMF/CMC mixtures produce white, fluffy fibers with
   increased water absorbency. Such improvement in water absorbency is most
   likely due to the presence of structurally deformed CMF which provide
   intrinsic water pockets along with the hydrophilic nature of CMC. On the
   other hand, thin films with different transparency can be prepared when
   CMF/CMC mixtures are dried at 50 A degrees C from aqueous suspensions.
   Physical and optical properties of the CMF/CMC films are mainly
   dependent on the degree of substitution (DS), as well as pH. With an
   increase in the DS, tensile strength, Young's modulus, density,
   transparency, water absorbency, and gas barrier property are all
   increased. Tensile strength and Young's modulus of CMF/CMC films are as
   high as 165 MPa and 13 GPa, respectively. The oxygen transmission rate
   of CMF/CMC film at DS 0.45 is as low as 0.0161 cm(3) mu m m(-2) day(-1)
   kPa(-1) at 0 \% relative humidity. In contrast to CMF/CMC in sodium form
   (Na-CMF/CMC), CMF/CMC in hydrogen form (H-CMF/CMC) make films with
   improved wet strength without sacrificing transparency. Transparent
   CMF/CMC films can be used in areas such as disappearing packaging, wound
   dressing, and moisture sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial uncertainty modelling is a complex and challenging job for
   orebody modelling in mining, reservoir characterization in petroleum,
   and contamination modelling in air and water. Stochastic simulation
   algorithms are popular methods for such modelling. In this paper,
   discrete wavelet transformation (DWT)-based multiple point simulation
   algorithm for continuous variable is proposed that handles multi-scale
   spatial characteristics in datasets and training images. The DWT of a
   training image provides multi-scale high-frequency wavelet images and
   one low-frequency scaling image at the coarsest scale. The simulation of
   the proposed approach is performed on the frequency (wavelet) domain
   where the scaling image and wavelet images across the scale are
   simulated jointly. The inverse DWT reconstructs simulated realizations
   of an attribute of interest in the space domain. An automatic
   scale-selection algorithm using dominant mode difference is applied for
   the selection of the optimal scale of wavelet decomposition. The
   proposed algorithm reduces the computational time required for
   simulating large domain as compared to spatial domain multi-point
   simulation algorithm. The algorithm is tested with an exhaustive dataset
   using conditional and unconditional simulation in two- and
   three-dimensional fluvial reservoir and mining blasted rock data. The
   realizations generated by the proposed algorithm perform well and
   reproduce the statistics of the training image. The study conducted
   comparing the spatial domain filtersim multiple-point simulation
   algorithm suggests that the proposed algorithm generates equally good
   realizations at lower computational cost.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a reduced-order model (ROM) of the flow-induced
   vibrations of a flexible cantilevered hydrofoil is developed and used to
   design an active feedback controller. The ROM is developed using data
   from high-fidelity viscous fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations
   and includes nonlinear terms to accurately capture the effect of
   lock-in. An active linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is
   designed based on a linearization of the ROM and is implemented in
   simulation with the ROM and the high-fidelity viscous FSI model. A
   controller saturation method is also presented that ensures that the
   control force applied to the system remains within a prescribed range.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the LQG controller successfully
   suppresses vibrations in both the ROM and viscous FSI simulations using
   a reasonable amount of control force.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a dual three-level, T-type, neutral-point clamped
   (T-NPC) inverter fed dual permanent magnet synchronous motor topology
   for low-voltage, high-power traction applications. The switching pulses
   of the T-NPC inverters are interleaved and controlled, such that they
   produce equal and opposite three-phase currents at their output. This
   maintains balanced dc-link voltages in steady-state and transient
   conditions, even with slight mismatches between two sets of three-phase
   loads. Thus, the proposed configuration decouples the modulation
   strategy from the capacitor balancing control. Simulation and
   experimental results demonstrate that in comparison to the conventional
   single T-NPC inverter, the proposed topology reduces dc-link capacitors'
   voltage deviation and current stress by more than 90\% while avoiding
   additional switching instances to balance capacitor voltages.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of Gurney flaplike strips, of different geometric
   configurations and heights, on the aerodynamic characteristics and the
   tip vortices generated by a reverse delta wing (RDW) was investigated
   via force-balance measurement and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The
   addition of side-edge strips (SESs) caused a leftward shift of the lift
   curve, resembling a conventional trailing-edge flap. The large lift
   increment overwhelmed the corresponding drag increase, thereby leading
   to an improved lift-to-drag ratio compared to the baseline wing. The
   lift and drag coefficients were also found to increase with the strip
   height. The SES-equipped wing also produced a strengthened vortex
   compared to its baseline wing counterpart. The leading-edge strips
   (LESs) were, however, found to persistently produce a greatly diffused
   vortex flow as well as a small-than-baseline-wing lift in the prestall a
   regime. The downward LES delivered a delayed stall and an increased
   maximum lift coefficient compared to the baseline wing. The LESs provide
   a potential wingtip vortex control alternative, while the SESs can
   enhance the aerodynamic performance of the RDW.}},

Abstract = {{Study region: Narew River in Northeastern Poland.
   Study focus: Three methods for frequency analysis of snowmelt floods
   were compared. Two dimensional (2D) normal distribution and copula-based
   2D probability distributions were applied to statistically describe
   floods with two parameters (flood peak Q(max,f) and flood volume V-f).
   Two copula functions from different classes- the elliptical Gaussian
   copula and Archimedean 1-parameter Gumbel-Hougaard copula- were
   evaluated based on measurements.
   New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicated that the
   2D normal probability distribution model gives a better probabilistic
   description of snowmelt floods characterized by the 2-dimensional random
   variable (Q(max,f), V-f) compared to the elliptical Gaussian copula and
   Archimedean 1-parameter Gumbel-Hougaard copula models, in particular
   from the view point of probability of exceedance as well as complexity
   and time of computation. Nevertheless, the copula approach offers a new
   perspective in estimating the 2D probability distribution for
   multidimensional random variables. Results showed that the 2D model for
   snowmelt floods built using the Gumbel-Hougaard copula is much better
   than the model built using the Gaussian copula. (C) 2016 The Authors.

   alcohols on bubble rise velocity}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The properties of flotation frothers depend on their structure. This
   paper forms part of our investigation into the frother
   structure-property relationship using bubble rise velocity as the
   property, the structure variation in this study being the hydroxyl group
   position in alcohols. Single bubble rise velocity profiles were measured
   in a 350 cm column and velocity at 300 cm determined to estimate the
   concentration at minimum velocity (CMV): a decreasing CMV means it
   requires less concentration to slow the bubble, and vice versa. Two
   kinds of alcohols, alkyl alcohols (straight- and branched-chain) and
   1,omega-diols, were investigated using five and six carbon members. The
   general effect is that CMV decreases as the OH moves to a terminal
   position, in the case of 1,omega-diols this means the 1,2 structure. For
   the alkyl alcohols, the effect of OH position on CMV was greater for
   branched-chain compared to straight-chain members, and having the methyl
   branch as far as possible from the terminal OH gave the lowest CMV. The
   most significant effect on CMV was the position of the second OH in
   1,omega-diols. Arguments based on surfactant molecule orientation and
   packing on the bubble surface and the role of hydrogen bonding in the
   case of 1,omega-diols are advanced to account for the effects on CMV.
   Some observations on frother design based on the findings are offered.

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{38-57}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Boundary conditions (BCs) are important parameters of numerical
   computation for CAE structure analysis. Automatically and correctly
   reconstructing BCs would evidently improve the design efficiency. In
   this paper, a novel approach consisting of feature representation of
   BCs, coding mechanism for BC related topological entity and BC
   reconstructing mechanism is proposed. BCs treated as features can be
   adaptive to the changing geometric model in this approach. Coding
   mechanism guarantees that the specified entities of BCs from the model
   reconstruction process could be identified. Reconstructing mechanism
   comprises the maintenance of BC-geometry feature dependency, data
   consistency and coding transmission, which ensures all the BCs can be
   automatically updated in terms of the changing geometry. This approach
   can avoid repeatedly applying BCs to the whole or portion of topological
   entities. Finally, some representative cases demonstrate that the
   proposed approach is able to significantly improve the design
   efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recycling of aircraft aluminum alloys can be complex due to the presence
   of their corrosion protection coating that includes inorganic compounds
   containing Cr(VI). In this study, the characterization and thermal
   degradation behavior of the coating on aluminum substrates coming from
   an aircraft destined for recycling are presented. Elements such as Sr,
   Cr, Si, Ba, Ti, S, C, and O were found in three different layers by EDS
   elemental mapping corresponding to SrCrO4, Rutile-TiO2, SiO2, and BaSO4
   with an overall particle size D (50) = 1.96 A mu m. The thermal
   degradation profile analyzed by TGA showed four different stages. The
   temperature of complete degradation at the fourth stage occurred at
   753.15 K (480 A degrees C) at lower heating rates. At higher heating
   rates and holding an isotherm at the same temperature, the residence
   time to fully decompose the aircraft coating has been estimated as 4.0
   +/- A 0.2 minutes. The activation energy calculated by the
   Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and the modified Coats-Redfern methods for multiple
   fraction of decomposition showed a non-constant behavior indicating the
   complexity of the reaction. Finally, the concentration of Cr(VI)
   released to the environment during thermal decoating was obtained by
   UV-Vis spectroscopy. It was found that 2.6 +/- A 0.1 A mu g of
   Cr(VI)/mm(2) of aluminum substrate could be released unless adequate
   particle controls are used.}},
