Abstract = {{The rapid increase in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has
   attracted attention to bacteriophages for treating and preventing
   bacterial infections. Bacteriophages can drive the diversification of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, giving rise to phage-resistant variants with
   different phenotypes from their ancestral hosts. In this study, we
   sought to investigate the effect of phage resistance on cytotoxicity of
   host populations toward cultured mammalian cells. The library of
   phage-resistant P. aeruginosa PAO1 variants used was developed
   previously via experimental evolution of an isogenic host population
   using phages PP7 and E79. Our results presented herein indicate that the
   phage-resistant variants developed in a heterogeneous phage environment
   exhibit a greater ability to impede metabolic action of cultured human
   keratinocytes and have a greater tendency to cause membrane damage even
   though they cannot invade the cells in large numbers. They also show a
   heightened resistance to phagocytosis by model murine macrophages.
   Furthermore, all isolates produced higher levels of at least one of the
   secreted virulence factors, namely, total proteases, elastase,
   phospholipase C, and hemolysins. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR
   (RT-qPCR) revealed upregulation in the transcription of a number of
   genes associated with virulence of P. aeruginosa for the phage-resistant
   variants. The results of this study indicate a significant change in the
   in vitro virulence of P. aeruginosa following phage predation and
   highlight the need for caution in the selection and design of phages and
   phage cocktails for therapeutic use.}},

Abstract = {{A dispersion-tuned harmonically mode-locked fiber laser is demonstrated
   using a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) and a chirped

   a RF signal. The laser performance in terms of tunable bandwidth,
   pulsewidth, spectral width, output power, and optical signal to noise
   ratio (OSNR) is studied with respect to their dependence on the injected
   current levels to the RSOA. This letter indicates that lasing at higher
   harmonic order results in broaden temporal pulse width, larger spectral
   width, and lower OSNR. Narrower spectral width is obtained with lower
   modulation current causing less longitudinal modes to lase. A second
   synchronously gated RSOA is used to further amplify the laser with peak
   power up to 0 dBm with a constant output spectrum maintained at all
   wavelengths and reduced noise between pulses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new subspace-based algorithm for the
   identification of Hammerstein systems. It extends a previous approach
   which described the Hammerstein cascade by a state-space model and
   identified it with subspace methods that are fast and require little a
   priori knowledge. The resulting state-space models predict the system
   response well but have many redundant parameters and provide limited
   insight into the system since they depend on both the nonlinear and
   linear elements. This paper addresses these issues by reformulating the
   problem so that there are many fewer parameters and each parameter is
   related directly to either the linear dynamics or the static
   nonlinearity. Consequently, it is straightforward to construct the
   continuous-time Hammerstein models corresponding to the estimated
   state-space model. Simulation studies demonstrated that the new method
   performs better than other well-known methods in the nonideal conditions
   that prevail during practical experiments. Moreover, it accurately
   distinguished changes in the linear component from those in the static
   nonlinearity. The practical application of the new algorithm was
   demonstrated by applying it to experimental data from a study of the
   stretch reflex at the human ankle. Hammerstein models were estimated
   between the velocity of ankle perturbations and the EMG activity of
   triceps surae for voluntary contractions in the plantarflexing and
   dorsiflexion directions. The resulting models described the behavior
   well, displayed the expected unidirectional rate sensitivity, and
   revealed that both the gain of the linear element and the threshold of
   the nonlinear changed with contraction direction.}},

Abstract = {{Summary
   Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) decorated with platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs)
   have been characterized using a cold field-emission scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) and a high resolution field-emission transmission
   electron microscope (TEM). With this particular composite material, the
   complementary nature of the two instruments was demonstrated. Although
   the long CNTs were found to be mostly bent and defective in some parts,
   the nucleation of Pt occurred randomly and uniformly covered the CNTs.
   The NPs displayed a large variation in size, were sometimes defective
   with twins and stacking faults, and were found to be faceted with the
   presence of surface steps. The shape and size of the NPs and the
   presence of defects may have significant consequences on the activity of
   the Pt catalyst material. Also, thin layers of platinum oxide were
   identified on the surface of some NPs.}},

Abstract = {{A review of activities involving the development of large arrays of
   nanomechanical resonators is presented. This review includes
   demonstration of the use of these arrays for the detection of biological
   targets. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches to the realization of
   such arrays were developed. Using a top-down approach, a nanomachining
   method for the fabrication of large arrays of doubly-clamped silicon
   carbonitride (SiCN) resonators with width as narrow as 16 nm and a yield
   approaching 100\% was developed. The specific detection of protein-A
   using such resonator arrays functionalized with single domain antibody
   fragments (sdAb) was also demonstrated with femtogram-level mass
   sensitivity. A nano-imprinting based fabrication of these resonator
   arrays was also realized, opening up their potential for cost-effective
   manufacturing. On a bottom-up approach, resonant silicon nanowires were
   also produced using directed chemical vapor deposition methods. These
   bottom-up resonant nanowires were in turn successfully employed for the
   specific detection of streptavidin with attogram-level mass sensitivity.

Abstract = {{Spark plasma sintering (SPS) and Electrospark deposition (ESD) were used
   as two manufacturing routes to create Al-12Si coatings with refined
   microstructures. The tribological performance of these coatings was
   tested using a linear reciprocating tribometer. The SPS and ESD coatings
   were compared to a conventionally as-cast ingot (AC) of Al-12Si to
   observe the effect of particle refinement and morphology changes. The
   ESD sample exhibited lower wear rates than the AC and SPS samples.
   During the wear process, the Al and Si phases on the surface of the AC
   sample were significantly refined. This refinement led to a
   microstructure near the surface that was similar to the sample generated
   by SPS, and therefore showed similar wear rates at the end of testing.
   Subsurface cracking, which is known to occur in the wear of powder
   metallurgy alloys, was observed for sample SPS. The refinement of the Al
   and Si phases achieved for ESD process was much greater than what
   resulted during the wear of the AC and SPS surfaces and as a result the
   ESD sample showed lower wear rates throughout the entire test. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Continuum mechanical tools are used to describe the deformation, energy
   density, and material symmetry of a lipid bilayer with spontaneous
   curvature. In contrast to conventional approaches in which lipid
   bilayers are modeled by material surfaces, here we rely on a
   three-dimensional approach in which a lipid bilayer is modeling by a
   shell-like body with finite thickness. In this setting, the interface
   between the leaflets of a lipid bilayer is assumed to coincide with the
   mid-surface of the corresponding shell-like body. The three-dimensional
   deformation gradient is found to involve the curvature tensors of the
   mid-surface in the spontaneous and the deformed states, the deformation
   gradient of the mid-surface, and the transverse deformation. Attention
   is also given to the coherency of the leaflets and to the area
   compatibility of the closed lipid bilayers (i.e., vesicles). A
   hyperelastic constitutive theory for lipid bilayers in the liquid phase
   is developed. In combination, the requirements of frame indifference and
   material symmetry yield a representation for the energy density of a
   lipid bilayer. This representation shows that three scalar invariants
   suffice to describe the constitutive response of a lipid bilayer
   exhibiting in-plane fluidity and transverse isotropy. In addition to
   exploring the geometrical and physical properties of these invariants,
   fundamental constitutively associated kinematical quantities are
   emphasized. On this basis, the effect on the energy density of assuming
   that the lipid bilayer is incompressible is considered. Lastly, a
   dimension reduction argument is used to extract an areal energy density
   per unit area from the three-dimensional energy density. This step
   explains the origin of spontaneous curvature in the areal energy
   density. Importantly, along with a standard contribution associated with
   the natural curvature of the lipid bilayer, our analysis indicates that
   constitutive asymmetry between the leaflets of the lipid bilayer gives
   rise to a secondary contribution to the spontaneous curvature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the joint design of multiple non-regenerative
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying matrices, with the
   purpose of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the
   transmitted signals from the source and the received signals at the
   destination. Two types of constraints on the transmit power of the
   relays are considered separately: 1) a weighted sum power constraint,
   and 2) per-relay power constraints. As opposed to using general-purpose
   interior-point methods, we exploit the inherent structure of the
   problems to develop more efficient algorithms. Under the weighted sum
   power constraint, the optimal solution is expressed as a function of a
   Lagrangian parameter. By introducing a complex scaling factor at the
   destination, we derive a closed-form expression for this parameter,
   thereby avoiding the need to solve an implicit nonlinear equation
   numerically. Under the per-relay power constraints, the optimal solution
   is the same as that under the weighted sum power constraint if
   particular weights are chosen. We then propose an iterative power
   balancing algorithm to compute these weights. In addition, under both
   types of constraints, we investigate the joint design of a MIMO
   equalizer at the destination and the relaying matrices, using block
   coordinate descent or steepest descent. The bit-error rate (BER)
   simulation results demonstrate that all the proposed designs, under
   either type of constraints, with or without the equalizer, perform much
   better than previous methods.}},

Abstract = {{The geometrically nonlinear size-dependent behaviour of a Timoshenko
   microbeam is examined numerically, taking into account the coupled
   longitudinal-transverse displacements as well as the rotation. The
   strain energy of a Timoshenko microbeam is obtained based on the
   modified couples stress theory. Hamilton's principle is then employed to
   derive the nonlinear partial differential equations of motion for the
   longitudinal, transverse, and rotational motions. The Galerkin scheme is
   applied to these nonlinear partial differential equations, resulting in
   a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with coupled terms.
   The nonlinear resonant response of the system is examined by solving the
   discretized equations of motion via the pseudo-arclength continuation
   technique and constructing the frequency-response and force-response
   curves. In particular, the effect of the length scale parameter is
   investigated by comparing the results obtained using the modified couple
   and classical theories. The frequency-response curves of the present
   model are compared to those of the one in which the longitudinal
   displacement is neglected so as to highlight the importance of taking
   into account the longitudinal displacement. The effect of other system
   parameters on the frequency-response and force-response curves is also
   investigated. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the nonlinear size-dependent behaviour of
   an electrically actuated MEMS resonator based on the modified couple
   stress theory; the microbeam is excited by an AC voltage which is
   superimposed on a DC voltage. A high-dimensional reduced order model of
   the continuous system is obtained by applying the Galerkin scheme to the
   nonlinear partial differential equation of motion. The pseudo-arclength
   continuation technique is employed to examine the nonlinear static and
   dynamic behaviour of the system. Specifically, the nonlinear static
   behaviour of the system is investigated when the microbeam is excited by
   the electrostatic excitation (DC voltage); this analysis yields the
   static deflected configuration of the system and the value of the DC
   voltage corresponding to the static pull-in instability. The
   size-dependent dynamic behaviour of the system is examined under primary
   and superharmonic excitations; the frequency- and force-response curves
   of the system as well as time histories and phase-plane portraits are
   constructed. Moreover, the effect of taking into account the
   length-scale parameter on the static and dynamic behaviour of the system

   spherical powders, the sponge and irregular CP-Ti powders had higher
   oxygen content, poorer powder flowability, higher compression ratio,
   lower powder packing factor, and higher average particle impact
   velocities. XRD results showed no new phases present when comparing the
   various feedstock powders to corresponding coatings. A higher particle
   temperature was also obtained with larger particle size for all
   feedstock powder morphologies processed with the same set of spray
   parameters. A spherical powder with 29 mu m mean particle size was found
   to have the lowest porosity coating and best cold sprayability. The

Abstract = {{During the past century our world has witnessed a number of global
   pandemic outbreaks of viral infections from time to time, often with
   deadly consequences. However, in recent years viral infections of new
   types or variants are beginning to emerge often with significantly high
   virulence properties. A number of these new strains are derived from
   animals such as avian, cattle, primates, etc. which have crossed the
   animal barrier due to varying reasons that may include the change in
   lifestyle, food habit, increased migration, globalization as well as
   living and staying too close to animals. Extensive research has been
   undertaken to better understand the genetic and protein architectures of
   these and other highly infectious viruses and their mode of progression.
   Already potential targets have been identified for development of safe
   and effective intervention and treatment strategies. These are all
   directed towards the viral components such as viral enzyme, viral
   protein and viral membrane associated with the fusiogenic event.
   However, host cellular enzyme/s of protease family also plays a critical
   role in viral pathogenesis and infection. It cleaves viral surface
   glycoproteins leading to their maturation forms to be recognized by host
   cellular receptor. This leads to viral fusion with host membrane and
   delivery of its components leading to viral replication and progression.
   As a result, these selected host proteases may also be considered as
   important targets for blockade of viral infection and pathogenesis. In
   this respect, one enzyme in particular called furin (also known as
   PCSK3) that belongs to the Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin (PCSK)
   super family stands out the most. In fact, furin inhibitors have been
   developed and shown in vitro and animal models to diminish viral
   replication and its load. Development of highly selective furin
   inhibitors is thus an attractive option to fight against the viral
   infections despite the challenge one has to face in terms of enzyme
   specificity, potency and delivery of anti-furin agents in an
   organ/tissue-specific manner. This review discusses the various issues
   facing this approach. Both pros and cons of this methodology are
   discussed and debated in this review.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for detecting suspicious events in
   videos by using only the video itself as the training samples for valid
   behaviors. These salient events are obtained in real-time by detecting
   anomalous spatio-temporal regions in a densely sampled video. The method
   codes a video as a compact set of spatio-temporal volumes, while
   considering the uncertainty in the codebook construction. The
   spatio-temporal compositions of video volumes are modeled using a
   probabilistic framework, which calculates their likelihood of being
   normal in the video. This approach can be considered as an extension of
   the Bag of Video words (BOV) approaches, which represent a video as an
   order-less distribution of video volumes. The proposed method imposes
   spatial and temporal constraints on the video volumes so that an
   inference mechanism can estimate the probability density functions of
   their arrangements. Anomalous events are assumed to be video
   arrangements with very low frequency of occurrence. The algorithm is
   very fast and does not employ background subtraction, motion estimation
   or tracking. It is also robust to spatial and temporal scale changes, as
   well as some deformations. Experiments were performed on four video
   datasets of abnormal activities in both crowded and non-crowded scenes
   and under difficult illumination conditions. The proposed method
   outperformed all other approaches based on BOV that do not account for
   contextual information. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   substrates with the aim of impairing bacterial pathogen motility and
   spreading on the substrate surface. The release of CDMs from the
   silicone substrates when soaking in an aqueous medium was quantified for
   a period of 24 h. Next, we showed that CDMs released from two silicone
   substrates remain bioactive as they downregulate the expression of the
   flagellin gene of two key uropathogens - Escherichia coli CFT073 and
   Proteus mirabilis HI4320. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CDM-modified
   silicone inhibits the swarming motility of P. mirabilis, an aggressive
   swarmer. The bioactive, CDM-modified substrates can find broad
   applications in the medical device and food industries where the
   impairment of bacterial colonization of surfaces is of paramount
   importance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study used very high strain rate uniaxial compression testing to
   analyze the microstructure and texture evolution during high speed
   rolling of as-cast AZ31B alloy. A split Hopkinson pressure bar equipped
   with induction radiation furnace was used to attain a strain rate of
   1200 s(-1) in the temperature range of 25-350 A degrees C and the result
   was compared with low strain rate (0.01 s(-1)) behavior. As well, high
   speed rolling at 500 m min(-1) was employed to successfully roll AZ31
   alloy in one pass with 71 \% reduction at 200 A degrees C. During
   rolling, the mill was suddenly stopped and the sheet was withdrawn from
   rolling gap and the microstructure and texture evolution was observed.
   Grain boundary misorientation analysis shows that coincident site
   lattice boundaries related to contraction twins and secondary twins are
   more numerous in the samples deformed at high strain rate. With
   increasing strain for both rolling and compression at 200 A degrees C,
   the splitting of basal poles was observed, indicating the activation of
   more contraction twins and secondary twins compared to low strain rate
   deformation. Also, the recrystallized volume fraction increased
   significantly with strain rate, probably due to increasing the
   twin-induced recrystallization fraction. On annealing of the samples
   compressed at 200 A degrees C, secondary twins and their vicinity were
   observed to be the preferential sites for nucleation and it seems that
   rapid recrystallization on secondary twins contributes to the basal
   texture weakening. Therefore, an increasing number of such twins
   increase the texture weakening.}},

Title = {{Discrepancies between cardiovascular magnetic resonance and Doppler
   echocardiography in the measurement of transvalvular gradient in aortic
   stenosis: the effect of flow vorticity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Valve effective orifice area EOA and transvalvular mean
   pressure gradient (MPG) are the most frequently used parameters to
   assess aortic stenosis (AS) severity. However, MPG measured by
   cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) may differ from the one measured
   by transthoracic Doppler-echocardiography (TTE). The objectives of this
   study were: 1) to identify the factors responsible for the MPG
   measurement discrepancies by CMR versus TTE in AS patients; 2) to
   investigate the effect of flow vorticity on AS severity assessment by
   CMR; and 3) to evaluate two models reconciling MPG discrepancies between
   CMR/TTE measurements.
   Methods: Eight healthy subjects and 60 patients with AS underwent TTE
   and CMR. Strouhal number (St), energy loss (EL), and vorticity were
   computed from CMR. Two correction models were evaluated: 1) based on the
   Gorlin equation (MPG(CMR-Gorlin)); 2) based on a multivariate regression
   model (MPG(CMR-Predicted)).
   Results: MPG(CMR) underestimated MPG(TTE) (bias = -6.5 mmHg, limits of
   agreement from -18.3 to 5.2 mmHg). On multivariate regression analysis,
   St (p = 0.002), EL (p = 0.001), and mean systolic vorticity (p < 0.001)
   were independently associated with larger MPG discrepancies between CMR
   and TTE. MPG(CMR-Gorlin) and MPG(TTE) correlation and agreement were r =
   0.7; bias = -2.8 mmHg, limits of agreement from -18.4 to 12.9 mmHg.
   MPG(CMR-Predicted) model showed better correlation and agreement with
   MPG(TTE) (r = 0.82; bias = 0.5 mmHg, limits of agreement from -9.1 to
   10.2 mmHg) than measured MPG(CMR) and MPG(CMR-Gorlin).
   Conclusion: Flow vorticity is one of the main factors responsible for
   MPG discrepancies between CMR and TTE.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional compound semiconductor nanolasers, especially nanowire
   (NW)-based nanolasers utilizing III-nitride (AlGaInN) materials system,
   are an emerging and promising area of research. Significant achievements
   have been made in developing III-nitride NW lasers with emission
   wavelengths from the deep ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared spectral
   range. The types of lasers under investigation include Fabry-Perot,
   photonic crystal, plasmonic, ring resonator, microstadium, random,
   polariton, and two-dimensional distributed feedback lasers. The lasing
   thresholds vary by several orders of magnitude, which are a direct
   consequence of differing NW dimensions, quality of the NWs,
   characteristics of NW cavities, and coupling with the substrate. For
   electrically injected, such as ultralow-threshold and continuous-wave
   III-nitride NW lasers that can operate at room temperature, the
   following obstacles remain: carrier loss mechanisms including
   defect-related nonradiative surface recombination, electron overflow,
   and poor hole transport; low radiative recombination efficiency and high
   surface recombination; poor thermal management; and highly resistive
   ohmic contacts on the p-layer. These obstacles must be overcome to fully
   realize the potential of these lasers. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring groups of muscle myosin behave differently from
   individual myosins or small groups commonly assayed in vitro. Here, we
   investigate the emergence of myosin group behavior with increasing
   myosin group size. Assuming the number of myosin binding sites (N) is
   proportional to actin length (L) (N = L/35.5 nm), we resolve in vitro
   motility of actin propelled by skeletal muscle myosin for L = 0.2-3 mu
   m. Three distinct regimes were found: L < 0.3 mu m, sliding arrest; 0.3
   mu m <= L <= 1 mu m, alternation between arrest and continuous sliding;
   L > 1 mu m, continuous sliding. We theoretically investigated the myosin
   group kinetics with mechanical coupling via actin. We find rapid actin
   sliding steps driven by power-stroke cascades supported by
   postpower-stroke myosins, and phases without actin sliding caused by
   prepower-stroke myosin buildup. The three regimes are explained: N = 8,
   rare cascades; N = 15, cascade bursts; N = 35, continuous cascading. Two
   saddle-node bifurcations occur for increasing N (mono -> bi ->
   mono-stability), with steady states corresponding to arrest and
   continuous cascading. The experimentally measured dependence of actin
   sliding statistics on L and myosin concentration is correctly predicted.}},

Abstract = {{A consistent higher-order shear deformation nonlinear theory is
   developed for shells of generic shape allowing for thickness variation
   by using six variables; geometric imperfections are also taken into

   are derived retaining full nonlinear terms in the in-plane
   displacements. They are presented in curvilinear coordinates in a
   formulation that can be readily implemented in computer codes. This new
   theory is applied to laminated circular cylindrical shells complete
   around the circumference and simply supported at the ends. Linear
   (natural frequencies) and geometrically nonlinear (large-amplitude
   forced response) vibrations are studied by using the present theory and
   results are compared to those obtained by using the refined
   Amabili-Reddy higher-order shear deformation nonlinear shell theory,

Abstract = {{The effect of blending polyglycols (F150 and DF250) with alcohols (MIBC
   and pentanol) on bubble size, gas holdup and froth height in a two-phase
   system has been determined. A synergistic effect on froth height was
   observed accompanied by a change in bubble size: below the alcohol
   critical coalescence concentration (CCC) the addition of small amounts
   of polyglycol decreased bubble size and, unexpectedly, above the alcohol
   CCC the polyglycol increased bubble size. Gas holdup confirmed the
   bubble size response. No explanation of the latter effect is immediately
   apparent. Implications for possible independent control of froth
   stability and bubble size as a reason for using frother blends are
   discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   not being significantly affected by the acid type or the colloid size.
   In addition, the aggregation of the nanoparticles is minimised when the

Abstract = {{Biodegradable polymer blends based on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and
   poly{[}(butylene succinate)-co-adipate] (PBSA) were prepared with a
   laboratory internal mixer. An epoxy-based, multifunctional chain
   extender was used to enhance the melt strength of the blends. The
   morphology of the blends was observed with field emission scanning
   electron microscopy. The elongational viscosities of the blends, with
   and without chain extender, were measured with a Sentmanat extensional
   rheometer universal testing platform. The blends with chain extender
   exhibited strong strain-hardening behavior, whereas the blends without
   chain extender exhibited only weak strain-hardening behavior.
   Measurements of the linear viscoelastic properties of the melts
   suggested that the chain extender promoted the development of chain
   branching. The results show that PBSA contributed to significant
   improvements in the ductility of the PLA/PBSA blends, whereas the chain
   extender did not have a significant effect on the elastic modulus and
   strain at break of the blends. The combined blending of PLA with PBSA
   and the incorporation of the chain extender imparted both ductility and
   melt strength to the system. Thus, such an approach yields a system with
   enhanced performance and processability. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Although the universe of protein structures is vast, these innumerable
   structures can be categorized into a finite number of folds. New
   functions commonly evolve by elaboration of existing scaffolds, for
   example, via domain insertions. Thus, understanding structural diversity
   of a protein fold evolving via domain insertions is a fundamental
   challenge. The haloalkanoic dehalogenase superfamily serves as an
   excellent model system wherein a variable cap domain accessorizes the
   ubiquitous Rossmann-fold core domain. Here, we determine the impact of
   the cap-domain insertion on the sequence and structure divergence of the
   core domain. Through quantitative analysis on a unique dataset of 154
   core-domain-only and cap-domain-only structures, basic principles of
   their evolution have been uncovered. The relationship between sequence
   and structure divergence of the core domain is shown to be monotonic and
   independent of the corresponding type of domain insert, reflecting the
   robustness of the Rossmann fold to mutation. However, core domains with
   the same cap type share greater similarity at the sequence and structure
   levels, suggesting interplay between the cap and core domains. Notably,
   results reveal that the variance in structure maps to alpha-helices
   flanking the central beta-sheet and not to the domain-domain interface.
   Collectively, these results hint at intramolecular coevolution where the
   fold diverges differentially in the context of an accessory domain, a
   feature that might also apply to other multidomain superfamilies.}},

Abstract = {{The wave propagation, vibration transmission and acoustic emission
   characteristics in the passive and the active periodic shell systems are
   investigated. A finite element method (FEM) is utilised to conduct the
   investigation. In the passive periodic shell, two pivotal frequencies
   (i.e., the cut-off frequency of the periodic shell, and the resonant
   frequency of flexural vibration of shell ring), which are existed in an
   arbitrarily high circumferential mode, are found; the frequency range is
   divided into three regions by these two frequencies. Various band
   formation mechanisms and the dynamic properties within the three
   frequency regions are illustrated, with the aid of a series of vibration
   deformations. Furthermore, an active periodic shell is constructed.
   Several control methods, such as inverted displacement-, velocity- and
   acceleration-feedback control strategies, are explored for the active
   shell. Under these control strategies, the effects of negative
   stiffness, damping coefficient and mass modulation, can be produced,
   thus enabling the band gap generable and its characteristics, such as
   their bandwidth, location and attenuation coefficient, adjustable. The
   pressure level of the structure-borne sound is also suppressed along the
   shell within the band gaps. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of electrothermal in-flight anti-icing systems is
   presented by introducing a general methodology. The optimization goal
   was to achieve an ice-free area over the protected zone by using the
   lowest energy possible. The power and/or length of the electric pads are
   considered as design variables. The optimization procedure is performed
   via a derivative-free method that typically needs many
   objective-function evaluations. This would be impractical as aero-icing
   flow simulation remains computationally intensive when coupled with
   conjugate heat-transfer calculations, as in the case of ice-protection
   systems. The cost is even more prohibitive for an optimization process,
   as a large number of simulations are needed. To make it practical, this
   work presents a surrogate-based optimization approach using proper
   orthogonal decomposition, in conjunction with kriging. The results
   obtained show that the methodology is efficient and reliable in
   optimizing electrothermal ice-protection systems in particular, and a
   thermal-based one in general.}},

Abstract = {{Clathrate hydrates are currently being studied for their applications in
   many areas such as natural gas storage and transportation, component
   separation, and carbon dioxide sequestration. The ability to increase
   hydrate production is integral in the success of these innovative
   technologies. It has been found that the addition of multi-wall carbon
   nanotubes (MWNTs) to hydrate systems promotes clathrate formation. In
   order to better understand how this occurs, an analysis of the heat
   transfer during the formation of tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrates was
   performed. Two concentrations of both conventional (hydrophobic) and
   plasma-functionalized (hydrophilic) MWNTs were added to a THF-water
   hydrate-forming solution. With the use of infrared imaging, the velocity
   and temperature of the thermal front during hydrate formation was
   measured. It was found that in both cases, the presence of MWNTs
   elevated the velocity of the front for a given system sub-cooling.
   Furthermore, as the MWNT concentration increased, so did the velocities.
   The presence of the MWNTs also decreased the sub-cooling required for
   nucleation.}},

Abstract = {{A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring can be
   an alternative tool to characterize nanoparticle size by virtue of its
   acoustic principle to sense adsorbed mass. In this study, sizes obtained
   by QCM-D for polymer-coated metallic nanoparticles and polydisperse
   polystyrene latex particle suspensions were compared with those obtained
   by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering
   (DLS). We describe the obtained ``QCM-D mass{''}, which is weighted over
   surface area, by a general particle height distribution equation that
   can be used to determine the average particle diameter of a distribution
   of particles deposited on the QCM-D surface. Because the particle height
   distribution equation can be used for any particle geometry and surface
   packing geometry, it Is described how the QCM-D can also be used to
   study the orientation of deposited nonspherical particles. Herein, the
   mean nanoparticle sizes obtained by QCM-D were generally in closer
   agreement with the primary particle size determined by TEM than with the
   sizes obtained by DLS, suggesting that primarily smaller particles
   within the particle population deposited on the sensor surface. Overall,
   the results from this study demonstrate that QCM-D could serve as an
   alternative and/or complementary means to characterize the size of
   nanoparticles deposited on a surface from suspensions of varying
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of solar energy into hydrogen via water splitting process
   is one of the key sustainable technologies for future clean, storable,
   and renewable source of energy. Therefore, development of visible
   light-responsive and efficient photocatalyst material has been of
   immense interest, but with limited success. Here, we show that overall
   water splitting under visible-light irradiation can be achieved using a
   single photocatalyst material. Multiband InGaN/GaN nanowire
   heterostructures, decorated with rhodium (Rh)/chromium-oxide (Cr2O3)
   core shell nanoparticles can lead to stable hydrogen production from
   pure (pH similar to 7.0) water splitting under ultraviolet, blue and
   green-light irradiation (up to 560 nm), the longest wavelength ever
   reported. At similar to 440-450 nm wavelengths, the internal quantum
   efficiency is estimated to be similar to 13\%, the highest value
   reported in the visible spectrum. The turnover number under visible
   light well exceeds 73 in 12 h. Detailed analysis further confirms the
   stable photocatalytic activity of the nanowire heterostructures. This
   work establishes the use of metal-nitrides as viable photocatalyst for
   solar-powered artificial photosynthesis for the production of hydrogen
   and other solar fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion quality and polymer-filler interaction are important factors
   in determining the final properties of polymer nanocomposites. Surface
   energy of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) and some polymers
   (polypropylene, PP, and polylactic acid, PLA) was measured at room and
   high temperatures. NCC had higher polarity and surface energy than PP
   and PLA at room temperature but had a lower surface energy at higher
   temperatures. The effect of surface modification with alkenyl succinic
   anhydride (ASA) on NCC surface energy at room and high temperature was
   studied. Total surface energy of NCC was lowered after surface
   modification. Thermodynamic work of adhesion for PP/NCC and PLA/NCC was
   lowered by NCC surface modification. A thermodynamic analysis is
   proposed to estimate the dispersion energy, based on surface energy
   measurements at room and high temperatures. Also, a dispersion factor is
   defined to provide a quantitative indication of the dispersibility of
   nanoparticles in a polymer matrix under various conditions. The required
   dispersion energy was reduced by lowering the interfacial tension. On
   the other hand, it increased as the quality of NCC dispersion (i.e., the
   nanoparticle surface area) in the system was improved. Surface
   modification of NCC with ASA had a negative effect on the compatibility
   between NCC and PLA, whereas it had a positive influence on
   compatibility between PP and NCC.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of a
   lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM)-Large Eddy Simulation methodology for the
   prediction of sound radiation from a round jet-microjet combination. The
   distinct advantage of LBM over traditional computational fluid dynamics
   methods is its ease of handling problems with complex geometries.
   Numerical simulations of an isothermal Mach 0.5, Re-D = 1 x 10(5)
   circular jet (D-j = 0.0508 m) with and without the presence of 18
   microjets (D-mj = 1 mm) were performed. The presence of microjets
   resulted in a decrease in the axial turbulence intensity and turbulent
   kinetic energy. The associated decrease in radiated sound pressure level
   was around 1 dB. The far-field sound was computed using the porous
   Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings surface integral acoustic method. The trend
   obtained is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. The
   results of this study support the accuracy of LBM based numerical
   simulations for predictions of the effects of noise suppression devices

Abstract = {{This paper introduces open-wire fault-resilient multiple-valued codes
   for reliable asynchronous point-to-point global communication links. In
   the proposed encoding, two communication modules assign complementary
   codewords that change between two valid states without an open-wire
   fault. Under an open-wire fault, at each module, the codewords don't
   reach to one of the two valid states and remains as ``invalid{''}
   states. The detection of the invalid states makes it possible to stop
   sending wrong codewords caused by an open-wire fault. The detectability
   of the open-wire fault based on the proposed encoding is proven for
   m-of-n codes. The proposed code used in the multiple-valued asynchronous
   global communication link is capable of detecting a single open-wire
   fault with 3.08-times higher coding efficiency compared with a
   conventional multiple-valued code used in a triple-modular redundancy
   (TMR) link that detects an open-wire fault under the same dynamic range

Title = {{Energy-Consistent Force Feedback Laws for Virtual Environments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{When digitally realized, virtual environments (VEs) do not perfectly
   match the physical environments they are supposed to emulate. This paper
   deals with energy aspects of such a mismatch, i.e., artificial energy
   leaks. A methodology is developed that employs smooth correction (SC)
   and leak dissipation (LD) to achieve a stable interconnection of the VE
   with the haptic device. The SC-LD naturally blends with the original
   laws for rendering the VE and gives rise to modified force feedback
   laws. These laws can be regarded as energy-consistent discretizations of
   their continuous-time counterparts. For some fundamental examples
   including virtual springs and masses, these laws are analytically
   reduced to simple closed-form equations. The methodology is then
   generalized to the multi-variable case. Several experiments are
   conducted including a 2-DOF coupled nonlinear VE example, and a scenario
   leading to a sequence of contacts with a virtual object. Besides the
   conceptual advantage, simulation and experimental results demonstrate
   some other advantages of the SC-LD over well-known time-domain passivity
   methods. These advantages include improved fidelity, simpler
   implementation, and less susceptibility to produce impulsive/chattering
   response.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we review both the fundamentals and the expansion of
   computational Bayesian econometrics and statistics applied to
   transportation modeling problems in road safety analysis and travel
   behavior. Whereas for analyzing accident risk in transportation networks
   there has been a significant increase in the application of hierarchical
   Bayes methods, in transportation choice modeling, the use of Bayes
   estimators is rather scarce. We thus provide a general discussion of the
   benefits of using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to simulate
   answers to the problems of point and interval estimation and
   forecasting, including the use of the simulated posterior for building
   predictive distributions and constructing credible intervals for
   measures such as the value of time. Although there is the general idea
   that going Bayesian is just another way of finding an equivalent to
   frequentist results, in practice Bayes estimators have the potential of
   outperforming frequentist estimators and, at the same time, may offer
   more information. Additionally, Bayesian inference is particularly
   interesting for small samples and weakly identified models.}},

Abstract = {{More than a century long research and development on utilization of
   lignocellulosic biomass for biofuels and biomaterials are still in its
   formative years and the main reason for this is the over-dependence on
   the fossil fuel reserves. Active research works in the last decades has
   resulted in a few industrial units to start, stumble and become the
   forerunners of future biorefineries. But the current system of feedstock
   logistics and biomass valorization has many drawbacks that make the
   biorefinery operations unsuccessful throughout the world. This paper
   discusses the important lignocellulosic feedstocks used, existing and
   alternate logistical practices, and the pretreatment of biomass for the
   biorefinery operations. It also emphasises on the importance of
   decentralized pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for the
   centralized biorefinery operations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This work studies the joint scheduling-admission control (SAC) problem
   for a single user over a fading channel. Specifically, the SAC problem
   is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize
   a utility defined as a function of the throughput and queue size. The
   optimal throughput-queue size trade-off is investigated. Optimal
   policies and their structural properties (i.e., monotonicity and
   convexity) are derived for two models: simultaneous and sequential
   scheduling and admission control actions. Furthermore, we propose online
   learning algorithms for the optimal policies for the two models when the
   statistical knowledge of the time-varying traffic arrival and channel
   processes is unknown. The analysis and algorithm development are relied
   on the reformulation of the Bellman's optimality equations using
   suitably defined state-value functions which can be learned online, at
   transmission time, using time-averaging. The learning algorithms require
   less complexity and converge faster than the conventional Q-learning
   algorithms. This work also builds a connection between the MDP based
   formulation and the Lyapunov optimization based formulation for the SAC
   problem. Illustrative results demonstrate the performance of the
   proposed algorithms in various settings.}},

Title = {{Energy-Efficient Power Adaptation over a Frequency-Selective Fading

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{4529-4541}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an energy-efficient power allocation for a
   multicarrier link over a frequency-selective fading channel with a
   delay-outage probability constraint. The power adaptation maximizes the
   system energy efficiency (EE), formulated as the ratio of the achieved
   effective capacity (EC) to the total expenditure power, including both
   transmission power and rate-independent circuit power. We prove that
   this objective function is quasi-concave in the transmission power, and
   derive the global optimum solution using fractional programming. Based
   on the obtained solution, we develop a power adaptation algorithm
   consisting of two steps: (i) establishing the optimum average power
   level corresponding to the maximum achievable EE with no transmit power
   constraint, and then (ii) for a given power constraint, jointly
   distributing the power over time and frequency based on the constraint
   and the optimum power level found in the first step. Analytical results
   show that the proposed EE-based power allocation has a structure similar
   to the allocation that maximizes the EC, but with a different cutoff
   threshold. Our proposed joint EE-optimal power allocation provides
   significant EE gains over both the joint spectral-efficient and
   independent-subcarrier EE-based power allocation schemes, where the
   rate-energy tradeoff becomes more pronounced with higher frequency
   selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{We derive the optimal resource allocation of a practical half-duplex
   scheme for the Gaussian multiple access channel with transmitter
   cooperation (MAC-TC). Based on rate splitting and superposition coding,
   two users transmit information to a destination over 3 phases, such that
   the users partially exchange their information during the first 2 phases
   and cooperatively transmit to the destination during the last one. This
   scheme is near capacity-achieving when the inter-user links are stronger
   than each user-destination link; it also includes partial decode-forward
   relaying as a special case. We propose efficient algorithms to find the
   optimal resource allocation for maximizing either the individual or the
   sum rate and identify the corresponding optimal scheme for each channel
   configuration. For fixed phase durations, the power allocation problem
   is convex and can be solved analytically based on the KKT conditions.
   The optimal phase durations can then be obtained numerically using
   simple search methods. Results show that as the inter-user link
   qualities increase, the optimal scheme moves from no cooperation to
   partial then to full cooperation, in which the users fully exchange
   their information and cooperatively send it to the destination.
   Therefore, in practical systems with strong inter-user links, simple
   decode-forward relaying at both users is rate-optimal.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50-51}},
Pages = {{64-68}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Critical coalescence concentration (CCC) is commonly used to
   characterize frothers. The CCC is determined from a plot of Sauter mean
   bubble size (D-32) vs. frother concentration, referred to here as the
   `addition' method. Industrial flotation systems can encounter a number
   of naturally occurring surfactants and salts that also influence bubble
   size. In effect there is a `system' CCC. This paper introduces a
   dilution method to identify the system CCC. The study verifies the
   dilution technique using the commercial frother DF-250. It is shown that
   the system CCC can be expressed as an equivalent DF-250 concentration to
   provide context and a means of comparing water samples. The viability of
   using gas holdup to provide an estimate of process water D32 is also
   explored. To illustrate the procedure three samples of process water
   from the Albian Sands bitumen processing plant were examined. They
   proved to be similar and yielded a system CCC equivalent to about 20 ppm
   DF-250. It is concluded that the dilution and frother equivalent
   techniques can be used to help identify system hydrodynamic properties.

Abstract = {{The anisotropic diffusion behavior of Zn in hcp Mg was for the first
   time experimentally investigated using diffusion couple experiments with
   Mg single crystals at temperatures between 553 and 603 K (280 and 330
   degrees C). The diffusion coefficients determined from Zn concentration
   profiles in hcp Mg single crystals are: D-perpendicular to hcp-Mg(Zn) =
   4.98 x 10(-5)exp( - 132725/RT) m(2)/s along the basal plane and
   D-parallel to hcp-Mg(Zn) = 7.33x 10(-5)exp( - 135488/RT) m(2)/s normal
   to the basal plane. The diffusion coefficient of Zn along the basal
   plane is about 1.23 times higher than the one normal to the basal plane
   at the experimental temperatures. Inter-diffusion coefficients of
   Mg2Zn3, MgZn2 and Mg2Zn11 were experimentally determined for the first
   time. In addition, the inter-diffusion coefficients of Mg12Zn13 and
   Mg51Zn20 were calculated from a multiphase diffusion model. Crown

   demonstrate the successful implementation of a tunable MIMO system with

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop optimal power adaptation schemes by means of
   power amplification coefficients at the relay for half-duplex
   single-relay amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative systems with channel
   side information (CSI) available at the relay. We consider both the
   orthogonal AF (OAF) and the nonorthogonal AF (NAF) transmission
   protocols. In particular, assuming that the relay has full knowledge of
   the channel gains, optimal power adaptation schemes under a long-term
   average power constraint are established in closed form using the mutual
   information (MI) and pairwise error probability (PEP) criteria with
   Gaussian inputs at the source. The proposed solutions can be understood
   as multidimensional (multi-D) distributed water filling in time and
   space. Numerical results show that the proposed power amplification
   methods provide a significant improvement over conventional schemes
   using either channel distribution information (CDI) or channel inversion
   (CI). The gain is observed with regard to the MI with Gaussian inputs
   and the bit-error-rate (BER) performance using finite constellations for
   both coded and uncoded systems.}},

Abstract = {{The STEP-NC-AP 238 and ISO 14649 standard is the result of a 10-year
   international effort to replace the RS274D (ISO 6983) G and M code
   standard with a modern associative language that connects the CAD design
   data used to determine the machining requirements for an operation with
   the CAM process data that is used in creating a machining solution to
   satisfy these requirements. STEP-NC builds on the previous 10 years
   effort to develop the STEP neutral data standard for CAD data, and uses
   the modern geometric constructs in that standard to specify device
   independent tool paths, and CAM independent volume removal features.
   STEP-Manufacturing, Team 24 in Working Group 3 (WG3) of ISO TC184/SC4,
   is developing and validating the STEP-NC standard in liaison with
   Working Group (WG7) of ISO TC184/SC1 who provides the domain-specific
   input (ISO 14649) used within the standard. This paper reviews the
   demonstrations carried out by STEP-Manufacturing over the past 10 years.
   These demonstrations have been international collaborations between
   industry, academia, and research agencies. Each demonstration focused on
   extending the STEP-NC data model for a different application.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the nonlinear forced dynamics of an axially moving
   beam is investigated numerically taking into account the in-plane and
   out-of-plane motions. The nonlinear partial differential equations
   governing the motion of the system are derived via Hamilton's principle.
   The Galerkin scheme is then introduced to these partial differential
   equations yielding a set of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential
   equations with coupled terms. This set is transformed into a new set of
   first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations by means of a
   change of variables. A direct time integration technique is conducted
   upon the new set of equations resulting in the bifurcation diagrams of
   Poincare maps of the system. The dynamical characteristics of the system
   are investigated for different system parameters and presented through
   use of time histories, phase-plane portraits, Poincare sections, and
   fast Fourier transforms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The short life span of many street trees in the Montreal downtown area
   may be due in part to higher than standard concentrations of trace
   metals in the tree pit soils. The effects of land use, soil organic
   matter, and time since tree planting in a given tree pit (soil age) were
   studied with respect to the total concentration of trace metals (Cr, Ni,
   Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) in soil collected from tree pits on commercial and
   residential streets. Contingency table analysis and multiple linear
   regression were applied to study how these variables were related to the
   total concentrations of trace metals in soil. Other variables, such as
   pH, street width, distance of the tree pit from the curb, and tree pit
   volume, were also used as input to statistical analysis to increase the
   analysis' explanatory power. Significantly higher concentrations of Cu,
   Cd, Zn, and Pb were observed in soils from commercial streets, possibly
   as a result of heavier traffic as compared with residential streets.
   Soil organic matter was positively correlated with the concentrations of
   Cu and Pb, probably due to the ability of organic matter to retain these
   trace metals. Nickel, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb were positively correlated with
   the soil age presumably because trace metals accumulate in the tree pit
   soil over time. This knowledge can be helpful in providing soil quality
   standards aimed at improving the longevity of downtown street trees.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose In practice, the surgeon must rely on screw position (insertion
   depth) and tactile feedback from the screwdriver (insertion torque) to
   gauge compression. In this study, we identified the relationship between
   interfragmentary compression and these 2 factors.
   Methods The Acutrak Standard, Acutrak Mini, Synthes 3.0, and
   Herbert-Whipple implants were tested using a polyurethane foam scaphoid
   model. A specialized testing jig simultaneously measured compression
   force, insertion torque, and insertion depth at half-screw-turn
   intervals until failure occurred.
   Results The peak compression occurs at an insertion depth of -3.1 mm,
   -2.8 mm, 0.9 mm, and 1.5 mm for the Acutrak Mini, Acutrak Standard,
   Herbert-Whipple, and Synthes screws respectively (insertion depth is
   positive when the screw is proud above the bone and negative when
   buried). The compression and insertion torque at a depth of -2 mm were
   found to be 113 +/- 18 N and 0.348 +/- 0.052 Nm for the Acutrak
   Standard, 104 +/- 15 N and 0.175 +/- 0.008 Nm for the Acutrak Mini, 78
   +/- 9 N and 0.245 +/- 0.006 Nm for the Herbert-Whipple, and 67 +/- 2N,
   0.233 +/- 0.010 Nm for the Synthes headless compression screws.
   Conclusions All 4 screws generated a sizable amount of compression (> 60
   N) over a wide range of insertion depths. The compression at the
   commonly recommended insertion depth of -2 mm was not significantly
   different between screws; thus, implant selection should not be based on
   compression profile alone. Conically shaped screws (Acutrak) generated
   their peak compression when they were fully buried in the foam whereas
   the shanked screws (Synthes and Herbert-Whipple) reached peak
   compression before they were fully inserted. Because insertion torque
   correlated poorly with compression, surgeons should avoid using tactile
   judgment of torque as a proxy for compression.
   Clinical relevance Knowledge of the insertion profile may improve our
   understanding of the implants, provide a better basis for comparing
   screws, and enable the surgeon to optimize compression. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A gradient-enriched shell formulation is introduced in the present study
   based on the first order shear deformation shell model and the stress
   gradient and strain-inertia gradient elasticity theories are used for
   dynamic analysis of single walled carbon nanotubes. It provides
   extensions of the first order shear deformation shell formulation with
   additional higher-order spatial derivatives of strains and stresses. The
   higher-order terms are introduced in the formulation by using the
   Laplacian of the corresponding lower-order terms. The proposed shell
   formulation includes two length scale size parameters related to the
   strain gradients and inertia gradients. The effects of the transverse
   shear, aspect ratio, circumferential and half-axial wave numbers and
   length scale parameters on different vibration modes of the
   single-walled carbon nanotubes are elucidated. The results are also
   compared with those obtained from a classical shell theory with

Abstract = {{Early detection of infertile and non-hatchable eggs would benefit
   hatcheries and poultry breeding farms by saving space, handling costs,
   and preventing contamination from exploder eggs. Therefore, it would be
   advantageous to the hatchery industry of developing a non-destructive,
   rapid, and accurate method to detect the fertility and embryo
   development of eggs. For this purpose, a near-infrared hyperspectral
   imaging system was developed to detect fertility and early embryo
   development. A total of 174 white-shell chicken eggs including 156
   fertile eggs and 18 infertile eggs were used in this study and all eggs
   were incubated in a commercial incubator for 4 days. Hyperspectral
   images were captured for all eggs on each day of incubation. After
   imaging on each day, developing embryos in randomly selected eggs were
   stopped by injecting sodium azide (NaN3). All the eggs were divided into
   two classes, fertile eggs and non-fertile eggs (including infertile eggs
   and dead embryos), and the data set of each class varied with day of
   incubation. The region of interest (ROI) of each hyperspectral image was
   segmented and the image texture information was extracted from the ROI
   of spectral images using Gabor filters. Two types of spectral
   transmission characteristics termed MS and MG, were obtained by
   averaging the spectral information of ROI and Gabor-filtered ROI,
   respectively. The dimensionality of the spectral transmission
   characteristics were reduced by PCA. The first three PCs were used for
   K-means clustering, as well as the first three bands with maximum
   responses of each spectral transmission characteristic. The best
   classification results were 100 \% at day 0, 78.8 \% at day 1, 74.1 \%
   at day 2, 81.8 \% at day 3, and 84.1 \% at day 4. A perfect detection of
   fertility prior to incubation was obtained using only the first three
   bands of maximum responses of MS. The classification results suggested
   the usefulness of the image texture information for detection of early
   embryo development. Promising results were also obtained when only the
   first three bands with maximum response of spectral transmission
   characteristics were used, which indicated the potential in applying
   hyperspectral imaging techniques to develop a real-time system for
   detecting fertility and early embryo development of chicken eggs.}},

Title = {{Bayesian road safety analysis: Incorporation of past evidence and effect
   of hyper-prior choice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{31-40}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Problem: This paper aims to address two related issues when applying
   hierarchical Bayesian models for road safety analysis, namely: (a) how
   to incorporate available information from previous studies or past
   experiences in the (hyper) prior distributions for model parameters and
   (b) what are the potential benefits of incorporating past evidence on
   the results of a road safety analysis when working with scarce accident
   data (i.e., when calibrating models with crash datasets characterized by
   a very low average number of accidents and a small number of sites).
   Method: A simulation framework was developed to evaluate the performance
   of alternative hyper-priors including informative and non-informative
   Gamma, Pareto, as well as Uniform distributions. Based on this
   simulation framework, different data scenarios (i.e., number of
   observations and years of data) were defined and tested using crash data
   collected at 3-legged rural intersections in California and crash data
   collected for rural 4-lane highway segments in Texas. Results: This
   study shows how the accuracy of model parameter estimates (inverse
   dispersion parameter) is considerably improved when incorporating past
   evidence, in particular when working with the small number of
   observations and crash data with low mean. The results also illustrates
   that when the sample size (more than 100 sites) and the number of years
   of crash data is relatively large, neither the incorporation of past
   experience nor the choice of the hyper-prior distribution may affect the
   final results of a traffic safety analysis. Conclusions: As a potential
   solution to the problem of low sample mean and small sample size, this
   paper suggests some practical guidance on how to incorporate past
   evidence into informative hyper-priors. By combining evidence from past
   studies and data available, the model parameter estimates can
   significantly be improved. The effect of prior choice seems to be less
   important on the hotspot identification. Impact on Industry: The results
   show the benefits of incorporating prior information when working with
   limited crash data in road safety studies. (C) 2013 National Safety

Abstract = {{Subsystems that are coupled due to dynamics and costs arise naturally in
   various communication applications. In many such applications the
   control actions are shared between different control stations giving
   rise to a control sharing information structure. Previous studies of
   control-sharing have concentrated on the linear quadratic Gaussian setup
   and a solution approach tailored to continuous valued control actions.
   In this paper a three step solution approach for finite valued control
   actions is presented. In the first step, a person-by-person approach is
   used to identify redundant data or a sufficient statistic for local
   information at each control station. In the second step, the
   common-information based approach of Nayyar et al. (2013) is used to
   find a sufficient statistic for the common information shared between
   all control stations and to obtain a dynamic programming decomposition.
   In the third step, the specifics of the model are used to simplify the
   sufficient statistic and the dynamic program.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the relationship between the hybrid
   passivity/finite-gain systems framework and the generalized
   Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (GKYP) lemma. In particular, we investigate how
   to optimally design finite-frequency (FF) controllers that possess
   strictly positive real (SPR) properties over a low-frequency range and
   bounded real (BR) properties over a high-frequency range. Such FF SPR/BR
   controllers will be used to control systems that have experienced a
   passivity violation. We first review the hybrid passive/finite-gain
   systems framework and how linear time-invariant hybrid
   passive/finitegain systems relate to systems with low-frequency FF
   positive real (PR) or SPR properties, and high-frequency FF BR
   properties as characterized by the GKYP lemma. Optimal design of FF
   SPR/BR controllers is considered next. A convex optimization problem
   constrained by a set of linear matrix inequalities is posed where
   constraints are imposed using various forms of the GKYP lemma, yielding
   optimal FF SPR/BR controllers. The FF SPR/BR controllers are optimal in
   that they approximate the traditional H-2 control solution. Finally, FF
   SPR/BR controllers are used within a gain-scheduling architecture to
   control a two-link flexible manipulator. Experimental results
   successfully demonstrate closed-loop stability and good closed-loop

Abstract = {{Combining-type relay systems can benefit from distributed array gain if
   the signals retransmitted from different relays are superimposed
   coherently at the destination. For this purpose, we propose a
   low-complexity hybrid framework in which the non-regenerative
   multiple-input-multiple-output relaying matrix at each relay is
   generated by cascading two substructures, akin to an equalizer for the
   backward channel and a precoder for the forward channel. For each of
   these two substructures, we introduced two one-dimensional parametric
   families of candidate matrix transformations. The first family,
   non-cooperative by nature, depends only on the backward or forward
   channel of the same relay. The second (cooperative) family also makes
   use of information derived from the channels of other relays. This
   hybrid framework allows for the classification and comparison of all
   possible combinations of these substructures, including several
   previously investigated methods and their generalizations. The design
   parameters can be optimized based on individual channel realizations or
   on channel statistics; in the latter case, the optimum parameters can be
   well approximated by linear functions of the signal-to-noise ratios. The
   proposed methods achieve a good balance between performance and
   complexity: they outperform existing low-complexity strategies by a
   large margin in terms of both capacity and bit-error rate, and at the
   same time, are significantly simpler than previous near-optimal
   iterative algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Morbidity from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) ensues when the
   pulmonary pressure reaches suprasystemic levels. A transcatheter
   alternative to the Potts shunt would allow decompression of the right
   heart without the surgical risks. To aid development of a transcatheter
   aortopulmonary shunt (TAPS) device, we described the anatomic
   relationship between the left pulmonary artery (LPA) and the descending
   aorta (dAO) in adults with severe pulmonary hypertension. Adults with
   severe PAH (peak systolic pulmonary arterial pressure {[}PASP] >= 80
   mmHg) who had computed tomography of the chest were enrolled.
   Measurements were taken on the axial plane at the level of the pulmonary
   artery bifurcation. Forty patients (male sex, 9 patients; median age +/-
   standard deviation {[}SD], 59 +/- 15 years; median PASP +/- SD, 93 +/-
   12 mmHg) were identified. The mean distance (+/- SD) between the LPA and
   dAO was 2.3 +/- 3.1 mm. The mean luminal dAO and LPA diameters (+/- SD)
   were 23.4 +/- 3.8 mm and 25.5 +/- 5.1 mm, respectively. The LPA and dAO
   approximated in 93\% of patients, with 38\% having aortic calcification
   at the contact site. The mean ``landing zone{''} width and height
   (defining an area with distance <4 mm between the outer borders) of the
   two arteries were 15.7 +/- 3.4 mm and 20: 6 +/- 4.3 mm, respectively, at
   a mean distance of 28.0 +/- 7.6 mm from the main pulmonary artery
   bifurcation. This study shows that the landing zone is able to
   accommodate a TAPS device of up to 15 mm in diameter in the majority of
   patients with severe PAH.}},

Abstract = {{The high-temperature deformation behavior of the Ni-base superalloy,
   Waspaloy, using uniaxial isothermal compression testing was investigated
   at temperatures above the gamma' solvus, 1333 K, 1373 K, and 1413 K
   (1060 A degrees C, 1100 A degrees C, and 1140 A degrees C) for constant
   true strain rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 s(-1) and up to a true
   strain of 0.83. Flow softening and microstructural investigation
   indicated that dynamic recrystallization took place during deformation.
   For the investigated conditions, the strain rate sensitivity factor and
   the activation energy of hot deformation were 0.199 and 462 kJ/mol,
   respectively. Constitutive equations relating the dynamic recrystallized
   grain size to the deformation temperature and strain rate were developed
   and used to predict the grain size and strain rate in linear
   friction-welded (LFWed) Waspaloy. The predictions were validated against
   experimental findings and data reported in the literature. It was found
   that the equations can reliably predict the grain size of LFWed
   Waspaloy. Furthermore, the estimated strain rate was in agreement with

Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},

Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{1-16}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the nonlinear forced vibrations and stability of an
   axially moving Timoshenko beam with an intra-span spring-support are
   investigated numerically. Taking into account the shear deformation and
   rotary inertia, three coupled nonlinear partial differential equations
   of motion are obtained using Hamilton's principle along with
   stress-strain relations. These equations are discretized into a set of
   coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations via the Galerkin
   method. The pseudo-arclength continuation technique is used to solve the
   governing set of equations. The frequency-response curves of the system

Title = {{Quantifying the spatial temporal variability of annual streamflow and

   wavelet analysis and GIS}},

Abstract = {{To make good policy decisions, knowledge of the trends and patterns in
   regional and local fluctuations in water resources and the influence of
   regional meteorological conditions are required. This study quantified
   the spatial-temporal variability of annual streamflow variations and
   meteorological changes in parts of eastern Canada. Time series and
   Geographic Information System (GIS) methods were used to evaluate the
   potential influence of low frequency climate change on annual spring
   flood onset and streamflow amplitude over a 24 year period. Continuous
   wavelet (CWT) and cross-wavelet transforms (XWT) were used to detect and
   extract temporal changes in the annual streamflow cycle amplitude, and
   to determine its relative phase shift to a standing 1-year sine wave
   through time. This was done to determine spatial-temporal differences
   and trends in the annual flood onset, and to determine the differences
   in the range between flood and background levels in 23 hydrological
   stations in eastern Canada. The study was carried out in the eastern
   Ontario/southwestern Quebec region of Canada because of the relatively
   high spatial density of hydrological stations from generally pristine
   waterways, as well as the high density of meteorological stations with
   uninterrupted recordings for a 24 year period from 1/1969 to 12/1992.
   This research indicates that over this 24 year period, the southwestern
   part of the region, along the US border, experienced an increase in
   temperature of up to 0.05 degrees C/year, and a decrease in
   precipitation of similar to 0.5 mm/month; the predominantly rural
   northwest region warmed only <0.02 degrees C/year and became <0.2
   mm/year wetter. During the same time interval, the annual streamflow
   shifted on average to a similar to 20 days earlier flood onset,
   following the similar northwest-southeast trend of the meteorological
   records. In the northwest, along the Ottawa River, flooding occurred
   approximately 50 days earlier in the early 1990s than in the late 1960s,
   while it was less than 10 days earlier in the southeastern streams. The
   streamflows of the Ottawa and Rideau River, the main waterways that were
   studied, have generally lower annual streamflow amplitudes than the
   smaller and more pristine waterways that experience more seasonality,
   while the annual streamflow amplitude does not show any significant
   trend in time and space. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The corrosion behavior of electrodeposited Zn-Ni alloy coatings was
   studied with a view to replace Zn and Cd coatings. A three electrode
   electrochemical cell was utilized to understand corrosion of the
   coatings in 3.5\% NaCl solution by measuring the open circuit potentials
   (OCPs), polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS). EIS was performed at intermittent time intervals to understand
   the extent of dezincification in Zn-Ni alloys and to determine the
   polarization resistance change with respect to time. Coatings were
   examined with SEM and XRD to correlate the corrosion behavior with the
   surface/interface morphology and residual stresses and to understand the
   nature of corrosion products. The effect of heat treatment and trivalent
   chrome passivation on the corrosion behavior of Zn-Ni coatings is also
   reported. Zn-Ni coatings studied here have higher polarization
   resistance, lower corrosion currents and the corrosion products offer
   additional protection in increasing the life of the coatings compared
   with Zn and Cd coatings. Based on these results Zn-Ni coatings are an
   attractive alternative to Cd and Zn coatings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A eutectic Al-Si cladding was formed on the surface of a wrought
   aluminum alloy 7075. The cladding was formed by simultaneous sintering
   and joining of the powder to the substrate surface. Interfacial strength
   and properties of the cladding were investigated, as well as the effect
   of sintering on the substrate properties. A minimum thickness of 1 mm
   for the cladding process was found in order to maintain the mechanical
   properties. During sintering, diffusion of Si, Zn, Mg and Cu across the
   interface occurred, upwards of 200 mu m into the cladding. The sintering
   process resulted in a drop in the hardness of the substrate, which was
   recoverable by solutionizing and subsequent artificial aging.
   Three-point bending was used to test the strength of the interface
   formed between the two materials and an average flexural strength was
   determined to be 260 +/- 31 MPa with an average strain to failure of

Abstract = {{The objective of this article is to quantify relationships between
   microstructural changes and the room temperature mechanical behavior of
   novel extruded Mg-Al-Zn-Sr alloys. To this aim, targeted mechanical
   testing coupled with full-field strain measurements and simultaneous
   acoustic emission recordings is further combined with grain-scale
   observations. To date, the precise effect of alloying elements on the
   plasticity of Mg alloys is still largely unknown. Strontium in wrought
   Mg alloys has already been shown to reduce grain size and texture
   anisotropy, as well as improve their creep resistance, replicating the
   effects of rare earth elements. To further investigate the effects of Sr
   on the mechanical properties and plasticity of Mg alloys compression
   tests were performed and were coupled with nondestructive measurements
   provided by digital image correlation and acoustic emission monitoring.
   The results presented herein demonstrate the effect of the extrusion
   temperature and provide direct correlations between Sr content and bulk
   mechanical properties, overall plasticity and texture evolution in these
   novel alloys. Furthermore, the addition of Sr was found to be related to
   distinct strain localizations near yielding, which were linked to
   twinning activity, providing in this way a route for quantitative
   control of their microstructural design. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The present study aims to characterize the temperature dependence of
   polyethylene (PE) solubility in hexane at high pressure using an
   atomistic-level simulation technique, without the need for expensive and
   time-consuming experimental methods, to gain significant miscibility
   insights in polymer processes that are present in a wide range of
   industrial applications. To this end, various molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations based upon the OPLS-AA force field are carried out over a
   range of 425-500 K at 50 and 200 bar to predict the temperature
   dependence of Hildebrand's solubility parameter of high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE) and hexane at these high pressures. The NVT
   simulation results compare quite favorably with the available
   experimental and theoretical data. The effect of electrostatic potential
   energy contribution to cohesive energy is also investigated, and it is
   shown that the solubility parameter decreases with increasing
   temperature for both molecular mechanical models with and without
   electrostatic terms. Subsequently, the Flory-Huggins (FH) binary
   interaction parameter is predicted from the knowledge of temperature
   dependence of solubility parameters. It is demonstrated that the
   computed binary interaction parameter increases upon increasing the
   temperature, indicating that the miscibility of the PE/hexane system
   decreases by raising the temperature. This conclusion is in agreement
   with the widely recognized lower critical solution temperature (LCST)
   fluid phase behavior. Moreover, it is shown that the increase in system
   temperature decreases the chemical potential factor of the phase
   stability condition, indicating that at higher temperatures this effect
   tends to destabilize the polymer-solvent system. Comparisons of
   electrostatic forces evaluated based on shift functions and the
   Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) methods show slight difference, and it is also
   found that the grid spacing has no noticeable influence on non-bonded
   energy terms and total potential, employed in the calculation of
   cohesive energy, a result that is useful to increase the efficiency of
   future MD simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on theoretical and experimental investigation of azimuthal and
   longitudinal modes in rolled-up microtubes at telecom wavelengths. These
   microtubes are fabricated by selectively releasing a coherently strained
   InGaAs/GaAs bilayer. We apply planar waveguide method and a
   quasi-potential model to analyze the azimuthal and longitudinal modes in
   the microtubes near 1550 nm. Then we demonstrate these modes in
   transmission spectrum by evanescent light coupling. The experimental
   observations agree well with the calculated results.
   Surface-scattering-induced mode splitting is also observed in both
   transmission and reflection spectra at similar to 1600 nm. The mode
   splitting is in essence the non-degeneracy of clockwise and
   counter-clockwise whispering-gallery modes of the microtubes. This study
   is significant for understanding the physics of modes in microtubes and
   other microcavities with three-dimensional optical confinement, as well
   as for potential applications such as microtube-based photonic
   integrated devices and sensing purposes. (c) 2013 Optical Society of

   re-endothelialization}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{Present study, for the first time, reports the development of a
   nanohybridized baculovirus based stent that can locally promote vascular
   re-endothelialization by efficient delivery of pro-angiogenic vascular
   endothelial growth factor (Vegf) genes. In vitro data demonstrated rapid
   expression of functionally active Vegf by the bioactive stent-transduced
   vascular cells. In vivo site-specific transgene expression was observed
   at the stented regions of balloon-denuded canine femoral artery, which
   eventually lead to significant endothelial recovery at the injured
   sites. A significant reduction in neointima formation (2.23 +/- 0.56
   mm(2) vs 2.78 +/- 0.49 mm(2) and 3.11 +/- 0.23 mm(2), p < 0.05; n = 8)
   and percent stenosis was observed in treated stent group compared to
   negative control and bare metal stent groups. These findings
   collectively implicate the potential of this newly developed baculovirus
   based biotherapeutic stent to ameliorate damaged vascular biology and
   attenuate re-narrowing of stented artery by inhibiting neointima
   formation.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of influence on hierarchical structures}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Dichotomous spin dynamics on a pyramidal hierarchical structure (the
   Bethe lattice) are studied. The system embodies a number of classes,
   where a class comprises nodes that are equidistant from the root (head
   node). Weighted links exist between nodes from the same and different
   classes. The spin (hereafter state) of the head node is fixed. We solve
   for the dynamics of the system for different boundary conditions. We
   find necessary conditions so that the classes eventually repudiate or
   acquiesce in the state imposed by the head node. The results indicate
   that to reach unanimity across the hierarchy, it suffices that the
   bottommost class adopts the same state as the head node. Then the rest
   of the hierarchy will inevitably comply. This also sheds light on the
   importance of mass media as a means of synchronization between the
   topmost and bottommost classes. Surprisingly, in the case of discord
   between the head node and the bottommost classes, the average state over
   all nodes inclines towards that of the bottommost class regardless of
   the link weights and intraclass configurations. Hence the role of the
   bottommost class is signified.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the
   response sensitivity of a tension leg platform (TLP) to its tendons. An
   uncoupled TLP model ignores the intrinsic dynamics and environmental
   loads on the cables by treating each tendon as an ideal massless spring.
   A coupled TLP system, in contrast, considers the effects of distributed
   mass and drag along the tendon. Under certain operating conditions, an
   uncoupled dynamics model can produce results comparable to its coupled
   counterpart. This paper defines the conditions under which it is
   acceptable to model a TLP tendon as a linear spring, as opposed to one
   that considers the cable dynamics. The analysis is performed in the
   frequency domain and, for generality, the results are
   nondimensionalized. The findings indicate that a more elaborate set of
   conditions than the platform-to-cable mass ratio must be satisfied for
   the two models to provide similar results. To conclude this study, two
   simulations are performed and compared against the performance metrics
   derived in this paper.}},

Title = {{Maximizing Design Confidence in Sequential Simulation-Based Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Computational simulation models support a rapid design process. Given
   model approximation and operating conditions uncertainty, designers must
   have confidence that the designs obtained using simulations will perform
   as expected. The traditional approach to address this need consists of
   model validation efforts conducted predominantly prior to the
   optimization process. We argue that model validation is too daunting of
   a task to be conducted with meaningful success for design optimization
   problems associated with high-dimensional space and parameter spaces. In
   contrast, we propose a methodology for maximizing confidence in designs
   generated during the simulation-based optimization process.
   Specifically, we adopt a trust-region-like sequential optimization
   process and utilize a Bayesian hypothesis testing technique to quantify
   model confidence, which we maximize by calibrating the simulation model
   within local domains if and when necessary. This ensures that the design
   iterates generated during the sequential optimization process are
   associated with maximized confidence in the utilized simulation model.
   The proposed methodology is illustrated using a cantilever beam design
   subject to vibration.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of multiphase flows, they are often studied with
   numerical simulations. These simulations must be validated with
   experimental results. This paper introduces a new approach to initialize
   the continuous phase of gas-liquid flows generated by airblast nozzles
   for microlubrication applications with a recently modified commercial
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FINE (TM)/Open. Microlubrication
   is a technology used in metal machining where the coolant flow rate is
   lower than with conventional flood cooling. In this paper, single-phase
   gas and two-phase liquid-gas flows are studied. The continuous phase is
   simulated using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled
   with a k-epsilon turbulence model and the dispersed phase is simulated
   using a Lagrangian method. To validate these simulations, particle image
   velocimetry (PIV) and particle dynamics analysis (PDA) measurements have
   been performed. This study illustrates the possibility of performing
   complex two-phase simulations with the help of single-phase studies to
   initialize the continuous phase of the flow (i.e., the gas). The
   single-phase flow also helps in estimating the magnitudes of the droplet
   velocities.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We propose and demonstrate a novel architecture for four-wave mixing
   (FWM)-based recognition of spectral amplitude code (SAC) labels in
   optical packet-switched networks. With a proper code design, a unique
   FWM idler for each SAC label, referred to as a label identifier (LI), is
   generated in a nonlinear medium. A serial array of fiber Bragg gratings
   is then used to reflect the LI wavelengths. Each LI is associated with a
   unique amount of delay between two optical signals received at two
   photodiodes (PDs). Label recognition is then achieved by measuring this
   unique time delay (referred to as the characteristic delay). The main
   advantages of the proposed method include the following: no
   serial-to-parallel conversion is required, simple label extraction is
   achieved, variable-length packets are supported, and the number of PDs
   used in the label recognition module is reduced. Moreover, the LI
   wavelengths do not need to exhibit any periodicity or match a particular
   wavelength grid; this results in a less challenging code design with
   smaller spectral occupancy for label generation. An experiment is
   conducted, where two variable-length data packets are transmitted over a
   50-km dispersion-compensated span and switched at a forwarding node. The
   SAC labels are successfully recognized, and we obtain error-free
   transmission for the switched packets with less than 0.3-dB penalty.}},

Abstract = {{Ozonolysis and hydrogenation reaction was performed on ten
   North-American vegetable oils. From these oils, canola oil and sunflower
   oil were chemically refined. Camelina, juvenile canola, three types of
   flax and three types of mustard were cold pressed and their oils were
   processed without further treatment. The production of polyols from
   unrefined vegetable oils by the ozonolysis-hydrogenation process is
   reported for the first time. The resulting polyols and mono-ols were
   characterized by GC-FID, DSC, GPC, HPLC, and their acid and hydroxyl
   numbers, viscosity and molecular weight distribution were determined.
   Results showed that the physical properties of the refined vegetable
   oils were different from the unrefined vegetable oils as they displayed
   higher hydroxyl values. However, the physical properties of the polyols
   from the unrefined starting materials are expected to be sufficient to
   be utilized as monomers for the production of polymeric materials. Crown

Abstract = {{Continuing advances in the processing technology, along with the
   significant decreases in the feature size of integrated circuits lead to
   increases in susceptibility to transient errors and permanent faults.
   Network on Chips (NoCs) have come to address the demands for high
   bandwidth communication among processing elements. The structural
   redundancy inherited in NoC-based design can be exploited to improve
   reliability and compensate for the effects of failures. In this paper,
   we propose an enhanced fault tolerant microarchitecture with
   deadlock-free routing for Hierarchical NoCs. The proposed router
   supplies dynamic Virtual Channel (VC) Allocation, and it employs a
   high-performance fault tolerant control flow, handling both transient
   and permanent faults in hierarchical networks without extra
   retransmission buffer requirements. Experimental results show a
   significant improvement in reliability as well as decreases in the
   average latency and energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common form of cancer. Diverse
   therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation have shown
   beneficial effects, but are limited because of their safety and
   toxicity. Probiotic formulations have shown great promise in CRC as
   preventive and early stage therapeutics. This review highlights the
   importance of a balanced intestinal microbiota and summarizes the recent
   developments in probiotics for treating CRC. Specifically, this report
   describes evidence of the role of probiotics in modulating the
   microbiota, in improving the physico-chemical conditions of the gut and
   in reducing oxidative stress. It also discusses the mechanisms of
   probiotics in inhibiting tumour progression, in producing anticancer
   compounds and in modulating the host immune response. Even though some
   of these effects were observed in several clinical trials, when
   probiotic formulations were used as a supplement to CRC therapies, the
   application of probiotics as biotherapeutics against CRC still needs
   further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The protective effects of grape polyphenols have been reported on oral
   health, though unreasonable alcohol consumption represents a risk factor
   for developing oral cancer. The possible effects of red wine consumption
   on salivary antiradical activity were investigated in healthy volunteers
   for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Time-course (from 0
   min to 240 min) changes of salivary radical-scavenging capacity were
   measured by the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)
   (ABTS(-+)) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH center dot) assays,
   in twelve healthy volunteers, after the intake of red wine (125 mL), a
   capsule of red wine extract (300 mg) or water (125 mL). Furthermore,
   time-course of salivary total polyphenol levels, detected by the
   Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method, was also determined. Both ABTS and
   DPPH tests showed that red wine consumption did not increase salivary
   antiradical activity in volunteers. Conversely, red wine extract
   administration caused a marked rise in salivary ABTS radical-scavenging
   capacity within 30 min, followed by a plateau up to 240 min. The same
   treatment also raised salivary DPPH radical-scavenging activity at any
   time point, though to a minor extent. The highest salivary polyphenol
   concentration was reached 30 min after wine drinking, followed by a
   steady decrease up to 240 min. Wine drinking was not associated to a
   reduced salivary antiradical capacity. However, wine extract greatly
   improved the salivary antioxidant status. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Decrease in the Integrated Circuit (IC) feature sizes leads to the
   increase in the susceptibility to transient and permanent errors. The
   growing rate of such errors in ICs intensifies the need for a wide range
   of solutions addressing reliability at various levels of abstractions.
   Network on Chip (NoC) architecture has been introduced to address the
   increasing demand for communication bandwidth among processing cores.
   The structural redundancy inherited in NoC-based system can be leveraged
   to improve reliability and compensate for the effects of failures. In
   this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant NoC router NISHA, which stands
   for No-deadlock Interconnection of Subnets in Hierarchical
   Architectures. Armed with a new flow control mechanism, as well as an
   enhanced Virtual Channel (VC) regulator, the proposed router can
   mitigate the effects of both transient and permanent errors. A
   Dynamic/Static virtual channel allocation with respect to the local and
   global traffic is supported in NISHA; thereby, it maintains a
   deadlock-free state in the presence of routers or link failures in
   hierarchical topologies. Experimental results show an enhanced operation
   of NoC applications as well as the decrease in the average latency and
   energy consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED COMPOSITE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{415-429}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Variation in fibre volume fraction is a common characteristic of
   composites made by an injection moulding process. The effect of this
   variation on fracture toughness is not yet fully investigated. This
   paper examines the fracture in fabric carbon/epoxy composite laminates
   under a wide range of combined mode-I and mode-II delamination. A total
   of 60 double cantilever beam and edge-notched flexure specimens are
   manufactured by resin transfer moulding with two different fibre volume
   fractions. It was observed that increasing the fibre volume fraction
   decreased the initiation fracture toughness in all mixed-mode ratios.
   This behaviour is believed to relate to the fact that the initiation
   fracture energy is dominantly absorbed by the resin-rich regions at the
   delamination tip. In contrast, an increase in fibre volume fraction was
   found to increase the propagation fracture toughness at high mode-I
   contribution where the fibre bridging is believed to be the major energy
   dissipating mechanism. Fractographic analysis also demonstrated that an
   increase in contribution of mode-II delamination is accompanied by a
   decrease in fibre bridging and an increase in shear hackles.}},

Abstract = {{Several finite-element time-domain (FETD) formulations to model
   inhomogeneous and electrically/magnetically/doubly dispersive materials
   based on the second-order vector wave equation discretized by the
   Newmark-beta scheme are developed. In contrast to the existing
   formulations, which employ recursive convolution (RC) approaches, we use
   a Mobius transformation method to derive our new formulations. Hence,
   the obtained equations are not only simpler in form and easier to derive
   and implement, but also do not suffer from the intrinsic limitations of
   the RC methods in modeling arbitrary high-order media. To obtain the
   formulations, we first demonstrate that the update equation for the
   electric field strength \{e\} in the mixed Crank-Nicolson (CN) FETD
   formulation, which is based on expanding the electric and magnetic field
   in terms of the edge and face elements in space and discretizing the
   resultant first-order differential equations using Crank-Nicolson scheme
   in time, is equivalent to the unconditionally stable (US) second-order
   vector wave equation for the same variable (\{e\}) discretized by the
   Newmark-beta method with beta = 1/4. In addition, we show that the
   update equation for the magnetic flux density \{b\} in CN-FETD is the
   same as the second-order vector wave equation for \{b\} on the dual grid
   discretized again by a similar Newmark-beta method.
   Subsequently, thanks to the mixed FETD formulation properties, we derive
   update equations for the constitutive relations using a Mobius
   transformation method separately. In addition, we use the shown
   equivalence to derive formulations based on the vector wave equation.
   Finally, several numerical examples are solved to validate the developed
   formulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a summary of the damage to bridges in the M-w 8.8
   Chile earthquake of 27 February 2010. Lessons from the different types
   of structural damage observed on concrete and steel bridges are
   discussed. The important roles played by soil liquefaction, settlement
   and embankment failures are highlighted. Aspects such as shear failure
   of steel piles, shear failure of concrete substructure elements,
   failures and severe buckling of steel braces, failures of shear keys and
   restrainers at supports, and damage to girders due to lack of diaphragms
   are described. Many examples of loss of superstructure support are
   presented. Skew supports and multi-span simply supported bridges were
   particularly susceptible to loss of support. Several aspects of the
   Chilean bridge design code are discussed and compared with North
   American codes (CSA S6 and AASHTO).}},

   Structural steel buildings are not common in Chile, due to the
   relatively high cost of material. The majority of damage to steel
   structures was observed in industrial facilities. In general, the
   structural steel buildings performed well. Limited damage was observed
   in some of the older buildings. Extensive damage was sustained by
   nonstructural elements, including masonry infill walls, suspended
   ceilings, partition walls, and architectural features. Brick masonry
   partition walls, commonly used in Chilean buildings, suffered damage
   when used in frame buildings with little drift control. The paper
   presents a summary of observed damage and a comparison of Chilean and

Abstract = {{For hybrid systems where the continuous state space is partitioned by
   switching manifolds, the discrete state changes autonomously if the
   continuous state hits a manifold. Recently, we introduced a version of
   the minimum principle for the optimal control of such systems, where
   necessary optimality conditions were provided for the case that a
   trajectory passes through the intersection of switching manifolds {[}1].
   Further, we introduced an algorithm based on these conditions for
   computing optimal controls by varying not only the continuous state on
   switching manifolds based on gradient information, but also the sequence
   of discrete states {[}2]. It was shown that, the combinatorial
   complexity of former computational schemes based on the minimum
   principle can be avoided, since not all possible discrete state
   sequences need to be analyzed separately. In this note, theoretical
   aspects of the algorithm and practical considerations for a successful
   implementation are discussed in detail. Further, a comparison to
   existing algorithms for the solution of hybrid optimal control problems
   with autonomous switching is presented. The efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm is demonstrated by a novel numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable segmented polyurethanes were prepared with

   studied and not different from Tecoflex (R) although an early stage of
   activation was observed on biodegradable segmented polyurethane prepared
   with dithioerythritol. Relative viability was higher than 80\% on human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells in contact with biodegradable segmented
   polyurethane extracts after 1, 2 and 7 days. Furthermore, both
   biodegradable segmented polyurethane materials supported human umbilical
   vein endothelial cell adhesion, spreading, and viability similar to
   Tecoflex (R) medical-grade polyurethane. These biodegradable segmented

Abstract = {{Collagen fibrils are believed to control the immediate deformation of
   soft tissues under mechanical load. Most extracellular matrix proteins
   remain intact during frozen sectioning, which allows them to be scanned
   using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Collagen fibrils are
   distinguishable because of their periodic roughness wavelength. In the
   present study, the shape and organization of collagen fibrils in
   dissected porcine vocal folds were quantified using nonlinear laser
   scanning microscopy data at the micrometer scale and AFM data at the
   nanometer scale. Rope-shaped collagen fibrils were observed. The
   geometric characteristics for the fibrils were fed into a hyperelastic
   model to predict the biomechanical response of the tissue. The model
   simulates the micrometer-scale unlocking behavior of collagen bundles
   when extended from their unloaded configuration. Force spectroscopy
   using AFM was used to estimate the stiffness of collagen fibrils (1 +/-
   0.5 MPa). The presence of rope-shaped fibrils is postulated to change
   the slope of the force-deflection response near the onset of
   nonlinearity. The proposed model could ultimately be used to evaluate
   changes in elasticity of soft tissues that result from the collagen
   remodeling. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We study a general framework for broadcast gossip algorithms which use
   companion variables to solve the average consensus problem. Each node
   maintains an initial state and a companion variable. Iterative updates
   are performed asynchronously whereby one random node broadcasts its
   current state and companion variables and all other nodes receiving the
   broadcast update their state and companion variables. We provide
   conditions under which this scheme is guaranteed to converge to a
   consensus solution, where all nodes have the same limiting values, on
   any strongly connected directed graph. Under stronger conditions, which
   are reasonable when the underlying communication graph is undirected, we
   guarantee that the consensus value is equal to the average, both in
   expectation and in the mean-squared sense. Our analysis uses tools from
   non-negative matrix theory and perturbation theory. The perturbation
   results rely on a parameter being sufficiently small. We characterize
   the allowable upper bound as well as the optimal setting for the
   perturbation parameter as a function of the network topology, and this
   allows us to characterize the worst-case rate of convergence.
   Simulations illustrate that, in comparison to existing broadcast gossip
   algorithms, the approaches proposed in this paper have the advantage
   that they simultaneously can be guaranteed to converge to the average
   consensus and they converge in a small number of broadcasts.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a non-binary stochastic decoding algorithm for low-density
   parity-check (LDPC) codes over GF(q) with degree two variable nodes,
   called Adaptive Multiset Stochastic Algorithm (AMSA). The algorithm uses
   multisets, an extension of sets that allows multiple occurrences of an
   element, to represent probability mass functions that simplifies the
   structure of the variable nodes. The run-time complexity of one decoding
   cycle using AMSA is O(q) for conventional memory architectures, and O(1)
   if a custom memory architecture is used. Two fully-parallel AMSA
   decoders are implemented on FPGA for two (192,96) (2,4)-regular codes
   over GF(64) and GF(256), both achieving a maximum clock frequency of 108
   MHz. The GF(64) decoder has a coded throughput of 65 Mb/s at E-b/N-0 =
   2.4 dB when using conventional memory, while a decoder using the custom
   memory version can achieve 698 Mb/s at the same E-b/N-0. At a frame
   error rate (FER) of 2 x 10(-6) the GF(64) version of the algorithm is
   only 0.04 dB away from the floating-point SPA performance, and for the
   GF(256) code the difference is 0.2 dB. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first fully parallel non-binary LDPC decoder over GF(256)
   reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Some biological tissues are repeatedly stimulated under cyclic loading,
   and this stimulation can be combined with large pressures, thus leading
   to large deformations. For such applications, visco-hyperelastic models
   have been proposed in the literature and used in finite-element studies.
   An extensively used quasi-linear model (QLVH), which assumes linear
   evolution equations, is compared with a nonlinear model (NLVH), which
   assumes a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient. The
   comparison is made here using sets of simulations covering a large
   frequency range. Lost and stored energies are computed, and the
   additional parameter of the NLVH model is set to two values found in the
   literature (NLVH-2 and NLVH-30 models). The predicted behaviour is very
   similar for all models at small strains, with each time constant (and
   corresponding viscous modulus) being associated with a damping peak and
   a stored-energy increase. When the strain amplitude is increased, the
   ratio of lost to stored energy increases for the QLVH model, but
   decreases for the NLVH models. The NLVH-30 model also displays a shift
   of the peak damping towards higher frequencies. Before reaching a steady
   state, all models display a decay of energy independent of the
   frequency, and the additional parameter of the NLVH model permits the
   modelling of complex types of evolution of the damping. In conclusion,
   this study compares the behaviour of two viscous hyper-elastic laws to
   allow an informed choice between them.}},

Abstract = {{Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) come in many types, the most
   common being fixed-wing and rotorcraft. Most of these are powered by
   brushless dc motors driving fixed-pitch propellers. Since the thrusters
   are typically quite powerful, relative to the weight of the aircraft,
   the motion of these UAVs is usually dominated by the thruster dynamics.
   It therefore becomes particularly important to have a good model of the
   thruster, which can be assembled based on simple measurements of the
   system properties, rather than from exhaustive testing. This paper
   presents such a model. The governing equations are assembled by
   considering, in succession, the motor electrodynamics and the propeller
   aerodynamics. The results of the model are compared to experimental test
   results for a particular thruster assembly. Agreement between the two is
   excellent-with an error of 4.7\% in thrust and 7.6\% in torque under
   static conditions-thereby demonstrating the validity of the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The cold spray of Ti-6Al-4V coatings deposited on Ti-6Al-4V substrates
   has been investigated. Coatings were produced using nitrogen and helium
   as propellant gases and subsequently heat treated with various
   temperature-time conditions. The microstructure was characterized by SEM
   and optical microscopy while mechanical properties were measured by
   microhardness and tensile testing. It is shown that coatings sprayed
   with nitrogen gas were relatively porous in comparison to the nearly
   completely dense coatings obtained with helium gas. In the as-sprayed
   condition, coatings displayed high hardness but low tensile strength.
   Heat treatments at temperatures of 600 A degrees C and higher resulted
   in a decrease in hardness due to microstructural changes within the
   particles including recovery, recrystallization, and/or phase
   transformation. However, an increase in tensile strength was attributed
   to improved inter-particle bonding due to an observed change from
   brittle to ductile features on the fracture surface. The highest
   strength coating produced was a helium-sprayed coating annealed at 600 A
   degrees C, which featured a tensile strength similar to 85\% of the
   minimum required bulk value and coating/substrate microstructures
   similar to the as-received powder/substrate microstructures.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled key phase diagram experimental study and thermodynamic
   modeling of the SiO2-P2O5 system was conducted. Equilibration and
   quenching experiments using sealed Pt crucibles were performed in the
   SiO2-rich region to resolve inconsistencies found in the literature data
   about the SiO2 liquidus. Based on new experimental data and all
   available and reliable phase diagram and thermodynamic data, the
   thermodynamic optimization of the SiO2-P2O5 system was carried out to
   obtain a set of thermodynamic equations for liquid and solid phases in
   the system. The liquidus slope of SiO2 indicates that P2O5 in the
   SiO2-rich liquid exists mainly in the form of P2O7 (4-) instead of PO4
   (3-). Thermodynamic properties of the liquid solution can be predicted
   from the Gibbs energy of the liquid phase.}},

Abstract = {{The comprehensive microstructural evolution of Mg-3, 6 and 9 wt.\% Al
   alloys with respect to the solidification parameters such as thermal
   gradient (G), solidification velocity (V), cooling rate (G. V) and
   solute (Al) content were investigated in the present study. Various
   solidification techniques, including directional solidification, wedge
   casting, sand and graphite mould casting, gravity casting in a Cu mould
   and water quenching, were employed in order to obtain wide ranges of
   cooling rates between 0.05 and 1000 K s(-1). The microstructural length
   scales of Mg-Al alloys, such as secondary dendrite arm spacing and
   primary dendrite arm spacing, were determined experimentally and
   compared with published models. In addition, the solidification
   parameters of morphological transitions such as cellular to columnar
   dendrite and columnar to equiaxed dendrite were also determined. Based
   on all the experimental data and the solidification model, a
   solidification map was built in order to provide guidelines for the

   to solve the discretized equations of motion numerically. Different
   types of bifurcations as well as the stability of solution branches are

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to solve ore-waste discrimination and block
   sequencing problems for given capacities through a combination of goal
   programming (GP) and simulated annealing (SA). The problem is firstly
   formulated in a goal programming form, which is expressed as the
   minimization of the violations between the production rates and the
   installed capacities under access, metal quantity and the required net
   present value (NPV) constraints. In the model, block sequencing is first
   solved by CPLEX. The violations from the capacities are allowed under a
   cost because actual grade and tonnage values of blocks cannot be known.
   The violations can be accepted to some extent because mines are planned
   and designed on the basis of simulated/estimated grades. This solution
   is then submitted to the SA module such that ore-waste discrimination is
   incorporated into the modeling. A case study was carried out to
   demonstrate the approach. The findings show that the approach gives rise
   to the profitability and can be used to generate mining schedules. (C)

Title = {{Improvement of aortic valve stenosis by ApoA-I mimetic therapy is
   associated with decreased aortic root and valve remodelling in mice}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1587-1599}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   We have shown that infusions of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) mimetic
   peptide induced regression of aortic valve stenosis (AVS) in rabbits.
   This study aimed at determining the effects of ApoA-I mimetic therapy in
   mice with calcific or fibrotic AVS.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice and mice with Werner
   progeria gene deletion (Wrn(Delta hel/Delta hel)) received high-fat
   diets for 20 weeks. After developing AVS, mice were randomized to
   receive saline (placebo group) or ApoA-I mimetic peptide infusions
   (ApoA-I treated groups, 100 mg.kg(-1) for ApoE(-/-) mice; 50 mg.kg(-1)
   for Wrn mice), three times per week for 4 weeks. We evaluated effects on
   AVS using serial echocardiograms and valve histology.
   KEY RESULTS
   Aortic valve area (AVA) increased in both ApoE(-/-) and Wrn mice treated
   with the ApoA-I mimetic compared with placebo. Maximal sinus wall
   thickness was lower in ApoA-I treated ApoE(-/-) mice. The type I/III
   collagen ratio was lower in the sinus wall of ApoA-I treated ApoE(-/-)
   mice compared with placebo. Total collagen content was reduced in aortic
   valves of ApoA-I treated Wrn mice. Our 3D computer model and numerical
   simulations confirmed that the reduction in aortic root wall thickness
   resulted in improved AVA.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
   ApoA-I mimetic treatment reduced AVS by decreasing remodelling and
   fibrosis of the aortic root and valve in mice.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by a host of recent applications requiring some amount of
   redundancy, frames are becoming a standard tool in the signal processing
   toolbox. In this paper, we study a specific class of frames, known as
   discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codes, and introduce the notion of
   systematic frames for this class. This is encouraged by a new
   application of frames, namely, distributed source coding that uses DFT
   codes for compression. Studying their extreme eigenvalues, we show that,
   unlike DFT frames, systematic DFT frames are not necessarily tight.
   Then, we come up with conditions for which these frames can be tight. In
   either case, the best and worst systematic frames are established in the
   minimum mean squared reconstruction error sense. Eigenvalues of DFT
   frames and their subframes play a pivotal role in this work.
   Particularly, we derive some bounds on the extreme eigenvalues DFT
   subframes which are used to prove most of the results; these bounds are
   valuable independently.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present work is to investigate the spatial vibration
   pattern of the gerbil tympanic membrane (TM) as a function of frequency.
   In vivo vibration measurements were done at several locations on the
   pars flaccida and pars tensa, and along the manubrium, on surgically
   exposed gerbil TMs with closed middle ear cavities. A laser Doppler
   vibrometer was used to measure motions in response to audio frequency
   sine sweeps in the ear canal. Data are presented for two different pars
   flaccida conditions: naturally flat and retracted into the middle ear
   cavity. Resonance of the flat pars flaccida causes a minimum and a
   shallow maximum in the displacement magnitude of the manubrium and pars
   tensa at low frequencies. Compared with a flat pars flaccida, a
   retracted pars flaccida has much lower displacement magnitudes at low
   frequencies and does not affect the responses of the other points. All
   manubrial and pars tensa points show a broad resonance in the range of
   1.6 to 2 kHz. Above this resonance, the displacement magnitudes of
   manubrial points, including the umbo, roll off with substantial
   irregularities. The manubrial points show an increasing displacement
   magnitude from the lateral process toward the umbo. Above 5 kHz, phase
   differences between points along the manubrium start to become more
   evident, which may indicate flexing of the tip of the manubrium or a
   change in the vibration mode of the malleus. At low frequencies, points
   on the posterior side of the pars tensa tend to show larger
   displacements than those on the anterior side. The simple low-frequency
   vibration pattern of the pars tensa becomes more complex at higher
   frequencies, with the breakup occurring at between 1.8 and 2.8 kHz.
   These observations will be important for the development and validation
   of middle ear finite-element models for the gerbil.}},

Abstract = {{Performance-based earthquake engineering necessitates the development of
   reliable nonlinear analysis models that are able to simulate the
   behavior of structures from the onset of damage through collapse. These
   models provide engineering demand parameters that are then related with
   damage measures and describe the damage of a building and its
   components. To accurately simulate dynamic response up to collapse of
   structures, it is important to model strength and stiffness
   deterioration of structural components in addition to effects. These
   models require the use of large sets of experimental data for
   calibration of their deterioration parameters. This paper discusses the
   development of three databases on experimental data of steel W-beams,
   tubular hollow square steel columns, and RC beams. These databases are
   used for quantification of important parameters that affect the cyclic
   moment-rotation relationship at plastic hinge regions in steel and RC
   components. Emphasis is placed on the prediction of collapse of
   buildings caused by earthquakes. The utilization and importance of the
   three databases in the context of performance-based earthquake
   engineering is demonstrated through a case study of a 4-story steel
   building. Its seismic performance is successfully assessed through
   collapse.}},

Abstract = {{Pathologies of the aortic valve such as aortic sclerosis are thought to
   impact coronary blood flow. Recent clinical investigations have observed
   simultaneous structural and hemodynamic variations in the aortic valve
   and coronary arteries due to regional pathologies of the aortic valve.
   The goal of the present study is to elucidate this observed and yet
   unexplained phenomenon, in which a local pathology in the aortic valve
   region could potentially lead to the initiation or progression of
   coronary artery disease. Results revealed a considerable impact on the
   coronary flow, velocity profile, and consequently shear stress due to an
   increase in the aortic wall or aortic leaflet stiffness and thickness
   which concur with clinical observations. The cutoff value of 0.75 for
   fractional flow reserve was reached when the values of leaflet thickness
   and aortic wall stiffness were approximately twice and three times their
   normal value, respectively. Variations observed in coronary velocity
   profiles as well as wall shear stress suggest a possible link for the
   initiation of coronary artery disease.}},

Abstract = {{Drug-related cues are potent triggers for relapse in people with cocaine
   dependence. Dopamine (DA) release within a limbic network of striatum,
   amygdala and hippocampus has been implicated in animal studies, but in
   humans it has only been possible to measure effects in the striatum. The
   objective here was to measure drug cue-induced DA release in the
   amygdala and hippocampus using high-resolution PET with {[}18 F]
   fallypride. Twelve cocaine-dependent volunteers (mean age: 39.6 +/- 8.0
   years; years of cocaine use: 15.9 +/- 7.4) underwent two {[}F-18]
   fallypride high-resolution research tomography-PET scans, one with
   exposure to neutral cues and one with cocaine cues. {[}F-18] Fallypride
   non-displaceable-binding potential (BPND) values were derived for five
   regions of interest (ROI; amygdala, hippocampus, ventral limbic
   striatum, associative striatum, and sensorimotor striatum). Subjective
   responses to the cues were measured with visual analog scales and
   grouped using principal component analysis. Drug cue exposure
   significantly decreased BPND values in all five ROI in subjects who had
   a high-, but not low-, craving response (limbic striatum: p = 0.019,
   associative striatum: p = 0.008, sensorimotor striatum: p = 0.004,
   amygdala: p = 0.040, and right hippocampus: p = 0.025). Individual
   differences in the cue-induced craving response predicted the magnitude
   of {[}F-18] fallypride responses within the striatum (ventral limbic: r
   = 0.581, p = 0.048; associative: r = 0.589, p = 0.044; sensorimotor: r =
   0.675, p = 0.016). To our knowledge this study provides the first
   evidence of drug cue-induced DA release in the amygdala and hippocampus
   in humans. The preferential induction of DA release among high-craving
   responders suggests that these aspects of the limbic reward network
   might contribute to drug-seeking behavior.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient irrigation system should meet crop demands for water. A
   limited water supply may result in reductions in yield, while excess
   irrigation is a waste of resources. To investigate water availability
   throughout the growing season, on-the-go sensing technologies (field
   elevation and apparent electrical conductivity) were used to analyze the
   spatial variability of soil relevant to its water-holding capacity.
   High-density data layers were used to identify strategic sites to
   monitor changes in plant-available water over time. To illustrate this
   approach, nine locations in a 37-ha agricultural field were selected for
   monitoring the soil matric potential and temperature at four depths (18,
   48, 79 and 109 cm) using wireless technology. Using a linear regression
   approach, a field-specific model was developed that quantified
   plant-available water at every field location and at specific points in
   time. Further analysis was used to quantify the percentage of the field
   that undergoes a potential shortage in water supply. These results could
   be used to optimize irrigation scheduling and to assess the potential
   for variable-rate irrigation.}},

Abstract = {{Two of the major challenges for the commercialization of automotive fuel
   cells are cost and durability. Cost estimations indicate that at a large
   production rate, the majority of the stack component cost comes from the
   catalyst ink. Decreasing this cost depends on finding a durable
   cost-effective platinum-free electrocatalyst. In this work, pure
   graphene nano-flake (GNFs) powders are produced by plasma decomposition.
   The GNFs are composed of 5-20 layers of stacked graphene sheets, a
   structure that appears to be closely associated to catalyst stability
   and durability. Additionally, the large number of attachment sites for
   nitrogen and atomic iron functionalization provide an avenue for
   improving activity. The GNFs were nitrogen functionalized and then used
   to support atomic iron to create the active sites for a non-noble
   catalyst. Iron was successfully incorporated at a value of 0.28 at\% on
   the surface of the catalyst structure. The catalyst was used on the
   cathode side of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and
   showed stability over 100 h. The performance of the catalyst
   demonstrates, to our knowledge, the first proof of a stable strictly
   iron-based fuel cell catalyst. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The structure and mechanics of fish scales display unusual and
   attractive features which could inspire new protective materials and
   systems. This natural material is therefore attracting attention over
   the past few years, and recent work demonstrated the remarkable
   performance of individual fish scales. A puncture event as would occur
   from a predator's attack however involves more than one scale, and in
   this article we therefore investigate collective mechanisms occurring
   within the scaled skin of a fish in the event of a predator's attack. We
   first demonstrate that in striped bass (Morone saxatilis), the scales
   increase by four to five times the force required to puncture the skin.
   We show that individual scales from striped bass provide a remarkable
   barrier against sharp puncture, regardless of the stiffness of the
   substrate. The scalation pattern in striped bass is such that three
   scales overlap at any point on the surface of the fish, which we show
   effectively multiplies the puncture force by three. We determined that
   the friction between scales is negligible and therefore it does not
   contribute to increasing puncture force. Likewise, we found that the
   local arrangement of the scales had little effect on the puncture
   performance. Interestingly, because the scales are several orders of
   magnitude stiffer than the substrate, indenting a few isolated scales
   results in ``sinking{''} of the scales into the substrate. The high
   local deflections and strain within the soft tissue may then result in
   blunt injury before the sharp indenter penetrates the scales.
   Stereo-imaging and image correlation performed around a puncture site in
   fish reveal that the surrounding scales collectively contribute to
   redistributing the puncture force over large volume, limiting local
   deflections and strains in the soft tissues. The structure and
   mechanisms of natural fish scales therefore offer an effective
   protection against several types of threat, and may inspire novel
   versatile protective systems with attractive flexural properties. (C)

Abstract = {{The effective thermal conductivity of anisotropic two-phase media is
   studied. Using Chang's unit cell, a new analytical solution is developed
   for anisotropic materials based on the self-consistent field concept.
   The structure comprises randomly distributed aligned elliptical
   inclusions embedded in a continuous medium. Inclusions have arbitrary
   aspect ratio and arbitrary orientation relative to the coordinate system
   of interest. The temperature distribution is solved and averaged in the
   unit cell to obtain all the components. The model shows correct limiting
   properties in all its independent variables. In particular, it yields
   Maxwell's theory in the limit where the inclusion aspect ratio
   approaches unity. Compact expressions for the components of the
   effective thermal conductivity are presented. The present model is
   compared with available expressions for anisotropic systems based on an
   equivalent inclusion model. To assess the accuracy of these, the closure
   problem associated with the volume averaging method with periodic
   boundary condition is numerically solved. The present model agrees well
   with the result of the periodic unit cell compared with equivalent
   inclusion based methods, particularly for low aspect ratios and moderate
   particle volume fractions. This is consistent with Ochoa-Tapia's
   analysis for isotropic systems that Chang's unit cell can accurately
   approximate spatially periodic models in a wider range of porosities
   compared to Maxwell's theory. The present solution can serve as a
   general 2D model for anisotropic structures with dilute to moderate
   inclusion concentrations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Convective heat transfer from cylinders embedded in porous media is
   important for many engineering applications. In the present study,
   flow-field and heat transfer around a cylinder embedded in a layer of
   homogenous porous media is investigated numerically. The range of
   Reynolds and Darcy numbers are chosen to be 1-40 and 1 x 10(-8)-1 x
   10(-1), respectively. Volume averaged equations are used for modeling
   transport phenomena within the porous layer and conservation laws of
   mass, momentum, an energy are applied in the clear region. A
   comprehensive parametric study is carried out and effects of several
   parameters, such as porous layer thickness and permeability as well as
   the Darcy and Reynolds numbers on flow-field and heat transfer
   characteristics are studied. Finally an optimization process is
   conducted in order to determine the optimal thickness and porosity of
   the porous layer resulting in the lowest heat transfer from the
   cylinder. The numerical results indicate that, in the presence of a
   porous layer around the cylinder, the wake length increases with
   decreasing the Darcy number while the critical radius of insulation
   increases. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the stiffness and strength of lattices with
   multiple hierarchical levels. We examine two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional lattices with up to three levels of structural
   hierarchy. At each level, the topology and the orientation of the
   lattice are prescribed, while the relative density is varied over a
   defined range. The properties of selected hierarchical lattices are
   obtained via a multiscale approach applied iteratively at each
   hierarchical level. The results help to quantify the effect that
   multiple orders of structural hierarchy produces on stretching and
   bending dominated lattices. Material charts for the macroscopic
   stiffness and strength illustrate how the property range of the lattices
   can expand as subsequent levels of hierarchy are added. The charts help
   to gain insight into the structural benefit that multiple hierarchies
   can impart to the macroscopic performance of a lattice. (C) 2013

   improved by 23.1\% and 23.4\%, respectively. The increased light
   absorption and effective charge separation of blend films contributed to
   the enhancement of PCE in doping devices. Moreover, by simulating the
   photocurrent of solar cells using Onsager-Braun theory, it was found
   that doping rubrene was responsible for the enhancement of charge

Abstract = {{Aspen wood (Populus tremula) was pretreated with ionic liquid
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ({[}EMIM]OAc) and dilute sulfuric

   pretreatment included wood dissolution at 120 degrees C and 5\% solid
   loading for 1, 3, and 5 h followed by regeneration using water as an
   anti-solvent. More than 95\% enzymatic digestibility was achieved for
   the ionic liquid treated wood, while the yield from the untreated wood
   was only 5.3\%. Furthermore, over 81\% of the maximum theoretical
   ethanol yield was attained after 24h fermentation of the ionic liquid

   untreated and dilute acid treated materials, respectively. A
   side-by-side comparative analysis of the pretreated materials using

Abstract = {{dinal ranges are experiencing rising air temperatures compared to their
   surrounding rural areas. This study investigated how this urban heat
   island effect (UHIE) may influence the streamflow of rivers crossing
   large urban areas on annual and multi-decadal time-scales. In order to
   detect, link, and quantify differences in meteorological and streamflow
   patterns between rural and large urban areas, this study developed a
   methodology based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT),
   cross-wavelet transform (XWT), linear regression, as well as the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test. A case study was carried out for the city of
   Ottawa, Canada as the metropolitan centre, along with three surrounding
   rural locations (Angers, Arnprior, Russell), with pristine rivers
   crossing these locations. From roughly 1970 to 2000, air temperature in
   Ottawa increased at a rate exceeding 0.035 degrees C/year, while
   parallel changes in rural areas were relatively stable, and varied by
   less than 0.025 degrees C/year. The urban warming that occurred during
   these decades was accompanied by a significant drop in the amplitude of
   annual temperatures (i.e. warmer winters). Precipitation in both urban
   and rural areas showed no significant trends, although the variability
   in the precipitation amount decreased in both settings. Concurrently,
   streamflow showed decreasing trends in both urban and rural areas.
   Annual amplitudes in urban streamflow (Rideau River through Ottawa, ON)
   correlated positively with annual air temperature amplitudes (i.e., less
   severe annual flooding with a decreasing winter/summer temperature
   contrast), whereas such a relationship was not apparent for the rural
   stations. Moreover, the timing of the annual daily minimum temperature
   cycle correlated significantly with the streamflow pattern in the urban
   area, i.e., early annual warming corresponded to earlier annual
   streamflow maxima. The precipitation pattern (i.e. distribution of rain
   and snowfall over time) significantly influenced the annual and long
   term streamflow pattern, but this influence differed little between
   urban and rural areas. It was also determined that the warming from the
   urban heat island effect, especially during winter months, was found to
   perhaps reduce the severity of the annual spring flood event in
   mid-to-high latitudinal continental settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Solute transport through extracellular matrix (ECM) is important to
   physiology and contrast agent-based clinical imaging of articular
   cartilage. Mechanical injury is likely to have important effects on
   solute transport since it involves alteration of ECM structure.
   Therefore it is of interest to characterize effects of mechanical injury
   on solute transport in cartilage. Using cartilage explants injured by an
   established mechanical compression protocol, effective partition
   coefficients and diffusivities of solutes for transport across the
   articular surface were measured. A range of fluorescent solutes
   (fluorescein isothiocyanate, 4 and 40 kDa dextrans, insulin, and
   chondroitin sulfate) and an X-ray contrast agent (sodium iodide) were
   used. Mechanical injury was associated with a significant increase in
   effective diffusivity versus uninjured explants for all solutes studied.
   On the other hand, mechanical injury had no effects on effective
   partition coefficients for most solutes tested, except for 40 kDa
   dextran and chondroitin sulfate where small but significant changes in
   effective partition coefficient were observed in injured explants.
   Findings highlight enhanced diffusive transport across the articular
   surface of injured cartilage, which may have important implications for
   injury and repair situations. Results also support development of
   non-equilibrium methods for identification of focal cartilage lesions by
   contrast agent-based clinical imaging. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the nonlinear dynamics of thin circular cylindrical
   shells with clamped-free boundary conditions subjected to axial internal
   flow is theoretically analyzed for the first time. The nonlinearity is
   geometric and is related to the large deformation of the structure. The
   nonlinear model of the shell is based on the Flugge shell theory; in
   this model, in-plane inertia terms and all the nonlinear terms due to
   the mid-surface stretching are retained. The fluid is considered to be
   inviscid and incompressible, and its modelling is based on linearized
   potential flow theory. The fluid behaviour beyond the free end of the
   shell is described by an outflow model, which characterizes the fluid
   boundary condition at the free end of the shell. At the clamped end,
   however, it is assumed that the fluid remains unperturbed. The Fourier
   transform method is used to solve the governing equations for the fluid
   and to obtain the hydrodynamic forces. The extended Hamilton principle
   is utilized to formulate the coupled fluid-structure system, and a
   direct approach is employed to discretize the space domain of the
   problem. The resulting coupled nonlinear ODEs are integrated
   numerically, and bifurcation analyses are performed using the AUTO
   software. Results indicate that the shell loses stability through a
   supercritical Hopf bifurcation giving rise to a stable periodic motion
   (limit cycle). The amplitude of this oscillation grows with flow
   velocity until it loses stability to nonperiodic oscillatory motion,
   namely, quasiperiodic and chaotic oscillation. The values of the
   critical flow velocities for various length-to-radius ratios obtained by
   nonlinear theory agree well with available experimental data. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Large amplitude vibrations of completely free rectangular plates are
   investigated for the first time. Nonlinear higher-order shear
   deformation theory is used and the nonlinear response to transverse
   harmonic excitation in the frequency neighborhood of the fundamental
   mode is studied. Geometric imperfections are taken into account. The
   numerical analysis is carried out in two steps. First, the plate
   displacements and rotations are expanded in terms of Chebyshev
   polynomials and a linear analysis is conducted to obtain the natural
   frequencies and modes of vibration. Then, the energy functional is
   discretized by using the natural modes of vibration and a system of
   nonlinear ordinary differential equations with cubic and quadratic
   nonlinear terms is obtained. A pseudo arc-length continuation and
   collocation scheme is used for bifurcation analysis of periodic
   solutions. Moreover, to validate the numerical results, experimental
   tests have been conducted for the fundamental vibration mode at several
   harmonic excitation amplitudes by using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer to
   characterize the nonlinear response of the plate with imperfections and
   closed-loop control of the excitation. The effects of geometric
   imperfections on the trend of nonlinearity and on natural frequencies
   are fully discussed and the convergence of the numerical solutions has
   been verified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a
   considerable influence on the curing behavior and crosslink density of
   epoxy resins. This invariably has an important effect on different
   thermal and mechanical properties of the epoxy network. This work
   focuses on the important role of the epoxy/hardener mixing ratio on the
   mechanical and thermal properties of a high temperature aerospace-grade
   epoxy (MY0510 Araldite as an epoxy and 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone as an
   aromatic hardener) modified with single-walled carbon nanotubes
   (SWCNTs). The effects of three different stoichiometries (stoichiometric
   and off-stoichiometric) on various mechanical and thermal properties
   (fracture toughness, tensile properties, glass transition temperature)
   of the epoxy resin and its SWCNT-modified composites were obtained. The
   results were also supported by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). For the neat resin, it was found that an
   epoxy/hardener molar ratio of 1:0.8 provides the best overall
   properties. In contrast, the pattern in property changes with the
   reaction stoichiometry was considerably different for composites
   reinforced with unfunctionalized SWCNTs and reduced SWCNTs. A comparison
   among composites suggests that a 1:1 molar ratio considerably
   outperforms the other two ratios examined in this work (1:0.8 and
   1:1.1). This composition at 0.2 wt\% SWCNT loading provides the highest
   overall mechanical properties by improving fracture toughness, ultimate
   tensile strength and ultimate tensile strain of the epoxy resin by 40\%,
   34\%, 54\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with the downlink beamforming designs in a
   coordinated multicell system with dynamic base-station (BS) assignment.
   At each cell, a multiple-antenna BS employs linear beamforming to send
   multiple data streams to its assigned mobile-stations (MSs). Exploiting
   multicell coordination, the multiple BSs jointly optimise the
   beamformers and the BS-MS assignments to enhance the overall system
   performance. With per-BS power constraints, considered are the
   coordinated beamforming problems under the following two design
   criteria: (i) minimising the transmit power margin at the BS with a set
   of target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) at the MSs and
   (ii) jointly maximising the minimum SINR margin at the MSs. As the
   original problem formulations are shown to be non-convex integer
   programs, which are combinatorially hard, the authors propose an
   efficient convex relaxation approach to solve the problems with low
   complexity. Simulations show that the convex relaxation-based assignment
   schemes significantly outperform heuristic fixed assignment schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We studied state-adopted bicycle guidelines to determine
   whether cycle tracks (physically separated, bicycle-exclusive paths
   adjacent to sidewalks) were recommended, whether they were built, and
   their crash rate.
   Methods. We analyzed and compared US bicycle facility guidelines
   published between 1972 and 1999. We identified 19 cycle tracks in the
   United States and collected extensive data on cycle track design, usage,
   and crash history from local communities. We used bicycle counts and
   crash data to estimate crash rates.
   Results. A bicycle facility guideline written in 1972 endorsed cycle
   tracks but American Association of State Highway and Transportation
   Officials (AASHTO) guidelines (1974-1999) discouraged or did not include
   cycle tracks and did not cite research about crash rates on cycle
   tracks. For the 19 US cycle tracks we examined, the overall crash rate
   was 2.3 (95\% confidence interval = 1.7, 3.0) per 1 million bicycle
   kilometers.
   Conclusions. AASHTO bicycle guidelines are not explicitly based on
   rigorous or up-to-date research. Our results show that the risk of
   bicycle-vehicle crashes is lower on US cycle tracks than published
   crashes rates on roadways. This study and previous investigations
   support building cycle tracks.}},

Abstract = {{A multiscale finite element method is applied to the Spalart-Allmaras
   turbulence model based detached-eddy simulation (DES). The multiscale
   arises from a decomposition of the scalar field into coarse (resolved)
   and fine (unresolved) scales. It corrects the lack of stability of the
   standard Galerkin formulation by modeling the scales that cannot be
   resolved by a given spatial discretization. The stabilization terms
   appear naturally and the resulting formulation provides effective
   stabilization in turbulent computations, where reaction-dominated
   effects strongly influence near-wall predictions. The multiscale DES is
   applied in the context of high-Reynolds flow over the Commonwealth
   Advisory Aeronautical Council (CAARC) standard tall building model, for
   both uniform and turbulent inflows. Time-averaged pressure coefficients
   on the exterior walls are compared with experiments and it is
   demonstrated that DES is able to resolve the turbulent features of the
   flow and accurately predict the surface pressure distributions under
   atmospheric boundary layer flows.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the lack of information regarding the phenomena of mass, heat,
   and momentum transfer in coated paper drying, substantial research work
   still needs to be done. A simulation model for coated paper drying is
   introduced which integrates heat and mass transfer mechanisms. In the
   model, the coated paper was assumed to have 3 layers (coated layer, wet
   and dry layers of the base paper), in which the thickness of each layer
   is a function of drying time and condition. The thickness of the wet
   layer of the base paper was considered to be a function of water
   permeability rate that in turn is a function of the moisture diffusion
   coefficient, time and drying rate. Movement of vapor resulting from
   evaporation in the middle layer was assumed to be a combination of
   laminar bulk flow and molecular diffusion. Radiation absorption was used

Abstract = {{A general model that predicts single-phase creeping flow pressure drop
   in microchannels of a noncircular cross section under slip and no-slip
   regimes is proposed. The model accounts for gradual variations in the
   cross section and relates the pressure drop to geometrical parameters of
   the cross section, i.e., area, perimeter, and polar moment of inertia.
   The accuracy of the proposed model is assessed by comparing the results
   against experimental and numerical data collected from various studies
   in the literature for a wide variety of cross-sectional shapes. The
   suggested model can be used for the design and optimization of
   microsystems that contain networks of microchannels with noncircular
   cross sections resulting from different fabrication techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The functional repair of large skeletal defects remains a significant
   challenge to orthopaedic surgeons due to the lack of effective
   strategies to promote bone regeneration, particularly in the elderly.
   This study investigated the potential use of bone marrow derived
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in a dense collagen scaffold with a
   bolus dose of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to repair a
   defect in the femoral diaphysis of mice. MSC isolated from bone marrow
   of 4-month-old donor mice were seeded in type I collagen gels that were
   then compressed to form scaffolds with a fibrillar density similar to
   osteoid. The cells remained metabolically active in scaffolds incubated
   in vitro for up to 15 days and differentiated into osteoblasts that
   deposited calcium-phosphate mineral into the scaffold, which was
   quantified using micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) imaging. When
   implanted in a 1 mm x 3 mm unicortical defect the MSC-loaded scaffolds
   were rapidly mineralised and integrated into host bone with
   administration of 10 ng of recombinant VEGF injected into the femoral
   canal at 4 days postoperative. Empty scaffolds and MSC-seeded scaffolds
   implanted in defects that did not receive a bolus dose of VEGF did not
   mineralise or integrate with native bone. The approach with MSC,
   hydrogels and a biologic factor already approved for human use warrants
   further pre-clinical investigation with a large animal model.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is a risk factor for
   osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Disruption
   of noncholesterol sterol absorption due to cholesterol-lowering
   therapies may result in reduced fat-soluble vitamin absorption.
   Objective: We have previously reported on the cholesterol-lowering
   efficacy and reduced sterol absorption of probiotic bile salt hydrolase
   active Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242; however, the effects on
   fat-soluble vitamins was previously unknown and the objective of the
   present study.
   Design, Settings, Patients, and Intervention: The study was
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter
   lasting 13 weeks. A total of 127 otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic
   adults with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol >3.4 mmol/L,
   triglycerides <4.0 mmol/L, and body mass index of 22 to 32 kg/m(2) were
   included. Subjects were recruited from 6 private practices in Prague,
   Czech Republic, and randomized to consume L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 or
   placebo capsules over a 9-week intervention period.
   Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was the change in serum
   low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol over the 9-week intervention.
   Analysis of fat-soluble vitamins at weeks 0 and 9 were performed post
   hoc.
   Results: There were no significant differences between L. reuteri NCIMB
   30242 and placebo capsule groups in serum vitamin A, vitamin E, or
   beta-carotene or dietary intake over the intervention period (P > .05).
   L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D by 14.9
   nmol/L, or 25.5\%, over the intervention period, which was a significant
   mean change relative to placebo of 17.1 nmol/L, or 22.4\%, respectively
   (P = .003).
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of increased
   circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D in response to oral probiotic
   supplementation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of buoyancy-driven natural convection on the performance of
   ground-coupled heat exchangers of closed loop geothermal systems is
   investigated. The governing equations of continuity, momentum, and
   energy balance are derived, taking into account a porous ground medium
   fully saturated with liquid water. Boussinesq approximation is used to
   model the effect of buoyancy forces in water. A three-dimensional
   finite-volume discretization method over a structured mesh is used to
   solve the governing equations numerically. The performance of the
   ground-coupled heat exchanger system is assessed based on the rate of
   energy extraction and the outlet fluid temperature. The effects of
   hydraulic conductivity of the heat exchange medium and seasonal
   variations of heat load on the heat transfer phenomenon are studied. The
   results are evaluated by comparing them against the results of existing
   conduction-based heat transfer models. The influence of natural
   convection on the sustainable rate of heat extraction from a geothermal
   resource is underlined and interpreted. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{There is currently very little information on the physico-chemical
   properties of rare earth element bearing minerals, or on their
   processing. With the increasing demand for rare earths, this is
   something that needs to be addressed. This paper introduces some surface
   chemistry analysis of fergusonite (YNbO4), and the bubble particle
   attachment. Zeta potential measurements indicate adsorption of sodium
   oleate and, to a lesser degree, potassium amyl xanthate onto the
   surface, and an increase in attachment to an air bubble is observed at
   pH 4.5 and 6.5. At a pH of 10.5, no attachment is observed, whether in
   the presence of the reagents or not. This analysis, although initial,
   will be used to initiate flotation tests, in order to facilitate the
   selective recovery of fergusonite. Two extensively characterised
   minerals, one hydrophilic (quartz) and one hydrophobic (galena) were
   also investigated as a comparison.}},

   available literature data for the Mn-Y and Mn-Gd systems were conducted
   to obtain reliable thermodynamic functions of all solid and liquid
   phases. Recent experimental data were taken into account and the phase
   diagram and thermodynamic properties were slightly revised for the Mn-Y
   system and considerably altered for the Mn-Gd one from previous studies.
   Both systems have quite similar thermodynamic properties and phase
   diagrams. The systematic trend observed in RE elements for Mn-RE systems

Abstract = {{Rare earth elements are becoming increasingly in demand, due to their
   prevalence in both renewable energy devices and high end electronics.
   The characterisation of the composition and morphology of the various
   phases that have valuable rare earth elements in the ores are needed in
   conjunction with the study of their physicochemical properties to
   optimise industrial process to extract the minerals containing the rare
   earth elements. Rare earth bearing minerals contain many elements with
   overlapping X-ray peaks (L- and M-lines) with an energy dispersive
   spectrometry detector, requiring a high degree of X-ray energy
   resolution. A program was developed to obtain the intensity of each peak
   by deconvolution of the X-ray spectrum. Low accelerating voltage of less
   than 5 kV and small beam diameter of less than 10 nm of a cold field
   emission scanning electron microscope allow x-ray microanalysis on the
   nanometre scale. A 100 nm wide phase was observed at 4 kV on a
   backscattered electron micrograph. Furthermore, a small beam diameter of
   less than 10 nm was used for identification of small phases of a few
   micrometres.}},

Abstract = {{Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was
   investigated for small red bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) protein hydrolysate
   produced by sequential digestion of Alcalase, papain followed by in
   vitro gastrointestinal simulation. The hydrolysate had ACE inhibitory
   activity with IC50 of 67.2 +/- 1.8 mu g protein/mL. Peptides responsible
   for potent ACE inhibitory activity were isolated by a three-step
   purification process, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and
   preparative reverse phase high performance chromatography (RP-HPLC). The
   fraction obtained after RP-HPLC fractionation with the highest activity
   yielded an IC50 of 19.3 +/- 1.4 mu g protein/mL. Enzymatic kinetic
   studies using this fraction demonstrated competitive inhibition with K-i
   of 11.6 +/- 1.7 mu g protein/mL. Mass spectrometric characterization
   identified for the first time the octapeptide PVNNPQIH which
   demonstrated an IC50 value of 206.7 +/- 3.9 mu M. The results expand the
   knowledge base of ACE inhibitory properties of small red bean protein
   hydrolysate and should be useful in further identification of specific
   ACE inhibitory peptides in beans. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{The effect of initial curing on carbonation curing of lightweight
   concrete masonry units (CMUs) was examined. Initial curing was performed
   from 4 to 18 hours at a relative humidity (RH) of 50\% and temperature
   of 25 degrees C (77 degrees F). Based on cement content, 4-hour
   carbonation curing allowed concretes to uptake 22 to 24\% CO2 with
   initial curing and 8.5\% without initial curing, while prolonged 4-day
   carbonation recorded an uptake of 35\%. Carbonated CMUs exhibited higher
   early strength but lower 28-day strength due to water loss by initial
   curing in comparison to hydrated and steam-cured references. A
   water-spray mechanism was thus devised to compensate the water loss and,
   ultimately, made the late strength of carbonated CMUs comparable to
   references. Carbonation curing can replace steam in CMU production to
   accelerate hydration, improve durability, and recycle cement kiln CO2 in
   a beneficial manner.}},

Abstract = {{The passive control of the tip vortex generated by an oscillating NACA
   0012 wing via a tip-mounted half-delta wing, in both regular and reverse
   configurations, was investigated experimentally at Re = 2.45 x 10(5).
   Velocity and vorticity measurements, performed using a miniature triple
   hot-wire probe, show that vortex breakdown occurred when the regular
   half-delta wing (HDW) was mounted, but not for the reverse half-delta
   wing (RHDW) configuration. The HDW vortex breakdown led to a rapidly
   diffused tip vortex, suggesting an enhanced wake-vortex decay. For the
   RHDW wing configuration, the tip vortex remained concentrated but had a
   smaller size and also a weaker strength and rotation compared to the
   oscillating baseline wing. In addition, the vortex center of the
   oscillating RHDW wing-generated tip vortex was also found to be greatly
   displaced, especially in the transverse direction, which could translate
   into an increased blade-vortex-impingement miss distance and, as a
   result, an alleviated blade-vortex interaction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the precoder design for a bandwidth-efficient
   bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) system over nonorthogonal
   amplify-and-forward (NAF) single-relay channels with an arbitrary length
   of cooperative frame 2N. Based on the tight union bound to the bit error
   probability (BEP), we first derive an asymptotic design criterion with
   regard to a general 2N x 2N rotation matrix. This expression allows us
   to develop a class of precoders that not only achieves full cooperative
   diversity but optimizes the asymptotic error performance as well.
   Interestingly, the developed class of optimal precoders indicates that
   the source should keep silent in the cooperative phase. In the
   broadcasting phase, it is shown that power is equally distributed to 2N
   information symbols at the source. By further examining the structure of
   the optimal class of 2N x 2N precoders, it is then revealed that
   precoding over a group of at least two information symbols is sufficient
   to fully exploit diversity and coding advantages. Such a precoding
   technique, which is referred to as symbol grouping, therefore
   significantly reduces the system complexity without sacrificing the
   error performance. Among the pool of optimal precoders with respect to
   the asymptotic performance, the design of a precoder that provides a
   good convergence property is also discussed. Numerical examples show
   that the proposed precoder greatly improves the error performance of the
   cooperative system with low complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear forced dynamics of an axially
   moving Timoshenko beam. Taking into account rotary inertia and shear
   deformation, the equations of motion are obtained through use of
   constitutive relations and Hamilton's principle. The two coupled
   nonlinear partial differential equations are discretized into a set of
   nonlinear ordinary differential equations via Galerkin's scheme. The set
   is solved by means of the pseudo-arclength continuation technique and
   direct time integration. Specifically, the frequency-response curves of
   the system in the subcritical regime are obtained via the
   pseudo-arclength continuation technique; the bifurcation diagrams of
   Poincar, maps are obtained by means of direct time integration of the
   discretized equations. The resonant response is examined, for the cases
   when the system possesses a three-to-one internal resonance and when
   not. Results are shown through time traces, phase-plane portraits, and
   fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). The results indicate that the system
   displays a wide variety of rich dynamics.}},

   the finite-time visualization of generalized stable and unstable

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of space elevator dynamics after the tether
   rupture due to its collision with a piece of space debris. The flexible
   heavy tether is modeled by a set of massive points connected by massless
   viscous bars. The tether is assumed to break at the geostationary orbit;
   its consequent motion is subject to gravitational and aerodynamic
   forces. Numerical simulation shows that, after entering the atmosphere,
   the majority of the tether segments are broken down by aerodynamic
   forces and smoothly descend to the Earth's surface. This process is
   accompanied by the formation of large loops, some of which can get
   beyond the atmosphere. Meanwhile, some parts of the tether reach the
   surface of the Earth with considerable speed, jeopardizing both
   spaceborne and ground objects in the equatorial plane.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethanes are very often used in the cardiovascular field due to
   their tunable physicochemical properties and acceptable
   hemocompatibility although they suffer from poor endothelialization.
   With this in mind, we proposed the synthesis of a family of degradable
   segmented poly(urea)urethanes (SPUUs) using amino acids (l-arginine,
   glycine and l-aspartic acid) as chain extenders. These polymers degraded
   slowly in PBS (pH 7.4) after 24 weeks via a gradual decrease in
   molecular weight. In contrast, accelerated degradation showed higher
   mass loss under acidic, alkaline and oxidative media. MTT tests on
   polyurethanes with l-arginine as chain extenders showed no adverse
   effect on the metabolism of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
   (HUVECs) indicating the leachables did not provoke any toxic responses.
   In addition, SPUUs containing l-arginine promoted higher levels of
   HUVECs adhesion, spreading and viability after 7 days compared to the
   commonly used Tecoflex(A (R)) polyurethane. The biodegradability and
   HUVEC proliferation on l-arginine-based SPUUs suggests that they can be
   used in the design of vascular grafts for tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Cryomilled eutectic aluminum-12\% silicon powder was sintered using
   spark plasma sintering (SPS) to create bulk compacts. The cryomilling
   serves to break up and disperse the eutectic phase in the powder to
   create a well-distributed Si phase throughout the matrix and to modify
   the morphology of the Si phase from plate-like to spherical, whilst
   refining the aluminium grain size to the nanometric level. The effects
   of different sintering times and temperatures using SPS on the
   densification of the powder, the aluminium grain size evolution, the
   growth of the Si phase and the morphology change of the Si phase were
   investigated. The compacts were analysed using X-ray diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The initial stages
   of densification appear to be highly dependent on the yield strength of
   the powder. An estimate of the temperature gradient seen in the powder
   bed was made and calculated to be near 200 degrees C at the highest
   point. The Al and Si phase growth was investigated and it was observed
   that the Si coarsening rate is increased due to the increased volume of
   grain boundaries. As the Si coarsens, any pinning effect on the Al
   grains is lost, resulting in a highly unstable microstructure that
   coarsens rapidly.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{8-29}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the coupled nonlinear dynamics of an axially
   moving viscoelastic beam with time-dependent axial speed is investigated
   employing a numerical technique. The equations of motion for both the
   transverse and longitudinal motions are obtained using Newton's second
   law of motion and the constitutive relations. A two-parameter
   rheological model of the Kelvin-Voigt energy dissipation mechanism is
   employed in the modelling of the viscoelastic beam material, in which
   the material time derivative is used in the viscoelastic constitutive
   relation. The Galerkin method is then applied to the coupled nonlinear
   equations, which are in the form of partial differential equations,
   resulting in a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
   with time-dependent coefficients due to the axial acceleration. A change
   of variables is then introduced to this set of ODEs to transform them
   into a set of first-order ordinary differential equations. A variable
   step-size modified Rosenbrock method is used to conduct direct time
   integration upon this new set of first-order nonlinear ODEs. The mean
   axial speed and the amplitude of the speed variations, which are taken
   as bifurcation parameters, are varied, resulting in the bifurcation
   diagrams of Poincare maps of the system. The dynamical characteristics
   of the system are examined more precisely via plotting time histories,
   phase-plane portraits, Poincare sections, and fast Fourier transforms
   (FFTs). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A general model of decentralized stochastic control called partial
   history sharing information structure is presented. In this model, at
   each step the controllers share part of their observation and control
   history with each other. This general model subsumes several existing
   models of information sharing as special cases. Based on the information
   commonly known to all the controllers, the decentralized problem is
   reformulated as an equivalent centralized problem from the perspective
   of a coordinator. The coordinator knows the common information and
   selects prescriptions that map each controller's local information to
   its control actions. The optimal control problem at the coordinator is
   shown to be a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which
   is solved using techniques from Markov decision theory. This approach
   provides 1) structural results for optimal strategies and 2) a dynamic
   program for obtaining optimal strategies for all controllers in the
   original decentralized problem. Thus, this approach unifies the various
   ad-hoc approaches taken in the literature. In addition, the structural
   results on optimal control strategies obtained by the proposed approach
   cannot be obtained by the existing generic approach (the
   person-by-person approach) for obtaining structural results in
   decentralized problems; and the dynamic program obtained by the proposed
   approach is simpler than that obtained by the existing generic approach
   (the designer's approach) for obtaining dynamic programs in
   decentralized problems.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the impact of weather on pedestrian activity, as
   well as the temporal trends of pedestrian flows in the city of Montreal,
   Canada. The direct and lagged effects of weather variables on hourly
   volumes are determined for the temperate and cold months, as well as for
   weekdays and weekends. Pedestrian hourly volumes are found to decrease
   in the winter. In downtown locations, there are three weekday pedestrian
   hourly peaks; a pattern distinctive from those observed in other
   surveys. Also, temperature, humidity, wind speed as well as direct and
   lagged effects of precipitation are the main factors affecting
   pedestrian activity. In winter, pedestrian flows are more sensitive to
   wind speeds and precipitation, and also during weekends than weekdays.
   Built environment plays a role not only in the magnitude but also in the
   temporal profile of pedestrian sidewalk activity. In comparison to
   bicycle ridership, pedestrian flows seem to be much less sensitive to
   weather. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While advances in biomineralization have been made in recent years,
   unanswered questions persist on bone- and tooth-cell differentiation, on
   outside-in signaling from the extracellular matrix, and on the link
   between protein expression and mineral deposition. In the present study,
   we validate the use of a bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) dense
   collagen hydrogel scaffold as a cell-culture model to explore these
   questions. Dental pulp progenitor/stem cells from human exfoliated
   deciduous teeth (SHEDs) were seeded into an extracellular matrix-like
   collagen gel whose fibrillar density was increased through plastic
   compression. SHED viability, morphology, and metabolic activity, as well
   as scaffold mineralization, were investigated over 24 days in culture.
   Additionally, measurements of alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity,
   together with immunoblotting for mineralized tissue cell markers ALPL
   (tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase), DMP1 (dentin matrix protein
   1), and OPN (osteopontin), demonstrated osteo/odontogenic cell
   differentiation in the dense collagen scaffolds coincident with
   mineralization. Analyses of the mineral phase by electron microscopy,
   including electron diffraction and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy,
   combined with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and biochemical
   analyses, were consistent with the formation of apatitic mineral that
   was frequently aligned along collagen fibrils. In conclusion, use of a
   3D dense collagen scaffold promoted SHED osteo/odontogenic cell
   differentiation and mineralization.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the advances made in the field of regenerative medicine, the
   progress in cutting-edge technologies for separating target therapeutic
   cells are still at early stage of development. These cells are often
   rare, such as stem cells or progenitor cells that their overall
   properties should be maintained during the separation process for their
   subsequent application in regenerative medicine. This work, presents
   separation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from rat brain
   primary cultures using an integrated thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE)-
   based multilayer microfluidic device fabricated using hot-embossing
   technology. OPCs are frequently used in recovery, repair and
   regeneration of central nervous system after injuries. Indeed, their
   ability to differentiate in vitro into myelinating oligodendrocytes, are
   extremely important for myelin repair. OPCs form 5-10\% of the glial
   cells population. The traditional macroscale techniques for OPCs
   separation require pre-processing of cells and/or multiple time
   consuming steps with low efficiency leading very often to alteration of
   their properties. The proposed methodology implies to separate OPCs
   based on their smaller size compared to other cells from the brain
   tissue mixture. Using aforementioned microfluidic chip embedded with a 5
   mu m membrane pore size and micropumping system, a separation efficiency
   more than 99\% was achieved. This microchip was able to operate at flow
   rates up to 100 mu l/min, capable of separating OPCs from a confluent 75
   cm(2) cell culture flask in less than 10 min, which provides us with a
   high-throughput and highly efficient separation expected from any cell
   sorting techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to negative-ion
   electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (RP-LC/ESI-MS/MS) was used to
   study the fatty acid profile from the oil of harvested field pea (Pisum
   sativum) varieties as part of a research project to develop this legume
   as a commercial oilseed for Canada. The seed oils from pea samples
   contained palmitic and stearic acids as major saturated fatty acids.
   Oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids were the major unsaturated fatty
   acids found. Small percentages of other long chain fatty acids were also
   detected. This profile suggests that the species of field pea
   investigated might have the potential to be used as raw materials to
   develop a future new oilseed crop for the food industry. Fatty acid

Abstract = {{We compare two different nonlinear fiber-based approaches for
   all-optical clock recovery (AOCR) at 40 Gb/s. Both involve mode-locking
   a semiconductor fiber laser (SFL); one is based on the use of a
   nonlinear optical loop Mirror (NOLM) while the second exploits nonlinear
   polarization rotation (NPR). We assess the impact of input signal
   characteristics on the RMS timing jitter and power fluctuation of the
   recovered clock. We also investigate the possibility for wavelength
   tunable operation. The results show that both approaches are capable of
   recovering a good quality clock signal over a large range of operating
   parameters. While the NPR-based approach has slightly better performance
   in terms of reduced power fluctuation and wavelength tunability, it is
   more sensitive to polarization. We also discuss the approaches for
   polarization-insensitive operation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, a compact multielement antenna system composing of
   microstrip patch antennas is designed by using electromagnetic bandgap
   (EBG) structures. Two distinct EBG structures are designed to achieve
   the two objectives of miniaturization and suppression of interelement
   coupling due to surface waves in a multiantenna system. By embedding an
   EBG array operating in the slow-wave region, the area of the microstrip
   patch antenna is reduced by 67.48\%. To alleviate the resulting
   increased back radiation, a second EBG structure is designed to surround
   the miniaturized patch antenna and close to 8 dB improvement in the
   front-to-back lobe ratio is achieved. As well, the second EBG design is
   included in a 2 x 2 multiantenna system to suppress interelement
   coupling. It is found that the coupling is reduced significantly when
   utilizing the proposed EBG rings. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{Rheological behavior of date syrup is an important factor affecting the

   degrees C) and four concentrations (17, 24,31 and 39 degrees Brix). The
   samples were subjected to a programmed shear rate increasing from 10 to
   100 s(-1) in 2 min, held constant at 100 s(-1) for 10 min and linearly
   decreasing to 10 during 2 min. The power law model was fitted to shear
   stress vs. shear rate data to obtain the consistency coefficient (m) and
   the flow behavior index (n). Both m and n were sensitive to changes in
   temperature and concentration. The apparent viscosity increases with
   increasing concentration of date syrup and a decrease in temperature.

Abstract = {{The age of groundwater, the time since the water recharged the
   subsurface, is a fundamental characteristic of groundwater that impacts
   diverse geologic processes and practical applications. The distribution
   of groundwater age depends on many factors including permeability,
   recharge rate, aquifer geometry, and topography. Seminal work simulated
   topography-driven regional groundwater flow with various topographies,
   localized high-permeability zones, and more recently with permeability
   decreasing with depth, but the role of layered aquifer systems which are
   common in both consolidated and unconsolidated sediments has not been
   systematically explored. Here we show that high age zones with
   predictable locations occur in layered geologic systems across a wide
   range of hydraulic gradients, basin geometries, and permeabilities.
   Numerical simulations of a generic three-layer aquifer system indicate
   that high age zones consistently form in the low-permeability layer near
   the middle of the basin. The zones of older groundwater result from low
   groundwater velocities in the low-permeability layer and the
   rejuvenation of the groundwater through mixing of different flow paths
   near discharge zones. The high age zones are not hydraulic stagnation
   points but are associated with areas of low velocity. Formation and
   location of zones of high groundwater ages in low-permeability units are
   important as these units are targeted for radioactive waste disposal and
   shale gas extraction. High age zones are also likely to affect geologic
   processes that depend on groundwater or solute fluxes and may serve as
   archives of past hydrological or climatological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced-order models are essential to study nonlinear vibrations of
   structures and structural components. The natural mode discretization is
   based on a two-step analysis. In the first step, the natural modes of
   the structure are obtained. Because this is a linear analysis, the
   structure can be discretized with a very large number of degrees of
   freedom. Then, in the second step, a small number of these natural modes
   are used to discretize the nonlinear vibration problem with a huge
   reduction in the number of degrees of freedom. This study finds a recipe
   to select the natural modes that must be retained to study nonlinear
   vibrations of an angle-ply laminated circular cylindrical shell that the
   author has previously studied by using admissible functions defined on
   the whole structure, so that an accuracy analysis is performed. The
   higher-order shear deformation theory developed by Amabili and Reddy is

Abstract = {{Polylactide (PLA) nanocomposites reinforced with commercially available

   interaction between polymer and clay was measured by FTIR analysis and
   contact angle measurements. Better dispersion quality and interaction
   with the polymer matrix was observed for I.34TCN organoclay. The effect
   of clay dispersion and its interaction with PLA was investigated by
   measuring the thermal, oxygen barrier and mechanical properties of the
   prepared nanocomposites; consequently, higher improvements were observed
   in the properties of nanocomposites containing I.34TCN compared to the
   I.28E counterpart. Besides, 2 wt.\% clay content was found as an optimum
   concentration for enhancing the different properties of the resulting
   nanocomposites with respect to neat PLA. However, higher improvements in

   to determine the corrosion resistance of coatings before, during and

   to understand the polarization resistance of the coatings before and
   after the wear tests. Wear tracks were analyzed with SEM and XRD to
   determine the nature of corrosion products and surface morphology
   changes during the tribocorrosion tests. Zn-Ni coatings had higher
   polarization resistance after wear test as compared to zinc and cadmium
   coatings. The mass loss due to wear enhanced corrosion was less with
   Zn-Ni than with Zn and Cd coatings. Zn-Ni coatings are a suitable

Abstract = {{Stability analysis of a horizontal cantilevered pipe conveying fluid
   with an inclined terminal nozzle is considered in this paper. The pipe
   is modelled as a cantilevered Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the flow-induced
   inertia, Coriolis and centrifugal forces along the pipe as well as the
   follower force induced by the jet-flow are taken into account. The
   governing equations of the coupled bending-torsional vibrations of the
   pipe are obtained using extended Hamilton's principle and are then
   discretized via the Galerkin method. The resulting eigenvalue problem is
   then solved, and several cases are examined to determine the effect of
   nozzle inclination angle, nozzle aspect ratio, mass ratio and
   bending-to-torsional rigidity ratio on flutter speed of the system. (c)

Abstract = {{In the present study, a theoretical method is developed to investigate
   free vibrations of circular plates immersed in fluids and a series of
   experimental tests are presented to validate the model. The coupled
   governing equations of both hydroelastic vibration of the plate and
   liquid sloshing are solved by a semi-analytical procedure,
   simultaneously. The effect of the plate, used as a baffle, on
   suppression free surface waves is also considered. Plates with two
   different boundary conditions, free-edge and clamped edge, are studied.
   The fluid domain is non-convex because of the presence of the plate,
   which introduces a singularity in the formulation of the fluid velocity
   potential. Both the least square and Galerkin methods are applied to
   determine the unknown coefficients in the velocity potential. Natural
   frequencies and mode shapes are obtained using the Rayleigh-Ritz method,
   taking fluid-structure interaction into account. The present approach is
   validated by comparison to results of modal test on two different steel
   plates with the free edge and submerged in water, as well as comparison
   to those of a commercial finite element code. The results obtained from
   the present method agree with those obtained from modal test and the
   finite element analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{A simple model is used to study the equilibrium of lipid domains on
   two-phase vesicles. Two classes of configurations are considered:
   multidomain and ground state configurations. For multidomain
   configurations, the vesicle has a finite number of identical lipid
   domains. For ground state configurations, the vesicle is fully phase
   separated into two coexisting domains. Whereas the volume enclosed by a
   vesicle with multidomains is fixed, the volume enclosed by a vesicle in
   a ground state is allowed to vary with the osmotic pressure. Guided by
   experimental observations, all domains are assumed to be spherical caps.
   In a multidomain configuration, the line tension is found to decrease
   with the number of domains present, with possible exceptions when the
   number of domains is very small. The importance of a critical osmotic
   pressure and a critical excess radius on ground state configurations is
   explored. Emphasis is placed on understanding the variations of these
   critical quantities with relevant parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Metal oxides such as ferric or aluminum oxides can play an important
   role in the retention of bacteria in granular aquatic environments;
   however, their role in bacterial inactivation is not well understood.
   Herein, we examined the role of water chemistry and surface chemistry on
   the short-term inactivation rates of three bacteria when adhered to
   surfaces. To evaluate the role of water chemistry on the inactivation of
   attached bacteria, the loss in membrane integrity of bacteria attached
   to an iron oxide (Fe2O3) surface was measured over a range of water
   ionic strengths of either monovalent or divalent salts in the absence of
   a growth substrate. The influence of surface chemistry on the
   inactivation of attached bacteria was examined, by measuring the loss in
   membrane integrity of cells attached to three surfaces (SiO2, Fe2O3, and
   Al2O3) at a specific water chemistry (10 mM KCl). Bacteria were allowed
   to attach onto the SiO2 or metal oxide coated slides mounted in a
   parallel-plate flow cell, and their inactivation rate (loss in membrane
   integrity) was measured directly without removing the cells from
   the,surface and without disturbing the system. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy analysis revealed a high correlation between the amounts of
   C-metal or O-metal bonds and the corresponding bacterial inactivation
   rates for each surface. Finally, for all three surfaces, a consistent
   increase in inactivation rate was observed with the type of bacterium in
   the order: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and
   Escherichia coli D21f2.}},

Abstract = {{Managing change can be challenging due to the high levels of
   interdependency in concurrent engineering processes. A key activity in
   engineering change management is propagation analysis, which can be
   supported using the change prediction method. In common with most other
   change prediction approaches, the change prediction method has three
   important limitations: L1: it depends on highly subjective input data;
   L2: it is capable of modelling `generalised cases' only and cannot be;
   customised to assess specific changes; and L3: the input data are
   static, and thus, guidance does not reflect changes in the design. This
   article contributes to resolving these limitations by incorporating
   interface information into the change prediction method. The enhanced
   method is illustrated using an example based on a flight simulator.}},

Abstract = {{In turbomachinery, depositing abradable coatings along the circonference
   of casings is recognized as a robust solution which combines the
   adjustment of operating clearances with the reduction of nonrepairable
   damages potentially affecting the rotating blades. Accordingly, the
   modeling of the removal process experienced by these materials is of
   growing industrial importance. Based on a numerical strategy detailed in
   a previous publication by the authors, the present study aims at
   describing the mechanical behavior of abradable coatings used within
   turbomachines in the context of translational high-speed interactions
   with a rigid tool. The developed plastic constitutive law
   macroscopically capturing the abradable material removal is first
   enriched to account for its strain rate dependence. Then, a sensitivity
   analysis with respect to a few parameters of interest is conducted and
   calibration of the numerical investigation with existing experimental
   data validates the proposed approach. Finally, the strain-rate
   dependence of the viscoplastic law implemented within a full numerical
   three-dimensional rotor/stator interaction is addressed. Results reveal
   that viscoplastic terms have minor effects in turbomachinery
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Alpha-type regularisation models provide theoretically attractive
   subgrid-scale closure approximations for large-eddy simulations of
   turbulent flow. We adopt the a-priori testing strategy to study three
   different alpha regularisation models, namely the Navier-Stokes- model,
   the Leray- model, and the Clark- model. Specifically, we use
   high-resolution direct numerical simulation data of homogeneous
   isotropic turbulence to compute the mean subgrid-scale dissipation, the
   spatial distribution of the subgrid-scale dissipation, and the spatial
   distribution of elements of the subgrid-scale stress tensor. This is
   done for different filter parameters and different large-eddy simulation
   grid resolutions. Predictions of the three regularisation models are
   compared to the exact values of the subgrid-scale stress tensor, as
   defined in the filtered Navier-Stokes equations. The potential of the
   three regularisation models to provide good approximations is quantified
   using spatial correlation coefficients. Whereas the Clark- model
   exhibits the highest spatial correlation coefficients for the
   subgrid-scale dissipation and the subgrid-scale stress tensor elements,
   the Leray- model provides lower correlation coefficients, and the
   Navier-Stokes- model exhibits the lowest correlation coefficients of the
   three models. Our results indicate the presence of an optimal choice of
   the filter parameter depending on the large-eddy simulation grid
   resolution.}},

   explore the possibilities offered by the saddlepoint approximation of

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{730-750}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Plant petioles and stems are hierarchical cellular structures,
   displaying structural features defined at multiple length scales. The
   current work focuses on the multi-scale modelling of plant tissue,
   considering two orders of structural hierarchy, cell wall and tissue.
   The stiffness of plant tissue is largely governed by the geometry of the
   tissue cells, the composition of the cell wall and the structural
   properties of its constituents. The cell wall is analogous to a fiber
   reinforced composite, where the cellulose microfibril (CMF) is the load
   bearing component. For multilayered cell wall, the microfibril angle
   (MFA) in the middle layer of the secondary cell wall (S-2 layer) largely
   affects the longitudinal stiffness for values up to 40 degrees. The MFA
   in turn influences the overall wall stiffness. In this work, the
   effective stiffness of a model system based on collenchyma cell wall of
   a dicotyledonous plant, the Rheum rhabarbarum, is computed considering
   generic MFA and volume fractions. At the cellular level, a 2-D Finite
   Edge Centroidal Voronoi tessellation (FECVT) has been developed and
   implemented to generate the non-periodic microstructure of the plant
   tissue. The effective elastic properties of the cellular tissue are
   obtained through finite element analysis (FEA) of the Voronoi model
   coupled with the cell wall properties. The stiffness of the
   hierarchically modeled tissue is critically important in determining the
   overall structural properties of plant petioles and stems.}},

Abstract = {{The Na2O-MgO-CaO-FeO-Fe2O3-Al2O3-SiO2-P2O5 system is a basic oxide
   system for the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) process as well as the hot
   metal dephosphorization process. Numerous experimental investigations on
   this oxide system are being carried out to find out an advanced process
   route for P removal from molten iron. In spite of their industrial
   importance, however, phase equilibria in oxide systems containing P2O5
   have not been well investigated due to the complexity of their
   chemistry. No systematic thermodynamic modeling of these systems has
   been conducted to date, either. In order to meet the strong demands of
   steelmaking and other industries, new systematic thermodynamic modeling
   of the P2O5-containing oxide systems
   (Na2O-MgO-CaO-FeO-Fe2O3-Al2O3-SiO2-P2O5) and key phase diagram
   experiments have been carried out over the past years. In the present
   study, the results of the thermodynamic modeling of unary, binary and
   ternary P2O5-containing systems and the applications of the
   thermodynamic database to the dephosphorization by multi-component slag

Abstract = {{Dielectric properties of ethanol + HCl and ethanol + acetic acid heated
   at different temperature levels were recorded at microwave frequencies
   ranging from 0.5 GHz to 6 GHz, and the corresponding dissipation factor
   and depth of penetration of the solutions were calculated and analyzed
   using response surface methodology for the factors of temperature level
   and ethanol and acid (HCl and acetic acid) concentration generated using
   a central composite design. In case of mixtures with acetic acid,
   ethanol concentration and temperature were found to be the significant
   factors; however in the case of mixtures with HCl, HCl concentration was
   also found to be a significant factor contributing to all analyzed
   responses. The heating rate was interpreted in terms of the different
   factors based on their effects on dissipation factor and depth of
   penetration. Overall, with an increase in the concentration of ethanol
   and at lower temperature levels, the microwave heating rate was

Title = {{Energy recovery potential in comminution processes}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46-47}},
Pages = {{83-88}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Comminution processes are cited as having an efficiency of less than
   1\%. Even if the efficiency of these processes could be increased to 5\%
   as is suggested to be possible, the conclusion would remain that
   cornminution processes are very inefficient with some 95\% of the input
   energy lost to the environment as heat. This is an interesting
   observation as one could suggest that, although comminution systems are
   very inefficient in producing new surface energy, they should be very
   efficient in producing heat. On the other hand, high efficiency in
   generating heat might be off-set by a limit on the energy that can be
   recovered.
   In this paper, four issues will be addressed: heat generated in
   comminution, potential energy recovery, different means to increase
   energy recovery in comminution processes and avenues to possible
   implementation. It will close with a discussion of a number of issues
   surrounding energy recovery in comminution processes. (C) 2013 Published

Abstract = {{One of the major problems of communication networks is congestion. In
   order to address this problem in TCP/IP networks, Active Queue
   Management (AQM) scheme is recommended. AQM aims to minimize the
   congestion by regulating the average queue size at the routers. To
   improve upon AQM, recently, several feedback control approaches were
   proposed. Among these approaches, PI controllers are gaining attention
   because of their simplicity and ease of implementation. In this paper,
   by utilizing the fluid-flow model of TCP networks, we study the PI
   controllers designed for TCP/AQM. We compare these controllers by first
   analyzing their robustness and fragility. Then, we implement these
   controllers in ns-2 platform and conduct simulation experiments to
   compare their performances in terms of queue length. Taken together, our
   results provide a guideline for choosing a PI controller for AQM given
   specific performance requirements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{It is important to investigate impurity scattering phenomena when

   present in any realistic system and can significantly influence graphene
   carrier transport. We present a short review of quantum transport where
   density functional theory (DFT) is carried out within the nonequilibrium
   Green's function formalism (NEGF), focusing on a recent extension of
   this framework in the form of nonequilibrium vertex correction (NVC)
   that captures random graphene impurity scattering in a systematic
   fashion. Our results show that disorder effects significantly alters the
   electronic and transport properties of graphene devices. We argue that
   disorder effects should not be ignored if one were to model graphene
   nanoscale devices in realistic situations, including arriving at
   fundamental electronic properties such as Ohm's law.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental method based on Rayleigh wave propagation was developed
   for quantifying the frequency-dependent viscoelastic properties of a
   small volume of expensive biomaterials over a broad frequency range.
   Synthetic silicone rubber and gelatin materials were fabricated and
   tested to evaluate the proposed method. Planar harmonic Rayleigh waves
   at different frequencies, from 80 to 4000 Hz, were launched on the
   surface of a sample composed of a substrate with known material
   properties coated with a thin layer of the soft material to be
   characterized. A transfer function method was used to obtain the complex
   Rayleigh wavenumber. An inverse wave propagation problem was solved and
   a complex nonlinear dispersion equation was obtained. The complex shear
   and elastic moduli of the sample materials were then calculated through
   the numerical solution of the obtained dispersion equation using the
   measured wavenumbers. The results were in good agreement with those of a
   previous independent study. The proposed method was found to be reliable
   and cost effective for the measurement of viscoelastic properties of a
   thin layer of expensive biomaterials, such as phonosurgical
   biomaterials, over a wide frequency range. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society

Abstract = {{While conventional mechanical and chemical polishing results in stress,
   deformation and polishing particles embedded on the surface, flat
   milling with Ar+ ions erodes the material with no mechanical artefacts.
   This flat milling process is presented as an alternative method to
   prepare a Pb-Ag alloy cross-section for scanning electron microscopy.
   The resulting surface is free of scratches with very little to no stress
   induced, so that electron diffraction and channelling contrast are
   possible. The results have shown that energy dispersive spectrometer
   (EDS) mapping, electron channelling contrast imaging and electron
   backscatter diffraction can be conducted with only one sample
   preparation step. Electron diffraction patterns acquired at 5 keV
   possessed very good pattern quality, highlighting an excellent surface
   condition. An orientation map was acquired at 20 keV with an indexing
   rate of 90.1\%. An EDS map was performed at 5 keV, and Pb-Ag
   precipitates of sizes lower than 100 nm were observed. However, the
   drawback of the method is the generation of a noticeable surface
   topography resulting from the interaction of the ion beam with a
   polycrystalline and biphasic sample.}},

Abstract = {{Proteus mirabilis is an etiological agent of complicated urinary tract
   infections. North American cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) have long
   been considered to have protective properties against urinary tract
   infections. This work reports the effects of cranberry powder (CP) on
   the motility of P. mirabilis HI4320 and its expression of flaA, flhD,
   and ureD. Our results show that swimming and swarming motilities and
   swarmer-cell differentiation were inhibited by CP. Additionally,
   transcription of the flagellin gene flaA and of flhD, the first gene of
   the flagellar master operon flhDC, decreased during exposure of P.
   mirabilis to various concentrations of CP. Moreover, using ureD-gfp, a
   fusion of the urease accessory gene ureD with gfp, we show that CP
   inhibits urease expression. Because we demonstrate that CP does not
   inhibit the growth of P. mirabilis, the observed effects are not
   attributable to toxicity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that
   CP hinders motility of P. mirabilis and reduces the expression of
   important virulence factors.}},

   analysis. FSI results yield a more accurate representation of pressure
   loads acting on moving conductors than provided by the pseudo-static

   significantly overestimates the conductor motion and the cable tensions.

Abstract = {{In this letter, we describe an easy approach to implement the

   two mixed finite-element time-domain (FETD) formulations, namely the
   Crank-Nicolson FETD (CN-FETD) and the leap-frog FETD (LF-FETD). The idea
   is to introduce a current source distribution on the outer boundary of
   the domain such that it cancels outgoing waves. The current distribution
   is obtained based on the ABC relation. In addition, we show that the
   CN-FETD and the LF-FETD are equivalent to the FETD based on the vector
   wave equation discretized by the Newmark-beta method in time with beta =
   1/4 and 0, respectively. Having utilized these equivalences, we
   demonstrate that our approach to implement the ABC in the mixed
   formulations lead to the same result as the vector wave FETD truncated
   with the same ABC. A numerical example is provided to validate our
   formulations.}},

Abstract = {{The design of high-Q microresonators requires a careful evaluation of
   thermoelastic damping (TED). Here, we consider the widely used class of
   flexural-mode bilayered beam resonators consisting of a substrate coated
   with a thin film and derive an analytical expression in the form of an
   infinite series to compute the frequency dependence of TED. The nature
   and structure of the thermoelastic dissipation spectrum were explored by
   computing TED over several decades of frequency in a large set of
   materials and structures. TED exhibits a rich variety of spectral
   features that include multiple well-resolved peaks. An approximate rule
   of mixture was obtained by retaining only the leading term of the
   infinite series. The accuracy and utility of the one-term approximation,
   which can be regarded as the analog of Zener's formula for bilayered
   beams, are discussed. Taken together, our results can be used to
   optimize the design of layered microresonators and gain useful insight

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{65-83}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A methodology is proposed to design a spatially periodic
   microarchitectured material for a two-dimensional femoral implant under
   walking gait conditions. The material is composed of a graded lattice
   with controlled property distribution that minimizes concurrently bone
   resorption and interface failure. The periodic microstructure of the
   material is designed for fatigue fracture caused by cyclic loadings on
   the hip joint as a result of walking. The bulk material of the lattice
   is Ti6AL4V and its microstructure is assumed free of defects. The
   Soderberg diagram is used for the fatigue design under multiaxial
   loadings. Two cell topologies, square and Kagome, are chosen to obtain
   optimized property gradients for a two-dimensional implant. Asymptotic
   homogenization (AH) theory is used to address the multiscale mechanics
   of the implant as well as to capture the stress and strain distribution
   at both the macro and the microscale. The microstress distribution found
   with AH is also compared with that obtained from a detailed finite
   element analysis. For the maximum value of the von Mises stress, we
   observe a deviation of 18.6\% in unit cells close to the implant
   boundary, where the AH assumption of spatial periodicity of the
   fluctuating fields ceases to hold.
   In the second part of the paper, the metrics of bone resorption and
   interface shear stress are used to benchmark the graded cellular implant
   with existing prostheses made of fully dense titanium implant The
   results show that the amount of initial postoperative bone loss for
   square and Kagome lattice implants decreases, respectively, by 53.8\%
   and 58\%. In addition, the maximum shear interface failure at the distal
   end is significantly reduced by about 79\%.
   A set of proof-of-concepts of planar implants have been fabricated via
   Electron Beam Melting (EBM) to demonstrate the manufacturability of
   Ti6AL4V into graded lattices with alternative cell size. Optical
   microscopy has been used to measure the morphological parameters of the
   cellular microstructure, including cell wall thickness and pore size,
   and compared them with the nominal values. No sign of fracture or
   incomplete cell walls was observed, an assessment that shows the
   satisfactory metallurgical bond of cell walls and the structural
   integrity of the implants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{361-380}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The annual production scheduling of open pit mines determines an optimal
   sequence for annually extracting the mineralized material from the
   ground. The objective of the optimization process is usually to maximize
   the total Net Present Value (NPV) of the operation. Production
   scheduling is typically a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) type problem
   containing uncertainty in the geologic input data and economic
   parameters involved. Major uncertainty affecting optimization is
   uncertainty in the mineralized materials (resource) available in the
   ground which constitutes an uncertain supply for mine production
   scheduling.
   A new optimization model is developed herein based on two-stage
   Stochastic Integer Programming (SIP) to integrate uncertain supply to
   optimization; past optimization methods assume certainty in the supply
   from the mineral resource. As input, the SIP model utilizes a set of
   multiple, stochastically simulated scenarios of the mineralized
   materials in the ground. This set of multiple, equally probable
   scenarios describes the uncertainty in the mineral resource available in
   the ground, and allows the proposed model to generate a single optimum
   production schedule.
   The method is applied for optimizing the annual production scheduling at
   a gold mine in Australia and benchmarked against a traditional
   scheduling method using the traditional single ``average type{''}
   assessment of the mineral resource in the ground. In the case study
   presented herein, the schedule generated using the proposed SIP model
   resulted in approximately 10\% higher NPV than the schedule derived from
   the traditional approach.}},

Abstract = {{Air evacuation is crucial to achieve low porosity for vacuum-bag-only
   manufacturing of out-of-autoclave prepregs. In this paper, the air
   permeability of composite skins was evaluated for in-plane and
   transverse air evacuation. The air permeability and microstructure were
   evaluated for three common prepreg fabric architectures: unidirectional,
   plain weave, and 5 harness satin. Since prepreg permeability is
   anisotropic, a 3-D pressure gradient can arise in honeycomb skins.
   In-order to calculate the effective air permeability coefficients of
   honeycomb skins, the computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT was
   used to determine the 1-D pressure gradient and corresponding area
   normal to flow. The air permeability coefficients were correlated to the
   prepreg microstructure using micro-CT imaging. The results showed that
   the in-plane air permeability was higher for fabrics with larger visible
   dry tow areas. The transverse air permeability was higher for prepregs
   that formed connected macro-porosity networks after lay-up, compared to
   prepregs with isolated macro-pores. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper aims to better understand the nature of flax/epoxy hot melt
   prepreg systems as well as the mechanical properties of their cured
   composites. Two uncured systems were subjected to thermal gravimetric
   analysis and compaction experiments. Composites were then produced in an
   autoclave at pressures of 1, 3 and 5 bars. Void analysis was carried out
   on the cured laminates by optical microscopy and void contents ranging
   from below 1\% to over 20\% were obtained by image analysis. The primary
   source of voids was shown to be resin starvation based on the results of
   the compaction tests. Tensile properties were shown to be strongly
   degraded by fabric crimp. Short beam tests revealed a 16\% decrease in
   interlaminar shear strength with a 3.5\% increase in void content.
   Similarly, water absorption tests showed a significant increase in rate
   of absorption likely due to the presence of voids. The results suggest
   that in order for flax/epoxy prepregs to reach their full potential, the
   level of crimp and the evacuation of moisture during cure should be of
   primary concern.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is considerable debate on the appropriate discrete choice
   framework for examining injury severity. Researchers in the safety field
   have employed ordered and unordered frameworks for examining the various
   factors influencing injury severity. The objective of the current study
   is to investigate the performance of the ordered and unordered response
   frameworks at a fundamental level. Towards this end, we undertake a
   comparison of the alternative frameworks by estimating ordered and
   unordered response models using data generated through ordered,
   unordered data and a combination of ordered and unordered data
   generation processes. We also examine the influence of aggregate sample
   shares on the appropriateness of the modeling framework. Rather than be
   limited by the aggregate sample shares in an empirical dataset,
   simulation allows us to explore the influence of a broad spectrum of
   sample shares on the performance of ordered and unordered frameworks. We
   also extend the data generation process based analysis to under reported
   data and compare the performance of the ordered and unordered response
   frameworks. Finally, based on these simulation exercises, we provide a
   discussion of the merits of the different approaches. The results
   clearly highlight the emergence of the generalized ordered logit model
   as a true equivalent ordered response model to the multinomial logit
   model for ordinal discrete variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A chemo-mechanical model is used to capture the formation and evolution
   of microdomains on the deforming surface of giant unilamellar vesicles.
   The model is intended for the regime of vesicle dynamics characterized
   by a distinct difference in time scales between shape change and species
   transport. This is achieved by ensuring that shape equilibrium holds
   away from chemical equilibrium. Conventional descriptions are used to
   define the curvature and chemical contributions to the vesicle
   energetics. Both contributions are consistently non-dimensionalized. The
   phase-field framework is used to cast the coupled model in a
   diffuse-interface form. The resulting fourth-order nonlinear system of
   equations is discretized using the finite- element method with a uniform
   cubic spline basis, which satisfies global higher-order continuity.
   Two-dimensional and axisymmetric numerical examples of domain evolution
   coupled to vesicle shape deformation are presented. Curvature-dependent
   domain sorting and shape deformation dominated by line tension are also
   considered.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A study has been undertaken of the degradation of carbon nanotube
   (CNT)-covered stainless steel mesh cathodes during exposure to
   low-pressure oxygen glow discharges. Emission spectroscopy and molecular
   absorption spectroscopy in DC glow discharge and in RF afterglow
   experiments, as well as morphological evidence, mass spectrometry
   spectra of condensed oxidation products, and molecular structure models
   have shown that plasma oxidation favors the production of 2,3 naphthalic
   anhydride. Absorption spectra taken during plasma oxidation match both
   literature sources for 2,3 naphthalic anhydride, as well as spectra of a
   chemical standard. MS data indicate that the only heavy compounds
   produced during plasma oxidation are poly-cyclic aromatics that can be
   attributed either directly to 2,3 naphthalic anhydride or to toluene,
   its major plasma decomposition product. Morphological observations using
   the scanning electron microscope support the conclusion that the
   reaction is facilitated by the field enhancement effect that accelerates
   oxygen ions to the tips of CNTs, where the oxidation takes place. Tests
   using water vapor show that oxidation is anhydrous, even in the presence
   of hydrogen. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the extent of biodegradation of non-volatile
   petroleum hydrocarbons (C16-C34) and the associated microbial activity
   in predominant aggregate sizes during a pilot-scale biopile experiment
   conducted at 15 degrees C, with a clayey soil, from a crude oil-impacted
   site in northern Canada. The in situ aggregate microstructure was
   characterized by N-2 adsorption and X-ray CT scanning. The soils in the
   nutrient (N)-amended and unamended biopile tanks were comprised of
   macroaggregates (>2 mm) and mesoaggregates (0.25-2 mm). Nutrient
   addition significantly enhanced petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation in
   macroaggregates, but not in mesoaggregates. At the end of 65-d biopile
   experiment, 42\% of the C16-C34 hydrocarbons were degraded in the
   nutrient-amended macroaggregates, compared to 13\% in the
   mesoaggregates. Higher microbial activity in the macroaggregates of the
   nutrient amended biopile was inferred from a larger increase in
   extractable protein concentrations, compared to the other aggregates.
   Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA
   genes showed that there was no selection of bacterial populations in any
   of the aggregates during biopile treatment, suggesting that the enhanced
   biodegradation in nutrient-amended macroaggregates was likely due to
   metabolic stimulation. X-ray micro CT scanning revealed that the number
   of pores wider than 4 mu m, which would be easily accessible by
   bacteria, were an order of magnitude higher in macroaggregates. Also,
   N-2 adsorption analyses showed that pore surface areas and pore volumes
   per unit weight were four to five-times larger, compared to the
   mesoaggregates. Thus the higher porosity microstructure in
   macroaggregates allowed greater hydrocarbon degradation upon
   biostimulation by nutrient addition and aeration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We experimentally study the sensitivity limits of an integrated
   Si-photonic dual-polarization balanced coherent receiver co-packaged
   with transimpedance amplifiers. For 28 Gbaud PDM-QPSK and PDM-16QAM
   signals, we compare colorless and optical preamplifierless reception to
   the case where an optical preamplifier and optical filters are used
   before the receiver. Back-to-back receiver sensitivities are evaluated.
   After propagation over an SMF-28e(+) EDFA amplified link and assuming a
   3.8 x 10(-3) FEC threshold, colorless/preamplifierless reception using
   the Si-photonic receiver allows for error-free transmission of 112 Gbps
   PDM-QPSK over 4800 km at a received power of -23 dBm and of 224 Gbps
   PDM-16QAM over 640 km at a received power of -17 dBm. Finally, a 16 x
   112 Gbps PDM-QPSK WDM experiment is carried out. Using the Si-photonic
   receiver for colorless/preamplifierless reception of all channels, we
   achieve error-free transmission for all channels over 4160 km at a
   received power of -21 dBm per channel. Results reveal that the receiver
   provides excellent sensitivity while allowing us to save cost,
   footprint, and power if used in a colorless/preamplifierless scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Fixed-point accuracy analysis and optimization of polynomial data-flow
   graphs with respect to a reference model is a challenging task in many
   digital signal processing applications. Range and precision analysis are
   two important steps of this process to assign suitable integer and
   fractional bit-widths to the fixed-point variables and constant
   coefficients in a design such that no overflow occurs and a given error
   bound on maximum mismatch (MM) or mean-square-error (MSE) and
   signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) is satisfied. This paper
   explores efficient optimization algorithms based on robust analyses of
   MM and MSE/SQNR for fixed-point polynomial data-flow graphs.
   Experimental results illustrate the robustness of our analyses and the
   efficiency of the optimization algorithms compared to previous work.}},

Abstract = {{The nanoimpact indentation technique is an emerging characterization
   technique that permits measurement of dynamic properties on a small
   scale. This article reports results on the characterization of
   nanostructured and ultrafine-grained Al-Si claddings using this
   technique. First, it was found that with this technique, the dynamic
   hardness of the material also becomes independent of the load, similar
   to nanoidentation, which yields to the concept of the existence of a
   dynamic true hardness. Second, the plasticity results have been compared
   to a strain-gradient plasticity model and have shown to deviate from the
   Nix-Gao model. Finally, a comparison between H/E and DH/E ratios has
   shown that the DH/E ratio correlates better with dry sliding wear
   results obtained for this material.}},

Abstract = {{The use of resistance welding technology to join thermoplastic composite
   aerospace structures is still contingent upon a better understanding of
   the heat transfer mechanisms occurring during welding, which govern the
   joint quality and mechanical performance. In this study, two-dimensional
   (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) transient heat transfer finite element
   models were developed to simulate resistance welding of thermoplastic
   composites. The 2D model was used to investigate the effect of the
   length of the exposed areas of the heating element to air (clamping
   distance) on the local overheating at the edges and the effects of the
   input power level on the thermal behavior of the welds. It is shown that
   controlling the clamping distance improves the thermal uniformity of the
   weld. The 3D model shows that heat conduction along the length of the
   laminates influences the thermal uniformity of the weld interface. An
   optimization chart is developed in order to minimize the undesirable
   edge effect and to define the conditions required to obtain a complete
   weld. The results of the 3D model are compared with experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Optical space switches are key elements for the next generation of
   switching fabrics in backbone routers, high performance computing
   systems, and large data processing and storage systems. A number of
   architectures and alternative options for gating elements have been
   proposed, assessed, and implemented for a limited port count. The
   challenge is to further enhance the scalability and energy efficiency of
   space switches to support future traffic loads. This paper proposes a
   heterogeneous implementation of the space switches based on two
   different types of gating elements, namely semiconductor optical
   amplifiers (SOA) and Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZI). With respect to
   the existing homogeneous implementations, a higher energy efficiency can
   be achieved by minimizing the number of SOAs, but crosstalk is
   introduced by MZI. To reduce the power consumption while still
   guaranteeing adequate physical layer performance, the design of both
   Spanke and multi-stage architectures is optimized by strategically
   placing the different gating and amplification elements, and a physical
   layer analysis is carried out to validate the performance. The proposed
   heterogeneous implementation is able to achieve power savings up to 10\%
   and 50\% in the Spanke and multi-stage Benes architectures,
   respectively, with respect to SOA-based space-switch implementations.
   Moreover, an improvement of the physical layer performance is achievable
   in the Spanke architecture thanks to the different placement of the
   SOAs.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of early-age carbonation curing on the microstructure and
   properties of lightweight concrete with expanded slag aggregates was
   examined. Carbonation was performed on concretes either immediately
   after casting or after 18-h air curing. Their corresponding carbon
   uptake was 8 and 23\%, respectively, based on cement content. A process
   involving initial air curing, carbonation curing, water compensation,
   and subsequent hydration was developed to maximize the degree of
   carbonation and hydration. Reaction products of carbonation-cured
   concretes at early and late age were characterized by using
   thermogravimetrical (TG) analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, and
   scanning electron microscopy. Although the presence of calcium
   carbonates was evident, the microstructure was nevertheless typical of
   amorphous. It was believed that early carbonation of concrete consumed
   calcium hydroxide, calcium silicate hydrates, and anhydrous calcium
   silicates while producing calcium carbonates of different polymorphs and
   amorphous calcium silicate hydrocarbonates. (c) 2013 American Society of

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to develop rules for optimal reservoir
   operation and water withdrawal from river and aquifer considering water
   supply and pollution control targets. The general approach is making use
   of an integrated water quantity-quality management (IWQM) modeling in
   conjunction with accurate data mining techniques. The IWQM model
   generates data, including; optimal releases and water withdrawal from
   river and aquifer for different conditions, and M5P and Support Vector
   Regression (SVR) data mining models utilize the results of the IWQM
   model for the derivation of rules. The IWQM model minimizes the
   deviation from water supply and water quality targets during the
   planning horizon. This method for derivation of operating rules is
   applied to a real world case study, Zayandehrood system, in Iran, with
   serious water supply and water pollution problems. The IWQM model is
   analyzed for different hydrologic and water demands scenarios with total
   dissolved solids (TDS) as the water quality indicator. Results show that
   an integrated approach to reservoir-river-aquifer operation in the study
   area can reduce the TDS by 43 \% in the downstream river.}},

Abstract = {{Given the water scarcity becoming endemic to a large portion of the
   globe, arid region irrigation has resorted to the use of treated,
   partially treated, or even untreated wastewaters. Such waters contain a
   number of pollutants, including surfactants. Applied to agricultural
   lands, these surfactants could affect the fate and transport of other
   chemicals in the soil, particularly pesticides. A field lysimeter study
   was undertaken to investigate the effect of nonionic surfactant, Brij35,
   on the in-soil fate and transport of a commonly used herbicide,
   metribuzin
   {[}4-amino-6-tert-butyl-3-(methylthio)-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one]. Nine
   PVC lysimeters, 1.0 m long x 0.45 m diameter, were packed with a sandy
   soil to a bulk density of 1.35 mg m(-3). Antibiotic-free cattle manure
   was applied (10 mg ha(-1)) at the surface of the lysimeters. Metribuzin
   was then applied to the soil surface of all lysimeters at a rate of 1.00
   kg a.i. ha(-1). Each of three aqueous Brij35 solutions, 0, 0.5 and 5 mg
   L-1 (i.e., ``good{''}, ``poor{''} and ``very poor{''} quality irrigation
   water) were each applied to the lysimeters in triplicate. Analysis for
   metribuzin residues in samples of both soil and leachate, collected over
   a 90-day period, showed the surfactant Brij35 to have increased the
   mobility of metribuzin in soil, indicating that continued use of poor
   quality water could influence pesticide transport in agricultural soils,

   partial elevator is studied. For such a system, the center of mass,
   center of gravity, and center of orbit are not coincident; disregarding
   this distinction can lead to erroneous results. A relation between these
   three points is presented in this paper. A consistent stress
   distribution along the tether is obtained by taking into account the
   distinction between these points. Dynamics of the system consisting of
   two end bodies, the tether (with mass), and a climber is examined. The
   equations of motion are derived using the Lagrangian formulation and
   analyzed numerically. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, the anisotropic diffusion behavior of Al in hcp Mg was
   for the first time experimentally investigated using the diffusion
   couple technique with single crystal Mg at the temperatures ranging
   between 638 K and 693 K (365 A degrees C and 420 A degrees C). The
   diffusion coefficients derived from Al profiles in single crystal hcp Mg
   are D (aSyen(a-axis)) = 3.1 x 10(-3) (m(2)/s) exp(-152154/RT) and D (a
   center dot(c-axis)) = 8.7 x 10(-3)(m(2)/s) exp(-159221/RT). The
   diffusion coefficient of Al within the basal plane is about 1.3 times
   greater than that along normal direction of the basal plane at the
   experimental temperatures. The interdiffusion coefficients of Mg17Al12
   and Mg2Al3 solid solutions were also derived, and the values are similar

Abstract = {{Pulse flours have great potential for use as ingredients in the food
   industry because of their good functional properties and health
   benefits. In this study, raw lentil flour and lentil flour and seeds
   subjected to different thermal processing treatments (i.e., ground
   roasted seeds; roasted flours; pre-cooked, ground and freeze-dried
   seeds; pre-cooked, ground and spray-dried seeds) were used to supplement
   salad dressing emulsions. The effect of lentil addition on color,
   physical stability, rheological, microstructural and sensory properties
   was evaluated. The control sample (i.e., without pulse supplementation)
   had the lowest values for consistency coefficient (m), apparent
   viscosity (eta(ap)) and plateau modulus (G(N)(0)), which indicated lower
   viscoelastic properties, and further suggested that addition of pulse
   flours had a thickening effect. Dressings supplemented with pre-cooked
   freeze- and spray-dried lentil flours had the highest rheological
   properties. Overall, the results showed that thermally-processed pulse
   flours may be suitable as value-added ingredients in salad dressing

Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Prior to this study, the earliest appearance of circulating endothelial
   cells in warm-blooded animals was unknown. Time-lapse imaging of
   germ-line transformed Tie1-YFP reporter quail embryos combined with the
   endothelial marker antibody QH1 provides definitive evidence for the
   existence of circulating endothelial cells - from the very beginning of
   blood flow. Blood-smear counts of circulating cells from Tie1-YFP
   embryos showed that up to 30\% of blood-borne cells are Tie1 positive;
   though cells expressing low levels of YFP were also positive for
   benzidine, a hemoglobin stain, suggesting that these cells were
   differentiating into erythroblasts. Electroporation-based time-lapse
   experiments, exclusively targeting the intra-embryonic mesoderm were
   combined with QH1 immunostaining. The latter antibody marks quail
   endothelial cells. Together the optical data provide conclusive evidence
   that endothelial cells can enter blood flow from vessels of the embryo
   proper, as well as from extra-embryonic areas. When Tie1-YFP positive
   cells and tissues are transplanted to wild type host embryos,
   fluorescent cells emigrate from such transplants and join host vessels;
   subsequently a few YFP cells are shed into circulation. These data
   establish that entering circulation is a commonplace activity of
   embryonic vascular endothelial cells. We conclude that in the class of
   vertebrates most closely related to mammals a normal component of
   primary vasculogenesis is production of endothelial cells that enter
   circulation from all vessels, both intra-and extra-embryonic.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of controllers that minimize a H2 performance index
   subject to a strictly positive real (SPR) constraint is considered. Two
   controller synthesis methods are presented that are then combined into
   an iterative algorithm. Each method synthesizes optimal SPR controllers
   by posing a convex optimization problem where constraints are enforced
   via linear matrix inequalities. Additionally, each method fixes the
   controller state-feedback gain matrix and finds an observer gain matrix
   such that an upper bound on the closed-loop H2-norm is minimized and the
   controller is SPR. The first method retools the standard H2-optimal
   control problem by using a common Lyapunov matrix variable to satisfy
   both the H2 criteria and the SPR constraint. The second method overcomes
   bilinear matrix inequality issues associated with the H2 performance and
   the SPR constraint by employing a completing the square method and an
   overbounding technique. Both synthesis methods are used within an
   iterative scheme to find optimal SPR controllers in a sequential manner.
   Comparison of our synthesis methods to existing methods in the
   literature is presented. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is used to characterize the
   electrical characteristics of vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) Si nanowires
   (NWs) that are grown in-place between two predefined electrodes. KPFM
   measurements are performed under an applied bias. Besides contact
   potential differences due to differing materials, the two other primary
   contributions to measured variations on Si NWs between electrodes are:
   trapped charges at interfaces, and the parallel and serial capacitance,
   which are accounted for with voltage normalization and oxide
   normalization. These two normalization processes alongside
   finite-element-method simulations are necessary to characterize the
   bias-dependent response of Si NWs. After applying both normalization
   methods on open-circuit NWs, which results in a baseline of zero, we
   conclude that we have accounted for all the major contributions to CPDs
   and we can isolate effects due to applied bias such as impurity states
   and charged carrier flow, as well as find open connections when NWs are
   connected in parallel. These characterization and normalization methods
   can also be used to determine that the specific contact resistance of
   electrodes to the NWs is on the order of mu Omega cm(2). Thus, the VLS
   growth method between predefined electrodes overcomes the challenge of
   making low-resistance contacts to nanoscale systems. Thereby, the
   experiments and analysis presented outline a systematic method for
   characterizing nanowires in parallel arrays under device operation
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to fiber optical parametric amplification, theoretical
   studies on the dynamics of fiber optical parametric oscillation are
   rare. In this letter, we propose a precise nonlinear model to predict
   the saturation gain and the output power of a fiber optical parametric
   oscillator (FOPO) in the steady state. This model utilizes the
   sinusoidal-input describing function as a quasi-linear approximation of
   the nonlinear dynamics of parametric amplification. To complete the
   nonlinear model of a FOPO, a model for the linear part of the FOPO
   cavity is established, and then the block diagram of a FOPO is derived.
   Based on this block diagram and the related transfer function, a
   graphical approach to attain the saturation gain and output power is
   introduced. In addition, a simplified graphical approach and a
   theoretical upper bound for the output power are investigated. Finally,
   the proposed model is experimentally verified, in which the theory is in
   agreement with the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the first in a two-part study of the dynamics of long
   pipes towed underwater. In this part, Part 1, the three-dimensional
   equations of motion are derived for the dynamics of the system. Inviscid
   forces are modelled by adapting Lighthill's slender-body work to the
   problem at hand, while the viscous forces are modelled by elaboration of
   Taylor's expressions. The effect of cross-currents is also considered in
   the equations of motion. The pipeline is flexibly connected to the

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method of solution based on a finite difference scheme
   is developed, via which the partial differential equations of motion and
   boundary conditions, presented in Part 1, are converted into a set of
   first-order ODEs which are then solved numerically. The mathematical
   model is validated by considering some simplifications which enable us
   to compare the numerical results with the results of short pipes simply
   supported at both ends (pinned-pinned) and subjected to axial flow. A
   typical Argand diagram is then presented for a long pipe ((L) over cap =
   2000 m) which shows the evolution of lowest three eigenfrequencies of
   the system as a function of nondimensional flow velocity (towing speed),
   For the same pipe, the deformation and time-trace diagrams at different
   values of flow velocity are also given. The results show clearly that a
   long pipe towed underwater may lose stability by divergence and at
   higher flow velocities by flutter; the deformation is confined to a
   small segment of the pipe, close to the downstream end. Some numerical
   comparisons are also presented in which the effects of cable stiffness
   and the skin friction coefficient on the onset of instabilities are
   studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To determine how statin drugs (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme
   A reductase inhibitors) affect endothelial cell (EC) shape and F-actin
   cytoskeleton arrangement in the presence of physiologically relevant
   wall shear stress (WSS) of 12.5 dyn/cm(2).
   Main methods: Human abdominal aortic endothelial cells (HAAECs) were
   cultured to a confluent monolayer within three dimensional tissue
   culture models and presheared for 6 h at 12.5 dyn/cm(2) within a
   continuous flow loop. Statins were added to the perfusion media and the
   perfusion was continued for a further 24 h. ECs were then analyzed for
   morphology and F-actin cytoskeleton arrangement using light microscopy
   and laser scanning confocal microscopy.
   Key findings: ECs became rounded with a significantly higher shape index
   with the addition of 10 mu M simvastatin under both static and flow
   conditions. F-actin cytoskeleton structure was disorganized and
   fragmented with statin treatment under static and flow conditions.
   Neither of these findings were observed with the addition of both
   simvastatin and 200 mu M mevalonate, confirming regulation through the
   cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.
   Significance: EC morphology and F-actin cytoskeleton arrangement are
   regulated through the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and are therefore
   impacted by statin treatment. ECs treated with statins became rounded,
   which is usually associated with unhealthy cells in regions of the
   vasculature prone to developing atherosclerotic plaques. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A computational study of vortex-induced transverse vibrations of a
   cylinder with low mass-damping is presented. An Arbitrary
   Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged
   Navier-Stokes equations (URANS), along with the Spalart-Allmaras (SA)
   one-equation turbulence model, are coupled conservatively with rigid
   body motion equations of the cylinder mounted on elastic supports in
   order to study the amplitude and frequency response of a freely
   vibrating cylinder, its flow-induced motion, Vortex Street, near-wake
   flow structure, and unsteady loading in a moderate range of Reynolds
   numbers. The time accurate response of the cylinder from rest to its
   limit cycle is studied to explore the effects of Reynolds number on the
   start of large displacements, motion amplitude, and frequency. The
   computational results are compared with published physical experiments
   and numerical studies. The maximum amplitudes of displacements computed
   for various Reynolds numbers are smaller than the experimental values;
   however, the overall agreement of the results is quite satisfactory, and
   the upper branch of the limit-cycle displacement amplitude vs. reduced
   velocity response is captured, a feature that was missed by other
   studies. Vortex shedding modes, lock-in phenomena, frequency response,
   and phase angles are also in agreement with experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of smart grid technologies in terms of advanced
   communication infrastructure, embedded intelligence, diagnostics and
   monitoring capabilities offers new opportunities for improved
   transmission asset management strategies (TAMS). Accordingly, power
   system operators are currently looking for analytics that can make use
   of transmission asset condition monitors and data already available to
   make better-informed decisions. This two-part paper introduces a
   two-stage maintenance scheduler for power transmission assets. Part I
   begins with the motivation for TAMS and then continues with a two-stage
   maintenance management model that incorporates joint midterm and
   short-term maintenance. The first stage involves a midterm asset
   maintenance scheduler that explicitly considers the asset condition
   dynamics in terms of failure rate. The second stage introduces a
   short-term maintenance scheduler with N-1 reliability that schedules the
   output of the midterm maintenance scheduler in the short run. The
   midterm and short-term stages are completely decoupled schemes to make
   the problem computationally tractable. For the sake of exposition here,
   we focus on the maintenance of grid transformers. The proposed
   methodology is general, however, and can be extended to other network
   equipments as well. The characteristics of the proposed model and its
   benefits are investigated in Part II through several case studies.}},

Abstract = {{A two-stage framework for transformer maintenance management is
   introduced and formulated in Part I of this two-part paper in the
   context of transmission asset management strategies (TAMS). The proposed
   model optimizes maintenance outage schedule over a predefined period of

   condition dynamics in terms of failure rate and resource limitations in
   midterm horizons, as well as operating constraints, economic
   considerations and N-1 reliability in the shorter term. In Part II, a
   small six-bus system is first used to demonstrate how the two-stage
   maintenance framework works using a step-by-step procedure. Then,
   IEEE-RTS is used to investigate the performance of the proposed model in
   more detail. In addition, the impacts of varying the characteristics of
   the proposed midterm and short-term maintenance schedulers, such as
   flexibility in time horizon selection, on maintenance scheduling results
   and computational efficiency are investigated on IEEE-RTS. The numerical
   studies indicate that the proposed framework gives appropriate results

Abstract = {{For the first time, IEEE Std. C37.118.1-2011 now provides metrics for
   PMU dynamic performance in terms of classes P and M filter designs. This
   paper attempts to determine whether fulfilling these requirements makes
   the PMU inherently well suited for stability control applications such
   as wide-area power system stabilizers (PSSs). In this aim, we considered
   two different frequency-adaptive approaches for class-P and -M
   compliance to ensure operation over a wide frequency range. The first is
   based on a finite-impulse response (FIR) with no overshoot in either the
   phase or the amplitude step responses, while the second is Kalman
   filter-based (EKF), which allows for a more refined out-of-band
   interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response with
   overshoot. These two approaches are benchmarked against Hydro-Quebec's
   existing PSS requirements and the conclusion is that the total vector
   error-based response time is not indicative of the phase lag within the
   frequency band of interest, nor of the 3-dB bandwidth under sinusoidal
   amplitude/frequency modulation phenomena, which are key criteria when
   specifying PSS PMUs. Using simulated and field-recorded network fault
   responses, we also show that a class-M PMU is unsatisfactory for
   wide-area stabilizing control, unless its performance is improved during
   the fault period, which is not covered by Std. C37.118.1-2011.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1787-1796}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach to the security-constrained unit commitment
   (SCUC) with uncertain wind power generation. The goal is to solve the
   problem considering multiple stochastic wind power scenarios but while
   significantly reducing the computational burden associated with the
   calculation of the reserve deployment for each scenario. The method is
   called reduced SCUC or R-SCUC and is based on the notion of loadability
   set, that is, the set of residual demand scenarios that can be met by
   the transmission and reserve capability of a given power system at any
   specific hour. The key is to project all feasible generation and demand
   vectors onto the demand space and reformulate the SCUC within this
   loadability set rather than on the larger set of generation and demand.
   The accuracy and performance of R-SCUC were gauged and compared to SCUC
   via a three-region multi-unit system and by the IEEE 24-bus reliability
   test system with multiple units. Simulations support the accuracy and
   superior computational performance of R-SCUC.}},

Abstract = {{Thin IrxTi(1-x)-oxide coatings (x= 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) were
   formed on Ti substrates and commercial 316L stainless steel (SS)
   coronary stents employing a simple thermal deposition method.
   Electrochemical and surface-characterization techniques were used to
   investigate the surface topography/morphology and chemical composition
   of the coatings, their electrochemical properties, and radiopacity.
   These properties were found to highly depend on the coating composition;
   however, no particular composition-dependent trend was observed. All the
   coatings were found to be stable under the experimental conditions
   employed in the research. The electrochemical behaviour of the
   Ir-containing coatings was governed mostly by the pseudo-capacitive
   response of the coating and the coating/electrolyte interface. The
   absence of the low-frequency resistive component of the impedance
   response indicated a very high corrosion resistance of the coatings. SS
   coronary stents modified by IrxTi1-x-oxide coatings were found to be
   more radiopaque than the bare (naked) SS stent. The Ir0.4Ti0.6-oxide
   coating showed to be the most uniform, the most corrosion resistant and
   the most radiopaque coating.}},

Abstract = {{In an industrial/mining city, land use, ecosystem service values (ESVs)
   and local economy have a close relation. The study reported in this
   paper is conducive to optimising land use and to balancing ecosystem
   services and local economy. The aim is to provide useful information and
   advice for industrial/mining cities concerned with sustainable
   development. Wu'an, which is rich in mineral resources and an important
   energy supplier in Hebei Province, is selected as the study area. The
   ecosystem service value coefficients of industrial ecosystem and urban
   ecosystem are estimated adopting the cost method and applied to the city
   from 1996 to 2005. The temporal and spatial changes of the ESVs
   estimated within the entire ecosystem, sub-ecosystems and individual
   ecosystem services are analysed and discussed based on land use. The
   results show that land use in Wu'an had a great influence on the ESVs
   and especially the project of converting farmland into forests
   determined the entire ecosystem structure and functions. Additionally,
   the study shows the comparing relationships between ecosystem service
   values and local economy through various mathematical expressions. One
   significant relationship can be abstracted into an inverse curve (zone)
   under restrained conditions. The conclusions suggest that the rapid
   local economy development should build on a reasonable land use with
   emphasis on the high ecosystem services. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Low-density parity-check codes are attractive for high throughput
   applications because of their low decoding complexity per bit, but also
   because all the codeword bits can be decoded in parallel. However,
   achieving this in a circuit implementation is complicated by the number
   of wires required to exchange messages between processing nodes.
   Decoding algorithms that exchange binary messages are interesting for
   fully-parallel implementations because they can reduce the number and
   the length of the wires, and increase logic density. This paper
   introduces the Relaxed Half-Stochastic (RHS) decoding algorithm, a
   binary message belief propagation (BP) algorithm that achieves a coding
   gain comparable to the best known BP algorithms that use real-valued
   messages. We derive the RHS algorithm by starting from the well-known
   Sum-Product algorithm, and then derive a low-complexity version suitable
   for circuit implementation. We present extensive simulation results on
   two standardized codes having different rates and constructions,
   including low bit error rate results. These simulations show that RHS
   can converge faster on average than existing state-of-the-art decoding
   algorithms, leading to improvements in throughput and energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrations and stability of a thin rectangular plate, infinitely long
   and wide, periodically supported in both directions (so that it is
   composed by an infinite number of supported rectangular plates with
   slope continuity at the edges) and immersed in axial liquid flow on its
   upper side is studied theoretically. The flow is bounded by a rigid wall
   and the model is based on potential flow theory. The Galerkin method is
   applied to determine the expression of the flow perturbation potential.
   Then the Rayleigh-Ritz method is used to discretize the system. The
   stability of the coupled system is analyzed by solving the eigenvalue
   problem as a function of the flow velocity; divergence instability is
   detected. The convergence analysis is presented to determine the
   accuracy of the computed eigenfrequencies and stability limits. Finally,
   the effects of the plate aspect ratio and of the channel height ratio on
   the critical velocity giving divergence instability and vibration
   frequencies are investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Frameworks and libraries offer reusable and customizable functionality
   through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Correctly using large
   and sophisticated APIs can represent a challenge due to hidden
   assumptions and requirements. Numerous approaches have been developed to
   infer properties of APIs, intended to guide their use by developers.
   With each approach come new definitions of API properties, new
   techniques for inferring these properties, and new ways to assess their
   correctness and usefulness. This paper provides a comprehensive survey
   of over a decade of research on automated property inference for APIs.
   Our survey provides a synthesis of this complex technical field along
   different dimensions of analysis: properties inferred, mining
   techniques, and empirical results. In particular, we derive a
   classification and organization of over 60 techniques into five
   different categories based on the type of API property inferred:
   unordered usage patterns, sequential usage patterns, behavioral

Abstract = {{This paper incorporates formal concepts of invariance of numerical
   integration schemes into the design of Kalman filters. In general terms,
   invariant discretizations of dynamical systems can form the basis for
   the derivation of the covariance propagation during the prediction and
   update phases of a Kalman filter, and this paper presents a framework to
   that effect. Specifically, natural invariants of angular motion are
   introduced, as part of a symmetry-preserving trapezoidal integration
   rule, to form the basis for the derivation of a discrete-time invariant
   Kalman filter for an attitude estimation problem. The proposed filter is
   realized by expressing all zero-mean random variables in the Lie
   algebra, while the state manipulations are performed in special
   orthogonal group 3. Simulation and experimental results are obtained
   using a neutrally buoyant spherical blimp to validate the proposed
   method against state-of-the-art Kalman filters in a broad range of
   angular speeds and sampling rates. Furthermore, the results support
   claims of invariance of the estimator with respect to angular speed, as
   well as the preservation of the system's symmetries through the
   covariance calculations.}},

Abstract = {{A characterization method based on Rayleigh wave propagation was
   developed for the quantification of the frequency-dependent viscoelastic
   properties of soft materials at high frequencies; i.e., up to 4 kHz.
   Planar harmonic surface waves were produced on the surface of silicone
   rubber samples. The phase and amplitude of the propagating waves were
   measured at different locations along the propagation direction, which
   allowed the calculation of the complex Rayleigh wavenumbers at each
   excitation frequency using a transfer function method. An inverse wave
   propagation problem was then solved to obtain the complex shear/elastic
   moduli from the measured wavenumbers. In a separate, related
   investigation, dynamic indentation tests using atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) were performed at frequencies up to 300 Hz. No systematic
   verification study is available for the AFM-based method, which can be
   used when the dimensions of the test samples are too small for other
   existing testing methods. The results obtained from the Rayleigh wave
   propagation and AFM-based indentation methods were compared with those
   from a well-established method, which involves the generation of
   standing longitudinal compression waves in rod-shaped test specimens.
   The results were cross validated and qualitatively confirmed theoretical
   expectations presented in the literature for the frequency-dependence of
   polymers. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{In time of arrival (TOA) estimation of received ultra-wideband (UWB)
   pulses, traditional maximum likelihood (ML) and generalized likelihood
   estimators become impractical because they require sampling at the
   Nyquist rate. Sub-Nyquist ML-based TOA estimation currently assumes a
   priori knowledge of the UWB channels in the form of the average power
   delay profile (APDP). In this paper, instead of assuming a known APDP,
   we propose and investigate a joint estimator of the TOA and the APDP. We
   assume a multi-cluster parametric APDP model and estimate its parameters
   via a least-squares approach; the estimated APDP is then used in
   connection with a ML criterion to obtain the TOA estimate. The proposed
   method has a low sampling rate requirement and is well-suited for

Title = {{Assessing the Impacts of Four Land Use Types on the Water Quality of

Abstract = {{This study examined how changes in the composition of land use can
   affect wetland water quality. Twenty-four wetlands located in Hiroshima
   prefecture in the western part of Japan were selected for this purpose.
   The water quality parameters that were explored include: pH, electrical
   conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solid,
   temperature and different forms of nitrogen. These important indicators
   of the water quality in the study area were measured from December 2005
   to December 2006. The composition of land uses was determined for the
   catchments of the wetlands. They were then categorized into three
   classes, including non-disturbed, moderately-disturbed and
   highly-disturbed wetlands, based on the extent of urban area (as the
   most disruptive land use type within the catchment of the wetlands). The
   relationship between land use types and water quality parameters for the
   wetlands was statistically examined. The findings indicated that there
   were significant positive relationships between the proportion (\%) of
   urban areas within catchments of the wetlands and EC (r = 0.67, p <
   0.01), TDS (r = 0.69, p < 0.01), TN (r = 0.92, p < 0.01), DON (r = 0.6,
   p < 0.01), NH4 (+)(r = 0.47, p < 0.05), NO2 (-) (r = 0.50, p < 0.05),
   while negative relationships were observed between the proportion (\%)
   of forest area in these wetlands and EC (r = -0.62, p < 0.01), TDS (r =
   -0.68, p < 0.01), TN (r = -0.68, p < 0.01), DON (r = -0.43, p < 0.05),
   and NH4 (+) (r = -0.55, p < 0.01). Analysis of the variance also
   revealed significant differences within the wetland groups in terms of
   the annual mean of electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids,
   total nitrogen, nitrite, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved
   organic nitrogen in the study area. Moreover, the study also indicated
   that the forest area plays a significant role in withholding nutrient
   loads from the wetlands, and hence, it can act as a sink for
   surface/subsurface nutrient inputs flowing into such water bodies from
   the watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of
   global mortality and morbidity. Current CVD treatment methods include
   dietary intervention, statins, fibrates, niacin, cholesterol absorption
   inhibitors, and bile acid sequestrants. These formulations have
   limitations and, thus, additional treatment modalities are needed.
   Probiotic bacteria, especially bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-active
   probiotic bacteria, have demonstrated cholesterol-lowering efficacy in
   randomized controlled trials.
   Areas covered: This review describes the current treatments for CVD and
   the need for additional therapeutics. Gut microbiota etiology of CVD,
   cholesterol metabolism, and the role of probiotic formulations as
   therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of CVD are described.
   Specifically, we review studies using BSH-active bacteria as
   cholesterol-lowering agents with emphasis on their cholesterol-lowering
   mechanisms of action. Potential limitations and future directions are
   also highlighted.
   Expert opinion: Numerous clinical studies have concluded that BSH-active
   probiotic bacteria, or products containing them, are efficient in
   lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, the
   mechanisms of action of BSH-active probiotic bacteria need to be further
   supported. There is also the need for a meta-analysis to provide better
   information regarding the therapeutic use of BSH-active probiotic
   bacteria. The future of BSH-active probiotic bacteria most likely lies
   as a combination therapy with already existing treatment options.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We model a cylindrical inclusion (lipid or membrane protein) translating
   with velocity U in a thin planar membrane (phospholipid bilayer) that is
   supported above and below by Brinkman media (hydrogels). The total force
   F, membrane velocity, and solvent velocity are calculated as functions
   of three independent dimensionless parameters: Lambda = eta a/(eta(m)h),
   l(1)/a and l(2)/a. Here, eta and eta(m) are the solvent and membrane
   shear viscosities, a is the particle radius, h is the membrane
   thickness, and l(1)(2) and l(2)(2) are the upper and lower hydrogel
   permeabilities. As expected, the dimensionless mobility 4 pi eta aU/F =
   4 pi eta aD/(k(B)T) (proportional to the self-diffusion coefficient, D)
   decreases with decreasing gel permeabilities (increasing gel
   concentrations), furnishing a quantitative interpretation of how porous,

   means of inferring hydrogel permeability and, perhaps, surface

Abstract = {{We propose a method for computing a depth map at interactive rates from
   a set of closely spaced calibrated video cameras and a Time-of-Flight
   (ToF) camera. The objective is to synthesize free viewpoint videos in
   real-time. All computations are performed on the graphics processing
   unit, leaving the CPU available for other tasks. Depth information is
   computed from color camera data in textured regions and from ToF data in
   textureless ones. The trade-off between these two sources is determined
   locally based on the reliability of the depth estimates obtained from
   the color images. For this purpose, a confidence measure taking into
   account the shape of the photo-consistency score as a function of depth
   is used. The final depth map is computed by minimizing a cost function.
   This approach offers a significant time savings relative to other
   methods that apply denoising to the photo-consistency score maps,
   obtained at every depth, and importantly, still obtains acceptable
   quality of the rendered image.}},

   emissions make-up the largest portion of lifecycle emissions. When
   comparing instantaneous and average speed emissions we find that both
   methods produce consistent results for diesel, however, the average
   speed method underestimates biodiesel emissions by 21\% and
   overestimates compressed natural gas emissions by 16\%. Bus technologies

Abstract = {{Cartilage defects can be addressed with replacement strategies such as
   autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Expansion of autologous
   chondrocytes in vitro is an essential step to obtain the necessary cell
   numbers required for ACI. A major problem with this approach is
   dedifferentiation of chondrocytes during expansion, resulting in cells
   with fibroblast-like features. These cells generate cartilage tissue
   with fibrotic instead of hyaline characteristics. The use of serum is a
   common feature in most expansion protocols and a potential factor
   contributing to the dedifferentiation process. The aim of this study was
   to assess if heat inactivation of serum used in the expansion medium
   might be a valid approach to generate cells with an improved phenotype
   and in relevant numbers. We used bovine chondrocyte expansion cultures
   incubated with heat inactivated allogeneic serum (HIFBS) as a model
   system. We here show that heat inactivation protects the differentiated
   phenotype of chondrocytes compared to cultures with regular serum. This
   is not only true for primary cultures but holds up after two passages.
   Moreover, using relatively low cell seeding densities, clinically
   relevant cell numbers can already be reached after the first passage in
   cultures with HIFBS. In short we here introduce a simple way to improve
   cell quality while generating relevant amounts of cells during monolayer
   expansion of bovine chondrocytes in a relative short time period. Our
   results could have wider implications when translated to the expansion
   of human chondrocytes.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of bacterial variants in the presence of lytic phages has been
   one of the basic grounds for evolution studies. However, there are
   incongruent results among different studies investigating the effect of
   phage resistance acquisition on bacterial fitness and virulence. We used
   experimental evolution to generate three classes of Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa variants under selective pressure from two different
   homogeneous phage environments and one heterogeneous phage environment.
   The fitness and virulence determinants of the variants, such as growth,
   motility, biofilm formation, resistance to oxidative stress, and the
   production of siderophores and chromophores, changed significantly
   compared to the control. Variants with similar colony morphology that
   were developed through different phage treatments have different
   phenotypic traits. Also, mRNA transcription for genes associated with
   certain phenotypic traits changed significantly; however, sequencing did
   not reveal any point mutations in selected gene loci. Furthermore, the
   appearance of small colony variants and melanogenic variants and the
   increase in pyocyanin and pyoverdin production for some variants are
   believed to affect the virulence of the population. The knowledge gained
   from this study will fundamentally contribute to our understanding of
   the evolutionary dynamics of bacteria under phage selective pressure
   which is crucial to the efficient utilization of bacteriophages in
   medical contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The goal of this work is to investigate t-m phase
   transformation, and subsurface damage in 3Y-TZP after sandblasting.
   Methods. Commercial grade 3Y-TZP powder was conventionally sintered and
   fully dense specimens were obtained. Specimens were sandblasted using
   different particle sizes (110 and 250 mu m) and pressures (2 and 4 bar)
   for 10s. Phase transformation was measured on the surface and in the
   cross-section using X-ray diffraction and micro Raman spectroscopy,
   respectively. Subsurface damage was investigated on cross-sections using
   SEM and in shallow cross-sections machined by focused ion beam.
   Results. Sandblasting induced monoclinic volume fraction is in the range
   of 12-15\% on the surface. In the cross-section, a non-homogeneous phase
   transformation gradient is found up to the depth of 12 +/- 1 mu m. The
   subsurface damage observed was plastic deformation in grains with the
   presence of martensite plates, and this effect is found to be larger in
   specimens sandblasted with large particles.
   Significance. The extent of subsurface tetragonal-monoclinic
   transformation and damage induced by sandblasting are reported for
   different sandblasting conditions. This knowledge is critical in order
   to understand the effect of sandblasting on mechanical properties of
   zirconia used to fabricate dental crowns and frameworks. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper describes and analyzes a hierarchical algorithm called
   Multiscale Gossip for solving the distributed average consensus problem
   in wireless sensor networks. The algorithm proceeds by recursively
   partitioning a given network. Initially, nodes at the finest scale
   gossip to compute local averages. Then, using multi-hop communication
   and geographic routing to communicate between nodes that are not
   directly connected, these local averages are progressively fused up the
   hierarchy until the global average is computed. We show that the
   proposed hierarchical scheme with k = Theta(log log n) levels of
   hierarchy is competitive with state-of-the-art randomized gossip
   algorithms in terms of message complexity, achieving epsilon-accuracy
   with high probability after O(n log log n log 1/epsilon) single-hop
   messages. Key to our analysis is the way in which the network is
   recursively partitioned. We find that the above scaling law is achieved
   when subnetworks at scale j contain O(n((2/3)j)) nodes; then the message
   complexity at any individual scale is O(n log 1/epsilon) Another
   important consequence of the hierarchical construction is that the
   longest distance over which messages are exchanged is O(n(1/3)) hops (at
   the highest scale), and most messages (at lower scales) travel shorter
   distances. In networks that use link-level acknowledgements, this
   results in less congestion and resource usage by reducing message
   retransmissions. Simulations illustrate that the proposed scheme is more
   efficient than state-of-the-art randomized gossip algorithms based on
   averaging along paths.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{54-74}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear global forced dynamics of an axially moving viscoelastic
   beam, while both longitudinal and transverse displacements are taken
   into account, is examined employing a numerical technique. The equations
   of motion are derived using Newton's second law of motion, resulting in
   two partial differential equations for the longitudinal and transverse
   motions. A two-parameter rheological Kelvin-Voigt energy dissipation
   mechanism is employed for the viscoelastic structural model, in which
   the material, not partial, time derivative is used in the viscoelastic
   constitutive relations; this gives additional terms due to the
   simultaneous presence of the material damping and the axial speed. The
   equations of motion for both longitudinal and transverse motions are
   then discretized via Galerkin's method, in which the eigenfunctions for
   the transverse motion of a hinged-hinged linear stationary beam are
   chosen as the basis functions. The subsequent set of nonlinear ordinary
   equations is solved numerically by means of the direct time integration
   via modified Rosenbrock method, resulting in the bifurcation diagrams of
   Poincare maps. The results are also presented in the form of time
   histories, phase-plane portraits, and fast Fourier transform (FFTs) for
   specific sets of parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental investigation of steel-sheathed

   investigate the influence of a second story, and to validate and improve
   the accuracy of the numerically predicted force-deformation response.
   The scope of study comprised five single-story and five double-story
   walls of the platform framing technique. Each wall was subjected to a
   suite of excitations: impact test to measure the linear-viscous damping
   ratio, harmonic excitation to estimate the natural period of vibration,
   and ground motions representative of the seismic hazard in Canada. An

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to assess the impact of media aging on
   Cryptosporidium parvum transport and retention in granular filters.
   Column experiments were conducted with sand, anthracite, and granular
   activated carbon (GAC) filters. All columns possessed an identical
   filter design and grain size distribution. Oocyst removal was evaluated
   with both new and aged media. The variation in performance among new
   media was attributed to the shape of the tested granular media and to
   the concentration of extractable metals on the surface of collector
   grains. Media aging significantly increased the treatment performance of
   sand (26\%) and GAC (31\%) but had no influence on the performance of
   anthracite. This enhanced performance of aged media correlated well with
   the extent of biofilm development. The best removal performance was
   observed with aged GAC ( 71 +/- 2\%), which supported the highest amount
   of biomass according to polysaccharide and protein measurements. The
   results of this investigation are of particular interest because they
   suggest that media aging increases the removal of protozoan parasites in
   full-scale granular filters. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000672.

   fourth-order or higher in space. Finally, 3DFLUX is used to simulate
   advection-diffusion of a complex temperature field in an incompressible

Abstract = {{We present a simple method based on the soliton perturbative theory to
   design microwires of non-uniform diameter profiles. In contrast to
   previous methods, the one presented here relies on minimizing the
   soliton perturbation by third order dispersion (TOD) while taking into
   account the change of the soliton local duration along the microwire.
   The method leads to a design that maximizes the soliton self-frequency
   shift in non-uniform microwires. The microwire design comprises a unique
   dispersion profile such that a wavelength-shifting soliton experiences
   only weak perturbations from the TOD and avoids shedding its energy into
   the dispersive waves. The TOD perturbation is quantified with an
   analytic expression that is kept below a threshold value, thus keeping a
   soliton weakly perturbed by TOD in every position within the microwire.
   Numerical simulations are conducted to check the validity of the method.
   We consider a fundamental soliton centered at a wavelength of 2000 nm
   propagating in As Se microwires of length as short as 10 cm. The results
   show that optimized non-uniform diameter profile allows the tuning of
   the self-frequency shifted soliton over a spectral range of 860 nm.}},

Title = {{Prediction of pork marbling scores using pattern analysis techniques}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Marbling is an important technical quality attribute of pork. Its
   assessment usually corresponds to a subjective score being given by
   trained panelists based on the marbling standards charts. The purpose of
   this study was to investigate objective determination of pork marbling
   using pattern analysis techniques. A line pattern recognition technique
   called the wide line detector (WLD) and a texture extraction technique
   based on an improved grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were
   employed and compared. Fifty three fresh pork loin chops from the
   longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle were collected and their marbling scores
   were assessed in a plant. Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of these chops
   were acquired using a digital camera. The loin eye area was selected as
   the region of interest (ROI) of the pork images. Marbling was extracted
   from the ROI by either GLCM or WLD. Proportion of marbling (PM) obtained
   from WLD or image texture measurement from GLCM (GI) was formulated as
   indices of the marbling score. Linear regressions based on the PM and GI
   were carried out at the red, green, and blue channels as well as the
   combined RGB channels. The results of WLD and GLCM based models showed
   the effectiveness of pattern analysis techniques for pork marbling
   assessment. The comparison indicated that the WLD based models had
   stronger predictive ability for pork marbling score determination than
   GLCM. The green channel was demonstrated to have the best explanatory
   for pork marbling assessment no matter which pattern analysis technique
   used. High correlation coefficients of calibration and validation (Rc =
   0.94, Rv = 0.94) of the WLD based linear model at the green channel
   strongly indicated the great potential of pattern analysis techniques
   especially the line pattern recognition methods for the accurate and
   real-time evaluation of pork marbling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Accelerated curing of fresh concrete using CO2 is a possible approach
   for value-added, high-volume usage products from waste CO2 emitted from
   stationary sources. The extent of CO2 uptake and the spatial
   distribution of the CaCO3(s) precipitates formed during accelerated
   carbonation curing of compacted, 4-h hydrated cement mortar (fresh
   concrete mixture with fine aggregates) samples were investigated in this
   study. The maximum carbonation efficiency achieved was 20\% of the
   theoretical uptake. Microprobe imaging was used to analyze the
   composition of the compacted cement mortar microstructure and showed
   extensive filling of pores of diameters 4 mu m and smaller, with
   CaCO3(s). The carbonation efficiency, however, reached 67\% when an
   aqueous suspension of cement was carbonated in a completely mixed
   reactor, where interparticle pores do not exist and a higher surface
   area of cement particles is exposed to dissolved CO2. The theoretical
   efficiency was not achieved because all reactive cement surfaces were
   saturated with carbonation products, as indicated by equilibrium
   concentrations of dissolved calcium, silica, inorganic carbon, and pH.
   This study shows that both deposition of CaCO3(s), on reactive surfaces,
   and pore filling may regulate the extent of CO2 uptake during
   accelerated carbonation curing of concrete.}},

Title = {{Identification and structural elucidation of ozonation transformation
   products of estrone}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY CENTRAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative methods for the analysis of contaminants of
   emerging concern (CECs) are abundant in the scientific literature.
   However, there are few reports on systematic methods of identification
   and structural identification of transformation products. For this
   reason, a new method based on high-resolution mass spectrometry and
   differential analysis was developed in order to facilitate and
   accelerate the process of identification and structural elucidation of
   transformation products CECs. This method was applied to the study of
   ozonation transformation products (OTPs) of the natural hormone estrone
   (E1).
   Results: A control compare trend experiment consisting in the comparison
   of a control sample to several samples having been exposed to decreasing
   concentrations of O-3(aq) indicated that 593 peaks could be associated
   with OTPs. After applying various filters to remove background noise,
   sample contaminants and signal spikes, this data set was reduced to 16
   candidate peaks. By inspection of the shape of these peaks, only two
   compounds OTP-276 (m/z 275.12930) and OTP-318 (m/z 317.14008) were
   considered as good candidates for further study. Multi-stage tandem mass
   spectrometry (MSn) experiments of SPE extracts of the ozonated samples
   of E1 and of a deuterium-labeled analogue (E1-d(4)) showed that OTP-276
   and OTP-318 had carboxylic acid and hydroxyl functional groups, as
   previously reported for OTPs of other hormones. Structures for these two
   compounds were proposed based on their MSn spectra.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that the method proposed is a
   systematic and rapid approach to study transformation products of CECs.}},

   to further reductions in the overall computational effort. The adaptive

Abstract = {{We propose intra-symbol carrier phase recovery (IS-CPR) for

   intra-symbol phase shift (ISPS) between subcarriers that is caused by
   the dispersion-enhanced phase noise (DEPN). We begin by proposing a
   pre-emphasized pilot subcarrier (PEPS) approach to reduce the pilot
   subcarrier overhead for the following IS-CPR algorithms. Then, we show a
   statistical analysis of the DEPN-induced ISPS between subcarriers within
   one symbol, which is related to the accumulated chromatic dispersion
   (CD). Next, three algorithms are proposed for IS-CPR including
   maximum-likelihood (ML) phase estimation, digital phase-locked loop

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a low-complexity and efficient carrier
   recovery algorithm for single carrier transmission systems that is
   capable of tracking frequency offset (FO) variations. Working as a FO
   tracking estimator, the algorithm demonstrates good accuracy in
   simulation and a FO drift of up to 200 MHz/mu s can be compensated with
   minimal degradation in a QPSK system. In 112 Gb/s dual polarization (DP)
   QPSK experiments, the algorithm recovers a data sequence having > 80 MHz
   of FO drift within 250 mu s, providing better performance than a
   one-time estimator. In a regime that utilizes parallel processing of the
   data, we further demonstrate FO tracking and carrier phase recovery
   (CPR) using only one of the streams in a parallelized configuration, and
   we apply the carrier information to recover neighbouring streams
   directly. Consequently, the complexity of both the FO tracking and the
   CPR is further reduced. (C)2013 Optical Society of America}},

   extrusion at 300 degrees C, but develops strong basal texture at 350 and
   400 degrees C. The weaker texture of M1 at 300 degrees C is partially
   due to random orientations created by CDRX mechanism. M1-1.6Sr alloy
   develops weaker textures at all extrusion temperatures as a result of
   particle stimulated nucleation promoted by Mg-Sr intermetallics which

Abstract = {{Control of systems that have had their passive input-output map
   partially violated is the motivation of this study. The hybrid
   passivity/finite-gain systems framework is specifically well suited to
   systems that have experienced a passivity violation. The focus of this
   study is the extension and application of the hybrid
   passivity/finite-gain systems framework to a multi-input multi-output
   (MIMO) control problem. Calculation of the hybrid passivity/finite-gain
   parameters in a linear time-invariant (LTI) MIMO context is considered.
   Additionally, we show that a set of hybrid very strictly
   passive/finite-gain (VSP/finite-gain) controllers gain-scheduled in a
   particular way also possesses hybrid VSP/finite-gain properties. To
   synthesise hybrid VSP/finite-gain controllers a frequency-weighted
   optimal control scheme is used to parameterise controllers that are then
   constrained and optimised within a numerical optimisation framework. The
   theoretical contributions of this work are validated experimentally
   using a two-link flexible manipulator apparatus. Results highlight the
   utility of the hybrid passivity/finite-gain framework, the scheduling

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with accurate numerical modelling of the
   propagation or progression of ice-shedding phenomena and resulting
   forces in overhead lines following an initial trigger, such as a
   controlled shock load applied locally with a cable de-icing device, or
   uncontrolled shocks due to cable rupture. The ice failure criterion used
   for the ice deposits in the simulations is based on a maximum effective
   plastic strain limit. This criterion has been verified in models of
   reduced-and real-scale single spans subjected to shock loads. After
   showing the improved performance of this ice failure model, it is
   applied to the case study of a 120 kV two-circuit line section that
   failed during a localized ice storm event in 1997. A nonlinear dynamic
   analysis of the line section is performed which considers ice-shedding
   effects following the conductor ruptures. The results confirm that
   considering ice-shedding effects in the iced spans subjected to cable
   rupture is essential to predict the general dynamic response of the line
   as the cable ruptures may induce ice shedding. The improved performance
   of the modelling procedure described in this paper can have practical
   use in the design of transmission lines in industry.}},

Abstract = {{Recent observations regarding the dynamic transformation of deformed
   austenite at temperatures above the Ae(3) are reviewed. Experimental
   results obtained on four different steels over the temperature range
   from 743 to 917 C and at strains up to epsilon = 5 are described. It is
   shown that there is a critical strain for the formation of
   superequilibrium ferrite and that the volume fraction of transformed
   ferrite increases with the strain. The structures observed are
   Widmanstatten in form and appear to have nucleated displacively. The
   effect of deformation on the Gibbs energy of austenite is estimated by
   assuming that the austenite continues to work-harden after initiation of
   the transformation and that its flow stress and dislocation density can
   be derived from the experimental flow curve by making suitable
   assumptions about two-phase flow. By further taking into account the
   inhomogeneity of the dislocation density, Gibbs energy contributions
   (driving forces) are derived that are sufficient to promote
   transformation as much as 100 degrees C above the Ae(3). The C diffusion
   times required for the dynamic formation of the cementite particles
   observed are estimated. These range from similar to 25 to 100 mu s and
   are therefore consistent with the times available during rolling. The
   Gibbs energy calculations suggest that growth of the Widmanstatten
   ferrite is followed by C diffusion at the lower carbon contents, while
   it is accompanied by C diffusion at the higher carbon levels. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Most optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) research literature

   binary chip-asynchronous OCDMA with time spreading, and the main result
   is that appropriate nonuniform signaling can achieve a data throughput
   of 2.5 bits per OCDMA chip. This result shows that the presence of chip
   asynchronism leads to approximately a threefold capacity gain over
   chip-synchronous OCDMA capacity. Additional results are presented to
   illustrate that the near capacity multiuser interference has a low
   variance and a non-Gaussian distribution. Finally, the robustness of the
   achieved capacity gains is verified in the presence of additive channel
   noise.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Exogenous Inputs and Defiant Agents on Opinion Dynamics

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Most of the conventional models for opinion dynamics mainly account for
   a fully local influence, where myopic agents decide their actions after
   they interact with other agents that are adjacent to them. For example,
   in the case of social interactions, this includes family, friends, and
   other immediate strong social ties. The model proposed in this paper
   embodies a global influence as well where by global we mean that each
   node also observes a sample of the average behavior of the entire
   population; e. g., in the social example, people observe other people on
   the streets, subway, and other social venues. We consider the case where
   nodes have dichotomous states; examples of applications include
   elections with two major parties, whether or not to adopt a new
   technology or product, and any yes/no opinion such as in voting on a
   referendum. The dynamics of states on a network with arbitrary degree
   distribution are studied. For a given initial condition, we find the
   probability to reach consensus on each state and the expected time reach
   to consensus. To model mass media, the effect of an exogenous bias on
   the average orientation of the system is investigated. To do so, we add
   an external field to the model that favors one of the states over the
   other. This field interferes with the regular decision process of each
   node and creates a constant probability to lean towards one of the
   states. We solve for the average state of the system as a function of
   time for given initial conditions. Then anti-conformists (stubborn nodes
   who never revise their states) are added to the network, in an effort to
   circumvent the external bias. We find necessary conditions on the number
   of these defiant nodes required to cancel the effect of the external
   bias. Our analysis is based on a mean field approximation of the agent
   opinions.}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal chemical kinetic mechanisms are presented for combustion
   analysis of a series of fuels of interest in combustion systems. These
   models are obtained from their respective detailed chemical kinetic
   models using the global species sensitivity method in a formulation
   referred to here as alternate species elimination (ASE), reflecting the
   alternate elimination of chemical species from a mechanism in order to
   assess the resulting effect on the prediction ability of the model.
   Ignition delay times are used as the target global combustion property
   for the assessment of the chemical influence of a species. Three
   ignition conditions of lean, stoichiometric, and rich fuel/air mixtures
   at a temperature and pressure of 1050 K and 15 atm, respectively, are
   used to generate data for the model reduction process. The skeletal
   mechanisms obtained from this ignition-based reduction are tested for
   their ability to predict premixed flame propagation and diffusion flame
   structure. It is found that, by imposing an appropriate threshold on the
   ranked normalized changes in ignition delay times, these skeletal models
   capture a broad range of combustion processes beyond the homogeneous
   ignition process used to deduce them. The skeletal mechanisms presented
   in this work include syngas (31 species), methyl butanoate (MB) (88
   species), n-heptane (122 species), and n-decane (89 species). These
   skeletal models reflect a reduction of at least 60\% in the number of
   chemical species with respect to the detailed model. They are
   recommended for use in further computational combustion analysis since
   they result in a reduction in computational costs, and are provided as
   Supporting Information to this article.}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{In-storage psychrophilic anaerobic digestion (ISPAD) is a technology
   allowing livestock producers to operate an anaerobic digester with
   minimum technological know-how and for the cost of a conventional
   storage cover. Nevertheless, the system is exposed to ambient
   temperatures and biogas production is expected to vary with climatic
   conditions. The objective of the project was therefore to measure ISPAD
   biogas production during the winter and fall seasons for a region east
   of Montreal, Canada. A calibrated biogas monitoring system was used to
   monitor biogas methane and carbon dioxide concentrations inside a
   two-year-old field installation with a 1000m(3) storage capacity.
   Despite a leaking pumping hatch, winter 2010 (January to March) methane
   concentrations varied directly with solar radiation and maximum exterior
   temperature, rather than with manure temperature at 2.4 and 1.2m depths
   which remained relatively constant between 1 and 5 degrees C. During a
   six-month-period from November 2009 to April 2010, inclusively, the
   field ISPAD degraded 34\% of the manure volatile solids corresponding to
   an average methane production of 40m(3)/d. The ISPAD biogas production
   could be further increased by improving its air tightness and intrusion
   and by regularly pumping out the biogas.}},

Abstract = {{Articular cartilage is an avascular tissue with poor regenerative
   capacity following injury, a contributing factor to joint degenerative
   disease. Cell-based therapies for cartilage tissue regeneration have
   rapidly advanced; however, expansion of autologous chondrocytes in vitro
   using standard methods causes dedifferentiation' into fibroblastic
   cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is crucial for
   chondrocyte metabolism and matrix production, and changes in MAPK
   signals can affect the phenotype of cultured cells. We investigated the
   effects of inhibition of MAPK signalling on chondrocyte
   dedifferentiation during monolayer culture. Blockade of extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
   signalling caused a significant increase in cartilage gene expression,
   however, also caused up-regulation of fibrotic gene expression.
   Inhibition of p38 MAPK (p38) caused a significant up-regulation of
   collagen type II while suppressing collagen type I expression. P38
   inhibition also resulted in consistently more organized secretion of
   collagen type II protein deposits on cell culture surfaces. Follow-on
   pellet culture of treated cells revealed that MAPK inhibition reduced
   cell migration from the pellet. ERK and JNK inhibition caused more
   collagen type I accumulation in pellets versus controls while p38
   inhibition strongly promoted collagen type II accumulation with no
   effect on collagen type I. Blockade of all three MAPKs caused increased
   GAG content in pellets. These results indicate a role for MAPK
   signalling in chondrocyte phenotype loss during monolayer culture, with
   a strong contribution from p38 signalling. Thus, blockade of p38
   enhances chondrocyte phenotype in monolayer culture and may promote more
   efficient cartilage tissue regeneration for cell-based therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are critical to the development
   and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic
   diseases. In this study, the effects of probiotics Lactobacillus and
   Bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory
   cytokine concentrations were evaluated using a human colonic microbiota
   model. Lactobacillus reuteri, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum,
   Bifidobacterium animalis, B. bifidum, B. longum, and B. longum subsp.
   infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory
   potential. Each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human
   colonic microbiota model during 14 days. Colonic lipopolysaccharides,
   and Gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. RAW 264.7
   macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic
   microbiota model. Concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-beta, and IL-4
   cytokines were measured. Lipopolysaccharide concentrations were
   significantly reduced with the administration of B. bifidum (-46.45 +/-
   5.65\%), L. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08\%), B. longum (-42.50 +/-
   1.28\%), and B. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32\%) (p < 0.05).
   Cell counts of Gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly
   affected by the probiotic administered. There was a probiotic
   strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of RAW 264.7
   macrophage cells. B. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher
   capacities to reduce TNF-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78\%; p <
   0.05) and to increase IL-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59\%; p < 0.05).
   Colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with TNF-alpha
   and IL-1 beta concentrations (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that
   specific probiotic bacteria, such as B. longum subsp. infantis, might
   decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce
   the proinflammatory tone. This study has noteworthy applications in the
   field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of
   inflammatory and metabolic diseases.}},

Title = {{A finite-discrete element framework for the 3D modeling of geogrid-soil

Abstract = {{The behavior of a geogrid-soil system under pullout mode is known to
   depend on the properties of the geogrid material, the backfill soil and
   the interface condition. Modeling the geogrid soil interaction taking
   into account the true geogrid geometry is a challenging numerical
   problem that requires the consideration of the discontinuous nature of
   the soil and the different modes of resistance that contribute to the
   pullout capacity of the geogrid layer. In this study, a coupled finite
   discrete framework has been developed to investigate the behavior of a
   biaxial geogrid sheet embedded in granular material and subjected to
   pullout loading. Validation is performed by comparing experimental data
   and numerically calculated results using the proposed model. The
   detailed behavior of the geogrid and the surrounding soil is then
   investigated. The numerical results indicated the suitability of the
   coupled model to solve this class of problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   for subsurface flow solute transport simulations}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{22-37}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Subsurface flow and solute transport simulations are performed using
   different scenarios of permeability fields generated from the sequential
   Gaussian simulation method (SGS), the multiple-point FILTERSIM algorithm
   and a new multiple-point wavelet-based simulation method (SWS). The SWS
   method is a multiple-point pattern-based simulation method which uses
   discrete wavelet transformation for the representation of geologic
   heterogeneity. For pattern-based simulation, patterns are generated by
   scanning a training image with a spatial template. The pattern
   classifications were performed after reducing the dimension of patterns
   by wavelet decomposition at the suitable scale and by taking only
   scaling components of wavelet decomposed patterns. The simulation is
   performed in a sequential manner by finding the best-matched class
   corresponding to the conditioning data and by randomly sampling a
   pattern from the best-matched class. The developed method is compared
   with two other multi-point simulation algorithms, FLTERSIM and SIMPAT.
   The comparative results revealed that the proposed method is
   computationally faster than the other two methods while the simulation
   maps are comparable. Numerical simulations of two flow problems are
   performed using SGS, SWS and FILTERSIM realizations. The numerical
   results show a superiority of the SWS method over SGS and FILTERSIM in
   terms of reproduction of the reference images main features, and
   agreement with flow and transport results obtained on reference images.

Abstract = {{Phthalate diesters such as di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are
   considered ubiquitous contaminants and are poorly biodegraded in the
   environment. Moreover, both the parent compound and stable metabolites
   such as mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) are linked to several
   negative impacts on the environment and human health. Earlier work
   established that saturated diester compounds, such as succinates, showed
   better biodegradation characteristics and comparable plasticizer
   properties compared to DEHP. In this work we examine the effect of alkyl
   chain length of succinate molecules on plasticizer and biodegradation
   properties. This included both the side chains (n-ethyl to n-octyl) as
   well as substituents on the middle part of the succinate molecule. We
   showed that the common soil bacterium Rhodococcus rhodocrous could
   rapidly break down all unsubstituted succinates, without the appearance
   of stable metabolites. Furthermore, the organisms used the plasticizer
   metabolites as carbon source. The introduction of a large cyclohexyl
   substituent on the succinate resulted in a poorer degradation rate.
   Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) measurements were performed to
   evaluate plasticizer properties and showed that longer side chains
   reduced the Tg more efficiently, while large cyclohexyl substituents on
   the succinate decreased this effect. However, all compounds performed
   better or equal to DEHP at reducing the Tg. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Tumbling mills play an essential role in modern mineral processing.
   Because of the nature of the mill, the internal forces make
   instrumentation of the mill interior difficult. One solution to this
   problem is the use of an instrumented ball. An instrumented ball,
   equipped with an accelerometer, rotation rate sensors and a temperature
   sensor has been built. The instrumented ball and a camera system are
   used to measure the state of the charge within a laboratory mill. In
   parallel, a discrete element model (DEM) of the laboratory mill is
   developed. Using the distributions and moments of the energy terms of
   the charge, the simulation and experimental results are analyzed and
   compared. The moments are used to tune the DEM, such that the simulation
   results are in agreement with the experimental results. The comparison
   also identifies which aspects require further improvement. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{For noncooperative games the mean field (MF) methodology provides
   decentralized strategies which yield Nash equilibria for large
   population systems in the asymptotic limit of an infinite (mass)
   population. The MF control laws use only the local information of each
   agent on its own state and own dynamical parameters, while the mass
   effect is calculated offline using the distribution function of i) the
   population's dynamical parameters, and ii) the population's cost
   function parameters, for the infinite population case. These laws yield
   approximate equilibria when applied in the finite population.
   In this paper, these a priori information conditions are relaxed, and
   incrementally the cases are considered where, first, the agents estimate
   their own dynamical parameters, and, second, estimate the distribution
   parameter in i) and ii) above.
   An MF stochastic adaptive control (SAC) law in which each agent observes
   a random subset of the population of agents is specified, where the
   ratio of the cardinality of the observed set to that of the number of
   agents decays to zero as the population size tends to infinity. Each
   agent estimates its own dynamical parameters via the recursive weighted
   least squares (RWLS) algorithm and the distribution of the population's
   dynamical parameters via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Under
   reasonable conditions on the population dynamical parameter
   distribution, the MF-SAC Law applied by each agent results in i) the
   strong consistency of the self parameter estimates and the strong
   consistency of the population distribution function parameters; ii) the
   long run average L-2 stability of all agent systems; iii) a (strong)
   epsilon-Nash equilibrium for the population of agents for all epsilon >
   0; and iv) the a.s. equality of the long run average cost and the
   non-adaptive cost in the population limit.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the mechanical and electrical properties
   of an anisotropic conductive film (ACF) on the basis of high-density
   vertical fibers for a wafer-level packaging (WLP) application. As part
   of the WaferBoard, a reconfigurable circuit platform for rapid system
   prototyping, ACF is used as an intermediate film providing compliant and
   vertical electrical connection between chip contacts and a top surface
   of an active wafer-size large-area IC. The chosen ACF is first tested by
   an indentation technique. The results show that the elastic-plastic
   deformation mode as well as the Young's modulus and the hardness depend
   on the indentation depth. Second, the efficiency of the electrical
   contact is tested using a uniaxial compression on a stack comprising a
   dummy ball grid array (BGA) board, an ACF, and a thin Al film. For three
   bump diameters, as the compression increases, the resistance values
   decrease before reaching low and stable values. Despite the BGA solder
   bumps exhibit plastic deformation after compression, no damage is found
   on the ACF film. These results show that vertical fiber ACFs can be used
   for nonpermanent bonding in a WLP application.}},

Abstract = {{Steady and unsteady three-dimensional viscous turbulent aero-icing
   simulations are computationally expensive, especially for certification
   campaigns when broad parametric studies are needed. To overcome the

   interpolation, is proposed. Using a database of high-fidelity numerical
   simulations, experimental data, or combinations of both, the proposed
   technique allows approximating solutions by linear combination of a
   limited number of eigenfunctions. Bayesian Kriging, a recent variant, is
   used to obtain the scalar coefficients for the expansion. The accuracy
   of the proposed method is assessed against reference solutions from two-

Abstract = {{This study aims at modifying the synthesis method of preparing
   N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM)/N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (VP)/Polyethylene
   glycol monoacrylate (PEG-A) polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating
   curcumin as a model drug. The optimal concentration of nanoparticle
   reagents was determined using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.
   Curcumin nanoparticles mean hydrodynamic size was found to be 104nm with
   zeta potential of 3 +/- 13mV. The release kinetic study of curcumin
   nanoparticles indicates that a maximum release of curcumin at 24h
   positively correlates with increase in temperature; however, change in
   pH did not produce any substantial drug release. In vitro cell viability
   assay performed on cancer cells exposed to various concentrations of
   model compound displayed the IC50 ranging between 100 and 200g/mL for
   human prostate cancer cells (PC3 cells) and 50 and 200g/mL for
   epidermoid carcinoma (A431 cell line). The Hoechst staining and phase
   contrast micrographs for 48h exposure of curcumin nanoparticles at a
   concentration of 400g/mL resulted in almost 92\% of cells death in both
   cell lines. This study concludes that the physiochemical characteristics
   of NIPAAM/VP/PEG-A polymer with key features of water solubility,
   sustained drug release, small particle size make these nanoparticles a
   prominent drug delivery device.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The complement system is composed of bactericidal and
   hemolytic proteins that increase capillary leakage and inflammatory cell
   migration. The role of complement C3 to augment wound healing has not
   yet been studied. Methods: We examined the effects of topical complement
   C3 formulation at two concentrations (10 and 100 nM) on the rat surgical
   skin incision model. Skin was examined for maximal breaking strength and
   sectioned for histological examination. Fibronectin and collagen I
   content were measured using western blot analysis. Results: There was a
   statistically significant 74\% increase in maximum wound strength with
   the topical application of 100 nM of C3 at day 3 (850 +/- 138 g) when
   compared to the control rats (490 +/- 57 g). Histological correlation
   was seen with an increased inflammatory cell and fibroblast infiltration
   in treated wounds as compared to control rats as early as 3 days
   post-wounding. Western blots revealed increased fibronectin and collagen
   I levels in C3 treated wounds. Conclusions: Topical application of
   complement C3 in collagen formulation to skin wounds significantly
   increases wound healing as early as 3 days after wounding. This is
   correlated with increased inflammatory cell recruitment and the
   subsequent early fibroblast migration and increased collagen deposition
   and organization in wounds.}},

Abstract = {{Selective hydrogenation is an important process in petrochemistry to
   purify feedstock for polymer synthesis. For this process, catalysts
   containing metallic palladium deposited with an eggshell distribution on
   porous alumina are usually employed. For this kind of catalyst, the
   activity is known to be in close relation with the thickness of the
   palladium crust. As palladium oxide is brown and alumina is white, the
   palladium distribution in a catalyst bead before the reduction step can
   be characterized by optical microscopy. We propose an original and
   automatic procedure of optical image analysis to obtain a fast and
   robust method to measure the mean crust thickness of a catalyst batch
   and the corresponding standard deviation. The approach is validated by
   two different methods. First, we compared the crust thickness with those
   obtained by electron probe microanalysis. Then, catalytic tests of four
   samples with varying palladium crust thicknesses were performed and
   confirmed the expected correlation between activity and crust thickness
   measured by optical microscopy coupled with image analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional nonlinear planar dynamics of an axially moving
   Timoshenko beam is investigated in this paper by means of two numerical
   techniques. The equations of motion for the longitudinal, transverse,
   and rotational motions are derived using constitutive relations and via
   Hamilton's principle. The Galerkin method is employed to discretize the
   three partial differential equations of motion, yielding a set of
   nonlinear ordinary differential equations with coupled terms. This set
   is solved using the pseudo-arclength continuation technique so as to
   plot frequency-response curves of the system for different cases.
   Bifurcation diagrams of Poincar, maps for the system near the first
   instability are obtained via direct time integration of the discretized
   equations. Time histories, phase-plane portraits, and fast Fourier
   transforms are presented for some system parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of time-critical applications, schedulability analysis is
   used to define the feasibility region of tasks with deadlines, so that
   optimization techniques can find the best design solution within the
   timing constraints. The formulation of the feasibility region based on
   the response time calculation requires many integer variables and is too
   complex for solvers. Approximation techniques have been used to define a
   convex subset of the feasibility region, used in conjunction with a
   branch and bound approach to compute suboptimal solutions for optimal
   task period selection, priority assignment, or placement of tasks onto
   CPUs. In this paper, we provide an improved and simpler real-time
   schedulability test that allows an exact and efficient definition of the
   feasibility region in Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
   optimization. Our method requires a significantly smaller number of
   binary variables and is viable for the treatment of industrial-size
   problem, as shown by the experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a weakly nonlinear equation of motion is derived for the
   dynamics of a towed, neutrally buoyant flexible slender cylinder. The
   cylinder is terminated by end-pieces at its two ends and is fastened via
   a massless towrope to a support rigidly fixed upstream. The motions are
   considered to take place in a horizontal plane. The equation of motion
   is obtained via Hamilton's principle after obtaining the Lagrangian of
   the system and the virtual work associated with the fluid dynamic
   forces. For convenience, the fluid-related forces are derived
   separately: inviscid hydrodynamic forces are modelled by an extension of
   Lighthill's slender-body work to third-order accuracy, and the viscous
   forces are derived to the same accuracy, by elaboration of Taylor's
   expressions. The Galerkin method is used to discretize the equation of
   motion with the free-free Euler-Bernoulli beam eigenfunctions, and the
   resulting set of first-order equations are solved numerically using a
   time-integration solver. Numerical results are obtained to illustrate
   the typical dynamical behaviour of a towed flexible cylinder, generally
   confirming experimental observations and linear theory predictions made
   in the past. Also, the effect of the towrope-length to cylinder-length
   ratio and the effect of the tail end-piece shape on the dynamics and
   stability of the system are investigated. The results confirm that for a
   towed flexible cylinder, if the tail end-piece is not blunt and the
   towrope not too short, both rigid-body and flexural instabilities may
   develop as the flow velocity is increased. The former occur at low flow
   velocities, in the form of oscillatory and then static instabilities,
   whereas the latter generally occur at higher flow velocities in the form
   of second- and then third-mode flutter. Moreover, it is found that the
   system becomes less stable and is subject to larger deformations if the
   towrope is longer. On the other hand, making the tail end-piece
   sufficiently blunt can effectively suppress all the instabilities; the
   system then remains stable for apparently all towing speeds. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel ab initio density functional theory (DFT)
   simulation approach to the study of surface defects in self-assembled
   monolayers (SAMs) on gold (001) surfaces. Surfaces defects can cause
   changes in gold atom spacing and the ligand footprint. DFT calculations
   of 6-mercapto-hexane on Au(001) surfaces have been performed as a
   function of ligand footprints of 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26 angstrom 2, using
   a slab geometry and periodic boundary conditions with varying gold atom
   spacing. The simulation results indicate that as the ligand packing
   density increases, the position of ideal binding sites changes from fcc
   to bridge sites. The packing density of 24 angstrom 2 corresponds to the
   highest binding energy and to a 28.85 degrees cant angle. These results
   are in good agreement with the experiments from ligand-capped gold
   nanoparticles. The simulation results also prove that the SAM structure
   of short-chain alkanethiols on gold is dominated by surface interactions
   rather than ligand interactions. The electron density mapping study
   confirms this observation, where only the top two layers of gold atoms
   contributed charge transfer to sulphur atom and no charge transfer was
   observed from the alkane chain.}},

Title = {{An interdisciplinary approach towards improved understanding of soil
   deformation during compaction}},
Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{61-80}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Soil compaction not only reduces available pore volume in which fluids
   are stored, but it alters the arrangement of soil constituents and pore
   geometry, thereby adversely impacting fluid transport and a range of
   soil ecological functions. Quantitative understanding of stress
   transmission and deformation processes in arable soils remains limited.
   Yet such knowledge is essential for better predictions of effects of
   soil management practices such as agricultural field traffic on soil
   functioning. Concepts and theory used in agricultural soil mechanics
   (soil compaction and soil tillage) are often adopted from conventional
   soil mechanics (e.g. foundation engineering). However, in contrast with
   standard geotechnical applications, undesired stresses applied by
   agricultural tyres/tracks are highly dynamic and last for very short
   times. Moreover, arable soils are typically unsaturated and contain
   important secondary structures (e.g. aggregates), factors important for
   affecting their soil mechanical behaviour. Mechanical processes in
   porous media are not only of concern in soil mechanics, but also in
   other fields including geophysics and granular material science. Despite
   similarity of basic mechanical processes, theoretical frameworks often
   differ and reflect disciplinary focus. We review concepts from different
   but complementary fields concerned with porous media mechanics and
   highlight opportunities for synergistic advances in understanding
   deformation and compaction of arable soils. We highlight the important
   role of technological advances in non-destructive measurement methods at
   pore (X-ray tomography) and soil profile (seismic) scales that not only
   offer new insights into soil architecture and enable visualization of
   soil deformation, but are becoming instrumental in the development and
   validation of new soil compaction models. The integration of concepts
   underlying dynamic processes that modify soil pore spaces and bulk
   properties will improve the understanding of how soil management affect
   vital soil mechanical, hydraulic and ecological functions supporting
   plant growth. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   on the Macdonald Campus of McGill University) to meet the irrigation
   demands of the two Horticulture Research Center greenhouses on the
   campus (approximate to 149 m(2) each) from May to October. Over its two
   years of operation, it was found that the amount of rainwater collected
   did not only meet the peak irrigation demands of the greenhouses (which
   amounted to almost 700 gal of water per day), but that there was also
   enough water for the irrigation of the nearby student-run gardens. The
   harvested rainwater was clear and did not cause any harm to the plants.
   The major problem that was experienced during the operation of the RWH
   system was that of algae growth in one of the water collection tanks.
   This issue was resolved by covering the tank with metallic green
   wallpaper, thereby blocking most of the sunlight from entering the tank.
   The RWH system is currently being used for irrigation and as a
   demonstration project to promote the learning of sustainable
   technologies on campus and in the surrounding communities.}},

Abstract = {{Sacrificial coatings, such as Zn and Cd, are used to protect steel
   against corrosion. During the electrodeposition of metals, hydrogen is
   evolved due to electrolysis. The evolved hydrogen may diffuse outward
   and become trapped in the substrate/coating interface or migrate inward
   into the steel lattice causing delayed embrittlement when the component
   is subjected to stress. This study reports two principal variables for
   Zn, Zn-Ni, and Cd coatings: (i) the quantity of hydrogen absorbed by the
   coating and substrate by vacuum thermal desorption and (ii) the
   permeability of the coating material to hydrogen by electrochemical
   permeation. The findings were analyzed in correlation with the
   microstructural characteristics of both the coating material and the
   coating/substrate interface. With Zn-Ni, both coating process and
   coating material combined to significantly reduce the risk of internal
   hydrogen embrittlement by (i) introducing the least amount of hydrogen
   during the electrodeposition process and (ii) by the ease with which
   hydrogen can be extracted by baking due to the presence of cracks in the
   coating.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a comprehensive study on the implementation of active
   harmonic and rational harmonic mode-locking of a fiber optical
   parametric oscillator (FOPO). In particular, the effect of pump
   parameters and cavity designs on the characteristics of the generated
   pulses are analyzed. Two methods of frequency multiplication in FOPOs
   are discussed and compared and we show that we can generate optical
   pulses with very high-repetition-rate (up to 240 GHz) using rational
   harmonic mode-locking. We find that optical pulses with short duration
   can be obtained using pump pulses with small duty cycle, large pump
   power, and an intra-cavity optical filter with proper bandwidth. In
   addition, optical pulses with low root-mean-square timing jitter are
   achievable when no pump phase modulation is applied and hybrid gain of
   erbium-doped fiber amplifier and parametric amplifier is used. High
   supermode noise suppression ratio is achieved by taking advantage of the
   fast parametric gain and the combined effect of self-phase modulation
   and spectral filtering. We conclude that synchronous-pumping of an
   actively mode-locked FOPO offers many advantages in terms of reducing
   the cavity loss, increasing the modulation frequency, enabling rational
   harmonic mode-locking, and applications to all-optical clock recovery.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the underlying relationship between pedestrian injury
   severity outcomes and factors leading to more severe injuries is very
   important in addressing the problem of pedestrian safety. This research
   combines data mining and statistical regression methods to identify the
   main factors associated with the levels of pedestrian injury severity
   outcomes. This work relies on the analysis of two unique pedestrian
   injury severity datasets from New York City, US (2002-2006) and the City
   of Montreal, Canada (2003-2006). General injury severity models were
   estimated for each dataset and for sub-populations obtained through
   clustering analysis. This paper shows how the segmentation of the
   accident datasets helps to better understand the complex relationship
   between the injury severity outcomes and the contribution of geometric,
   built environment and socio-demographic factors. While using the same
   methodology for the two datasets, different techniques were tested.
   Within the New York dataset, a latent class with ordered probit method
   provides the best results. However, for Montreal, K-means with a
   multinomial logit model proves most appropriate. Among other results, it
   was found that pedestrian age, location type, driver age, vehicle type,
   driver alcohol involvement, lighting conditions, and several built
   environment characteristics influence the likelihood of fatal crashes.
   Finally, the research provides recommendations for policy makers,
   traffic engineers, and law enforcement in order to reduce the severity
   of pedestrian-vehicle collisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Early detection of breast cancer is known to be a key factor in the
   successful treatment of the disease. Here, we present a detection
   technique complementary to the currently used modalities (primarily
   mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging). Our time-domain
   breast cancer detection system transmits microwave-range pulses into the
   breast and records the scattering off of the breast in order to detect
   malignancies. This method is made possible by an intrinsic contrast in
   the dielectric parameters, specifically the relative permittivity and
   conductivity, of the healthy and malignant breast tissues over the
   microwave frequency range. The long-term goal of our work is to develop
   a system that can be used periodically to monitor for unusual changes in
   breast tissues; for instance, healthy breasts would be scanned, and
   follow-up scans at regular intervals would detect any small changes in
   breast tissue composition that could indicate the presence of a
   malignant growth. At that point, the patient would be referred to see a
   doctor for further investigation of the abnormal results. Such a system
   would compare each new scan with previous ones to determine the level of
   tissue changes, and would be used by patients at home. We report
   feasibility and performance tests for our initial system, conducted with
   breast phantoms made up of tissue-mimicking materials (unique skin, fat,
   gland and tumor mixtures). We initiated the system testing with simple
   homogeneous phantoms, consisting solely of adipose tissue. Then, we
   extended our tests to cases of increasing complexity by adding a skin
   layer and varying percentages of glandular structures and tumor sizes.
   In order to optimize the experimental system, we performed tests with
   multiple antenna arrangements, tumor sizes and locations. This work
   shows that there are specific antenna arrangements that are advantageous
   for tumor detection and demonstrates the capabilities of our time-domain
   microwave breast tumor detection system.}},

Abstract = {{We address the issue of visual saliency from three perspectives. First,
   we consider saliency detection as a frequency domain analysis problem.
   Second, we achieve this by employing the concept of nonsaliency. Third,
   we simultaneously consider the detection of salient regions of different
   size. The paper proposes a new bottom-up paradigm for detecting visual
   saliency, characterized by a scale-space analysis of the amplitude
   spectrum of natural images. We show that the convolution of the image
   amplitude spectrum with a low-pass Gaussian kernel of an appropriate
   scale is equivalent to an image saliency detector. The saliency map is
   obtained by reconstructing the 2D signal using the original phase and
   the amplitude spectrum, filtered at a scale selected by minimizing
   saliency map entropy. A Hypercomplex Fourier Transform performs the
   analysis in the frequency domain. Using available databases, we
   demonstrate experimentally that the proposed model can predict human
   fixation data. We also introduce a new image database and use it to show
   that the saliency detector can highlight both small and large salient
   regions, as well as inhibit repeated distractors in cluttered images. In
   addition, we show that it is able to predict salient regions on which
   people focus their attention.}},

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{This study is a sequel to the paper of Savage and Oger (this issue) that
   reviewed experimental studies of airslides. These devices make use of
   fluidization to facilitate the transport of granular materials over long
   distances. The present paper describes a detailed and comprehensive
   consideration of the various contributions to the governing multiphase
   flow equations and proceeds to carry out numerical simulations of
   airslide flows and compare the results with laboratory experiments. It
   was carried out in part using the open source multiphase flow CFD
   program MFIX. Revisions and additions to the governing equations used in
   the distribution version of MFIX were made. The results of previously
   published molecular dynamics simulations were used to formulate a
   revised radial distribution function. The forms of the quasi-static
   stress contributions were designed to permit the development of higher
   concentration flows typical of experimentally observed airslide flows.
   Finally, additional terms were included in the particle fluctuation
   energy equation to account for (i) the viscous dissipation of the
   fluctuating particles due to the interstitial air, and (ii) the energy
   source term arising from the transfer of energy from the fluid to the
   particles. These expressions have been incorporated in the computational
   scheme and simulations of fluidized granular flows in a rectangular
   channel having frictional side walls were carried out. Some initial
   exploratory calculations were performed to examine the effects of
   various parameters on the mass flow rates and the velocity profiles.
   Different wall conditions were studied by varying the particle and wall
   restitution coefficients. The effects of varying the minimum
   fluidization velocity and the solid fraction thresholds were also
   examined. The simulation scheme was then applied to model two of the
   better documented fluidized chute flow experiments; those of Botterill
   and Bessant (1976), and the McGill University fluidized solids flow
   channel experiments of Liot (1979) and Chan (1979). Results of these
   computations and comparisons with observed experimental airslide
   behavior are discussed. Good agreement is found between the simulations
   and the experimental airslide flow characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Airslides are commonly used to transport dry particulate materials over
   distances as long as 1 km. Air is pumped through the porous bed of the
   transport channel to fluidize the granular material and to promote the
   flow down very small bed slopes. Current design of airslides is based on
   empirical design charts and past experiences. The present paper is the
   first of a two-part investigation of airslides. It reviews selected
   experimental studies of airslides with the goal of identifying
   characteristic features of these flows that we attempt to model in the
   numerical simulations described in the second companion paper. The
   experiments of Botterill and Bessant (1976) and a power-law,
   non-Newtonian finite element model that gave a good representation of
   the Botterill and Bessant (1976) velocity profiles are described. The
   McGill fluidized solids channel experimental setup and the associated
   measurements carried out by Liot (1979) and Chan (1979) are outlined.
   Some of these results were interpreted by means of simple, hydraulics
   type backwater analyses. As with the usual hydraulics type open channel
   flows, it was found that fully developed, uniform depth, granular
   airslide flows could develop. This is an important observation and it
   will be used as justification for the methodology employed in the
   calculations in the companion paper which proceeds to simulate fully
   developed, three-dimensional fluidized granular flows in a rectangular
   channel. The distinctive features identified in the review of the
   airslide flow experiments are summarized. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Genesis of natural biocomposite-based materials, such as bone,
   cartilage, and teeth, involves interactions between organic and
   inorganic systems. Natural biopolymers, such as peptide motif sequences,
   can be used as a template to direct the nucleation and crystallization
   of hydroxyapatite (HA). In this study, a natural motif sequence
   consisting of 13 amino acids present in the first helix of osteocalcin
   was selected based on its calcium binding ability and used as substrate
   for nucleation of HA crystals. The acidic (acidic osteocalcin-derived
   peptide (OSC)) and amidic (amidic osteocalcin-derived peptide (OSN))
   forms of this sequence were synthesized to investigate the effects of
   different C termini on the process of biomineralization. Electron
   microscopy analyses show the formation of plate-like HA crystals with
   random size and shape in the presence of OSN. In contrast, spherical
   amorphous calcium phosphate is formed in the presence of OSC. Circular
   dichroism experiments indicate conformational changes of amidic peptide
   to an open and regular structure as a consequence of interaction with
   calcium and phosphate. There is no conformational change detectable in
   OSC. It is concluded that HA crystal formation, which only occurred in
   OSN, is attributable to C-terminal amidation of a natural peptide
   derived from osteocalcin. It is also proposed that natural peptides with
   the ability to promote biomineralization have the potential to be
   utilized in hard tissue regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle gel electrophoresis has recently emerged as an attractive

   Newtonian electrolytes. We compare numerically exact solutions of the
   model with several independent asymptotic approximations, identifying
   regions in the parameter space where these approximations are accurate
   or break down. As previously assumed in the literature, Henry's formula,
   modified by the addition of a constant electroosmotic flow mobility, is
   accurate only for nanoparticles that are small compared to the hydrogel
   mesh size. We derived an exact analytical solution of the full model by
   judiciously modifying the theory of Allison et al. {[}15] for uncharged
   gels, drawing on the superposition methodology of Doane et al. {[}14] to
   account for hydrogel charge. This furnishes accurate and economical
   mobility predictions for the entire parameter space. The present model
   suggests that nanoparticle size separations (with diameters less than or
   similar to 40 nm) are optimal at low ionic strength, with a gel mesh
   size that is selected according to the particle charging mechanism. For
   weakly charged particles, optimal size separation is achieved when the
   Brinkman screening length is matched to the mean particle size. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) was used to evaluate the seismic
   response of straight, continuous 4-span bridges with different
   sub-structure configurations. Three different record sets were chosen to
   represent three different earthquake types which can occur for a site
   such as Vancouver (i.e., crustal, subduction interface, and subduction
   inslab earthquakes). Seventy eight records were considered in each set
   (i.e., a total of 234 records) and the capacities of the bridges were
   evaluated using a fast IDA algorithm. A simplified method to account for
   the effects of spectral shapes was used. Different subsets of the
   records with specific characteristics were also used in the IDA. The
   bridges were designed and evaluated for two different design force
   modification factors and bridges with different degrees of irregularity
   were studied. Comparisons of the IDA results obtained indicated that in
   most of the cases the interface record sets resulted in lower median
   collapse capacities and hence were the most critical of the ground
   motions studied.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-analytical finite strip method is developed for analyzing the
   post-buckling behavior of rectangular composite laminated plates of
   arbitrary lay-up subjected to progressive end-shortening in their plane
   and to normal pressure loading. In this method, all the displacements
   are postulated by the appropriate harmonic shape functions in the
   longitudinal direction and polynomial interpolation functions in the
   transverse direction. Thin or thick plates are assumed and
   correspondingly the Classical Plate Theory (CPT) or Higher Order Plate
   Theory (HOPT) is applied. The in-plane transverse deflection is allowed
   at the loaded ends of the plate, whilst the same deflection at the
   unloaded edges is either allowed to occur or completely restrained.
   Geometric non-linearity is introduced in the strain-displacement
   equations in the manner of the von-Karman assumptions. The formulations
   of the finite strip methods are based on the concept of the principle of
   the minimum potential energy. The Newton-Raphson method is used to solve
   the non-linear equilibrium equations. A number of applications involving
   isotropic plates, symmetric and unsymmetric cross-ply laminates are
   described to investigate the through-thickness shearing effects as well
   as the effect of pressure loading, end-shortening and boundary
   conditions. The study of the results has revealed that the response of
   the composite laminated plates is particularly influenced by the
   application of the Higher Order Plate Theory (HOPT) and normal pressure
   loading. In the relatively thick plates, the HOPT results have more
   accuracy than CPT.}},

Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Non-collagenous proteins (NCPs) inhibit hydroxyapatite (HA;
   Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH) formation in living organisms by binding to nascent
   nuclei of HA and preventing their further growth. Polar and charged
   amino acids (AAs) are highly expressed in NCPs, and the negatively
   charged ones, such as glutamic acid (Glu) and phosphoserine (P-Ser) seem
   to be mainly responsible for the inhibitory effect of NCPs. Despite the
   recognized importance of these AAs on the behaviour of NCPs, their
   specific effect on HA crystallization is still unclear, and
   controversial results have been reported concerning the efficacy of HA
   inhibition of positively versus negatively charged AAs. We focused on a
   positively charged (arginine, Arg) and a negatively charged (Glu) AA,
   and their combination in the same solution. We studied their inhibitory
   effect on HA nucleation and growth at physiological temperature and pH
   and we determined the mechanism by which they can affect HA
   crystallization. Our results showed a strong inhibitory effect of Arg on
   HA nucleation; however, Glu was more effective in inhibiting HA crystal
   growth during the growth stage. The combination of Glu and Arg was less
   effective in controlling HA nucleation, but it inhibited HA crystal
   growth. We attributed these differences to the stability of complexes
   formed between AAs and calcium and phosphate ions at the nucleation
   stage, and in bonding strength of AAs to HA crystal faces during the
   growth stage. The AAs also influenced the morphology of synthesized HA.
   Presence of either Arg or Glu resulted in the formation of spherulites
   consisting of preferentially oriented nanoplatelets orientation. This
   was attributed to kinetic factors favoring growth front nucleation (GFN)
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A clear understanding of the factors controlling the deposition behavior
   of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), such as quantum dots (QDs), is
   necessary for predicting their transport and fate in natural subsurface
   environments and in water filtration processes. A quartz crystal
   microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used to study the
   effect of particle surface coatings and water chemistry on the
   deposition of commercial QDs onto Al2O3. Two carboxylated QDs (CdSe and
   CdTe) with different surface coatings were compared with two model
   nanoparticles: sulfate-functionalized (sPL) and carboxyl-modified (cPL)
   polystyrene latex. Deposition rates were assessed over a range of ionic
   strengths (IS) in simple electrolyte (KCl) and in electrolyte
   supplemented with two organic molecules found in natural waters; namely,
   humic acid and rhamnolipid. The Al2O3 collector used here is selected to
   be representative of oxide patches found on the surface of aquifer or
   filter grains. Deposition studies showed that ENP deposition rates on
   bare Al2O3 generally decreased with increasing salt concentration, with
   the exception of the polyacrylic-acid (PAA) coated CdTe QD which
   exhibited unique deposition behavior due to changes in the conformation
   of the PAA coating. QD deposition rates on bare Al2O3 were approximately
   1 order of magnitude lower than those of the polystyrene latex
   nanoparticles, likely as a result of steric stabilization imparted by
   the QD surface coatings. Adsorption of humic acid or rhamnolipid on the
   Al2O3 surface resulted in charge reversal of the collector and
   subsequent reduction in the deposition rates of all ENPs. Moreover, the
   ratio of the two QCM-D output parameters, frequency and dissipation,
   revealed key structural information of the ENP-collector interface;
   namely, on bare Al2O3, the latex particles were rigidly attached as
   compared to the more loosely attached QDs. This study emphasizes the
   importance of considering the nature of ENP coatings as well as organic
   molecule adsorption onto particle and collector surfaces to avoid
   underestimating ENP mobility in natural and engineered aquatic
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Styrene/acrylonitrile (S/AN) and tert-butyl methacrylate/acrylonitrile
   (tBMA/AN) copolymers were synthesized in a controlled manner (low
   polydispersity (M) over bar (w)/(M) over bar (n) with linear growth of
   number average molecular weight (M) over bar (n) vs. conversion X) by
   nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP) with a succinimidyl ester (NHS)
   terminated form of BlocBuilder unimolecular initiator (NHS-BlocBuilder)
   in dioxane solution. No additional free nitroxide (SGI) was required to
   control the tBMA-rich copolymerizations with NHS-BlocBuilder, a feature
   previously required for methacrylate polymerizations with BlocBuilder
   initiators. Copolymers from S/AN mixtures (AN molar initial fractions
   f(AN,0) = 0.13-0.86, T = 115 degrees C) had (M) over bar (w)/(M) over
   bar (n) = 1.14-1.26 and linear (M) over bar (n) versus conversion X up
   to X approximate to 0.6. tBMA/AN copolymers (f(AN,0) = 0.10-0.81, T = 90
   degrees C) possessed slightly broader molecular weight distributions
   ((M) over bar (w)/(M) over bar (n) = 1.23-1.50), particularly as the
   initial composition became richer in tBMA, but still exhibited linear
   plots of (M) over bar (n) versus conversion X up to X approximate to
   0.6. A S/AN/tBMA terpolymerization (f(AN,0) = 0.50, f(S,0) = 0.40) was
   also conducted at 90 degrees C and revealed excellent control with (M)
   over bar (n) = 13.6 kg/mol, (M) over bar (w)/(M) over bar (n) = 1.19,
   and linear (M) over bar (n) versus conversion X up to X = 0.54.
   Incorporation of AN and tBMA in the final copolymer (molar composition
   F-AN = 0.47, F-tBMA = 0.11) was similar to the initial composition and
   represents initial designs to make tailored, acid functional AN
   copolymers by NMP for barrier materials. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {{Stochastic Decoding of LDPC Codes over GF(q)}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{939-950}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Despite the outstanding performance of non-binary low-density
   parity-check (LDPC) codes over many communication channels, they are not
   in widespread use yet. This is due to the high implementation complexity
   of their decoding algorithms, even those that compromise performance for
   the sake of simplicity.
   In this paper, we present three algorithms based on stochastic
   computation to reduce the decoding complexity. The first is a purely
   stochastic algorithm with error-correcting performance matching that of
   the sum-product algorithm (SPA) for LDPC codes over Galois fields with
   low order and a small variable node degree. We also present a modified
   version which reduces the number of decoding iterations required while
   remaining purely stochastic and having a low per-iteration complexity.
   The second algorithm, relaxed half-stochastic (RHS) decoding, combines
   elements of the SPA and the stochastic decoder and uses successive
   relaxation to match the error-correcting performance of the SPA.
   Furthermore, it uses fewer iterations than the purely stochastic
   algorithm and does not have limitations on the field order and variable
   node degree of the codes it can decode.
   The third algorithm, NoX, is a fully stochastic specialization of RHS
   for codes with a variable node degree 2 that offers similar performance,
   but at a significantly lower computational complexity.
   We study the performance and complexity of the algorithms; noting that
   all have lower per-iteration complexity than SPA and that RHS can have
   comparable average per-codeword computational complexity, and NoX a
   lower one.}},

   such a model, a STIA-based network is designed using three different

   small-size STIAs are an energy-efficient solution for data center
   networks and allow a power reduction of more than an order of magnitude
   with respect to the Ethernet-based network. The comparison for the same

Abstract = {{Mineralization is a typical strategy used in natural materials to
   achieve high stiffness and hardness for structural functions such as
   skeletal support, protection or predation. High mineral content
   generally leads to brittleness, yet natural materials such as bone,
   mollusk shells or glass sponge achieve relatively high toughness
   considering the weakness of their constituents through intricate
   microstructures. In particular, nanometers thick organic interfaces
   organized in micro-architectures play a key role in providing toughness
   by various processes including crack deflection, crack bridging or
   energy dissipation. While these interfaces are critical in these
   materials, their composition, structure and mechanics is often poorly
   understood. In this work we focus on nacre, one of the most impressive
   hard biological materials in terms of toughness. We performed
   interfacial fracture tests on chevron notched nacre samples from three
   different species: red abalone, top shell and pearl oyster. We found
   that the intrinsic toughness of the interfaces is indeed found to be
   extremely low, in the order of the toughness of the mineral inclusions
   themselves. Such low toughness is required for the cracks to follow the
   interfaces, and to deflect and circumvent the mineral tablets. This
   result highlights the efficacy of toughening mechanisms in natural
   materials, turning low-toughness inclusions and interfaces into
   high-performance composites. We found that top shell nacre displayed the
   highest interfacial toughness, because of higher surface roughness and a
   more resilient organic material, and also through extrinsic toughening
   mechanisms including crack deflection, crack bridging and process zone.
   In the context of biomimetics, the main implication of this finding is
   that the interface in nacre-like composite does not need to be tough;
   the extensibility or ductility of the interfaces may be more important
   than their strength and toughness to produce toughness at the
   macroscale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   expressions are developed for the deflections and stresses in the

Abstract = {{The development of a successful transit system must include a demand
   ridership analysis during the planning stage. The construction of a rail
   system is expensive and sufficient demand is needed for the project to
   be feasible. A classical and relatively simple method to predict
   potential ridership is to build a linear regression model that makes the
   linkage between the built environment, socioeconomics, transit service
   and ridership in existing stations. This paper develops trip production
   and attraction models at the station-level for the metro network in
   Montreal, Quebec, by exploring numerous factors that influence transit
   use. The results demonstrate that transit-related attributes have a
   significant impact on ridership. Population density, average income, bus
   service connectivity, distance to central station, and service frequency
   are linked to trip production ridership during morning peak hours.
   Factors such as commercial and governmental land uses, bus connectivity,
   and transfer stations are associated with station attraction ridership

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to synthesize initial mean consensus
   behavior of a set of agents from the fundamental optimization principles
   of i) stochastic dynamic games, and ii) optimal control. In the
   stochastic dynamic game model each agent seeks to minimize its
   individual quadratic discounted cost function involving the mean of the
   states of all other agents. In this formulation we derive the limiting
   infinite population mean field equation system and explicitly compute
   its unique solution. The resulting mean field (MF) control strategies
   drive each agent to track the overall population's initial state
   distribution mean, and by applying these decentralized strategies, any
   finite population system reaches mean consensus asymptotically as time
   goes to infinity. Furthermore, these control laws possess an
   epsilon(N)-Nash equilibrium property where epsilon(N) goes to zero as
   the population size goes to infinity. Finally, the analysis is extended
   to the case of random mean field couplings. In the social cooperative
   formulation the basic objective is to minimize a social cost as the sum
   of the individual cost functions containing mean field coupling. In this
   formulation we show that for any individual agent the decentralized mean
   field social (MF Social) control strategy is the same as the mean field
   Nash (MF Nash) equilibrium strategy. Hence
   MF - Nash Controls U-Nash(N) = MF - Social Controls U-Soc(N).
   On the other hand, the solution to the centralized LQR optimal control
   formulation yields the Standard Consensus (SC) algorithm whenever the
   graph representing the corresponding topology of the network is
   Completely Connected (CC). Hence
   Cent. LQR Controls U-Cent(N) = SC - CC Conrols U-SC(N).
   Moreover, a system with centralized control laws reaches consensus on
   the initial state distributionmean as time and population size N go to
   infinity. Hence, asymptotically in time
   MF - Nash Controls U-Nash(N) = MF - Social Controls U-Soc(N) = Cent. LQR
   Controls U-Cent(infinity) = SC - CC Controls U-SC(infinity).
   Finally, the analysis is extended to the long time average (LTA) cost
   functions case.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD(+),
   was investigated on glassy carbon (GC) electrode at various
   temperatures, electrode potentials and NAD(+) concentrations using
   electrochemical methods of linear polarization voltammetry, differential
   pulse voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was
   shown that under the experimental conditions employed, the NAD(+)
   reduction reaction is under diffusion control, is irreversible (requires
   overpotential of more than -550 mV), and is of pseudo-first order with
   respect to NAD+. The reduction process involves the exchange of 1.54 or
   1.62 electrons, depending on reduction potential. This indicates that 54
   or 62 mol\% of NADH is produced, respectively, while the remaining
   quantity is NAD2. The kinetics of NAD(+) reduction at a formal potential
   of the NAD(+)/ NADH couple was found to be rather slow, and only
   moderately temperature dependent: the apparent formal heterogeneous
   electron-transfer rate constant is in the order of 10(-14) cms(-1), and
   the apparent formal Gibbs energy of activation is 53.1 kJmol(-1).}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{76-91}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear forced dynamics of an axially moving beam in the
   supercritical speed regime is numerically investigated in this paper,
   with special consideration to the case possessing an internal resonance
   between the first two modes. At critical speed, the initial equilibrium
   configuration of the beam becomes unstable and a new stable non-trivial
   equilibrium solution together with its symmetric counterpart arises. A
   closed-form solution for the post-buckling configuration is introduced
   and the system is assumed to be subject to a transverse harmonic
   excitation load at its buckled state. The equation of motion is cast
   into new coordinates which gives the equation governing the motion of
   the beam about the buckled state. This equation is discretized via the
   Galerkin method which yields a set of nonlinear ordinary differential
   equations (NODEs) with quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms. The set of
   NODEs are solved either via the pseudo-arclength continuation technique
   or by means of direct time integration so as to obtain
   frequency-response curves as well as bifurcation diagrams of Poincare
   sections about the buckled state. Results are shown through time
   histories, phase-plane diagrams, and Poincare sections. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to measure the velocity of the superior
   surface of human vocal folds during phonation using laser Doppler
   vibrometry (LDV). A custom-made endoscopic laser beam deflection unit
   was designed and fabricated. An in vivo clinical experimental procedure
   was developed to simultaneously collect LDV velocity and video from
   videolaryngoscopy. The velocity along the direction of the laser beam,
   i.e., the inferior-superior direction, was captured. The velocity was
   synchronous with electroglottograph and sound level meter data. The
   vibration energy of the vocal folds was determined to be significant up
   to a frequency of 3 kHz. Three characteristic vibrational waveforms were
   identified which may indicate bifurcations between vibrational modes of
   the mucosal wave. No relationship was found between the velocity
   amplitude and phonation frequency or sound pressure level. A correlation
   was found between the peak-to-peak displacement amplitude and phonation
   frequency. A sparse map of the velocity amplitudes on the vocal fold
   surface was obtained. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Traffic collisions and fatalities during the holiday festive periods are

   Using data from 2004 to 2008, this research identifies the factors that
   delineate between crashes that occur during public holidays and those
   occurring during normal weekends. We find that fatal and injury crashes
   are over-represented during holidays. Amongst the three risky behaviors
   targeted in the holiday blitzes (driver intoxication, unsafe speeding
   and restraint use), non-use of restraint is more prevalent whereas
   driver intoxication and unsafe speeding are less prevalent during
   holidays. The mixed results obtained suggest that it may be time to
   consider a more balanced approach to the enhanced enforcement and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new control scheme for the problem of a space
   manipulator after capturing an unknown target, such as space debris. The
   changes in the dynamics parameters of the system, as a result of
   capturing an unknown target, must be accommodated because they may lead
   to poor performance of the trajectory control and attitude stabilization
   system. To address this issue in the postcapture scenario, the adaptive
   reactionless control algorithm to produce the arm motions with minimum
   disturbance to the base is proposed in this study. In addition, the
   online momentum-based estimation method is developed for
   inertia-parameter identification after the space manipulator grasps an
   unknown tumbling target with unknown angular momentum. This control
   scheme is intended for use in the transition phase from the instant of
   capture until the unknown parameters are identified and/or the available
   stabilization methods can be applied properly. To verify the validity
   and feasibility of the proposed concept, MSC.Adams simulation platform
   is employed to implement a planar base manipulator target model and the
   three-dimensional model of the Engineering Test Satellite VII system.
   The numerical results show that the space manipulator is able to perform
   reactionless motion while the inertial parameters converge to their real
   values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a detailed characterization of the observed daily
   rainfall series available for the Mekong, Chi, and Mun River Basins in
   the context of climate change; and describes the linkage between climate
   simulations given by Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and the local
   rainfall characteristics using the popular Statistical Downscaling Model
   (SDSM). Observed daily rainfall records at 11 stations in the study area
   for the 1961-2007 period were considered. Results of characterizing the
   available rainfall data for the 1961-1990 and 1991-2007 periods show
   different trends of rainfall characteristics for different locations in
   the study area. However, a consistent increase in the annual maximum
   number of consecutive dry days (CDD) was observed in the Chi catchment
   area, the eastern part of the Mun watershed, and the western portion of
   the Mekong River Basin. In addition, decrease in the annual maximum
   daily rainfall (AMDR) was found in most locations of the study area,
   except for the central part of the Chi and Mun River Basins. Moreover,
   it has been shown in this paper that the SDSM could adequately describe
   the basic statistical and physical characteristics of the observed
   rainfall processes for the calibration (1961-1975) and validation
   (1976-1990) periods. This statistical downscaling method was then used
   to project future rainfall characteristics for the 1961-2099 period
   using the climate simulations given by the UK HadCM3 (HadCM3) model
   under A2 and B2 scenarios (HadCM3A2 and HadCM3B2), and by the Canadian
   GCM3 (CGCM3) model under A2 and A1B scenarios (CGCM3A2 and CGCM3A1B). In
   general, the projected trends of rainfall characteristics by both HadCM3
   and CGCM3 were found to be consistent with the observed historical
   trends. However, there was a large difference in the projection results
   given by these two models. This would indicate the presence of high
   uncertainty in climate simulations provided by different GCMs. In
   addition, the climate change impacts on the flood and drought problems
   in the study area were shown using the CDD and AMDR indices of 100-year
   return period. (c) 2013 International Association for Hydro-environment

Abstract = {{An aluminum lithium copper alloy was rapidly solidified via the
   electrospark deposition process. High-resolution scanning electron
   microscopy (HR-SEM), time-of-flight secondary-ion-mass-spectroscopy
   (TOF-SIMS) and atom probe tomography (APT) were employed to investigate
   the distribution of solute within the deposited materials. The TOF-SIMS
   data revealed evidence that solute trapping of lithium occurred during
   solidification, while SEM and APT revealed the presence of fine
   copper-rich cells within the microstructure (similar to 30-60 rim in
   width). This morphology correlated directly with the microstructural
   morphology predicted by the Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi (KGT) model for
   microstructural development during rapid solidification. The KGT model,
   which can be used to describe the planar cellular transition within a
   microstructure, then predicted a solidification front velocity of
   similar to 1 m s(-1) being realized during electrospark deposition
   solidification. This SFV corroborated the chemical mapping data, and
   therefore supported the solute trapping hypothesis, as the continuous
   growth model for solute trapping as developed by Aziz and Kaplan (Acta
   Metallurgica 1988; 36:2335) predicts significant trapping of lithium at
   a SFV of 1 m s(-1). Finally APT revealed the presence of Al3Li phase
   upon the copper-rich cell walls. It was then determined that the Al3Li
   was not formed during solidification, as predicted by a time-dependent
   nucleation model for phase prediction during rapid solidification, and
   therefore is the result of a subsequent aging process. (C) 2012 Acta

Title = {{Planning additional drilling campaign using two-space genetic algorithm:

Abstract = {{Grade and tonnage are the most important technical uncertainties in
   mining ventures because of the use of estimations/simulations, which are
   mostly generated from drill data. Open pit mines are planned and
   designed on the basis of the blocks representing the entire orebody.
   Each block has different estimation/simulation variance reflecting
   uncertainty to some extent. The estimation/simulation realizations are
   submitted to mine production scheduling process. However, the use of a
   block model with varying estimation/simulation variances will lead to
   serious risk in the scheduling. In the medium of multiple simulations,
   the dispersion variances of blocks can be thought to regard technical
   uncertainties. However, the dispersion variance cannot handle
   uncertainty associated with varying estimation/simulation variances of
   blocks. This paper proposes an approach that generates the configuration
   of the best additional drilling campaign to generate more homogenous
   estimation/simulation variances of blocks. In other words, the objective
   is to find the best drilling configuration in such a way as to minimize
   grade uncertainty under budget constraint. Uncertainty measure of the
   optimization process in this paper is interpolation variance, which
   considers data locations and grades. The problem is expressed as a
   minmax problem, which focuses on finding the best worst-case performance
   i.e., minimizing interpolation variance of the block generating maximum
   interpolation variance. Since the optimization model requires computing
   the interpolation variances of blocks being simulated/estimated in each
   iteration, the problem cannot be solved by standard optimization tools.
   This motivates to use two-space genetic algorithm (GA) approach to solve
   the problem. The technique has two spaces: feasible drill hole
   configuration with minimization of interpolation variance and drill hole
   simulations with maximization of interpolation variance. Two-space
   interacts to find a minmax solution iteratively. A case study was
   conducted to demonstrate the performance of approach. The findings
   showed that the approach could be used to plan a new drilling campaign.

Abstract = {{In this brief, data-rate assignment in IS-856 uplink (reverse link) is

   assignment. In the first step, the controller is designed for the
   special case when the number of users in the network is fixed. Then, the
   designed controller is further developed for a dynamic network (where
   the number of users is subject to change) to achieve the desired
   performance. To this end, the network is formulated in the framework of
   switched systems, where any new activation or deactivation of users is
   considered as switching from one system to another. The controllers
   obtained are then modified properly to retain network stability and
   performance in the presence of time-delay. Simulation results are
   presented to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Inconel 718 was cold spray formed to a 6-mm thickness on an 8-cm
   diameter aluminum alloy tube using Sulzer Amdry 1718 powder and the

   velocity and post-spray heat treatment were studied. Post-spray
   annealing was performed from 950 to 1250 A degrees C for 1-2 h. The
   resulting microstructures as well as the corresponding mechanical
   properties were characterized. As-sprayed coatings exhibited very low
   ductility. The tensile strength and ductility of the heat-treated
   coatings were improved to varying levels depending on the heat-treatment
   and spray conditions. For coatings sprayed at higher particle velocity
   and heat treated at 1250 A degrees C for 1 h, an elongation of 24\% was
   obtained. SEM micrographs showed a higher fraction of interparticle
   metallurgical bonds due to some sintering effect. Corresponding fracture
   surfaces also revealed a higher fraction of dimple features, typically
   associated with ductile fracture, in the annealed coatings. The results
   demonstrate that cold spray forming of Inconel 718 is feasible, and with
   appropriate heat treatment, metallurgical bonding can be increased. The
   ductility of the spray-formed samples was comparable to that of the bulk
   material.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Flow curves were determined in torsion at a series of temperatures on
   four plain C steels and a Nb microalloyed steel of increasing C
   concentration. The mean flow stresses (MFSs) pertaining to each
   experimental condition were calculated from the flow curves by
   integration. These are plotted against inverse absolute temperature in
   the form of Boratto diagrams. The stress drop temperatures, normally
   defined as the upper critical temperature A(r3){*}, were determined from
   these diagrams. These are shown to be about 40 degrees C above the
   paraequilibrium and about 20 degrees C above the orthoequilibrium
   temperatures. This type of behavior is ascribed to the occurrence of
   dynamic transformation (DT) during deformation. The general
   characteristics of the DT of austenite to ferrite are reviewed. It is
   suggested that some of the unexpected load drops that have been reported
   to take place above the Ae3 temperature in strip mills may be
   attributable to this phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{The high complexity of optimal detection for spatial multplexing
   multiple-input multiple-output systems motivates the need for more
   practical alternatives. Among many suboptimal schemes reported in the
   literature, very few can be proven to provide close to optimal
   performance with low fixed complexity. The recently introduced Selection
   based Minimum Mean Square Error Ordered Successive Interference
   Cancellation (Sel-MMSE-OSIC) algorithm is one such scheme that employs
   list-based detection. Simulations results showed that its performance is
   nearly indistinguishable from optimal at almost all signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) levels. In this paper, we propose an improved asymptotically
   optimal fixed-complexity algorithm that provides substantial complexity
   reductions over Sel-MMSE-OSIC with similar error rate performance. This
   scheme is based on simplified channel partition and efficient tree-based
   list detection. To achieve further reductions in complexity for large
   constellation sizes, a variable complexity version of this scheme is
   proposed. The resulting algorithm is a variable complexity scheme that
   operates on a very small subset of candidates and employs an improved
   channel partition preprocessing that not only reduces complexity but
   also guarantees high SNR optimality over space uncorrelated channels.
   Simulations results confirm that the proposed scheme provides
   significantcomplexity reductions over conventional variable complexity
   detection schemes. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Forces measured with micro-fabricated cantilevers during actomyosin

Abstract = {{Background: There is evidence that the actin-activated ATP kinetics and
   the mechanical work produced by muscle myosin molecules are regulated by
   two surface loops, located near the ATP binding pocket (loop 1), and in
   a region that interfaces with actin (loop 2). These loops regulate force
   and velocity of contraction, and have been investigated mostly in single
   molecules. There is a lack of information of the work produced by myosin
   molecules ordered in filaments and working cooperatively, which is the
   actual muscle environment.
   Methods: We use micro-fabricated cantilevers to measure forces produced
   by myosin filaments isolated from mollusk muscles, skeletal muscles, and
   smooth muscles containing variations in the structure of loop 1 (tonic
   and phasic myosins). We complemented the experiments with in-vitro
   assays to measure the velocity of actin motility.
   Results: Smooth muscle myosin filaments produced more force than
   skeletal and mollusk myosin filaments when normalized per filament
   overlap. Skeletal muscle myosin propelled actin filaments in a higher
   sliding velocity than smooth muscle myosin. The values for force and
   velocity were consistent with previous studies using myosin molecules,
   and suggest a close correlation with the myosin isoform and structure of
   surface loop 1.
   General significance: The technique using micro-fabricated cantilevers
   to measure force of filaments allows for the investigation of the
   relation between myosin structure and contractility, allowing
   experiments to be conducted with an array of different myosin isoforms.
   Using the technique we observed that the work produced by myosin
   molecules is regulated by amino-acid sequences aligned in specific
   loops. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The potential development of antibacterial resistance and endocrine
   disruption has led to increased research investigating the removal of
   contaminants from wastewater (WW) such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and 17
   alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). These compounds react quickly with ozone
   (O-3), thus ozonation during WW treatment may result in their complete
   removal. Also, O-3 has demonstrated the ability to increase the
   biodegradability of WW and certain pharmaceuticals, suggesting its
   potential as a pretreatment to activated sludge (AS, biological
   treatment). The objective of this study was to determine whether
   ozonation, conducted at doses lower than commonly applied to treated WW,
   would lead to an increased biodegradability of SMX and EE2. The results
   show that after ozonation performed at lab-scale the bacterial mixtures
   removed 5 \% to 40 \% more SMX; however, 2 \% to 23 \% less EE2 was
   removed, which was attributed to the observed preferential degradation
   of a by-product of EE2 ozonation. These results suggest that although
   ozonation, used as a pretreatment, was shown in literature to increase
   the overall biodegradability of AS as well as some specific antibiotic
   compounds and a blood lipid regulator, the potential for increased
   removal of pharmaceuticals seems to be compound-dependent and cannot yet
   be extrapolated to this entire class of compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Bioengineered tissue equivalents should provide physiologically relevant
   biochemical and mechanical cues to support the growth and
   differentiation of seeded cells. Herein, tubular dense collagen
   constructs (TDCCs) with collagen content comparable to native
   extracellular matrix were used to investigate the effect of shear stress
   alone (i.e. under laminar fluid flow), and shear stress in combination
   with circumferential strain (i.e. under pulsatile fluid flow) on the
   proliferation, alignment, and phenotype of three-dimensionally (3D)
   seeded airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). In addition, the effect of
   ASMC-mediated remodelling on TDCC matrix morphological and mechanical
   properties was investigated. Compared to static culture, pulsatile flow
   increased seeded ASMC growth by 70\%, improved the homogeneity of cell
   distribution within the TDCCs and induced differential cellular
   alignment depending on the primary stimuli. Specifically, within the
   inner wall, where shear stress is predominant, ASMCs were aligned
   parallel to fluid flow direction, while within the outer wall ASMCs were
   aligned parallel to the circumferential strain (perpendicular to fluid
   flow). In contrast, under laminar flow, ASMCs were aligned parallel to
   fluid flow direction within both walls. Compared to laminar flow,
   pulsatile flow resulted in increased positive staining for alpha-smooth
   muscle actin, and in up-regulated typical ASMC contractile markers
   suggesting that circumferential strain modulates ASMC differentiation.
   Pulsatile flow also caused a 60 and 30\% increase in collagen density
   within both acellular and cellular TDCCs, respectively, which was
   reflected in an increased apparent modulus. Compared to static culture,
   pulsatile stimulation of cellular constructs resulted in 70\% higher
   circumferential strength. The TDCCs provide ASMC niche for greater
   insight into the responses of 3D seeded SMCs to physiologically
   equivalent in vitro dynamic conditioning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Reducing fat and cholesterol content is currently one of the primary
   trends in food product innovation. Fat plays an important role in
   maintaining food quality, particularly the texture, flavor, and
   stability of food emulsion products. The food industry faces major
   challenges in seeking to produce reduced-fat and low-cholesterol
   mayonnaise and dressings that have attributes similar to full-fat
   products. Efficient monitoring of products to ensure desirable quality
   requires knowledge of their physicochemical characteristics, including
   appearance, rheology, emulsion stability, microstructure, and flavor, as
   well as particle size and charge distribution. The purpose of this paper
   is to provide a comprehensive overview of trends in the development of
   reduced-fat and low-cholesterol dressings. The effects of reducing fat
   content or using various fat replacers on the physicochemical properties
   of dressing and mayonnaise products are detailed with supporting
   experimental results. The possibility of using plant-based ingredients
   or reduced-cholesterol egg yolk in the formulation of such products is

Abstract = {{We present a novel framework for analyzing univariate time series data.
   At the heart of the approach is a versatile algorithm for measuring the
   similarity of two segments of time series called geometric template
   matching (GeTeM). First, we use GeTeM to compute a similarity measure
   for clustering and nearest-neighbor classification. Next, we present a
   semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses the similarity measure with
   hierarchical clustering in order to improve classification performance
   when unlabeled training data are available. Finally, we present a
   boosting framework called TDEBOOST, which uses an ensemble of GeTeM
   classifiers. TDEBOOST augments the traditional boosting approach with an
   additional step in which the features used as inputs to the classifier
   are adapted at each step to improve the training error. We empirically
   evaluate the proposed approaches on several datasets, such as
   accelerometer data collected from wearable sensors and ECG data.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration of bone marrow with fat is a prevalent feature in people
   with age-related bone loss and osteoporosis, which correlates inversely
   with bone formation and positively with high expression levels of
   peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR). Inhibition of
   PPAR thus represents a potential therapeutic approach for age-related
   bone loss. In this study, we examined the effect of PPAR inhibition on
   bone in skeletally mature C57BL/6 male mice. Nine-month-old mice were
   treated with a PPAR antagonist, bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether (BADGE),
   alone or in combination with active vitamin D (1,25{[}OH]2D3) for 6
   weeks. Micro-computed tomography and bone histomorphometry indicated
   that mice treated with either BADGE or BADGE+1,25(OH)2D3 had
   significantly increased bone volume and improved bone quality compared
   with vehicle-treated mice. This phenotype occurred in the absence of
   alterations in osteoclast number. Furthermore, the
   BADGE+1,25(OH)2D3-treated mice exhibited higher levels of unmineralized
   osteoid. All of the treated groups showed a significant increase in
   circulating levels of bone formation markers without changes in bone
   resorption markers, while blood glucose, parathyroid hormone, and Ca+
   remained normal. Furthermore, treatment with BADGE induced higher levels
   of expression of vitamin D receptor within the bone marrow. Overall,
   treated mice showed higher levels of osteoblastogenesis and bone
   formation concomitant with decreased marrow adiposity and ex vivo
   adipogenesis. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that
   pharmacological inhibition of PPAR may represent an effective anabolic
   therapy for osteoporosis in the near future. (c) 2013 American Society

   regime and global dynamical behavior. Using Galerkin's technique, the
   non-linear partial differential equation of motion is discretized and
   reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by choosing
   the basis functions to be eigenfunctions of a stationary beam. The set
   of ODEs is solved by the pseudo-arclength continuation technique, for
   the system in the sub-critical axial speed regime, and by direct time
   integration to investigate the global dynamics. Results are shown
   through frequency-response curves as well as bifurcation diagrams of the
   Poincare maps. Points of interest in the parameter space in the form of
   time traces, phase-plane portraits, Poincare maps, and fast Fourier
   transforms (FFTs) are also highlighted. Numerical results indicate that
   the system displays a wide variety of rich and interesting dynamical
   behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Defect layer method to capture effect of gaps and overlaps in variable
   stiffness laminates made by Automated Fiber Placement}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{245-251}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A variable stiffness design can increase the structural performance of
   composite laminates. In this paper, a composite laminate with
   curvilinear fiber paths is designed to maximize simultaneously its
   in-plane stiffness and buckling load. After obtaining the Pareto front
   through a surrogate-based optimization algorithm, two variable stiffness
   laminates among the solution set are selected that can be manufactured
   by an Automated Fiber Placement machine. Due to the characteristics of
   the manufacturing process, defects appearing in the form of gaps and/or
   overlaps emerge within the composite laminate. MATLAB subroutines are
   developed here to capture the location and extent of the defects. A
   novel method, called defect layer, is proposed to characterize the
   change in properties of each layer in the composite laminates that
   results from the occurrence of gaps and overlaps. Such a method allows
   calculating the in-plane stiffness and buckling load of a composite
   laminate with embedded defects. The results show that by incorporating
   gaps in the laminates the buckling load improvement resulting from fiber
   steering reduces by 15\% compared to the laminates where gaps are
   ignored. A maximum improvement of 71\% in the buckling load over the
   quasi-isotropic laminates can be observed for a variable stiffness
   laminate built with a complete overlap strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   samples was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy. The ARBF process induced formation of a strong
   preferred orientation along the beta-fiber and also to the pronounced
   copper texture component. In the aluminum side, occurrence of dynamic
   recovery reduced the intensity of the beta-fiber rolling texture due to
   change in dislocation structure and decrease in the degree of strain
   hardening. On the other hand, occurrence of discontinuous dynamic
   recrystallization at the third and fourth ARBF cycles led to decreasing
   the intensity of fibers and texture components in the copper side. The
   average grain sizes of the final sample for the copper and aluminum
   sides were similar to 50 and similar to 200 nm, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Since the structure of a material is a key factor influencing the
   extraction efficiency, any means to modify the structure to enhance
   extraction is attractive. As limited information is available on the
   effect of sample pretreatment prior to extraction on the extractability
   of a bioactive compound, the effects of selected pretreatment methods,
   i.e., soaking in citric acid, blanching in water as well as in citric
   acid, on the sample structure and subsequent microwave-assisted
   extraction (MAE) were investigated; carrots and beta-carotene (as well
   as carotenoids) were selected as the test material and bioactive
   compound, respectively. A suitable condition to extract beta-carotene in
   terms of the microwave power and extraction time was determined.
   Comparison between MAE and Soxhlet extraction was also made. At the
   optimized condition the contents of beta-carotene and total carotenoids
   extractable from carrots blanched in water (29.74 and 58.04 mg/100 g dry
   basis) and in citric acid (32.08 and 61..62 mg/100 g dry basis) were
   significantly higher than those from the untreated carrots (23.26 and
   51.79 mg/100 g dry basis). The antioxidant activities of the extracts
   obtained from carrots blanched in water and in citric acid were also
   higher than that from carrots with no pretreatment. Comparison between
   MAE and Soxhlet extraction revealed that the extract from MAE contained
   lower amounts of beta-carotene and total carotenoids and exhibited lower
   antioxidant activity; the required MAE time was significantly shorter,
   however. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic simulations based on the CALPHAD method have been carried
   out to assess the phase formation in Al-7Si-(0-1)Ni-0.5Cu-0.35Mg alloys

   conditions. Calculations showed that the T-Al9FeNi, gamma-Al7Cu4Ni,
   delta-Al3CuNi and epsilon-Al3Ni phases are formed at different Ni
   levels. By analyzing the calculated isothermal sections of the phase
   diagrams it was revealed that the Ni:Cu and Ni:Fe ratios control
   precipitation in this alloy system. In order to verify the simulation
   results, microstructural investigations in as-cast, solution treated and
   aged conditions were carried out using electron probe microanalysis
   (EPMA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, cooling curve
   analysis (CCA) was also performed to determine the freezing range of the
   new alloys and porosity formation during solidification. Hardness
   measurements of the overaged samples showed that in this alloy system
   the delta-Al3CuNi phase has a greater influence on the overall strength

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that compression and shear wave elastography are
   sensitive to the mechanical property changes occuring in dying cells
   following chemotherapy, and can hence be used to monitor cancer
   treatment response. A qualitative and quantitative understanding of the
   mechanical changes at the cellular level would allow to better infer how
   these changes affect macroscopic tissue mechanical properties and
   therefore allow the optimization of elastographic techniques (such as
   shear wave elastography) for the monitoring of cancer therapy. We used
   intracellular particle tracking microrheology (PTM) to investigate the
   mechanical property changes of cells exposed to paclitaxol, a mitotic
   inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy. The average elastic and viscous
   moduli of the cytoplasm of treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells were
   calculated for frequency ranges between 0.2 and 100 rad s(-1)
   (corresponding to 0.03 and 15.92 Hz, respectively). A significant
   increase in the complex shear modulus of the cell cytoplasm was detected
   at 12 h post treatment. At 24 h after drug exposure, the elastic and
   viscous moduli increased by a total of 191.3 Pa (>8000x) and 9 Pa
   (similar to 9x), respectively for low frequency shear modulus
   measurements (at 1 rad s(-1)). At higher frequencies (10 rad s(-1)), the
   elastic and viscous moduli increased by 188.5 Pa (similar to 60x) and
   1.7 Pa (similar to 1.1x), respectively. Our work demonstrates that PTM
   can be used to measure changes in the mechanical properties of treated
   cells and that cell elasticity significantly increases by 24 h after

Abstract = {{Electrolyte filtration arises due to the presence of fixed charges in
   cartilage extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Commonly
   assumed negligible, it can be important for design and interpretation of
   streaming potential measurements and modeling assumptions. To quantify
   the scale of this phenomenon, chloride ion concentration in exudate of
   compressed cartilage was measured by Mohr's titration and explant GAG
   content was colorimetrically assayed. Pilot studies indicated that an
   appropriate strain rate for experiments was 8 x 10(-3) s(-1) to
   eliminate concerns of exudate evaporation and explant damage (at low and
   high strain rates, respectively). Exudate chloride concentration of
   explants equilibrated in 1 x PBS was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than
   the bath chloride concentration at strains of 37.5, 50, and 62.5\%, with
   clear dependence on strain magnitude. Exudate chloride concentration was
   also significantly lower than that of the bath when 50\% strain was
   applied after equilibration in 0.5, 1, and 2x PBS, with a trend for an
   increase in this relative difference with decreasing bath concentration
   (p = 0.065 between 0.5 and 2x PBS). Decreasing exudate chloride
   concentration correlated negatively with increasing postcompression GAG
   concentration. No difference between exudate chloride concentration and
   bath chloride concentration was ever observed for compression of
   uncharged agarose gel controls. Findings show that exudate from
   compressed cartilage is dilute relative to the bath due to the presence
   of matrix fixed charges, and this difference can generate diffusion
   potentials external to the explant, which may affect streaming potential
   measurements particularly under conditions of low strain rates and high
   strains.}},

Title = {{Bioinspired model of mechanical energy harvesting based on flexoelectric
   membranes}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{Membrane flexoelectricity is an electromechanical coupling process that
   describes membrane electrical polarization due to bending and membrane
   bending under electric fields. In this paper we propose, formulate, and
   characterize a mechanical energy harvesting system consisting of a
   deformable soft flexoelectric thin membrane subjected to harmonic
   forcing from contacting bulk fluids. The key elements of the energy
   harvester are formulated and characterized, including (i) the
   mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency, (ii) the
   electromechanical shape equation connecting fluid forces with membrane
   curvature and electric displacement, and (iii) the electric power
   generation and efficiency. The energy conversion efficiency is cast as
   the ratio of flexoelectric coupling to the product of electric and
   bending elasticity. The device is described by a second-order curvature
   dynamics coupled to the electric displacement equation and as such
   results in mechanical power absorption with a resonant peak whose
   amplitude decreases with bending viscosity. The electric power
   generation is proportional to the conversion factor and the power
   efficiency decreases with frequency. Under high bending viscosity, the
   power efficiency increases with the conversion factor and under low
   viscosities it decreases with the conversion factor. The theoretical
   results presented contribute to the ongoing experimental efforts to
   develop mechanical energy harvesting from fluid flow energy through
   solid-fluid interactions and electromechanical transduction. DOI:

Abstract = {{We have studied the electrical transport properties of intrinsic InN
   nanowires using an electrical nanoprobing technique in a scanning

   8000-12 000 cm(2)/V s, approaching the theoretically predicted maximum
   electron mobility at room temperature. In addition, charge traps are
   found to distribute exponentially just below the conduction band edge,

Title = {{Effect of nonionic surfactant Brij 35 on the fate and transport of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{125-134}},

Abstract = {{In many parts of the world, river water is used for irrigation. Treated,
   partially treated, and even untreated water from wastewater treatment
   plants is discharged directly into rivers, thereby degrading the quality
   of the water. Consequently, irrigation water may contain surfactants
   which may affect the fate and transport of chemicals such as pesticides
   and antibiotics in agricultural soils. A field lysimeter study was
   undertaken to investigate the effect of the nonionic surfactant, Brij
   35, on the fate and transport of an antibiotic, Oxytetracycline,
   commonly used in cattle farms. Nine PVC lysimeters, 1.0 m long x 0.45 m
   diameter, were packed with a sandy soil to a bulk density of 1.35 Mg
   m(-3). Cattle manure, containing Oxytetracycline, was applied at the
   surface of the lysimeters at the recommended rate of 10 t/ha. Each of
   three aqueous Brij 35 solutions, 0, 0.5 and 5 g L-1 (i.e., `good,'poor'
   and `very poor' quality irrigation water) were each applied to the
   lysimeters in triplicate. Over a 90 day period, soil and leachate
   samples were collected and analyzed. Batch experiment results showed
   that the presence of the nonionic surfactant Brij 35 significantly
   reduced the sorption coefficient of OTC from 23.55 mL g(-1) in the
   aqueous medium to 19.49, 12.49 and 14.53 in the presence of Brij 35 at
   concentrations of 0.25, 2.5 and 5 g L-1, respectively. Lysimeter results
   indicted the significant downward movement of OTC at depths of 60 cm
   into soil profile and leachate in the presence of surfactant. Thus, the
   reuse of wastewater containing surfactants might enhance the mobility of
   contaminants and increase ground water pollution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Gas emissions as influenced by home composting system configuration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{163-171}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Home composting systems (HC) are known to facilitate municipal solid
   waste management, but little is known about their environmental impact
   including their greenhouse gas emissions (GGE). The present research
   focused on selecting HC configuration producing the least CH4 and N2O.
   Thus, 4 HC types were used to compost food and yard waste for 150 days
   and monitored for CO2, CH4 and N2O as of day 15: the wood and plastic
   bins (WB and PB), the mixed and unmixed ground pile (GPM and GP). Using
   the same waste recipe, all HC were filled at once (batch fed) to
   maximize gaseous emissions. Weekly as of day 15, CO2, N2O and CH4
   emissions were measured during 2-h sessions using a closed chamber
   inserted into the compost surface. Monitored compost characteristics
   indicated little differences over time except for moisture content. From
   day 15 to 150, CH4 emissions were not measurable. Generation of N2O
   occurred between day 20 and 120 with PB producing the least because of
   top and bottom slots providing continuous convective aeration, as
   compared to the WB with slats over its full height and the naturally
   aerated mixed and unmixed ground piles. Total N2O emissions of 56 kg
   CO2-eq (tonne wet waste treated)(-1) for PB, 75 for GP, 97 for WB and 99
   for GPM represented average value for centralized composting facilities.
   Present and past scientific works suggest the need for more research to
   establish the combined effect of management and HC configuration on
   gaseous emissions, with close CH4 measurements from day 0 to 15. (C)

Abstract = {{A numerical procedure is proposed in this paper to study the response of
   an inclined beam subjected to sprung mass. The first-order shear

   centrifugal forces induced by the moving sprung mass are considered in
   governing equations. The Newmark time integration method is adopted in
   solving equations. In this paper, the horizontal and vertical
   deformations of the beam, along with the Coriolis force and the inclined
   angle are investigated. The moving system is considered as a one degree
   of freedom system including two masses located at the ends of the moving
   load system, one spring and viscous damping. The effects of spring
   constant and damper ratio on the dynamic magnification factor (DMF) of
   the inclined beam are also studied. The results obtained from the
   present study show that the Coriolis force in lower speed has
   significant influence on the dynamic response of the beam.}},

Abstract = {{Stainless steel 316L mixed with cobalt chromium alloy L605 powders has
   been cold sprayed onto mild steel substrate. As spraying Co-Cr alone is
   difficult, three different proportions (by volume of Co-Cr, 25\%, 33.3\%
   and 50\%) were used in this study. Analysis and characterization of
   sprayed depositions were performed through scanning electron microscopy,
   electron backscatter diffraction, microhardness, and tensile tests at
   room temperature. The porosity of the coating was low for both the 25\%
   and 33.3\% coating (about 0.9-1.5\%). However, the 50\% coating had a
   much poorer deposition rate leading to a much thinner coating using the
   same coating parameters: the porosity was much higher (about 4.5\%). The
   ductility of the annealed 25\% and 33.3\% specimens reached
   approximately 20\% and 18\% respectively after annealing, but the 50\%
   specimen was too thin to be tested. The corrosion behavior was evaluated
   using potentiodynamic polarization tests carried at Hank's solution as
   an electrolyte. It was found that corrosion resistances of the
   metal-metal mixture were higher than that of pure stainless steel. (C)

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle transport in porous materials, including nanoparticle gel
   electrophoresis, hinges on knowledge of the hydrodynamic drag
   coefficient. Here, we compute the drag force on a soft core-shell sphere
   translating in a porous medium from a continuum hydrodynamic model in
   which slow viscous flow in the soft shell and embedding porous medium
   are modelled using Brinkman's equations. This model unifies the Brinkman
   force for bare spheres in porous media and the drag force of Masliyah et
   al. (1987) for soft core-shell spheres in pure viscous fluids. We
   compare the drag force with the Brinkman force evaluated using the
   composite sphere hydrodynamic radius, showing that this convenient
   approximation is reasonable when the Brinkman screening length of the
   embedding porous medium is large compared to the core radius; otherwise,
   the Brinkman force can significantly underestimate the force. (C) 2012

   grains were gradually subdivided into ultrafine ones by mechanical
   twinning. Twin formation effectively suppressed the development of sharp
   texture and in this way enabled severe plastic deformation to take place
   at ambient temperature. Simple ageing of the MDFed sample lowered the
   strength. However, a combined process of ageing and MDFing increased the
   hardness and yield stress while it slightly decreased ductility. Good
   mechanical properties of 500 MPa yield stress, 540 MPa ultimate tensile

Title = {{MEG Source Localization of Spatially Extended Generators of Epileptic
   Activity: Comparing Entropic and Hierarchical Bayesian Approaches}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Localizing the generators of epileptic activity in the brain using
   Electro-EncephaloGraphy (EEG) or Magneto-EncephaloGraphy (MEG) signals
   is of particular interest during the pre-surgical investigation of
   epilepsy. Epileptic discharges can be detectable from background brain
   activity, provided they are associated with spatially extended
   generators. Using realistic simulations of epileptic activity, this
   study evaluates the ability of distributed source localization methods
   to accurately estimate the location of the generators and their
   sensitivity to the spatial extent of such generators when using MEG
   data. Source localization methods based on two types of realistic models
   have been investigated: (i) brain activity may be modeled using cortical
   parcels and (ii) brain activity is assumed to be locally smooth within
   each parcel. A Data Driven Parcellization (DDP) method was used to
   segment the cortical surface into non-overlapping parcels and
   diffusion-based spatial priors were used to model local spatial
   smoothness within parcels. These models were implemented within the
   Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM) and the Hierarchical Bayesian (HB)
   source localization frameworks. We proposed new methods in this context
   and compared them with other standard ones using Monte Carlo simulations
   of realistic MEG data involving sources of several spatial extents and
   depths. Detection accuracy of each method was quantified using Receiver
   Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and localization error metrics.
   Our results showed that methods implemented within the MEM framework
   were sensitive to all spatial extents of the sources ranging from 3
   cm(2) to 30 cm(2), whatever were the number and size of the parcels
   defining the model. To reach a similar level of accuracy within the HB
   framework, a model using parcels larger than the size of the sources
   should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, nitroxide-mediated controlled copolymerization (NMP) of
   methyl methacrylate (MMA) using BlocBuilder unimolecular initiator was
   found to require much less controlling comonomer when using
   9-(4-vinylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole (VBK) compared to styrene (S) as a
   comonomer (minimum similar to 1 mol \% VBK versus 4.4 mol \% S). Here,
   we explored why this was the case. Initially, the use of
   dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent in the copolymerization of MMA/S was
   studied as the MMA/VBK copolymerizations were done in DMF. The results
   confirmed that the increased effectiveness of VBK as a controlling
   comonomer was not due to the solvent or other experimental conditions.
   Second, the propagation rate constant k(P,VBK) and various <
   k(P)>(MMA/VBK) for MMA/VBK copolymerizations were determined using
   pulsed laser polymerization-size exclusion chromatography (PLP-SEC), and
   the dissociation rate constants k(d,VBK) for the VBK-BlocBuilder adduct
   and PVBK chains were determined using electron paramagnetic resonance
   (EPR) spectroscopy, showing that k(d) for VBK was very similar to S and
   < k(P)>(MMA/VBK) was very similar to k(P,MMA). Finally, modeling of the
   system using PREDICI was done and illustrated that the difference in
   reactivity ratios between MMA/S and MMA/VBK was ultimately one of the
   major reasons for the increased control of VBK versus S. This study
   showed that propagation rate of the copolymerization and equilibrium
   constant for the dormant/active species are not the only parameters that
   govern controlled NMP, and the effect of reactivity ratios between the
   methacrylate and the controlling comonomer must also be considered for
   the controlled nitroxide-mediated copolymerization of methacrylate-rich
   mixtures.}},

   response of particle-based STFs is investigated and the effects of fluid
   density and particle strength on ballistic performance are isolated. It
   is shown that the loss of ballistic resistance in the STFs at higher

Abstract = {{An efficient finitediscrete element method applicable for the analysis
   of quasi-static nonlinear soilstructure interaction problems involving
   large deformations in three-dimensional space was presented in this
   paper. The present method differs from previous approaches in that the
   use of very fine mesh and small time steps was not needed to stabilize
   the calculation. The domain involving the large displacement was modeled
   using discrete elements, whereas the rest of the domain was modeled
   using finite elements. Forces acting on the discrete and finite elements
   were related by introducing interface elements at the boundary of the
   two domains. To improve the stability of the developed method, we used
   explicit time integration with different damping schemes applied to each
   domain to relax the system and to reach stability condition. With
   appropriate damping schemes, a relatively coarse finite element mesh can
   be used, resulting in significant savings in the computation time. The
   proposed algorithm was validated using three different benchmark
   problems, and the numerical results were compared with existing
   analytical and numerical solutions. The algorithm performance in solving
   practical soilstructure interaction problems was also investigated by
   simulating a large-scale soft ground tunneling problem involving soil
   loss near an existing lining. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {{An improved failure criterion for biological and engineered staggered
   composites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{High-performance biological materials such as nacre, spider silk or bone
   have evolved a staggered microstructure consisting of stiff and strong
   elongated inclusions aligned with the direction of loading. This
   structure leads to useful combinations of stiffness, strength and
   toughness, and it is therefore increasingly mimicked in bio-inspired
   composites. The performance of staggered composites can be tuned; for
   example, their mechanical properties increase when the overlap between
   the inclusions is increased. However, larger overlaps may lead to
   excessive tensile stress and fracture of the inclusions themselves, a
   highly detrimental failure mode. Fracture of the inclusions has so far
   only been predicted using highly simplified models, which hinder our
   ability to properly design and optimize engineered staggered composites.
   In this work, we develop a new failure criterion that takes into account
   the complex stress field within the inclusions as well as initial
   defects. The model leads to an `optimum criterion' for cases where the
   shear tractions on the inclusions is uniform, and a `conservative'
   criterion for which the tractions are modelled as point forces at the
   ends of the overlap regions. The criterion can therefore be applied for
   a wide array of material behaviour at the interface, even if the details
   of the shear load transfer is not known. The new criterion is validated
   with experiments on staggered structures made of millimetre-thick
   alumina tablets, and by comparison with data on nacre. Formulated in a
   non-dimensional form, our new criterion can be applied on a wide variety
   of engineered staggered composites at any length scale. It also reveals
   new design guidelines, for example high aspect ratio inclusions with
   weak interfaces are preferable over inclusions with low aspect ratio and
   stronger interfaces. Together with existing models, this new criterion
   will lead to optimal designs that harness the full potential of
   bio-inspired staggered composites.}},

Title = {{Surface Transformations of Bioglass 4555 during Scaffold Synthesis for

Abstract = {{In physiological fluid, a layer of hydroxycarbonate apatite, similar to
   bone mineral, develops on the surface of Bioglass 45S5. Collagen from
   the surrounding tissue is adsorbed on this layer that attracts
   osteoblasts, and favors bone regrowth. Bioglass is therefore an
   osteoinductive material. Still, due to its brittleness, the glass alone
   cannot be used to heal large bone defects. To overcome this issue,
   Bioglass is used to form a composite scaffold with poly(D,L-lactide)
   (PDLLA), a biodegradable polymer. The goal of this work is to understand
   Bioglass reactivity throughout scaffold fabrication via a
   low-temperature route, the solvent casting and particulate leaching
   technique. Changes in Bioglass (especially its surface) are susceptible
   to occur both while in contact with the processing fluids and
   potentially through a reaction with the surrounding polymeric matrix.
   Here we analyzed the surface changes of three different Bioglass
   samples: (i) as-received, (ii) treated in solutions that parallel those
   used in scaffold fabrication, and (iii) extracted from the scaffolds. We
   showed that extracted, just like treated, Bioglass deviates from the
   as-received, but to a larger extent. X-ray photoelectron and infrared
   spectroscopy support the theory that Bioglass surface was modified not
   just through contact with the solutions in scaffold fabrication, but
   upon an interaction with the polymeric matrix. The polymer network slows
   down the Na+/H+ exchange between Bioglass and water used to leach salt
   particles to create pores within the scaffold. Changes in surface
   properties affect the bioactivity of Bioglass and thus of the composite
   scaffolds, and are therefore critical to identify.}},

Abstract = {{Even though erythrocytes transport both oxygen and carbon dioxide,
   research on blood substitutes has concentrated on the transport of
   oxygen and its vasoactivity and oxidative effects. Recent study in a
   hemorrhagic shock animal model shows that the degree of tissue PCO2
   elevation is directly related to mortality rates. We therefore prepared
   a novel nanobiotechnological carrier for both O-2 and CO2 with enhanced
   antioxidant properties. This is based on the use of glutaraldehyde to
   crosslink stroma free hemoglobin (SFHb), superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   catalase (CAT) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) to form a soluble
   PolySFHb-SOD-CAT-CA. It was compared to blood and different
   resuscitation fluids on the ability to lower elevated tissue PCO2 in a
   2/3 blood volume loss rat hemorrhagic shock model. Sixty minutes of
   sustained hemorrhagic shock at 30 mm Hg resulted in the increase of
   tissue PCO2 to 95 mm +/- 3 mmHg from the control level of 55 mm Hg.
   Reinfusion of whole blood (Hb 15 g/dL with its RBC enzymes) lowered the
   tissue PCO2 to 72 +/- 4.5 mmHg 60 minutes after reinfusion.
   PolySFHb-SOD-CAT-CA (SFHb 10 g/dL plus additional enzymes) was more
   effective than whole blood in lowering PCO2 lowering this to 66.2 +/-
   3.5 mmHg. Ringer's Lactated solution or polyhemoglobin lowered the
   elevated PCO2 only slightly to 87 +/- 4.5 mmHg and 84.8 +/- 1.5 mmHg,
   respectively. Moreover, ST-elevation for whole blood (Hb 15 g/dL) and
   PolySFHb-SOD-CAT-CA (Hb 10 g/dL) was respectively 12.8\% +/- 4\% and
   13.0\% +/- 2\% of the control 60 minutes after reinfusion. Both are
   significantly better than those in the Ringer's lactated group and the
   PolyHb group. In conclusion, this novel approach for blood substitute
   design has resulted in a novel nanobiotechnological carrier for both O-2
   and CO2 with enhanced antioxidant properties.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Birch wood was pretreated with N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO or NMO)
   followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to ethanol or
   digestion to biogas. The pretreatments were carried out with NMMO
   (w(NMMO) = 85\%) at 130 degrees C for 3 h, and the effects of drying
   after the pretreatment were investigated. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the
   untreated wood resulted in 8\%-10\% of theoretical glucose yield after 4
   days hydrolysis, while the NMMO pretreatment improved this yield to
   91\%. Consequently, ethanol production yield from NMMO-pretreated
   materials resulted in around 9-fold improvement compared to the
   untreated wood. On the other hand, drying of the pretreated wood had a
   negative impact and decreased the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis by
   4\%-10\%. Digestion of the untreated wood with thermophilic bacteria
   resulted in maximum methane yield of 158 cm(3) g(-1) of VS in 30 days,
   while the NMMO pretreatment improved the methane yield up to 232 cm(3)
   g(-1) of VS (80\% of the theoretical biogas yield) in just 9 days. (C)

   proposes a simpler initialization procedure for Newton's method. It is
   shown that as the size of the MIMO system increases, it becomes more
   tolerant to errors in the unconstrained solution for SD, and hence it
   requires a smaller number of Newton iterations. For a 16 x 16 MIMO
   system with QPSK or 16-QAM we show that 7 iterations are sufficient to
   ensure lossless SD performance. With only 4 iterations, a QPSK 32 x 32
   MIMO system exhibits less than 0.1 dB performance loss relatively to SD

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In full-duplex communication systems with discrete multi-tone (DMT)
   modulation, echo cancellers are employed to cancel echo by means of
   adaptive filters. Generally, the structure present in the DMT signals is
   used to decrease the computational complexity of these cancellers by
   splitting the operations between the time and frequency domains. In this
   work, we introduce a general framework for designing echo cancellers for
   such systems in an arbitrary mixed domain. This is achieved by
   introducing a generic decomposition of the Toeplitz data matrix at the
   transmitter in terms of arbitrary unitary matrices. Then, based on this
   decomposition, a new mixed-domain echo cancellation structure is
   derived, which performs an exact instantaneous gradient-type adaptation.
   This mixed-domain configuration is also extended for realizing
   constrained adaptation whereby linear constraints are used to ensure the
   proper mapping of the weight vectors in different domains. The proposed
   structures offer a unified framework to study existing cancellers and to
   design new ones with better performance measures. This framework is
   employed to propose a new canceller based on discrete trigonometric
   transformations. The analytical and numerical results presented show
   that this canceller has a faster convergence rate than the existing ones
   with similar complexity and is more robust.}},

Title = {{High pressure miscibility predictions of polyethylene in hexane
   solutions based on molecular dynamics}},

Abstract = {{Models that describe miscibility of polyethylene in hydrocarbon solvents
   at high pressures are of on-going interest in fundamental polymer
   physics and applied polymer processing. The present study aims to
   characterize the pressure dependence of the solubility of polyethylene
   (PE) in hexane using an atomistic-level simulation technique to avoid
   the need for expensive and difficult to obtain experimental data. To
   achieve this, isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics (NPT-MD)
   simulations based upon a well-established force field (OPLS-AA) are
   utilized to predict the pressure dependence of Hildebrand's solubility
   parameter of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and hexane at high
   pressure. The NPT simulations also capture molar volume data computed at
   high temperature (425 K) and high pressures ranging from 100 to 3000
   bar. Further, internal pressures are estimated at high pressures and it
   is shown that for PE internal pressure is not identical to cohesive
   energy density (CED). However for PE the ratio of these two quantities
   tends to unity with increasing pressure. Subsequently, the Flory-Huggins
   binary interaction parameter is predicted from the knowledge of pressure
   dependence of solubility parameters and molar volumes. It is
   demonstrated that the computed binary interaction parameter decreases
   upon increasing the pressure indicating that the miscibility of the
   PE/hexane system improves by raising the pressure. This conclusion is in
   agreement with the solution polymerization process for producing PE
   where pressure-induced phase separation (PIPS) is applied to separate
   the polymer product from the polyolefin solution. Exclusion of
   electrostatic potentials in the molecular mechanics model results in
   larger interaction parameters while the monotonically decreasing trend
   remains intact in both molecular mechanics models with and without
   electrostatic forces. In addition, it has been found that there is a
   pressure limit beyond which the binary interaction parameter
   demonstrates less sensitivity to pressure indicating that PE miscibility
   is not further affected by pressure changes. Based upon the pressure
   dependence of the interaction parameter the negative contribution of
   volume change on mixing is predicted where the change in volume upon
   mixing decays with increasing pressure. Moreover, it is shown that the
   increase in system pressure increases the chemical potential factor of
   the phase stability condition indicating that at higher pressures this
   term tends to stabilize the polymer-solvent system. It has also been
   revealed that the chemical potential factor estimated by the molecular
   mechanics model, incorporating the atomic partial charges, is
   qualitatively more consistent with the miscibility predictions from
   phase diagrams. The presented results contribute to the fundamental
   understanding of PIPS, an important demixing process poorly understood
   when compared to thermally-induced phase separation. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the dynamic electrical response of a charged or

   also be used for nano-positioning, or for studying the rheology and
   physiochemical characteristics of hydrogels. Here, the gel is modelled
   as a continuum composite comprising a porous, charged, elastic skeleton
   saturated by an aqueous electrolyte. Electrostatics satisfy the
   Debye-Huckel approximation, with zero-slip boundary conditions between
   the skeleton, solvent, and walls. For large channel gaps, the steady
   electric-field-induced displacement of the top plate is proportional to
   the difference between the top- and bottom-wall zeta-potentials. Under
   oscillatory electrical stimulation, resonant peaks, with amplitudes from
   picometers to micrometers, reflect hydrogel elasticity and charge
   density. Such displacements are within the detection range of modern

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Magnesium is an attractive material for use in biodegradable implants
   due to its low density, non-toxicity and mechanical properties similar
   to those of human tissue such as bone. Its biocompatibility makes it
   amenable for use in a wide range of applications from bone to
   cardiovascular implants. Here we investigated the corrosion rate in
   simulated body fluid (SBF) of a series of Mg-Sr alloys, with Sr in the
   range of 0.3-2.5\%, and found that the Mg-0.5 Sr alloy showed the
   slowest corrosion rate. The degradation rate from this alloy indicated
   that the daily Sr intake from a typical stent would be 0.01-0.02 mg
   day(-1), which is well below the maximum daily Sr intake levels of 4 mg
   day(-1). Indirect cytotoxicity assays using human umbilical vascular
   endothelial cells indicated that Mg-0.5 Sr extraction medium did not
   cause any toxicity or detrimental effect on the viability of the cells.
   Finally, a tubular Mg-0.5 Sr stent sample, along with a WE43 control
   stent, was implanted into the right and left dog femoral artery. No
   thrombosis effect was observed in the Mg-0.5 Sr stent after 3 weeks of
   implantation while the WE43 stent thrombosed. X-ray diffraction
   demonstrated the formation of hydroxyapatite and Mg(OH)(2) as a result
   of the degradation of Mg-0.5 Sr alloy after 3 days in SBF. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy further showed the possibility of the
   formation of a hydroxyapatite Sr-substituted layer that presents as a
   thin layer at the interface between the Mg-0.5 Sr alloy and the
   corrosion products. We believe that this interfacial layer stabilizes
   the surface of the Mg-0.5 Sr alloy, and slows down its degradation rate
   over time. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The nonlinear forced vibrations of a microbeam are investigated in this
   paper, employing the strain gradient elasticity theory. The
   geometrically nonlinear equation of motion of the microbeam, taking into
   account the size effect, is obtained employing a variational approach.
   Specifically, Hamilton's principle is used to derive the nonlinear
   partial differential equation governing the motion of the system which
   is then discretized into a set of second-order nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations (ODEs) by means of the Galerkin technique. A
   change of variables is then introduced to this set of second-order ODEs,
   and a new set of ODEs is obtained consisting of first-order nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations. This new set is solved numerically
   employing the pseudo-arclength continuation technique which results in
   the frequency-response curves of the system. The advantage of this
   method lies in its capability of continuing both stable and unstable

   Can. J. Soil Sci. 93: 45-57. The soil microbial community controls all
   biological processes in soils and is considered a good indicator of
   general soil health. Assessment of the microbial community in
   intensively cropped soils that are under reduced tillage management is
   especially important because the microbes are the primary decomposers of
   the high residue input in such systems. We investigated the microbial
   biomass and diversity of bacteria and archaea in a sandy-loam Dystric
   Gleysol from a long-term (15 yr) corn (Zea mays L.) agroecosystem in
   Quebec, Canada, under conventional (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no
   tillage (NT) and two residue inputs (high level: + R and low level: -
   R). Analysis included microbial biomass C and N (MBC, MBN), catalyzed
   reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and
   5-(4, 6-dichlorotriazinyl) amino fluorescein hydrochloride (DTAF) cell
   counts, 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and an archaeal clone library. The PCR-DGGE
   analysis identified Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes as
   dominant groups in all tillage and residue management treatments. The
   archaeal group was diverse, with most individuals identified as
   belonging to the Crenarchaeota phylum. We also detected soil archaea
   belonging to the newly proposed phylum Thaumarchaeota, the
   chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaeota, in a corn
   agroecosystem in Quebec, Canada. Microbial biomass increased in the + R
   treatment according to MBC concentration and direct cell counts.
   Considering results from the CARD-FISH counts (bacterial and archaeal
   cell counts without fungal cells) and from MBC results (all microbial
   biomass including fungi) we concluded the likelihood of greater fungal
   biomass in the NT plots.}},

Abstract = {{Tow impregnation as a function of material out-time was investigated for
   an out-of-autoclave carbon fiber-epoxy prepreg. Prepreg was aged at
   ambient temperature for 56 days. Every 7 days, laminates were laid up
   and cured using vacuum bag only processing. Void content was calculated
   through image analysis of polished sections. Experimental results were
   used to validate an analytical model for tow impregnation. Model
   predictions were based on flow kinetics during processing conditions,
   taking into account increasing degree of cure and evolution of resin
   viscosity as a function of ambient aging time. The study found that no
   significant tow porosity occurred within the material's stated out-life,
   that tow porosity increased once this out-life was exceeded and
   eventually stabilized due to the room-temperature vitrification of the
   resin. The model's predicted trends were consistent with experimental
   results, suggesting that an increase in resin viscosity is indeed the
   main cause of out-time induced tow porosity and providing a means of
   predicting laminate quality as a function of room temperature aging
   time. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a frequency-translating bandpass Delta Sigma
   modulator that uses single-path mixing within the Delta Sigma feedback
   loop to downconvert a 4-MHz signal band from IF1 = 225 MHz at the input
   to IF2 = 25 MHz at the output. The proposed Delta Sigma modulator is
   designed with a sixth-order continuous-time loop filter and a 3-bit
   quantizer. The quantizer operates at a sampling frequency of 100 MHz,
   which is lower than IF1 and, therefore, reduces both the power
   consumption and the sensitivity to timing errors relative to a
   conventional bandpass Delta Sigma modulator. Furthermore, the loop
   filter implements noise shaping primarily at IF2, which reduces the
   sensitivity to coefficient variations. The prototype chip was fabricated
   in 65-nm CMOS with an active area of 0.55 mm(2). It achieves an SNDR of
   55 dB over a 4-MHz signal bandwidth, and consumes 13 mW from a 1-V power
   supply.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synthesized by direct thermal chemical vapor
   deposition growth from stainless steel mesh are surface functionalized
   via an Ar/O2/C2H6 capacitively coupled RF plasma discharge. The open and
   rigid network of CNTs allows for a high degree of the CNT surface to be
   treated. As a result, the aqueous nanofluids that are produced by
   removing the CNTs from the substrate are found to remain stable for
   extended periods of time (greater than six months). X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy analysis revealed that oxygen comprised approximately
   21at.\% of the functionalized CNT surface. Poly(vinyl alcohol)/CNT
   nanocomposites produced using the plasma functionalized CNTs are
   homogenous with excellent dispersion of the CNTs. Mechanically, the
   0.75wt.-\% functionalized-CNT nanocomposite show 54 and 60\% increases
   in tensile strength and modulus, respectively, over the neat polymer.
   Little to no change is seen in the degree of crystallinity or the glass
   transition and melting point temperatures of the nanocomposites.
   Finally, water content is found to have a significant effect on the
   polymer and composite's tensile properties.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional open pit mine optimization models for designing mining
   phases and ultimate pit limit do not consider expected variations and
   uncertainty in metal content available in a mineral deposit (supply) and
   commodity prices (market demand). Unlike the conventional approach, a
   stochastic framework relies on multiple realizations of the input data
   so as to account for uncertainty in metal content and financial
   parameters, reflecting potential supply and demand. This paper presents
   a new method that jointly considers uncertainty in metal content and
   commodity prices, and incorporates time-dependent discounted values of
   mining blocks when designing optimal production phases and ultimate pit
   limit, while honouring production capacity constraints. The structure of
   a graph representing the stochastic framework is proposed, and it is
   solved with a parametric maximum flow algorithm. Lagragnian relaxation
   and the subgradient method are integrated in the proposed approach to
   facilitate producing practical designs. An application at a copper
   deposit in Canada demonstrates the practical aspects of the approach and
   quality of solutions over conventional methods, as well as the
   effectiveness of the proposed stochastic approach in solving mine
   planning and design problems. Journal of the Operational Research

Abstract = {{Effluents discharged from wastewater treatment plants are possible
   sources of pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, in the
   freshwater environment, and determining the possible selection of
   pathogens is important. This study evaluated the impact of activated
   sludge and physicochemical wastewater treatment processes on the
   prevalence of potentially virulent E. coli. A total of 719 E. coli
   isolates collected from four municipal plants in Quebec before and after
   treatment were characterized by using a customized DNA microarray to
   determine the impact of treatment processes on the frequency of specific
   pathotypes and virulence genes. The percentages of potentially
   pathogenic E. coli isolates in the plant influents varied between 26 and
   51\%, and in the effluents, the percentages were 14 to 31\%, for a
   reduction observed at all plants ranging between 14 and 45\%. Pathotypes
   associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) were the most
   abundant at three of the four plants and represented 24\% of all
   isolates, while intestinal pathogenic E. coli pathotypes (IPEC)
   represented 10\% of the isolates. At the plant where ExPEC isolates were
   not the most abundant, a large number of isolates were classified as
   both ExPEC and IPEC; overall, 6\% of the isolates were classified in
   both groups, with the majority being from the same plant. The reduction
   of the proportion of pathogenic E. coli could not be explained by the
   preferential loss of one virulence gene or one type of virulence factor;
   however, the quinolone resistance gene (qnrS) appears to enhance the
   loss of virulence genes, suggesting a mechanism involving the loss of
   pathogenicity islands.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{75-81}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the optimization of the ply angles and the
   internal geometry of a composite helicopter blade with a D-spar internal
   construction. The design involves the simultaneous optimization of
   several conflicting objectives such as: attaining three stiffness
   parameters, minimizing the blade mass and the distance between the
   mass-center and the aerodynamic-center. Optimization methods with a
   priori and a posteriori articulation of preferences are used to solve
   the problem. Among the a priori approaches, the min-max approach is used
   to transform multiple objective functions into a single criterion which
   is optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Alternatively, the
   design problem is tackled using a posteriori approach by using our
   in-house Non-dominated Sorting Hybrid Algorithm (NSHA). The results
   obtained with NSHA demonstrate trade-off designs which could not be
   captured with the min-max approach. The multi-objective approach allows
   identifying a window of 10\% adjustment in mass and 20\% adjustment in
   the distance between the mass center and the aerodynamic center with no
   significant deviation from the target stiffness vector. Furthermore, we
   have observed that the target stiffness vector can be attained more
   easily if the internal geometry, besides the ply angles, is considered
   as a design variable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Geometrically nonlinear forced vibrations of thick, deep laminated
   circular cylindrical panels are studied via multi-modal energy approach
   based on Lagrange equations. It is assumed that the panel is subjected
   to a steady harmonic concentrated force acting in the radial direction.
   Simply supported movable boundary conditions are considered and the
   energy functional is reduced to a system of nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations with cubic and quadratic nonlinear terms using
   admissible eigenfunctions. A code based on pseudo arc-length
   continuation and collocation method is used to carry out a bifurcation
   analysis and obtain numerical solutions. Several internal resonances are
   detected. Direct time integration of the equations of motion has also
   been performed to obtain the bifurcation diagrams and Poincare maps. It
   is shown that the panel exhibits complex nonlinear dynamics including
   quasi-periodic, intermittency and chaos in the vicinity of internal
   resonances. Moreover, it is illustrated that the choice of Amabili-Reddy
   higher-order shear deformation theory could be recommended for studying
   deep and thick panels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   effects were observed using W top electrode (TE) instead of Pt, which
   can be attributed to the oxygen barrier layer derived from a self-formed
   WOx layer between the W TE and the Nb2O5-x oxide film. The niobium

Abstract = {{The purpose of this contribution is to introduce a method for
   constructing temporally adaptive, sparse, accurate, efficient and
   reliable representations of large scale, discretely sampled transient
   space-time electromagnetic wave fields, through the use of sparse
   wavelet approximations. The temporally adaptive sparse wavelet
   approximations are achieved by performing a three step computational
   process during a time domain electromagnetic simulation. The
   computational process consists of a forward Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT)
   step, an adaptive wavelet coefficient truncation step, and an inverse
   FWT step. The sparse approximation of a space-time electromagnetic wave
   field results in retaining wavelet coefficients with the largest
   magnitudes, localized in regions of the solution domain with high
   electromagnetic energy density concentrations. Numerical results that
   demonstrate the applicability and versatility of the approach are
   provided. Rigorous error analyses are also provided to demonstrate the
   accuracy of the method.}},

Abstract = {{A novel hybrid titania paste comprising aqueous-synthesized anatase (A)
   nanocrystalites and submicrometer-sized ``sea urchin{''}-like rutile (R)
   particles that enables the construction of thin (5-6 mu m) single-layer
   photoanodes with competitive power conversion efficiency is described.
   Owing to the high surface area of the dye (N719)-coated anatase film,
   the scattering properties of the unique rutile particulates, and the
   incorporation of P25 particles, the constructed bifunctional electrode
   films exhibit excellent electron transport properties (long electron
   lifetime) and no electrolyte diffusion resistance. Dye-sensitized solar
   cell devices built with the thin (5-6 mu m) hybrid electrodes showed
   greatly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE), namely 7.04\%, when
   compared to devices based on single anatase (4.20\%), double-layer (A +
   R), or double thickness commercial benchmark paste (6.74\%). This is an
   impressive result as less than 1/2 material was used in a single printed
   layer. Thinner films as the ones built here may prove particularly
   advantageous in using new noniodide electrolytes associated with slow

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of the elastic-plastic nature of shock
   wave propagation in foams was undertaken. The study involved
   experimental blast wave and shock tube loading of three foams, two
   polyurethane open-cell foams and a low-density polyethylene closed-cell
   foam. Evidence of precursor waves was observed in all three foam samples
   under various compressive wave loadings. Experiments with an impermeable
   membrane are used to determine if the precursor wave in an open-cell
   foam is a result of gas filtration or an elastic response of the foam.
   The differences between quasi-static and shock compression of foams is
   discussed in terms of their compressive strain histories and the
   implications for the energy absorption capacity of foam in both loading
   scenarios. Through a comparison of shock tube and blast wave loading
   techniques, suggestions are made concerning the accurate measurements of
   the principal shock Hugoniot in foams.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal use of scarce water resources is the prime objective for water

   Optimal releases have been generally expressed as a function of

   released as a function of available information. Optimal releases were
   obtained by using optimal control theory with inflow series and revised

   were developed as a function of demand, water level and inflow.
   Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with back propagation algorithm, Fuzzy
   Logic and decision tree algorithms such as M5 and REPTree were used for
   deriving the operating rules using the optimal releases for an
   irrigation and power supply reservoir, located in northern India. It was

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks are becoming a standard of
   modern anesthesia. We developed a robotic system, Magellan, to perform
   nerve blocks using a remote control center.
   METHODS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in this pilot study. The
   Magellan system consists of 3 main components: a joystick, a robotic
   arm, and a software control system. The joystick allows simulation of
   wrist or arm movements of the proceduralist. After localization of the
   sciatic nerve, 35 mL of bupivacaine 0.25\% was injected. The success
   rate of sciatic nerve blocks and block performance times (performance
   time = interval of time from the start of the ultrasound search for the
   :nerve to the end of the injection of the drug; robotic time = interval
   of time from the identification of the nerve to the end of the injection
   of the drug) were determined. Data are presented as median (25th, 75th;
   minimal, maximal) and categorical data.
   RESULTS: Eight men and 5 women aged 34 years were included in this
   study. Nerve blocks were successful in all patients. A successful
   attempt was defined as the introduction of the needle into the nerve
   sheath; motor or sensory block was not used to determine the success
   rate. The nerve performance time was 189 seconds (150, 233; 90, 305),
   whereas the robotic time was 164 seconds (121, 210; 73, 271).
   CONCLUSIONS: We present the first human testing of a robotic
   ultrasound-guided nerve block system. The success rate was 100\%. The
   total performance time was approximately 3 minutes to 4 minutes. (Anesth

Abstract = {{We study a fluid-flow regularization based on the Leray-alpha model that
   uses deconvolution in the nonlinear term and dissipation scale modeling
   in the viscous term. In particular, we establish that this `Leray-alpha
   beta-deconvolution model has an energy cascade with an enhanced energy
   dissipation that enlarges the microscale of the model relative to the
   Kolmogorov microscale, but captures more of the small scales than does
   the Leray-alpha model. These theoretical results are confirmed via
   numerically determined energy spectra. We also propose and analyze an
   efficient finite-element algorithm method for the proposed model. In
   addition to establishing stability of the method, the essential
   ingredient for any numerical study, we demonstrate convergence to a
   Navier-Stokes solution. A numerical experiment for the two-dimensional
   flow around an obstacle is also discussed. Results show that enhancing
   the Leray-a model with deconvolution and dissipation scale modeling can
   significantly increase accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The presence of the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)
   in the environment is of increasing concern due to the endocrine
   disruption of aquatic organisms. Incomplete removal from wastewater (WW)
   is one of the main sources of EE2 in aquatic ecosystems, thus improving
   processes like biological WW treatment/activated sludge (AS) is becoming
   significantly important. There are opposing results regarding EE2
   biodegradability by AS; one discrepancy is the efficacy of heterotrophic
   bacteria. This research demonstrated the ability of heterotrophs
   commonly present in AS (B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, R. equi,
   R. erythropolis, R. rhodochrous, R. zopfii) to remove EE2. R.
   rhodochrous was the most successful with no detectable EE2 after 48 h;
   the other bacteria achieved 21\%-61\% EE2 removal. No additive or
   synergistic effects were observed due to the combination of the
   bacterial cultures with maximum EE2 removals of 43\% after 300 h. (C)

Abstract = {{This Technical Note considers a decentralized quantity allocation
   problem over networks. By employing the so-called UQ-PSP auction
   algorithm, distributed auctions on a two-level network are developed so
   as to achieve efficient resource allocations (in the sense of
   maximization of social welfare). In the formulation in this Technical
   Note, each vertex in the connected higher-level network is regarded as a
   supplier for a uniquely associated lower-level network, and each
   lower-level network consists of a set of agents which represent buyers.
   Each lower-level network with its associated supplier is assumed to
   constitute a local UQ-PSP auction, generically denoted by A(t). The
   adjustment of the quantities supplied to any A(t) is via a
   consensus-based dynamical system which exchanges quantities depending
   upon the limit prices of the recursive bidding processes of the local
   auctions in the neighborhood of A(t) in the higher-level network. Such a
   consensus auction system is formulated as a
   discrete-timeweighted-average consensus problem with an associated
   family of time-varying and asymmetric Perron matrices. Subject to
   continuous-valued pricing, the corresponding dynamical system converges
   to a global limit price which is independent of the initial data and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{126-136}},

Abstract = {{A numerical method based on asymptotic homogenization theory is
   presented for the design of lattice materials against fatigue failure.
   The method is applied to study the effect of unit cell shape on the
   fatigue strength of hexagonal and square lattices. Cell shapes with
   regular and optimized geometry are examined. A unit cell is considered
   to possess a regular shape if the geometric primitives defining its
   inner boundaries are joined with an arc fillet, whose radius is 1\% of
   the cell length. An optimized cell shape, on the other hand, is obtained
   by minimizing the curvature of its interior borders, which are conceived
   as continuous in curvature to smooth stress localization.
   For a given multi-axial cyclic loading, failure surfaces of metallic
   hexagonal and square lattices are provided along with their modified
   Goodman diagrams to assess the effect of mean and alternating stresses
   on the fatigue strength. In good agreement with the experimental data
   available in literature, the numerical results show that the shape of
   the unit cell has a major impact on the fatigue performance of the
   lattice material. For example under fully reversible tension, the
   fatigue strength of optimized square lattices of 10\% relative density
   is shown to be 54\% higher than that of their conventional counterparts
   with regular cell geometry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Out-of-autoclave prepregs require a two-step cure cycle. The first step
   is a low temperature cure to consolidate the laminate and build
   sufficient green strength to proceed to the second step, a free-standing

   resin. Process modeling can help design a robust cure cycle to avoid
   scrapping large parts in production. The focus of this article is to
   develop the cure kinetics, viscosity, and glass transition temperature
   models for two commercially available out-of-autoclave epoxy resins.
   Since the cure kinetics model is the basis for all other thermal models,
   the cure kinetics model was validated using a one-dimensional heat
   transfer analysis on thick prepreg laminates. Finally, the
   out-of-autoclave resin models were compared to a traditional autoclave
   resin system to highlight the difference in resin reactivity for

Title = {{Assessing the stirred mill design space}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{9-16}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In the context of the mining industry, smaller grain size and other
   mineralogical characteristics have motivated the need to grind finer. In
   order to address this need, the interest in fine grinding technologies
   has grown over the last 20 years as is illustrated by a growing body of
   knowledge on stirred milling. Emphasis in recent years has been on the
   use of computationally intensive modeling and simulation methods such as
   the discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics
   (CFDs). However, due to the computational requirements of these two
   methods, initiating a study that spans the stirred mill design space
   would take a lot of computational effort and time. Therefore the goal of
   this paper is to propose and apply a simplified stirred mill model that
   will then be used to assess configurations in the stirred mill design
   space.
   To this end, a stirred mill model was proposed based on the assumption
   that the main if not only mechanism of ore breakage is shear. As the
   basis of this model is the fluid mechanics definition of shear stress,
   the stirred mill power model became a function of viscosity, mill speed
   and a new parameter called shear volume. An initial validation using
   published data indicated the shear based power model correlated well
   with measured power.
   Establishing a morphological chart to delimit the stirred mill design
   space indicated that 24 design and operating conditions can be assess
   using the established shear volume measure. The results indicated for
   the mill configurations tested that a change in stirred mill liner
   design can potentially increase shear volume and power from 14\% to
   290\% as compared to smooth chamber liners. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A review of the beneficiation of rare earth element bearing minerals}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{97-114}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Rare earth elements (REEs) comprise the fifteen elements of the
   lanthanide series as well as yttrium, and may be found in over 250
   different minerals. These elements are required for many different
   applications such as high-strength permanent magnets, catalysts for
   petroleum refining, metal and glass additives and phosphors used in
   electronic displays. The only REE bearing minerals that have been
   extracted on a commercial scale are bastnasite, monazite, and xenotime.
   These minerals may be beneficiated using gravity, magnetic,
   electrostatic and flotation separation techniques. Increased demand for
   the different products manufactured from REE has resulted in a
   constriction of supply from China, which currently produces 97\% of the
   world's rare earths, via export quotas. Many new rare earth deposits are
   currently being developed to help meet the demand void created by the
   Chinese export quotas, however most of these developing deposits include
   rare earth minerals for which there is limited processing knowledge.
   This paper examines the separation techniques that are currently
   employed for rare earth mineral beneficiation and identifies areas in
   need of further research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grape seeds (Vitis vinifera) are rich in phytochemicals that have
   antioxidant properties. The influence of independent variables such as
   microwave power (100, 150, and 200 W), extraction time (2, 4, and 6
   min), and solvent concentration (30\%, 45\%, and 60\% ethanol) and their
   interactions on total phenols and the antioxidant activity
   (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric ion reducing
   antioxidant power (FRAP)) were determined; and the microwave-assisted
   extraction (MAE) process was optimized using a central composite design.
   The total phenols that were expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE),
   catechin equivalents (CAT), and tannic acid equivalents (TAE) were
   significantly influenced by the solvent concentration and the time of
   extraction. A numerical optimization was carried out to obtain the
   overall conditions for MAE of phenolic antioxidants from grape seed. The
   response variables were maximized for 6 min of MAE of grape seed (GS)
   with 32.6\% ethanol at 121 W with a desirability function of 0.947. The

   predicted antioxidant activity per gram of dry weight GS was 80.9\% for
   the inhibition of DPPH and 135 mu M ascorbic acid equivalents for FRAP

Title = {{Controlled Copper Ion Release from Phosphate-Based Glasses Improves
   Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell Survival in a Reduced Nutrient

Abstract = {{The success of tissue engineering is dependent on rapid scaffold
   vascularization after engraftment. Copper ions are well known to be
   angiogenic but exhibit cytotoxicity at elevated doses. The high
   sensitivity to copper concentration underlines the need of a controlled
   release mechanism. This study investigated the effect of copper ions
   released from phosphate-based glasses (PGs) on human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells (HUVECs) under standard growth conditions (SGC), as
   well as in a reduced nutrient environment (RNE) with decreased bovine
   serum and growth factor concentrations to approximate conditions in the
   core of large volume scaffolds where nutrient diffusion is limited.
   Initially, HUVECs were exposed to a range of CuCl2 concentrations in
   order to identify an optimal response in terms of their metabolism,
   viability, and apoptotic activity. Under SGC, HUVEC metabolic activity
   and viability were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of
   0.44-12 ppm Cu2+. In contrast, HUVEC death induced by the RNE was
   delayed by an optimal dose of 4ppm Cu2+, which was associated with a
   down-regulation of apoptosis as evidenced by caspase-3/7 activity.
   Copper ion release from soluble PGs of the formulation
   50P(2)O(5)-30CaO-(20-x)Na2O-xCuO {[}mol\%] (x = 0, 1, 5 and 10)
   demonstrated a controllable increase with CuO content. The presence of
   4ppm copper ions released from the 10\% CuO PG composition reproduced
   the delay in HUVEC death in the RNE, suggesting the potential of these
   materials to extend survival of transplanted endothelial cells in large
   volume scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure and texture evolution in Mg-1 \%Mn-Sr alloys during
   extrusion has been investigated. At 350 degrees C, the extrusion of Mg-1
   \%Mn (M1) alloy exhibits the progressive formation of basal texture from
   the undeformed zone to the die opening. The extruded microstructure of
   M1 consists of recrystallized grains nucleated by grain boundary bulging
   and elongated parent grains along with extensive twinning. At 350
   degrees C, the extrusion of M1-1.6Sr alloy results in progressive
   elongation of Mg-Sr precipitates in the form of stringers from the
   undeformed zone to the die opening. The final extruded microstructure of
   this alloy shows extensive recrystallization occurring at the
   intermetallic stringers by particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN).
   M1-(0.3-1.6)\%Sr alloys display weaker textures due to PSN which creates
   new grains with random orientations. At 250 degrees C, the extrusion of
   M1 creates necklace of small recrystallized grains around large
   elongated parent grains. M1-1.6Sr alloy extruded at 250 degrees C
   exhibits continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) in the Mg matrix
   and PSN at Mg-Sr precipitates. PSN is less extensive at lower
   temperature. Both CDRX and PSN grains have random orientations, and
   therefore, alloy develops random texture.}},

Title = {{Optimization of selected salts concentration for improved biohydrogen
   production from biodiesel-based glycerol using Enterobacter aerogenes}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{222-226}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Enterobacter aerogenes have a known ability to convert glycerol (GL) in
   a fermentative process to yield hydrogen and ethanol as the main
   by-products. The concentration of some media constituents was optimized
   to maximize biohydrogen yield and rate of production. E. aerogenes were
   cultured in aerobic conditions, and then transferred into anaerobic
   conditions before being cultured in a minimum mineral synthetic media
   (MMSM) containing 15 g/L GL. The concentration of selected salts were
   optimized in the following ranges: 0-300 mg/L MgSO4, 0-14 g/L Na(2)EDTA,
   0-10 mg/L CaCL2, 0-10 g/L Na2HPO4, and 0 9.7 g/L KH2PO4. The results of
   the full factorial design indicated that the production of biohydrogen
   required a minimal concentration of 3.5 mg/L EDTA, 200 mg/L MgSO4 center
   dot 7H(2)O and no CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O. A significant interaction
   between EDTA and MgSO4 was also observed. Results from the phosphate
   salts optimization showed that Na2HPO4 gave better results than KH2PO4.
   The optimal conditions determined using pure glycerol (commercial grade
   glycerol), were successfully applied to the fermentation of crude
   glycerol from biodiesel production. The results indicated promising
   yields of 0.79 and 0.84 mol/mol of glycerol for bioethanol and
   biohydrogen, respectively, and this at a faster rate than reported
   previously for E. aerogenes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{374-381}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of crystallographic texture and the mechanical properties
   of copper subjected to severe plastic deformation (SPD) using equal
   channel angular pressing (ECAP) were investigated. Samples were
   subjected to ECAP under two different processing routes: B-60 and B-C.
   As the cross sections of the samples were circular, a new route with a
   rotation angle of 60 degrees in the same direction between consecutive
   passes was introduced. The material exhibited texture development
   similar to the simple shear texture in both routes and the most
   significant changes in texture strength in both processing routes took
   place after the second pass. Microstructure of ECAP processed samples
   were investigated using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
   analysis. Comparison of the EBSD data with optical micrograph of the
   initial sample confirmed that ECAP process has led to a significant
   decrease in grain size. Significant increases in hardness and tensile
   strength were observed after the first pass of ECAP. Variations of
   tensile strength as a function of the number of passes were related to
   the dislocation densities and the average boundary spacing. (C) 2012

Journal = {{FINITE ELEMENTS IN ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{24-35}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A three dimensional numerical analysis for unconfined seepage problems
   in inhomogeneous and anisotropic domains with arbitrary geometry is
   presented in this paper. The unconfined seepage problems are nonlinear
   in its nature due to unknown location of the phreatic surface and
   nonlinear boundary conditions which complicates its solution. The
   presented method is based on the application of non-boundary-fitted
   meshes and is an extension of the recently proposed two dimensional
   smoothed fixed grid finite element method. The main objective of using
   this method is to facilitate solution of variable domain problems and
   improve the accuracy of the formulation of the boundary intersecting
   elements. In this method, the gradient smoothing technique is used to
   obtain the element matrices. This technique simplifies the solution
   significantly by reducing the volume integrals over the elements into
   area integrals on the faces of smoothing cells. To locate the free
   surface, an initial guess for the unknown geometry is selected and
   modified in each iteration to eventually satisfy nonlinear boundary
   condition. The application of the proposed technique for three
   dimensional seepage problems is carried out for different examples
   including rectangular, trapezoidal and semi-cylindrical dams and the
   results are compared with those available in the literature. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The modeling of the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes still
   represents a challenge to geometers. This paper is a contribution along
   these lines, as pertaining to gears with skew axes and cycloidal teeth.
   To this end, the authors follow and extend the results reported by
   Martin Disteli at the turn of the 20th century concerning the general
   synthesis of gears with skew axes. The main goal is the rendering of the
   tooth profiles of cycloidal gears with skew axes. This is done by means
   of the dualization of the geometric relations proposed by Disteli for
   bevel gears with cycloidal teeth, which leads to ruled surfaces as
   conjugate tooth flanks such that at any instant the contact points are
   located on a straight line. All results are proven by means of a
   consistent use of dual vectors representing directed lines and
   rigid-body twists. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular interactions driving the assembly of gold nanoparticles
   (AuNPs) in a nematic liquid crystal (LC) are directly detected by
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and thermodynamically
   analyzed. The orientational orders of the selectively deuterated LC
   matrix and AuNP ligands, each separately followed by variable
   temperature H-2 NMR as a function of particle concentration, were
   observed to be strongly correlated. The mechanism of the reversible
   formation of long-range, quasi-periodic nanoparticle structures is
   attributed to the coupling of the AuNP ligands to the LC matrix,
   inducing an isotropic nematic biphasic state. Experimentally validated
   thermodynamic modeling shows that, in contrast to colloidal nematics
   that are dominated by elastic forces, nematic dispersions of
   nanoparticles self-organize through a subtle balance of entropic forces
   and excluded volume, interface-mediated mesogen and nanoparticle
   molecular interactions, and couplings between conserved and nonconserved
   order parameters. Fine-tuning of these interactions through ligand and
   mesogen chemistry, together with mesoscale modeling, provides a route
   for materials innovations by merging structured fluid physics and
   nanoscience.}},

   characterized by less plastic flow and fewer instances of hole formation
   at the interface. This increase in stability correlated with lower wear

Abstract = {{Using a hybrid of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Fmincon
   optimization techniques is proposed for reducing vapor liquid
   equilibrium (VLE) data of systems formed by a subcritical and a

   with advantage for evaluation of binary parameters required by cubic
   equations of state for the correlation of VLE data of binary mixtures
   containing carbon dioxide with 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol.
   Four cubic equations of state (modified Van der Waals,
   Soave-Redlich-Kwong, Peng-Robinson, and Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera),
   coupled with four mixing rules (conventional one-binary parameter,
   Margules-type, Huron-Vidal and the reformulated Wong-Sandler) were used.
   The Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera EoS coupled with the Margules-type mixing
   rule gave the best correlation of vapor phase composition and combined
   with the reformulated Wong-Sandler mixing rule gave the best correlation
   of equilibrium pressure. The latter combination gave the best overall
   fit of the data. The binary interaction parameters were found to be

Abstract = {{The nonlinear dynamics for forced motions of an axially moving plate is
   numerically investigated using Von Karman plate theory and retaining
   in-plane displacements and inertia. The equations of motion are obtained
   via an energy method based on Lagrange equations. This yields a set of

   ordinary differential equations and are solved via the pseudo-arclength
   continuation technique. The hear-resonance nonlinear dynamics is
   examined via plotting the frequency-response curves of the system.
   Results are shown through frequency-response curves, time histories, and
   phase-plane diagrams. The effect of system parameters, such as the axial
   speed and the pretension, on the resonant responses is also highlighted.

Abstract = {{The texture evolution in four Mg-Zn-Ce alloys was compared to that of
   Mg-3Al-1Zn (AZ31) alloy following rolling and subsequent isothermal
   annealing. All the as-cast and homogenized alloys were rolled through
   two stages that can be characterized as rough rolling and finish
   rolling, respectively. To investigate the effect of finish rolling
   temperature, one finish rolling pass with 65\% reduction in thickness
   was performed at 300 degrees C and 450 degrees C. Of the studied
   compositions, the Mg-1Zn-1Ce, which had the highest Ce/Zn ratio, showed
   the weakest as-rolled texture and homogenous shear banding/twinning.
   Changing the Zn content changed particle size and, in alloys subject to
   texture weakening, the static recrystallization mechanism altered. On
   annealing, the maximum intensity of basal pole figures decreases as
   recrystallization progresses. The Mg-1Zn-1Ce (with the highest Ce/Zn),
   texture weakening is maintained even after full recrystallization, when
   grain coarsening occurs. However, in the Mg-4Zn-1Ce and AZ31 alloys,
   texture strengthening occurs when grain coarsening occurs, and the
   double split basal peak is replaced by a single peak. In these two
   alloys, grain coarsening is also accompanied by a bimodal grain size
   whereas in the Mg-1Zn-1Ce alloy, the grain coarsening leads to a uniform
   grain size. It is concluded that the differences between the Ce bearing
   alloys are related to Zn; increasing Zn decreases the solubility of Ce,
   which can influence the texture changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Frozen groundwater seeps from discrete features, such as fractures and
   faults, are common along steep faces of cliffs, mines, quarries, and
   road cuts in cold environments at high elevations and latitudes. Our
   objective is to test whether thermal infrared imaging can be used to
   quantify groundwater discharge from such discrete features in freezing
   conditions. Discrete seeps and freezing cliff faces were simulated in a
   cold room laboratory with a systematic series of experiments captured
   through infrared imaging. Two zones of distinct surface temperatures
   were observed at the ice surface: a zone of relatively warm and constant
   surface temperature above a zone with high thermal gradients.
   Experimental conditions impacted the length of the relative warm zone. A
   strong correlation is observed between length of the relative warm zone
   and the discharge rate suggesting that groundwater discharge from
   discrete features could be quantified using noninvasive infrared
   imaging. Citation: Pandey, P., T. Gleeson, and M. Baraer (2013), Toward

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the biodegradation of two commercial plasticizers,
   diethylene glycol dibenzoate (D(EG)DB) and dipropylene glycol dibenzoate
   (D(PG)DB), as well as two alternative plasticizers, 1,3-propanediol
   dibenzoate and 2,2-methyl-propyl-1,3-propanediol dibenzoate, were
   investigated in an aerated bioreactor. The experiments were conducted
   with resting cells of Rhodococcus rhodochrous, which had been grown with
   hexadecane as the substrate. The first step in the biodegradation was
   always the hydrolysis of an ester bond, releasing the corresponding
   monobenzoate and benzoic acid. Biodegradation of plasticizers and their
   associated metabolites were modeled using a Monod-type kinetic model.
   Significant differences between the biodegradation of commercial and
   alternative plasticizers were observed both in the biodegradation
   pathway and the biodegradation rates of monobenzoate metabolites. At a
   selected concentration of 0.4 g/L, the monobenzoates released from the
   biodegradation of 1,3-propanediol dibenzoate and
   2,2-methyl-propyl-1,3-propanediol dibenzoate were degraded approximately
   13 and 4 times more quickly, respectively, than the monobenzoate
   released from the biodegradation of D(PG)DB. The rapid biodegradation of
   monobenzoates released from microbial hydrolysis of alternative
   dibenzoate plasticizers was attributed to the lack of an ether bond in
   these compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Methacrylate-based densely grafted copolymers were synthesized by atom
   transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and activators generated by
   electron transfer for atom transfer radical polymerization (AGET ATRP)
   techniques. The linear poly(2-(2-bromoisobutyryloxy)ethyl methacrylate)
   PBIEM prepared by ATRP served as a macroinitiator backbone. The
   ``grafting from{''} strategy was used to initiate polymerization of
   tert-butyl methacrylate (tBuMA) from PBIEM under ATRP and/or AGET ATRP
   conditions yielding densely grafted copolymers PBIEM-graft-P(tBuMA). The
   low polydispersity indices (PDI) of the synthesized brushes evidenced by
   SEC analysis were consistent with a controlled/living radical
   polymerization (CLRP) mechanism. The chlorine-terminated
   PBIEM-graft-P(tBuMA)-Cl macroinitiators were subsequently employed for
   chain extension with 2-(dimethylamino ethyl) methacrylate (DMAEMA)
   yielding densely grafted copolymers with diblock copolymer side chains
   PBIEM-graft-P(tBuMA)-block-PDMAEMA. Further, PBIEM macroinitiator was
   used to initiate the copolymerization of a binary mixture of tBuMA and
   DMAEMA through both ATRP and AGET ATRP initiating systems, yielding
   densely grafted copolymers with statistical distribution of the side
   chains. The reactivity ratios for random graft copolymerization of tBuMA
   and DMAEMA from PBIEM backbone established by three different methods
   (Finemann-Ross, Kelen-Tudos and Error-in-Variable) did not substantially
   differ from literature values for conventional free-radical
   copolymerization of the same monomers. Polyampholyte brushes with
   PMAA-stat-PDMAEMA side chains were eventually synthesized by hydrolysis
   of the shielding tert-butyl groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a polynomial-adaptive lifting collocation penalty
   (LCP) formulation for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The LCP
   formulation is a high-order nodal scheme in differential form. This
   format, although computationally efficient, complicates the treatment of
   non-uniform polynomial approximations. In Cagnone and Nadarajah (2012)
   {[}9], we proposed to circumvent this difficulty by employing specially
   designed elements inserted at the interface where the interpolation
   degree varies. In the present study we examine the applicability of this
   approach to the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations, with
   focus put on the treatment of the viscous fluxes. The stability of the
   scheme is analyzed with the scalar diffusion equation and the merits of
   the approach are demonstrated with various p-adaptive simulations. (C)

Abstract = {{The state of dispersion plays an important role on the performance of
   polymer nanocomposites. Dispersion is usually assessed based on the
   qualitative evaluation of microscopy micrographs. In this paper, a
   quantitative algorithm is introduced for analyzing the dispersion of
   inclusions in polymer composites using image analysis. In a binary
   image, on-pixels are considered as particle elements while off-pixels
   stand for matrix elements. To quantify the dispersion, the mean distance
   value between any matrix elements to their corresponding nearest
   neighboring particle element is measured. A dispersion index, DI, is
   then defined by comparing the image of interest with the associated
   uniformly dispersed case. Synthetic models were utilized to examine the
   sensitivity of the algorithm to various dispersity scenarios such as the
   effect of particle size, clustering, and cluster distribution. Optical
   micrographs of carbon nanotube modified epoxy with different states of
   dispersion were also employed to assess the applicability and
   functionality of the algorithm to real micrographs.}},

Title = {{Using self-organizing maps and wavelet transforms for space-time
   pre-processing of satellite precipitation and runoff data in neural
   network based rainfall-runoff modeling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{476}},
Pages = {{228-243}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a two-level self-organizing map (SOM) clustering
   technique was used to identify spatially homogeneous clusters of
   precipitation satellite data, and to choose the most operative and
   effective data for a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to model
   rainfall-runoff process on a daily and multi-step ahead time scale. The
   wavelet transform (WT) was also used to extract dynamic and multi-scale
   features of the non-stationary runoff time series and to remove noise.
   The performance of the coupled SOM-FFNN model was compared to the newly
   proposed combined SOM-WT-FFNN model. The performance of these two models
   was also compared to that of a conventional forecasting method, namely
   the auto regressive integrated moving average with exogenous input
   (ARIMAX) model. Daily precipitation data from two satellites and four
   rain gauges, as well as runoff values recorded from January 2003 to
   December 2007 in the Gilgel Abay watershed in Ethiopia were used to
   calibrate and validate the models. Runoff predictions via all of the
   above methods were investigated for both single-step-ahead and
   multi-step-ahead lead times. The results indicated that the use of
   spatial and temporal pre-processed data in the FFNN model led to a
   promising improvement in its performance for rainfall-runoff
   forecasting. In the validation phase of single and multi-step-ahead
   forecasting, it was determined that the SOM-WT-FFNN models provide more
   accurate forecasts than the SOM-FFNN models (the determination
   coefficients for validation of the SOM-FFNN and SOM-WT-FFNN models were
   0.80 and 0.93, respectively). The proposed FFNN model coupled with the
   SOM clustering method decreased the dimensionality of the input
   variables and consequently the complexity of the FFNN models. On the
   other hand, the application of the wavelet transform to the runoff data
   increased the performance of the FFNN rainfall-runoff models in
   predicting runoff peak values by removing noise and revealing the
   dominant periods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Defects associated with drilling of Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymers
   (CFRPs) are of major economic and safety concerns for aerospace
   manufacturers. One of the most critical defects associated with drilling
   of CFRP laminates is delamination of layers which can be avoided by
   keeping the drilling forces below some threshold levels. Orbital
   Drilling (OD) is an emerging drilling process that exhibits lower
   cutting forces and temperatures, easier chip removal, higher produced
   surface quality, longer tool life, and a high possibility for dry
   machining. The OD process is featured by cyclic engagement and
   disengagement between the tool and the workpiece whereby a considerable
   part of the work done by the tool is directed towards the tangential
   direction while the work done in the axial direction is reduced. This
   reduces the risk of delamination at the exit. The objective of this
   research work is to investigate the effect of the OD process key
   parameters with respect to the produced hole attributes (surface
   roughness, delamination, and hole accuracy), as well as the cutting
   forces and temperatures. All the OD tests were performed under dry
   conditions using a four-flute 6.35 mm end-mill. The cutting forces were
   recorded using a 3-component dynamometer Kistler 9255B and cutting
   temperatures were measured using a FUR Thermo Vision A20M Infrared
   camera at the holes exit. A full factorial design of the experiment was
   used whereby the feeds varied from 60 to 360 mm/min and the speeds from
   6,000 to 16,000 rpm. The test material used was a quasi-isotropic
   laminate comprising woven graphite epoxy prepreg. Analysis of the
   results showed 45\% reduction in the axial force component in orbital
   drilling (OD), compared to conventional drilling. None of the holes
   produced by the entire set of experiments has experienced any entry or
   exit delamination. ANOVA was used to identify the significance of the
   controllable variables on the experimental outputs. To overcome the
   challenge of optimizing the competing parameters of the hole quality
   attributes while maximizing the productivity, an algorithm was applied
   by hybridizing Kriging as a meta-modeling technique with evolutionary
   multi-objective optimization to optimize the cutting parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In vibration assisted drilling (VAD), a controlled harmonic motion is
   superimposed over the principal drilling feed motion in order to create
   an intermittent cutting state, which reduces cutting forces and
   temperatures, facilitates chip removal, and increases the possibility
   for dry machining. However, accurate force measurements during VAD
   operations has been a challenge especially in systems, where the force
   transducer is part of the vibrating mass mounted on the shaker head, due
   to the dynamic force errors. Conventional signal filtering and
   compensation techniques were found to be not applicable for attenuating
   undesirable VAD dynamic force components, which exist in the measured
   force signals at the same frequency of superimposed modulation. This
   research work presents a corrective dynamic model that rectifies the
   erroneous VAD tangential and axial force signals measured by a
   commercial piezoelectric dynamometer mounted on electro-magnetic shakers
   for the low frequency/high amplitude (LF/HA) regime. An experimental
   modal analysis in tangential and axial directions was conducted in order
   to define the transfer function of a multiple degrees of freedom VAD
   system mounted on a vibrating base (shaker). The rectified force is then
   obtained by plugging the relative motion between the dynamometer base
   and face measured during cutting into the system transfer function. The
   predicted rectified force components showed very high conformance with
   known impact and sinusoidal excitation forces used for validation.
   Moreover, the developed corrective model was capable of predicting some
   features in the VAD force signals that were not fully captured in the
   measured force signals during cutting.}},

Abstract = {{As increasing attention is paid to the storage and flux of carbon in and
   around boreal lakes, systematic strategies to make and refine credible
   region-wide estimates of stocks and fluxes will be increasingly
   important. Given that there are hundreds of thousands of lakes in the
   world's lake-rich regions, even concerted long-term field campaigns can
   reach only a minuscule fraction of the water bodies of the world.
   Although remote sensing would appear to be of obvious potential,
   limnologists interested in satellite detection of lake coloorr have been
   limited by many factors, primarily (a) the low spectral and radiometric
   resolution of earlier Landsat imagery; (b) the limited coverage of the
   experimental ALI sensor; and (c) the high cost of alternative imagery.
   The launch of Landsat 8 promises a revolution in estimating carbon
   content in the world's small lakes. Yet as Landsat 8 becomes
   operational, the prospect of sampling and validating for hundreds of
   thousands of boreal lakes is nearly impossible using the standard
   approach of carefully timing lake sampling with satellite overpasses. We
   have recently shown that multi-temporal imagery from the prototype ALI
   sensor can be used for a high-quality estimation of coloured dissolved
   organic matter (CDOM), an important lake property that is usually well
   correlated with visible colour in northern lakes. For that relation we
   used a legacy field data set collected at irregular times over more than
   a decade, which greatly expanded the amount of field observation
   available for building the model. In a setting with multi-temporal field
   data matched with multi-temporal image data, the challenge of updating
   estimates will be increasingly important as Landsat 8 produces a stream
   of images of varying utility. Meanwhile, field data in newly sampled
   lakes may be plausibly used for a variety of purposes: for fits with
   imagery that is near in time, as validation of an existing estimate, or
   to refine fits from old imagery.
   Here we describe our expected protocol for treating and refining an
   ongoing series of imagery-driven estimates, built from a large amount of
   multi-temporal data. The workflow is intended to automatically
   incorporate new evidence to continually sharpen the estimates of lake
   carbon content across a vast area. The prospect of long-term observation
   of lake properties is arriving, and it promises a clearer picture of one
   of the world's great storehouses of carbon.}},

   to investigate different soil-structure interaction problems. The
   structural elements in the problems are modeled using finite elements

   the discontinuous nature of the granular material. The coupled framework
   is then used to model three soil-geogrid interaction problems including
   geogrid pullout test, strip footing on geogrid-reinforced sand and
   geogrid reinforced fill over void. The numerical results show the
   efficiency of the coupled framework to model the interlocking effect
   between the soil and the geogrid sheet. New insights into the nature of

Abstract = {{Sublevel mining methods are very popular in Canadian metal mines, which
   enable maximum recovery due to pillar-less mining. Ore is recovered by
   backfilling stopes and mining pillars after curing of backfilled stopes.
   Backfill material must be engineered to avoid backfill failure leading
   to dilution of precious ore. Current practice of designing backfill
   includes only gravity loading (static) on backfill. In reality, backfill
   is loaded by static and dynamic loads during extraction of adjacent
   pillars. The static load is due to weight of the backfill and dynamic
   loading is due to blasting and sudden loss of confinement. It is
   believed that dynamic loading on backfill must have an influence on
   backfill stability. This paper presents FLAC(3D) modelling results of
   static loading due to gravity and dynamic loading on backfill due to
   loss of confinement and blasting. The CRF stope is subjected to blast
   vibrations. The numerical modelling results are compared with the cavity
   monitoring survey (CMS) profiles of a case study thus validating the
   modelling technique.}},

Abstract = {{Oximeters are commonly used in abbreviated cardiorespiratory studies
   (ACS) to monitor blood oxygen saturation and heart rate using the
   photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. These data are prone to movement
   artifacts, especially in infants who move or need to be handled often.
   Therefore segments of PPG data contaminated by movement artifact must be
   detected as a first stage of analysis. In ACS this identification is
   generally done manually, by having an expert visually assess the quality
   of the signal. This is subjective and very time consuming, especially
   for long data records. For this reason we present a novel detector of
   PPG movement artifacts that uses moving average filters to remove
   trends, reduce the effect of white noise, and notch filter pulse-related
   information. The normalized root mean square of the filtered signal is
   then used as a detection statistic. We demonstrate its detection
   properties using a data set from infants recovering from anesthesia, and
   show that it performs better than other automated methods based on
   entropy or higher-order statistics. Furthermore, the new method is more
   robust than the other methods in the presence of large noise.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel model structure and identification method
   for the time-varying, intrinsic stiffness of human ankle joint during
   imposed walking (IW) movements. The model structure is based on the
   superposition of a large signal, linear, time-invariant (LTI) model and
   a small signal linear-parameter varying (LPV) model. The methodology is
   based on a two-step algorithm; the LTI model is first estimated using
   data from an unperturbed IW trial. Then, the LPV model is identified
   using data from a perturbed IW trial with the output predictions of the
   LTI model removed from the measured torque. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the method accurately tracks the continuous-time

Abstract = {{Dynamic ankle joint stiffness defines the relationship between the
   position of the ankle and the torque acting about it and can be
   separated into intrinsic and reflex components. Under stationary
   conditions, intrinsic stiffness can described by a linear second order
   system while reflex stiffness is described by Hammerstein system whose
   input is delayed velocity. Given that reflex and intrinsic torque cannot
   be measured separately, there has been much interest in the development
   of system identification techniques to separate them analytically. To
   date, most methods have been nonparametric and as a result there is no
   direct link between the estimated parameters and those of the stiffness
   model. This paper presents a novel algorithm for identification of a
   discrete-time model of ankle stiffness. Through simulations we show that
   the algorithm gives unbiased results even in the presence of large,
   non-white noise. Application of the method to experimental data
   demonstrates that it produces results consistent with previous findings.}},

   variable forgetting factor mechanism employs a new component updated by
   the time average of the constant modulus (CM) cost function, to adjust
   the forgetting factor. A complexity comparison is provided to show its
   advantages over existing methods. The study of the steady-state analysis

Abstract = {{In this work, a system scheme is proposed for tracking a radio emitting
   target moving in two-dimensional space. The localization is based on the
   use of biased time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements obtained at two
   asynchronous receivers, each equipped with two closely spaced antennas.
   By exploiting the multi-antenna configuration and using all the TOA
   measurements up to current time step, the relative clock bias at each
   receiver and the target position are jointly estimated by solving a
   nonlinear least-squares (NLS) problem. To this end, a novel time
   recursive algorithm is proposed which fully takes advantage of the
   problem structure to achieve computational efficiency while using
   orthogonal transformations to ensure numerical reliability. The
   Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is also derived as a lower bound on the
   error in estimating the position and biases. Simulation results show
   that the mean-squared error (MSE) of the proposed method approaches the

   the best possible rate. To achieve this, the algorithm requires multiple
   rounds of consensus per iteration, where the number of consensus rounds
   depends on the structure of the underlying communication topology

   sensors. In this paper we derive multi-Bernoulli filter equations for
   superpositional sensors. The multi-Bernoulli update is derived by
   defining a conditional PHD for each component of the multi-Bernoulli
   random finite set and then following an approach similar to that used in
   deriving the CPHD filter update equation for superpositional sensors.
   The cardinality distribution is also updated along with the conditional
   PHD.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of optical absorption coefficient (a) were made on
   Bridgman-grown CuInSe2 samples, over the wavelength range 1300 to 1600
   nm, at room temperature. The samples were obtained from
   multi-crystalline ingots, grown from melts of composition CuInSe2+x plus
   y atomic \% of elemental sodium. Here, x, the excess of Se over
   stoichiometry, ranged from 0 to 0.4 and y, the percentage of Na in the
   melt, ranged from 0 to 11 at \%. It was found that a was considerably
   increased by the original Na in the melt and also by a stoichiometric
   deficiency of Se in the melt; that is with a melt formula corresponding
   to CuInSe1.8, (or x = - 0.2). A smaller increase of a was observed with
   increase of x, the Se excess. With the addition of Na2Se in the melt,
   little change was obtained compared with the large increase with

Abstract = {{The appropriate dispatch of Load Shifting Devices (LSD) and Renewable
   Energy Sources (RES) is still a challenging issue for the Remote
   Community (RC). This paper analyzes three techniques for the economic
   dispatch of a RC microgrid that implements RES and LSDs as in the case
   of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) to a diesel infrastructure. Two online
   or period-ahead techniques are compared to an offline mathematical
   formulation of a PV-ESS-Diesel system for an hourly-based annual
   simulation. A new online method, based on the average cost curve of a
   generator is introduced as it consists in a combination between the
   closed mathematical formulation of a classic offline technique and the
   online capabilities of a Knowledge-Based Expert System (KBES). An
   application of the three techniques over the same benchmark shows that
   by the introduction of a load shifting capability of approximately 25\%
   of the peak, for all three methods the RC is able to save around 3\% of
   the overall diesel consumption of a PV-Diesel Microgrid (MG).}},

Abstract = {{Managing a patient with comorbid diseases according to multiple clinical
   practice guidelines (CPGs) may result in adverse interactions that need
   to be mitigated (identified and addressed) so a safe therapy can be
   devised. However, mitigation poses both clinical and methodological
   challenges. It requires extensive domain knowledge and calls for
   advanced CPG models and efficient algorithms to process them.
   We respond to the above challenges by describing our algorithm that
   mitigates interactions between pairs of CPGs. The algorithm creates
   logical models of analyzed CPGs and uses constraint logic programming
   (CLP) together with domain knowledge, codified as interaction and
   revision operators, to process them. Logical CPG models are transformed
   into CLP-CPG models that are solved to find a safe therapy. We represent
   these CLP-CPG models using MiniZinc, a standard language for CLP models.
   As motivation and illustration of our mitigation algorithm we use a
   clinical case study describing a patient managed for hypertension and
   deep vein thrombosis according to two individual CPGs. We apply the
   algorithm to this scenario and present MiniZinc representations of the
   constructed CLP-CPG models.}},

Abstract = {{Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), which is strongly advocated as anode material for
   lithium ion batteries destined for land transport and grid-integration
   PV applications, was prepared via a novel low-temperature aqueous
   synthesis followed by annealing route using only inorganic compounds,
   including lithium hydroxide and inexpensive titanium tetrachloride as
   precursors. The synthesis of nanostructured LTO is done via the thermal
   transformation (annealing) of the aqueous synthesized intermediate
   phase, Li1.81H0.19Ti2O5 center dot 2H(2)O (LTH). The nanostructure of
   the prepared LTO material was found to depend on the preceding
   intermediate phase formation conditions and applied annealing protocol.
   Thus nanoflower-structured LTO with ``petals{''} 17-50 nm thick was
   produced by annealing the LTH intermediate phase at 400 degrees C.
   However, the morphology changed from flower structure into particulate,
   when annealing was done at a temperature higher than 500 degrees C.
   Finally, after annealing at 700 degrees C an LTO-rutile TiO2 composite
   with average particle size of 100 nm was obtained. Possible mechanisms
   responsible for the different LTO nanocrystal morphologies are proposed.}},

   processes in InGaN/GaN dot-in-a-wire white light emitting diodes (LEDs)

   LEDs, the peak quantum efficiency occurs at relatively high injection
   current levels of >100 A/cm(2), compared to those of conventional
   InGaN/GaN quantum well blue LEDs. Through detailed simulation studies,
   it is concluded that, Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination, due
   to the presence of surface states and defects, plays a dominant role on
   the nanowire LED performance. We have further shown that such
   nonradiative recombination can be greatly reduced when the nanowire LEDs
   are treated by ammonium sulfide solution ((NH4)(2)S-x, 40-48\%
   concentration), which can lead to a much faster increasing trend of
   quantum efficiency vs. injection current, compared to the unpassivated

   introduction in 1995, has been applied to a variety of multibody systems
   such as serial, parallel, general closed-loop, flexible, legged,
   cam-follower, and space robots. The methodology has also proven useful
   for modelling of proteins and hyper-degree-of-freedom systems like
   ropes, chains, etc. This paper captures the evolution of the DeNOC-based
   dynamic modelling applied to different type of systems, and its benefits
   over other existing methodologies. It is shown that the DeNOC-based
   modelling provides deeper understanding of the dynamics of a multibody
   system. The power of the DeNOC-based modelling has been illustrated
   using several numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{A novel fabrication method comprising screen printing and sintering of
   nanotitania/carbon paste was developed in order to build binder-free
   electrodes for lithium-ion energy storage devices. As active material
   the commercial (P25) nanotitania was used. These electrodes were
   compared to those fabricated using the standard binder-based method.
   Physical characterization demonstrated that the novel method provided
   more carbon dispersion, smaller agglomerate size, and higher packing
   density (without the loss of interconnectivity or pore size) than the
   standard one. Electrochemical testing indicated that the novel
   method-built electrodes are exhibiting higher conductivity and specific
   capacity than electrodes made with the same active material and carbon
   plus binder. The specific charging (delithiation) capacity of the novel
   method electrodes was 162 mA h g(-1) compared to 134 mA h g(-1) for the
   standard method, representing 96 and 80\% of the theoretical capacity
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling (or also sub-Nyquist
   filtering) has been proposed as a means to increase the spectral
   efficiency of the next generation long-haul optical fiber transmission
   systems. In the high spectral efficiency regime, however, the severe
   intersymbol interference (ISI) inherent to the FTN signaling poses a
   significant challenge in implementing a practical FTN system.
   In this work, we propose to use non-uniform power allocation at the
   optical FTN transmitter and establish its optimality in the achievable
   capacity. Consequently, we utilize the non-uniform power allocation to
   design a low-complexity FTN receiver that can operate close to the
   channel capacity limit. Presented simulation results also illustrate
   that the proposed optical FTN signaling transceiver with non-uniform
   power allocation allows supporting very high spectral efficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{In a switched-capacitor (SC) integrator, the opamp can be switched off
   during the sampling phase, to reduce the power dissipation. This paper
   proposes a switchable-opamp technique based on a current-mirror opamp
   with switchable transconductances. Whereas previous switchable-opamp
   methods can only be used in SC integrators with half delay, the proposed
   technique can be utilized in SC integrators with both half delay, and
   full delay. Furthermore, no special common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuits
   are required for the opamp. At high sampling frequencies, circuit
   simulations of SC integrators and discrete-time Delta Sigma modulators
   demonstrate that power reductions of 30\% can be achieved by using the
   proposed technique, with minimal effect on the gain error of the SC
   integrator and the SNDR of the Delta Sigma modulator. This confirms that
   the proposed switchable-opamp technique does not limit the speed of the
   SC circuit.}},
