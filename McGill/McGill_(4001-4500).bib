Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to fully characterize a transistor in
   any CMOS technology using a set of dimension-independent parameters. The
   proposed approach creates a layer of abstraction that circumvents the
   SPICE transistor model complexity and replaces it with a set of
   normalized parameters. The proposed approach combined with the
   designer's knowledge of the circuit operation facilitates solving for
   near optimal, if not optimal, circuit behavior. The required small and
   large-signal behavior is achieved, while the dc biasing at each node in
   the circuit is defined at the same time. A simple design tool, called
   ACDNP, based on the proposed concept was developed. The results
   predicted by ACDNP and the Spectre circuit simulator are in excellent
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Granular filtration remains a key barrier for Cryptosporidium removal in
   water treatment plants without UV irradiation. To assess the impact of
   clay particles in source water on Cryptosporidium removal efficiency by
   granular filtration, this study investigated the co-transport of
   Cryptosporidium-sized microspheres and kaolinite particles in sand
   columns. To investigate the influence of clay load on microsphere
   transport and deposition, varying influent kaolinite concentrations
   (0-10(6) particles/mL) and microsphere concentrations (10(2)-10(6)
   microspheres/mL) were tested. The spatial distribution of retained
   microspheres was examined subsequent to experiments via filter coring.
   Results demonstrate that increasing the influent microsphere
   concentration impaired filter performance due to a blocking mechanism
   whereby previously retained particles repel incoming particles. In
   contrast, when the particulate load was dominated by kaolinite (for an
   equivalent particulate load), filter performance improved as a result of
   filter ripening whereby previously deposited particles act as additional
   collectors. Thus, microsphere-kaolinite interactions proved to be
   favorable although both particles possessed negative zeta potentials in
   the tested conditions. This study demonstrates that granular filter
   performance is vulnerable to peak events of microbial contamination.
   Conversely, Cryptosporidium-sized microsphere removal by granular
   filtration is enhanced in the presence of kaolinite in source water.}},

Abstract = {{A 16-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) suitable for a 25 Gb/s, 1/8th rate
   clock and data recovery (CDR) system is presented. Sub-rate CDRs have
   been shown to be reconfigurable to operate at fractions of their peak
   data rate. When operating at less than the maximum data rate, power
   dissipation can be reduced. Also, the jitter that can be tolerated from
   the multi-phase PLL is higher, suggesting a desirable power/jitter
   trade-off for power minimization across data rates. This PLL allows for
   on-the-fly trading off of power dissipation versus jitter performance by
   dynamically connecting between one and three identical sub-VCOs together
   to generate its 16 output phases. To minimize sudden phase excursions
   during VCO reconfiguration, a power-on sequence and a
   variable-capacitance load have been used. Simulation results using TSMC
   65 nm show that the power dissipation reduces by 57\% when switching
   from three to one VCO. Alternatively, the jitter can decrease by a
   factor of 1.5x when the PLL is reconfigured from one to three VCOs. This
   can be done with a maximum absolute timing excursion of 16 ps, making it
   suitable for an on-the-fly reconfiguration of the CDR from 12.5 to 25
   Gb/s.}},

Abstract = {{Recently reversible circuit testing has become an important issue for
   researchers. In the process of design, synthesis or template matching,
   failures can happen due to erroneous replacements or incorrect cascading
   of gates. In this paper, we present testing such errors modeled as gate
   and wire replacement faults, which can also handle most frequently
   addressed errors like missing gate and control points appearance or
   disappearance. Here, we propose three testing schemes based on Boolean
   Satisfiability (SAT) formulation and compare their efficiencies. In
   particular, we present the design of a Reversible Test Miter, which,
   along with backtracking, can easily detect such faults. We show that a
   smaller test set can be derived from the reversible test miter,
   increasing fault coverage and speed of testing.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerometers are vital parts of many industrial and biomedical
   applications. Such applications have high demands for accuracy.
   Multi-sensor fusion is an efficient approach to deliver accurate sensor
   readouts that are tolerant to multiple faults. This paper proposes an
   efficient data fusion algorithm, which minimizes Mean-Square-Error (
   MSE) and keeps the overall precision of the system high. We make use of
   a convex optimization scheme to tackle the problem. Furthermore, a
   pre-processing step called screening is used to exclude the potentially
   faulty sensors from the data fusion. The screening process makes it
   possible to quickly detect multiple faulty sensors. Our data fusion
   approach is applicable to any multi-sensor system, for which the
   post-calibration statistical characteristics of sensors can be measured
   experimentally. However, the results are presented for accelerometers.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key challenges in cognitive radio (CR) networks is to perform
   spectrum sensing in environments characterized by shadowing and fading
   effects as well as non-Gaussian noise distributions. Existing literature
   on spectrum sensing focuses mainly on the Gaussian noise model
   assumption, which does not properly characterize all the various noise
   types found in practical CR systems. This paper addresses the problem of
   spectrum sensing in the presence of non-Gaussian noise and interference
   for cognitive radio systems. A novel detector based on the Rao test is
   proposed for the detection of a primary user in the non-Gaussian noise
   environments described by the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD).
   The test statistic of the proposed Rao detector is derived and its
   detection performance is analyzed and compared to that of the
   traditional energy detection. The Rao-based detection is then extended
   to a multi-user cooperative framework based on an improved decision
   fusion rule. It is shown through computer simulations that for a given
   probability of false alarm, the Rao detector can significantly enhance
   the spectrum sensing performance over conventional energy detection in
   non-Gaussian noise. Furthermore, the proposed cooperative detection
   scheme has a significantly higher global probability of detection than
   the non-cooperative scheme.}},

   Trajectory Interpretation at Roundabouts}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2389}},
Pages = {{65-77}},
Abstract = {{With recent important upgrades to North American intersection design
   guides, roundabouts are gaining popularity as a method of reducing road
   conflicts, streamlining flow, and curbing excessive speeding at busy
   intersections. The current design approach, however, makes use of mean
   spot speed measures and design criteria that do not take into account
   yielding behavior and acceleration and deceleration, all of which may be
   affected by regional driving culture and local roundabout design. This
   research paper introduces the methodology being developed for the
   detailed analysis of driving behavior, trajectory interpretation, and
   conflict measures in modern North American roundabouts, based on video
   data extracted by means of computer vision. The analysis explores the
   methods used to prepare microscopic speed maps, compiled speed profiles,
   lane-change counts, and gap time measures. The paper introduces and
   discusses the interpretation of trajectories at the scale of roundabout
   merge sections instead of looking at safety from the point of view of a
   roundabout as a unified system. The research found significant variation
   in distributions of speed across five case study roundabouts in the
   province of Quebec, Canada; this result may be explained by regional
   differences in design and road use. The paper also found aggressive gap
   times and uneven traffic flow as contributing factors to speed.}},

   mixed recreational, and recreational. Study locations classified by
   these categories were found to have consistent hourly and weekly traffic
   patterns across cities, despite considerable differences between the
   cities in their weather, size, and urban form. Seasonal patterns across
   the four categories and in the cities also were identified. Expansion
   factors for each classification are presented by hour and day of the

   Kinect Motion-Sensing Device}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2339}},
Pages = {{80-89}},
Abstract = {{Data on pedestrian activity, including volumes, walking speed, and
   trajectories, are used by transportation agencies and researchers for
   planning, design, and analysis. Several technologies are available for
   automatic collection of pedestrian data; however, all have inherent
   limitations in either functionality or monetary cost. Also, most
   technologies provide only counts. This paper proposes the use of an
   inexpensive motion-sensing device, Microsoft Kinect, which can track
   multiple people in low light conditions and can be combined with
   existing video-based daytime tracking. The tracking software and speed
   estimation methodologies are described, and indoor and outdoor studies
   show the system's effectiveness at determining pedestrian volumes and
   walking speeds. The accuracy of speed data is very satisfactory, with
   correlation of 98\% or more for video data validation speeds. The
   accuracy of pedestrian volume data varies with traffic conditions;
   however, in low to moderate traffic conditions its performance is
   acceptable, with an undercounting error near 8\%. The applications of
   the sensor and its complementarity with other sensors are discussed, as
   these are the first step toward a multisensor system.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced Distribution Automation (ADA) is one of the key applications of
   the Smart Grid. Since Power Line Communications (PLC) can offer a
   cost-effective communication infrastructure supporting data acquisition
   and automation and IEC 61850 can provide interoperability of all power
   grid monitoring and control devices, they have appeared to be promising
   for ADA. However, the applicability of PLC for ADA needs to be
   investigated carefully since this technology still exhibits some
   limitations related to data rate, reliability, etc., in ADA scenario.
   When estimating the bandwidth requirement for ADA applications, previous
   works tend to make over-simplified assumptions on the numbers of
   involved communications devices as well as the sizes and the exchange
   rates of messages generated by those devices. This paper therefore
   attempts to give a more reasonable bandwidth estimation by incorporating
   insightful understandings of data modeling and communication services
   standardized by IEC 61850 together with knowledge on practical power
   grid infrastructure. The estimation is then used to identify the
   potential challenges for PLC to support ADA applications.}},

   factors of a selected number of electromechanical modes of power

   Analysis (TFEA) method and Modified Arnoldi Method (MAM). Computation
   time reduction comes from applying MAM to the reduced 2ngx2ng matrix of
   {[}A(omega)(K)](2ngx2ng) -formed by TFEA method instead of the higher
   rank full state matrix (e.g. {[}A](15ngx15ng)). Numerical results from a

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a generalized methodology to determine the optimal
   configuration of microgrids that maximizes its benefits. The technique
   proposed herein, incorporates a probabilistic modeling of variable loads
   and distributed generators into a deterministic power flow problem to
   solve an optimization problem. The losses from the power flow problem is
   monetized and supplied to the objective function as one of its input
   multiple cost functions. The optimization problem then concatenates the
   monetized losses, monetized emission and the cost components of
   generation into a single objective and then minimizes it. The
   optimization's aim is to minimize the energy cost to the utility while
   maximizing loss reduction and emission reduction under all practical
   constraints. The proposed algorithm is applied to a real feeder in North
   America and the results showed a significant decrease in the cost of
   energy. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology proposed
   in microgrid planning.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing the realism of the perceived contact force is a primary
   challenge in haptic rendering of virtual walls (VWs) and objects (VOs).
   For VOs, this goal directly translates into accurate rendering of not
   only stiffness, but also mass. The most challenging situation arises
   when the stiffness of the object is large, its mass is small, and
   sampling is slow. To address this challenge, a framework entitled
   high-fidelity haptic rendering (HFCR) has been developed. The HFCR
   framework is composed of the following three main strategies: an
   energy-consistent rendering of the contact force, smooth transition
   between contact modes, and remaining leak dissipation. The essence of
   all these strategies is to make the energy of the VO emulate its
   continuous-time counterpart. This is achieved through physically
   meaningful modifications in the constitutive relations to suppress
   artificial energy leaks. This paper reports simulation and experiments
   involving the one-dimensional canonical model of a VO to illustrate the
   HFCR framework and compare it to the existing methods. Results
   demonstrate the promising stability and force rendering fidelity of this
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of patients around the world suffer from neurological
   disorders. Many of these diseases such as Parkinson's are due to
   degeneration of Dopaminergic neurons. Our ultimate goal is to develop an
   intelligent implantable CMOS neurotrophic factor delivery microsystem
   which can maintain therapeutic levels of chemical concentrations in the
   brain by protecting the healthy neurons and restoring damaged ones. The
   hybrid microsystem is composed of neural probes fitted with novel
   sensors that can sense micromolar concentration of neurotransmitters
   (dopamine) and embedded negative feedback circuits that control the flow
   of pharmacological agents in micro fluidic channels. Additionally MEMS
   (Micro Electro Mechanical System) pumps connected to the probes to
   inject micromolar concentration of neurotrophic factors such as GDNF
   into the brain in order to protect and restore dopaminergic neurons in
   the nigrostriatal pathway. The focus of this manuscript is on sensing,
   control and decision making circuitry. It consists of a current
   conveyer, a low noise low power amplifier, an integrator and a
   comparator with offset cancelation. Circuit is fabricated in CMOS 0.18
   um with low power consumption of 921 nW while maintaining a bandwidth of

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of prior assumptions in applications
   of full Bayes methods in road safety analysis. The effect of prior
   choice was evaluated in the accuracy of model parameters, hotspot
   identification, goodness of fit, and a treatment effectiveness index in
   before after studies. Particular attention was devoted to conditions
   with a lack of data, which were referenced as the low-mean and
   small-sample problem. In this research, informative, semi-informative,
   and noninformative priors were determined on the basis of past published
   studies. A simulation framework was used to evaluate various scenarios
   of sample size and crash occurrence mean. Quasi-simulated data were
   generated on the basis of two empirical databases of divided and
   undivided rural highway segments in New York and Texas. Various sample
   mean values were obtained on the basis of time period (number of years)
   and classifying accidents in fatal injury and total accidents. The
   outcomes under low-mean and small-sample conditions were found to be
   significantly biased. However, the introduction of informative priors
   can make observational before after studies feasible when a few
   observations from treatment or comparison sites are used. Informative
   priors can help provide more accurate estimates of the effectiveness of
   the treatment. Finally, in accordance with previous works, the inverse
   dispersion parameter was significantly affected by prior specifications;
   nevertheless, regression parameters, goodness of fit, and hotspot
   identification were less sensitive to prior choices.}},

Abstract = {{Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) has many advantages for high-voltage
   direct current (HVDC) transmission and to integrate renewable energy to
   the main grid. Recently, there are several MMC projects being planning
   or in development over the world. However, due to the fact that the MMC
   has a large number of sub-modules (SMs) and a sophisticated controller,
   there are high demands on simulation tools to validate its design. A
   digital real-time simulator can simulate the MMC system quickly and
   accurately, and is able to validate the real MMC controller through
   hardware-in-the-loop tests. The challenges are to have an accurate and
   efficient MMC model so the simulator can solve the system with large
   number of MMC SMs in a very small time step, below 25 mu s.
   In this paper, two MMC models implemented in standard INTEL multi-core
   CPU and FPGA for a faster-than-real-time and real-time simulation
   platform are presented. The model performance and accuracy are studied
   through a back-to-back MMC HVDC system, and compared to a reference
   model made by SimPowerSystems blocks in Matlab. It is demonstrated that
   the both models have high fidelity and an MMC system with as high as
   3000 SMs can be simulated in real time with a time step of 500
   nanoseconds using FPGA chips.}},

Abstract = {{Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), a multiple
   user access scheme based on the single carrier frequency domain
   equalization (SC-FDE) technique, has been proposed for the uplink in
   fourth generation (4G) mobile communications. SC-FDE requires reliable
   channel estimates to maintain an acceptable bit error rate (BER)
   performance. Much research focuses on the use of pilot symbols which
   reduces the spectral efficiency of SC-FDE systems. In this paper, we
   propose a subspace decomposition approach for semi-blind channel
   estimation in SC-FDE systems as a means to reduce or eliminate the need
   for pilot symbols and increase their overall spectral efficiency.
   Simulation results show that, under the conditions presented in this
   paper, a BER of 10(-3) can be achieved with a power loss of roughly 1 dB
   compared to a system with perfect channel estimates. This result is
   achieved with channel estimates that have a normalized mean square error
   (NMSE) less than 1\%.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral efficiency (SE) is one of the key performance indicators of
   wireless communications, and energy efficiency (EE) is an urgent need to
   tackle the challenges raised by the high demands of wireless traffics
   and energy consumption. However, these two important design criteria
   conflict with each other and a careful study of their trade-off is
   mandatory for designing future wireless communication systems. In this
   paper, we introduce an optimization problem to maximize the ergodic SE
   of a point-to-point communication link with a constraint on its minimum
   ergodic EE. We prove that, at optimality, the constraint on minimum EE
   is met with equality, and use it to provide a closed-form expression for
   finding the optimal water-filling level in a Nakagami-m fading channel
   with integer values of m. We exploit this formulation to investigate the
   relationship between SE and EE as a function of circuit power, power
   amplifier (PA) efficiency and channel power gain. We observe that the SE
   and EE always contradict with each other, however, the trade-off curve
   is non-linear. The curve is steeper at the extremities as compared to
   the middle region. Hence, a small sacrifice in EE from its maximum value
   may map into a significant gain in SE. Our simulations show that this
   gain in SE is a decreasing function of the circuit power and channel
   power gain while an increasing function of the PA efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a distributed joint subchannel and power allocation
   algorithm for the downlink of an orthogonal frequency-division multiple
   access (OFDMA) mixed femtocell/macrocell network deployment.
   Specifically, the total throughput of all femtocell user equipments
   (FUEs) is maximized while the network capacity of an existing macrocell
   is always protected. To this end, we employ an iterative process in
   which subchannels and transmit powers of base stations (BS) are
   alternatively assigned and optimized at every step. For a fixed power
   allocation, we prove that the optimal policy is to give each subchannel
   to the user with the highest data rate, or equivalently the highest
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), on that subchannel. For
   any given subchannel assignment, we apply the
   difference-of-concave-functions (d.c.) approach and transform the highly
   nonconvex program into a sequence of convex power allocation
   subproblems. We show that the developed iterative scheme converges to an
   optimal point. Importantly, we implement the devised solution by a
   decentralized algorithm, wherein each BS computes the optimal subchannel
   and power allocation for its own servicing cell. Numerical results
   confirm the merits of our proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the dynamic scheduling problems in wireless networks
   with delay-sensitive loss-tolerant users. The users' traffic satisfies
   some statistical delay constraints. Moreover, the traffic can be dropped
   but the dropping rates do not exceed some thresholds. We consider two
   scheduling scenarios. First, we study the problem to minimize the total
   transmission power while maintaining the minimum rates for the users.
   Then, we study the problem to maximize the minimum rate(s) of the users
   while constraining the maximum total power. We derive the optimal
   solutions for both scheduling problems. When the fading statistics are
   available, using the dual-gradient method, the optimal policies can be
   computed. When the fading statistics are unknown, this work proposes
   online scheduling algorithms using online time-averaging. The
   convergence and optimality of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed by
   the results in stochastic approximation theory.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we establish the achievable sum-rate of a half-duplex
   single-relay two-way amplify-and-forward network in which the relay uses
   channel knowledge of the two incoming links to cooperate with the two
   sources. Specifically, by assuming that the relay can acquire full
   channel knowledge and that Gaussian codebooks are used at the source
   nodes, the optimal power adaptation scheme at the relay that maximizes
   the achievable sum-rate under a long-term average power constraint is
   derived. While the maximization of the sum-rate is shown to be a convex
   optimization problem, obtaining optimal solutions are challenging. By
   using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we first show that finding the
   optimal relay adaptation scheme is equivalent to finding the root of a
   quartic polynomial. The closed-form optimal solutions are then obtained.
   Important insights on the proposed adaptation scheme are also presented
   and discussed. Numerical results reveal that the derived relay
   adaptation technique outperforms the conventional fixed-gain and
   variable-gain amplification coefficients at low signal-to-noise ratio
   regimes, thanks to the benefit of dynamic power allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Neighbor area network (NAN) is one of the most important segments of
   smart grid communications network (SGCN). This paper studies the
   performance of geographic-based greedy perimeter stateless routing
   (GPSR) in the NAN scenario and investigates the feasibility of this
   routing protocol in supporting SG applications. Specifically, packet
   transmission delay and reliability of GPSR in an IEEE 802.15.4-based
   wireless mesh NAN with practical system parameters are measured by
   simulations. The results show that, at the basic data rate, the delay
   can always be maintained below 70 ms (950/0 quartile) while packet
   delivery ratio is higher than 90\%. This means that the simulated NAN
   can support a great number of SG applications including smart metering,
   real-time pricing, demand response, etc. However, due to that fact that
   more advanced applications that require information exchange at higher
   rates and more stringent delays are emerging in SG, the performance of
   GPSR in NAN scenarios using various radio technologies with higher
   offered loads and/or larger network scales needs to be studied.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a probabilistic framework to infer the ongoing task in visual
   search by revealing what the subject is looking for during a search
   process. Based on the level of difficulty, two types of tasks, easy and
   difficult, are investigated in this work, and individual models are
   customized for them according to their specific dynamics. We use Hidden
   Markov Models (HMMs) to serve as a model for the human cognitive process
   that is responsible for directing the center of gaze (COG) according to
   the task at hand during visual search and generating task-dependent eye
   trajectories. This generative model, then, is used to estimate the
   likelihood term in a Bayesian inference formulation to infer the task
   given the eye trajectory. In the easy task, focus of attention (FOA)
   often lands on targets, whereas in the difficult one, in addition to the
   on-target foci of attention, deployment of attention on nontarget
   objects happens very often. Therefore, we suggest a single-state and a
   multi-state HMM to serve as the cognitive process model of attention for
   the easy and difficult tasks, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Processing tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is an economically
   important vegetable crop in southwestern Ontario. Processing tomato
   (cultivar H9553) fruit yield and quality were evaluated in field
   experiments in southwestern Ontario over a three-year period
   (2008-2010). A split-plot randomized complete block design with four
   blocks was used in 2008 and 2010. Irrigation types (buried and surface
   drip) served as the main plots, while four moisture depletion levels
   constituted the split plots. In 2009, a 2x4 factorial complete
   randomized block design with four blocks was used, with the same two
   factors. The moisture treatments represented the lower soil moisture
   triggers, which initiated irrigation scheduling. Irrigation was
   terminated for each treatment when field capacity was reached.
   Continuous soil moisture status over the growing season was monitored
   with a combination of volumetric and tensiometric sensors. Seven fruit
   quality parameters were monitored: fruit weight, color, pH, size,
   firmness, Brix yield, and soluble solids. In each year, the most
   stressed treatment produced the highest soluble solids (6.0, 4.8, and
   5.2 degrees Brix for 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively). Total and
   marketable fruit yields ranged from 91.9 to 121.1 Mg ha(-1) and from
   91.4 and 119.7 kg ha(-1), respectively. Statistical significance was
   obtained among treatments and irrigation types in 2008 only. Irrigation
   water use efficiency was also not statistically significant over the
   three years. Seasonal irrigation depth ranged from 58 to 196 mm, and
   statistical significance among the moisture treatments was obtained in
   2008 and 2010.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the linear transceiver design for the downlink
   of a cellular network assisted by a multi-antenna relay. A diagonal
   scaling scheme is proposed in which multiple single-antenna users apply
   different complex-valued scaling to their signals before decoding, as
   represented by an equivalent diagonal equalizer matrix. This equalizer
   is designed together with a linear precoder at the base station (BS) and
   a linear processing matrix at the relay. The objective is to minimize
   the weighted minimum mean square error (MMSE) between the precoder input
   and the equalizer output, subject to power constraints at the BS and the
   relay. In particular, the optimal relaying matrix is first derived in
   closed form as a function of the precoder and the equalizer. The latter
   two can then be jointly designed in an efficient iterative manner.
   Simulation results demonstrate lower biterror rates (BERs) than previous
   design methods.}},

Abstract = {{A novel joint TOA and AOA estimator is proposed for impulse radio
   Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) systems, in which a uniform linear array of

   two steps: (1) coarse estimation of the TOA and the average power delay
   profile; (2) joint TOA refinement and AOA estimation by maximization of
   a novel log likelihood function (LLF) using the coarse estimates from
   the first step. The derivation of the LLF is based on an original
   approach in which the pulse image from the primary path is modeled as a
   deterministic component while the superposition of the images from the
   secondary paths is modeled as a Gaussian random process. In addition, a
   special gating mechanism is used to characterize the secondary paths,
   thereby leading to a previously unknown form of the LLF in step (2).
   According to simulation experiments based on standard UWB channel
   models, our approach exhibits superior performance to that of a

   integrated system is evaluated both in terms of computational complexity
   and ASR word recognition accuracy. Further comparisons of ASR

Abstract = {{This paper considers the application of discriminative manifold learning
   approaches in feature analysis for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
   The issue of manifold learning is addressed for feature space
   dimensionality reduction in domains involving noise corrupted speech.
   The locality preserving discriminant analysis (LPDA) approach to
   manifold learning is investigated. This class of techniques exploits the
   assumption that there is a structural relationship among data vectors
   which can be maintained by preserving the local relationships among the
   transformed data vectors. The paper presents a procedure for reducing
   the impact of varying acoustic conditions on manifold learning. Noise
   aware manifold learning (NAML) is described as an approach for
   exploiting estimated background characteristics to define the size of
   the local neighborhoods used for LPDA feature space transformations. It
   is shown that NAML significantly reduces the speech recognition WER in a
   noisy speech recognition task over LPDA, particularly at low
   signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Abstract = {{An approach is proposed for adapting subspace projection vectors in the
   subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) {[}1]. Subword models in the SGMM
   are composed of states, each of which are parametrized using a small
   number of subspace projection vectors. It is shown here that these
   projection vectors provide a compact and well-behaved characterization
   of phonetic information in speech. A regression based subspace vector
   adaptation approach is proposed for adapting these parameters. The
   performance of this approach is evaluated for unsupervised speaker
   adaptation on two large vocabulary speech corpora.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the use of acoustic similarity of speech intervals for
   generating improved confidence scores for spoken term detection (STD) is
   investigated. A procedure based on acoustic dotplots which requires no
   training data is deployed for discovering similar speech intervals. A
   graph based random walk algorithm incorporates acoustic similarity of
   hypothesized term occurrences for improving the corresponding confidence
   scores. The proposed approach is evaluated in an open vocabulary STD
   task defined on a lecture domain corpus. It is shown that updating the
   confidence scores in this fashion results in a significant increase in
   term detection performance of out of vocabulary search terms. A relative
   improvement of 12.9\% in figure of merit was gained relative to that
   obtained from a baseline lattice based STD system.}},

   virtualization. Then, this paper proposes a wireless virtualization
   classification based on the type of virtualized resources and the depth
   of slicing. The three main perspectives identified are data and
   flow-based perspective, protocol-based perspective and spectrum-based
   perspective. A hypothetical ecosystem scenario of a future virtualized
   wireless infrastructure in which these perspectives coexist is explored.
   Finally, the challenges and requirements of a sustainable wireless

Abstract = {{A greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory is estimated at the household
   level from disaggregated trip data considering all emitting modes.
   Trip-level GHG emissions are estimated by combining data sources (e.g.,
   origin destination surveys, vehicle fleet characteristics, transit
   ridership data) and by using modeling tools (traffic assignment and GHG
   models) developed for Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A simultaneous equation
   model framework is implemented to investigate links between urban form,
   transit supply, sociodemographics, and travel GHGs, taking into account
   the issue of residential self-selection. The potential impacts of land
   use and transit supply strategies with emerging green technology
   scenarios are then compared with each other. Findings are consistent
   with the literature; built environment attributes are statistically
   significant (10\% increase in density, transit accessibility, and land
   use mix results in 3.5\%, 5.8\%, and 2.5\% GHG reductions,
   respectively), and the number of workers and retirees make important
   contributions to GHG emissions at the household level (102\% increase
   from adding one worker and 51\% decrease from adding one retiree). Also,
   if the current transit fleet were replaced with electric trains and
   hybrid buses, transit GHGs would decrease by 32\%. If current trends
   persist in the private motor vehicle fleet, continued improvements in
   car fuel economy are estimated to reduce car GHGs 7\% by 2020. The two
   most effective strategies for reducing regional and household GHGs
   appear to be to improve the fuel efficiency of the private motor vehicle
   fleet and to increase transit accessibility.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{1-68}},
Abstract = {{Using a variational approach, the Euler-Lagrange equations of an open
   lipid bilayer subject to forces and couples distributed on its surface
   and edge are derived. Both constant and geometry-dependent edge-energy
   densities are considered. For the second of these alternatives, the
   edge-energy density is a general function of the normal and geodesic
   curvatures and geodesic torsion of the edge. Focusing on a generic
   segment of the edge, the global forms of the force and moment balances
   and the free-energy imbalance are stated and their local counterparts
   are derived. While the force and moment balances lead to the governing
   equations of the edge element under internal and external loads, the
   free-energy imbalance provides a mechanism for ensuring the
   thermodynamic compatibility of constitutive relations. Inspired by
   various experimental and theoretical studies showing the importance of
   dissipative mechanisms at the edge of an open lipid bilayer, the
   internal force and moment are decomposed into elastic and viscous parts.
   Considering the geometry-dependent edge-energy density and following the
   Coleman-Noll procedure, constitutive relations for the elastic
   contributions to the internal moment and tangential component of the
   internal force are derived. Additionally, the constitutive relations for
   the viscous contributions to the internal force and moment are
   restricted by a reduced dissipation inequality. In the purely elastic
   regime, it is shown that the governing equations for the edge arising
   from augmenting the force and moment balances with thermodynamically
   compatible constitutive relations reduce to the Euler-Lagrange equations
   previously obtained on variational grounds.}},

   reduced performance. To achieve the bench mark quality of autoclave
   structures, flow and compaction phenomena occurring during the
   consolidation of OOA materials have to be well understood in order to
   bring process and material parameters into optimal agreement. A basic

Abstract = {{Delamination growth in a double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen made of a
   five harness satin weave fabric composite is simulated by a multiscale
   finite element model in order to provide a better understanding of
   toughening mechanism of fabric composites. To accomplish this, a
   meso-scale model of five harness satin weave fabric composite is placed
   at the delamination zone in order to model the toughening caused by the
   fabric structure. R-curves and load-displacement curves from the
   analyses are compared with those of experiments which agree with the
   lower bound of experimental results. The numerical results revealed two
   major types of toughening mechanisms: 1) inter-yarn locking causing
   stress relaxation at delamination front 2) the creation of sub-surfaces
   via weft yarn bridging which is observed after the delamination grows.
   By including and observing these two toughening mechanisms, a more
   realistic simulation of delamination in fabric composites is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The FBG cavity sensor was invented to measure and trend End Winding
   Vibrations (SEW) inside larger power generators. The sensor consists of
   a twin grating cavity which can be used to monitor vibration as well as
   temperature change by changing the center wavelength of the transmitting
   laser to track the movement of the interference fringes. This paper will
   discuss the adaptation of this FBG cavity structure to measure much
   higher frequency signals like those found in Partial Discharge (PD)
   events. Special package design is necessary to maintain the signal to
   noise ratio as the high frequency PD signal propagates along the
   conductor inside the stator slots to the end windings. The challenge
   would be the coupling of these signals to our PD sensors. They will be
   mounted at the same locations where SEW sensors would be installed for
   end winding vibration. We would select the windings with the highest
   induced voltage hence most susceptible to PD. By trending the vibration
   amplitude related to loading, we would be able to diagnose each winding
   structure has become loose. These sensing channels would be correlated
   with PD amplitudes as well as their signature; more work would be
   required to relate the signature to the degradation process of the
   insulation layer. By measuring time of arrival differences at both ends
   of the generator, we can estimate which slot is associated with the
   discharge event. The addition of the PD sensor to vibration and
   temperature capability makes TG Guard a comprehensive solution for
   safeguarding the generator; its diagnostic capability would also shorten
   maintenance time and reduced the required resources. Owner would know
   exactly what to do by integrating all the trending data.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber optics vibration sensors have been extensively studied over the
   last ten years they have mainly been used to capture low frequency
   signals. One of these investigations has been commercialized to measure
   and trend End Winding Vibration (SEW) inside larger power generators.
   This sensor consists of a twin grating cavity and can be used to monitor
   temperature change as well as vibration. This paper will discuss the
   adaptation of the FBG cavity structure into a broad band sensor capable
   of measuring a range of higher frequencies previously identified as PD
   signals in the transformer from 30K to 300 KHz. Other work has been done
   to explore the possibility of developing a fiber optics acoustic sensor.
   The incentive is to overcome the limitation of the resonant based,
   acoustic, piezoelectric PD sensors previously used to analyze and locate
   PD. Working in resonance, they are unable to reveal the detailed
   spectrum or the signature of the PD events. We want to improve the
   packaging material and structure, then optimize the coupling methods to
   enhance its signal to noise ratio. All our work is still based on the
   fiber gratings cavity structure.}},

Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},

Pages = {{2233-2241}},
Abstract = {{The formation of strain-induced ferrite was investigated in two low
   carbon steels and in a 0.036\% Nb microalloyed low carbon steel at
   temperatures above the Ae3. Two distinct stages were observed, the first
   of which was characterized by the formation of Widmanstatten colonies
   with very fine plates of similar orientation. In the second stage,
   observed after further straining, the initial plates coalesced into
   polygonal ferrite grains. The transition from stage Ito stage II was
   retarded by additions of carbon and niobium and slightly by an increase
   in strain rate. EBSD analysis revealed that the small misorientations
   (<1.5) between Widmanstatten plates allow them to coalesce into grains.
   The 60 misorientations between some of the colonies suggest that they
   form from twinned regions of the parent austenite. A common
   characteristic of the polygonal grains is the presence of planar high
   angle boundaries, a feature inherited from the original Widmanstatten
   microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{A low-power Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) is introduced employing a
   new mechanism for associativity between the input tags and the
   corresponding address of the output data. The proposed architecture is
   based on a recently developed clustered-sparse network using
   binary-weighted connections that on-average will eliminate most of the
   parallel comparisons performed during a search. Therefore, the dynamic
   energy consumption of the proposed design is significantly lower
   compared to that of a conventional low-power CAM design. Given an input
   tag, the proposed architecture computes a few possibilities for the
   location of the matched tag and performs the comparisons on them to
   locate a single valid match. A 0.13 mu m CMOS technology was used for
   simulation purposes. The energy consumption and the search delay of the
   proposed design are 9.5\%, and 30.4\% of that of the conventional NAND
   architecture respectively with a 3.4\% higher number of transistors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous
   ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) for Network Intrusion
   Detection Systems (NIBS). The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect
   packet payloads as ``virus free{''} by inspecting only a few bytes.
   Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly
   reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing
   robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus
   pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a
   bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining
   complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is
   sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability
   of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces
   from MIT DARPA. A 2048 x 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using
   TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1\% lower and
   the cycle time is 52.4\% lower than those of a deep-pipelined
   synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that
   the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47\% variations (3 sigma) of threshold
   voltages.}},

Abstract = {{Non-metallic inclusions have always been the active subject of
   steelmaking research to improve the steel cleanliness and to develop the
   so-called oxide metallurgy technology. Inclusions in molten steel form
   and grow by the sequence of nucleation, chemical and physical growth and
   removal. Thus, the size distribution of inclusions evolves continuously
   with time in molten steel, and significant changes in the steel
   conditions are reflected in the inclusion size distribution as well as
   in the inclusion chemistry. This study aims to provide a new approach to
   interpret the inclusion size distributions. The concept of the
   Population Density Function (PDF) is introduced to objectively represent
   a given inclusion size distribution. Several possible applications of
   PDF analysis are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the
   utilization of the PDF for understanding the inclusion formation
   mechanism during the steelmaking process. Several ambitious ideas to
   utilize the PDF for inclusion size control are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a robust performance H-infinity controller for
   autonomous (stand-alone) operation of a four-wire distributed generation
   (DG) unit. The controller is designed to provide robustness against
   system and load parametric uncertainties as well as a worst-case
   performance guarantee for voltage disturbance rejection. The proposed
   control strategy employs: 1) an internal oscillator to maintain the
   frequency of the island; and 2) a feedback control system to regulate
   the voltage of the island. A robust performance mu-synthesized
   controller is designed using the D - K iteration technique. The
   performance of the proposed robust controller is compared to a standard
   PID controller and a ``PI-type-3{''} controller under varying system and
   load conditions. The superiority of the proposed control strategy is
   demonstrated using time-domain simulations carried out on a single-DG
   test system in MATLAB/Simulink (R) environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the use of the Conic Sector Theorem for both
   stability analysis and controller design. Ensuring input-output
   stability of plants experiencing passivity violations is the motivation
   behind this work. Given a previously designed controller and plant that
   has experienced a (partially unknown) passivity violation, a novel
   sector bound selection procedure is presented. This procedure can be
   used to assess input-output stability of the violated plant and original
   controller via the Conic Sector Theorem. Should input-output stability
   not be ensured, two original controller synthesis methods are suggested:
   one is designed to mimic the H-2 controller, and the other is inspired
   by strictly positive real controller synthesis. Both methods guarantee
   input-output stability by selecting controllers within appropriate conic
   sectors, and involve only the evaluation of readily solvable linear
   matrix inequalities and algebraic Riccati inequalities. A numerical
   simulation is provided as a proof of concept.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetically-biased graphene supports strong Faraday rotation at
   microwave frequencies. Contrary to other gyrotropic media, such as
   ferrites, Faraday rotation in graphene can be fully controlled via an
   electrostatic potential between graphene and a parallel electrode, while
   the static magnetic bias is kept constant. Based on Faraday rotation in
   graphene, the first graphene-based waveguide isolator is presented. An
   analytical model is developed and shown to exhibit excellent agreement
   with experiment. The performance of the isolator, which strongly depends
   on the mobility of graphene, is acceptable with the existing technology
   and is expected to satisfy commercial requirements as the quality of
   grown graphene improves in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising
   technology for high data rate transmission, that is widely used in
   modern wireless communication systems because of its suitability for
   frequency selective channels. However channel time variations destroy
   the orthogonality between sub-carriers resulting in Inter-Carrier
   Interference (ICI), that degrades performance in OFDM. Various
   techniques have been considered to mitigate the effects of ICI. In our
   work, we consider OFDM as a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system
   in the frequency domain, and employ corresponding detection techniques
   that provide good performance despite the presence of ICI. As ICI is
   mainly contributed by a limited number of adjacent sub-carriers, the
   frequency domain channel matrix can be approximated as banded. This work
   introduces a reduced complexity Sphere Decoder (SD) for OFDM
   demodulation that is based on such banded matrix assumption. It is shown
   that the proposed algorithm provides performance and complexity
   advantages over competing detection techniques based on the Viterbi
   Algorithm (VA) operating in the frequency domain.}},

Abstract = {{Common neuron firing rate estimators have been criticized because of
   their Poisson assumption, not accounting for the refractory period of
   action potentials that induces history dependency in spike sequences.
   Hence rate estimators that can account for such dependency, although
   seemingly more difficult to formulate, could provide more accurate
   results. In this paper a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator for an
   inhomogeneous Poisson process is modified to account for an absolute
   refractory period in the spike sequence. The proposed estimator treats
   the refractory period as a nuisance parameter and maximizes the profile
   likelihood of the stimulus. Through computer simulations we show that by
   exploiting the refractory phenomenon, the estimator can achieve better
   performance than the Poisson estimator for moderate to high firing
   rates. Furthermore, we show that the results provided by this estimator
   yield an improved goodness of fit to real data when compared to the
   Poisson estimator.}},

Abstract = {{Missisquoi Bay, located in southern Quebec at the north-eastern
   extremity of Lake Champlain, is subject to eutrophication arising from
   excess nutrients, predominantly phosphorus (P), contributed by
   agricultural watersheds. Factors such as land use pattern, management
   practices, soil properties and geomorphology have an impact on soil P
   levels. Land patches under different management practices introduce a
   cyclic pattern, especially when fitting the variogram. Geostatistics
   procedures were used to model soil test phosphorus (STP) within the 11
   km(2) Castor Watershed in southern Quebec, Canada. An ordinary kriging
   (OK) method was used to estimate STP at unsampled points, but this had a
   smoothing effect, resulting in an underestimation of high values and
   overestimation of low values. Therefore, a more efficient technique was
   needed to draw predictions from the conditional probability distribution
   at the simulation grid nodes. A sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) was
   adopted for this purpose, and used to create 50 equal probable
   realizations. Uncertainty was modelled using the E-type (mean) of the
   realizations, which ranged from 12.5 to 223 mg P kg(-1) soil. The
   adequate spatial probability pattern for STP is a valuable criterion
   when seeking to delineate areas of high STP for site-specific best
   management practices (BMPs).}},

Title = {{Evaluation of WARMF model for flow and nitrogen transport in an
   agricultural watershed under a cold climate}},
Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{400-413}},
Abstract = {{The Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework (WARMF) model is
   adapted to simulate flow and nitrate-N transport in an agricultural
   watershed in Quebec, Canada. The model was evaluated for the St. Esprit
   Watershed (24.3 km(2)), which is a part of the 210 km(2) St. Esprit
   river basin, a tributary of the L'Assomption Watershed (4,220 km(2)).
   WARMF's hydrologic calibration and validation was performed using data
   from the gauge station located at the outlet of the watershed.
   Water-quality data collected were used to guide water quality
   calibration/validation. Simulations were carried out from 1994 to 1996;
   data from 1994 and 1995 were used for model calibration and data from
   1996 were used for model validation. The model performed reasonably well
   in simulating the hydrologic response and nitrate losses at the outlet
   of the watershed. The R-2 between the observed and simulated monthly
   stream flow for calibration was 0.92, and that for validation was 0.94.
   The corresponding coefficients of efficiency (E) were 0.89 and 0.91. The
   R-2 and E values for calibration/validation of NO3--N loads simulation

Abstract = {{This work studies the power optimal dynamic scheduling problem in
   multi-channel multi-user wireless access networks. Users have
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements on the minimum rates with
   statistical delay guarantees. Only one user is allowed to transmit over
   a channel in a given time slot. This work considers two scenarios:
   homogeneous and heterogeneous users. For the former scenario, the
   optimal scheduling policy can be derived, and an online scheduling
   algorithm for the optimal policy is proposed using online time-averaging
   without requiring a-priori known fading statistics. For the latter
   scenario, the optimal scheduling problem is combinatorially hard; hence,
   even when the fading statistics are available, computing the optimal
   policy is intractable. Consequently, this work develops a sub-optimal
   online scheduling algorithm with linear complexity which does not
   require a-priori known fading statistics. Moreover, the scheduling
   algorithm satisfies the QoS constraints for the users. Illustrative
   results demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheduling
   algorithms in various settings.}},

Abstract = {{Challenges of the existing power grid demand the integration of
   information and communication technologies into the next-generation
   electric grid, namely the Smart Grid (SG). This paper focuses on the
   critical communications segment corresponding to the consumer-premise,
   the Neighbor Area Network (NAN). For this segment, Greedy Perimeter
   Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol is considered for its low complexity
   and high scalability. In order to provide guidelines for SG
   communications system designers and network engineers, the performance
   of GPSR in terms of throughput, latency and scalability is investigated
   with parametric sweeps of transmission range, data rate and the number
   of Smart Meters (SMs) per Data Aggregation Point (DAP). The simulation
   results show that network throughput of hundreds of times the rate
   required for basic SG applications (e. g., meter reading, service
   switch, ... ) can be achieved while the end-to-end delay can always be
   maintained below 100 ms. However, the converge-cast nature of the uplink
   traffic severely limits the SM-to-DAP ratio. Thus, with GPSR at the NAN
   level, emerging SG applications such as smart metering, real-time
   pricing, demand response, etc., can be supported.}},

Abstract = {{This paper characterizes the multicell precoding game where
   block-diagonalization (BD)-based precoding is utilized on a per-cell
   basis for downlink transmissions. Sharing the same frequency band, the
   base-station (BS) at each cell wishes to maximize the sum-rate for its
   connected mobile-stations (MS) with BD precoding. In this context, the
   paper considers a strategic non-cooperative game (SNG), where each BS
   greedily determines its precoding strategy in a distributed manner,
   based on the knowledge of the inter-cell interference (ICI) at its
   connected MSs. Via the game-theory framework, the existence and
   uniqueness of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this multicell game are
   subsequently studied. It is shown that there always exists at least one
   pure NE in the game, whereas the uniqueness of the NE is guaranteed
   under a certain condition on the ICI. The paper also characterizes the
   multicell precoding game where BD-Dirty Paper Coding (BD-DPC) is
   utilized at each BS on a per-cell basis. Simulation results then confirm
   our analysis on the NE's uniqueness in the BD and BD-DPC multicell
   precoding games.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a low-complexity adaptive transceiver algorithm
   for the K-pair multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference
   channels. The proposed algorithm is based on the joint optimization of
   transmit and receive vectors using the constrained constant modulus
   (CCM) criterion. We firstly derive CCM-based expressions for the
   transmit and receiver vectors. Then, we develop recursive least-squares
   (RLS) adaptive algorithms for their efficient implementation. Unlike
   earlier block-based transceivers for MIMO interference channels, the
   proposed algorithms have low computational complexity and can track the
   time-varying channels and interference as changes occur in the
   surrounding wireless environment. In particular, simulation results show
   that the proposed adaptive algorithms achieve the performance of the
   Sum-MSE algorithm at a much reduced complexity.(1)}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of dynamic
   precipitation on the hot deformation behaviour of magnesium. Mg-Al-Sn
   alloys have been designed using thermodynamic modeling software,
   FactSage, based on precipitation of Mg2Sn at hot deformation
   temperatures. Uniaxial compression has been introduced at the
   temperature range of 250-350 degrees C to enhance the formation of
   precipitates. The flow behaviour and microstructural evolvement were
   studied for a strain rate of 0.01 /s and deformation degree of 90 \%.
   Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurs in this study and it is found
   that the volume percent of dynamic recrystallization and dynamically
   recrystallized grain size are related to the amount of precipitation
   formed during deformation. The formation of Mg2Sn precipitates during
   the dynamic recrystallization process may retard the dynamic
   recrystallization and slow down the grain growth by precipitation
   pinning effect at the DRX grain boundaries, resulting in a finer grain
   size.}},

Title = {{Effect of chitosan incorporation on the consolidation process of highly
   hydrated collagen hydrogel scaffolds}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{45}},
Pages = {{10811-10821}},
Abstract = {{Collagenous body tissues exhibit diverse physicochemical and
   biomechanical properties depending upon their compositions (e. g.
   proteins, polysaccharides, minerals and water). These factors influence
   cell function and can contribute to tissue dysfunction and disease when
   they are either deficient or present in excess. Similarly, the
   constituents of tissue engineering hydrogel scaffolds must be carefully
   considered for the optimal design of engineered constructs for
   therapeutic applications. As a natural polysaccharide
   glycosaminoglycan-analog, chitosan (CTS) holds potential for generating
   highly hydrated collagen type I hydrogel (Coll) based scaffolds that
   mimic the native extracellular matrix. Analysis of fluid loss in CollCTS
   hydrogels undergoing either a gravity-driven consolidation process
   (self-compression; SC) or plasticcompression (PC) offers the potential
   for the controlled production of tissue-equivalent dense hydrogels with
   tailored physical and mechanical properties. Herein, the effect of CTS
   on Coll gels microstructural evolution involved in SC and PC was
   investigated by detecting the spatiotemporal distribution of fluorescent
   beads within Coll-CTS hydrogels using confocal microscopy. The hydraulic
   permeability (k), pre-and post-consolidation, as a function of CTS
   content, was estimated by the Happel model. The effect of CTS fixed
   charge on dense Coll-CTS hydrogels was investigated through structural,
   mechanical and swelling characterizations under isotonic and hypertonic
   conditions. Image analysis revealed a temporal increase in bead density,
   with both rate and extent of consolidation, correlating strongly with
   increasing CTS content. k decreased from 1.4 x 10(-12) to 1.8 x 10(-13)
   m(2) and from 2.9 x 10(-14) to 6.8 x 10(-15) m(2) for highly hydrated
   and dense hydrogels, respectively, with higher amount of CTS, resulting
   in a concomitant increase in the scaffold compressive modulus (from 7.65
   to 14.89 kPa). In summary, understanding the effect of CTS on Coll
   hydrogel properties enables the development of tailored scaffolds for
   use as tissue models for various biomedical applications.}},

Title = {{Numerical Optimization of Nozzle Ports to Improve the Fluidynamics by
   Controlling Backflow in a Continuous Casting Slab Mold}},
Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1794-1802}},
Abstract = {{In order to improve the fluid flow patterns inside the mold, a better
   understanding of the backflow phenomenon and its controlling parameters
   is necessary; then a mathematical simulation of the fluidynamics in the
   mold and the submerge entry nozzle (SEN) are carried out considering two
   typical nozzle designs and different modifications applied to the outlet
   ports. The numerical model considers isothermal three dimensional
   continuity and the Navier-Stokes equations in Cartesian co-ordinates,
   which are solved together with the k-epsilon standard turbulence and the
   Volume of Fluid (VOF) models through the volume finite method. The
   results show that the backflow phenomenon emerges from an inadequate SEN
   port design, when a boundary layer separation is generated before the
   steel is delivered to the mold. This separation occurs at the upper
   internal side of the port inducing a low pressure zone with high levels
   of kinetic energy dissipation, producing the backflow phenomenon. From
   the analysis, it is concluded that the implementation of a radius at the
   internal upper side of the port avoids the separation of the boundary
   layer, eliminating the backflow phenomenon which allows the use of the
   complete effective exit area of the port; this is reflected in a
   velocity decrease of the jets and consequently a velocity decrement of
   the bulk flow. Furthermore, the size of the radius controls the
   penetration angle of the jets, the impact point position and the
   meniscus deformation; which avoids the need of the inclination angle of
   the port.}},

   ordered phases}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{10335-10342}},
Abstract = {{Mesophase-particle mixtures are emerging functional material systems
   whose structure, dynamics and formation through phase transitions are
   poorly understood. In this paper, novel phase transitions in a system of
   coupled conserved and non-conserved order parameters - a mixture of
   liquid crystals and nanoparticles - are studied via phase-field
   modelling, under conditions where an intermediate phase, which is
   unstable to composition fluctuations, can be formed between the initial
   supercooled phase and the new stable phase. This paper analyzes the
   formation, stability and evolution of this intermediate phase and how it
   impacts the transformation of an isotropic phase when it is quenched
   with single and double temperature jumps to form a calamitic nematic
   phase. It is found that the intermediate phase forms through a
   front-splitting mechanism and grows for some time, but eventually decays
   through a spinodal decomposition starting at the interface and
   propagating to the bulk, producing a moving oscillating front. It is
   found that this phenomenon can be triggered solely by the presence of
   the interface even in the absence of composition fluctuations in the
   bulk. Spinodal decomposition initiated by thermal fluctuations also
   generates a moving oscillating front (because the intermediate phase was
   formed by a moving front). As a consequence, the velocity of the moving
   front changes from a small value at short time (interface-induced
   spinodal), to a large value at some finite time (moving bulk spinodal).
   The effect of a double quench was also analyzed and it was found that
   the oscillating front can be confined to a region close to the interface
   ({''}mushy{''} region), and the isotropic phase (originally of infinite
   extension) can be confined to a region close to the oscillating front,
   generating a very atypical phase morphology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze and compare several encoding and decoding

   compress-forward (CF) relaying at the destinations. For the decoding
   techniques, we compare backward and sliding window decoding at both
   destinations. We prove that the achievable rate regions obtained with QF
   and CF relaying are the same as long as the same decoding technique is
   used by the destinations. We also show that with backward decoding, QF
   and CF relaying techniques achieve the same rate region as that obtained
   by the HK with noisy network coding (NNC) scheme. Therefore, QF relaying
   is the preferred scheme because it is simpler than both CF relaying and
   NNC and still leads to the same rate region. Furthermore, we provide
   numerical results for the Gaussian channel. These results show that
   destination cooperation is more efficient in strong IC than in weak IC.
   Also, if the destinations have enough powers or the inter-destination
   links are very strong, sliding window decoding achieves almost the same
   rate region as backward decoding while having a much shorter decoding
   delay.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows that the capacity of the relay channel can be
   asymptotically achieved by allowing relay-destination cooperation.
   Consider a scheme with rate splitting and second-order superposition
   block Markov encoding at the source, partial decode-forward (PDF)
   relaying and joint decoding over two consecutive blocks at the relay,
   and quantize-forward relaying and backward decoding at the destination.
   This scheme includes as special cases the classical PDF scheme and the
   destination feedback scheme of the relay channel. In Gaussian channels,
   the proposed scheme outperforms noisy network coding scheme except for
   weak source-relay link. For all channel gains, it asymptotically
   achieves the capacity by reaching the cutset bound as the destination
   power approaches infinity.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of inferring the topology of an M-by-N network
   by sending probes between M sources and N receivers. Prior work has
   shown that this problem can be decomposed into two parts: first, infer
   smaller subnetwork components (i.e., 1-by-N's or 2-by-2's) and then
   merge these components to identify the M-by-N topology. In this paper,
   we focus on the second part. In particular, we assume that a 1-by-N
   topology is given and that all 2-by-2 components can be queried and
   learned using end-to-end probes. The problem is which 2-by-2's to query
   and how to merge them with the 1-by-N, so as to exactly identify the
   2-by-N topology, and optimize a number of performance metrics including
   measurement traffic, time complexity, and memory usage. We provide a
   lower bound, {[}N/2], on the number of 2-by-2's required by any active
   learning algorithm and we also propose a greedy algorithm that is
   near-optimal and efficient in practice. It follows a bottom-up approach:
   at every step, it selects two receivers, queries the corresponding
   2-by-2, and merges it with the given 1-by-N. The algorithm requires
   exactly N 1 steps, which is much less than all (N/2) possible 2-by-2's,
   and it correctly identifies the 2-by-N topology.}},

Abstract = {{Cu-doped 45S5 bioactive glasses with varying Cu contents were fabricated
   and used to process 3D porous scaffolds via the foam replica technique.
   Cu-doping results in the weakening of the glass network and a decrease
   in its glass transition temperature. Acellular in vitro studies revealed
   very high bioactivity independent of Cu doping as indicated by the fast
   formation of a carbonated hydroxyapatite layer (CHA) on scaffold
   surfaces after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF). The kinetics of
   the glass-ceramic scaffold's transition to an amorphous calcium
   phosphate layer (ACP) and the crystallisation of CHA were explored by
   FT-IR and SEM analyses. The elemental distribution in the scaffold/fluid
   interface region was monitored by the advanced micro-PIXE-RBS (particle
   induced X-ray emission/Rutherford backscattering spectrometry) method.
   Cu-containing glasses showed slower release of Si, Ca and P from the
   scaffold periphery, whereas traces of Cu were found incorporated in the
   CaP layer on the scaffold surface. Cu release kinetics from the
   scaffolds in SBF were found to depend on culturing conditions while
   highest Cu concentrations of similar to 3.1 ppm and similar to 4.6 ppm
   under static and quasi-dynamic conditions, respectively, were observed.
   Since Cu exhibits potential angiogenic and osteogenic properties, the
   Cu-containing scaffolds are suggested as promising materials for bone
   tissue engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by experimental and numerical studies revealing that discoidal
   high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles may adopt flat elliptical and
   nonplanar saddle-like configurations, it is hypothesized that these
   might represent stabilized configurations of initially unstable flat
   circular particles. A variational description is developed to explore
   the stability of a flat circular discoidal HDL particle. While the lipid
   bilayer is modeled as two-dimensional fluid film endowed with surface
   tension and bending elasticity, the apoA-I belt is modeled as
   one-dimensional inextensible twist-free chain endowed with bending
   elasticity. Stability is investigated using the second variation of the
   underlying energy functional. Various planar and nonplanar instability
   modes are predicted and corresponding nondimensional critical values of
   salient dimensionless parameters are obtained. The results predict that
   the first planar and nonplanar unstable modes occur due to in-plane
   elliptical and transverse saddle-like perturbations. Based on available
   data, detailed stability diagrams indicate the range of input parameters
   for which a flat circular discoidal HDL particle is linearly stable or
   unstable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the sensitive, selective, and simultaneous
   detection of four protein biomarkers involved in metastasis of various
   cancers, namely Fas, angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), human epidermal growth
   factor receptor 2 (HER2), and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) using an
   antibody-conjugated quantum dot (QD) chip and surface plasmon resonance
   imaging (SPRi) biosensors. Initially, a self-assembled monolayer film of
   L-cysteine, using glutaraldehyde as a linker and QDs as signal
   enhancement moieties, was employed to immobilize anti-Fas for the
   detection of Fas as a model protein in buffer. The biointerface was
   characterized using confocal microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and
   scanning electron microscopy to provide evidence of uniform surface
   coverage by the QDs. The SPRi signal was enhanced 100-fold to achieve a
   detection limit of 25 pg mL(-1) after applying biotinylated detection
   antibody-conjugate streptavidin-modified QDs. Secondly, this signal
   amplification strategy was applied to sequentially detect Fas, HER2,
   MMP-9, and Ang-2 at low concentrations on a
   protein-microprinted/gold-coated SPRi chip. The results showed the
   absence of cross-reactivity among these proteins and the feasibility of
   the approach for multiplex detection of biomarkers as required for the
   accurate diagnosis of various diseases.}},

   from capillary elements}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4180-4189}},
Abstract = {{Microfluidic capillary systems employ surface tension effects to
   manipulate liquids, and are thus self-powered and self-regulated as
   liquid handling is structurally and chemically encoded in microscale
   conduits. However, capillary systems have been limited to perform simple
   fluidic operations. Here, we introduce complex capillary flow circuits
   that encode sequential flow of multiple liquids with distinct flow rates
   and flow reversal. We first introduce two novel microfluidic capillary
   elements including (i) retention burst valves and (ii) robust low aspect
   ratio trigger valves. These elements are combined with flow resistors,
   capillary retention valves, capillary pumps, and open and closed
   reservoirs to build a capillary circuit that, following sample addition,
   autonomously delivers a defined sequence of multiple chemicals according
   to a preprogrammed and predetermined flow rate and time. Such a circuit
   was used to measure the concentration of C-reactive protein. This work
   illustrates that as in electronics, complex capillary circuits may be
   built by combining simple capillary elements. We define such circuits as
   ``capillarics'', and introduce symbolic representations. We believe that
   more complex circuits will become possible by expanding the library of
   building elements and formulating abstract design rules.}},

Title = {{Comparison of cytotoxicity and expression of metal regulatory genes in
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) liver cells exposed to cadmium sulfate, zinc
   sulfate and quantum dots}},
Journal = {{METALLOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{1411-1422}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in the ability to manufacture and manipulate materials
   at the nanometer scale have led to increased production and use of many
   types of nanoparticles. Quantum dots (QDs) are small, fluorescent
   nanoparticles composed of a core of semiconductor material (e.g. cadmium
   selenide, zinc sulfide) and shells or dopants of other elements.
   Particle core composition, size, shell, and surface chemistry have all
   been found to influence toxicity in cells. The aim of this study was to
   compare the toxicities of ionic cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) and Cd- and
   Zn-containing QDs in zebrafish liver cells (ZFL). As expected, Cd2+ was
   more toxic than Zn2+, and the general trend of IC50-24 h values of QDs
   was determined to be CdTe < CdSe/ZnS or InP/ZnS, suggesting that
   ZnS-shelled CdSe/ZnS QDs were more cytocompatible than bare core CdTe
   crystals. Smaller QDs showed greater toxicity than larger QDs. Isolated
   mRNA from these exposures was used to measure the expression of metal
   response genes including metallothionein (MT), metal response
   element-binding transcription factor (MTF-1), divalent metal transporter
   (DMT-1), zrt and irt like protein (ZIP-1) and the zinc transporter,
   ZnT-1. CdTe exposure induced expression of these genes in a dose
   dependent manner similar to that of CdSO4 exposure. However, CdSe/ZnS
   and InP/ZnS altered gene expression of metal homeostasis genes in a
   manner different from that of the corresponding Cd or Zn salts. This
   implies that ZnS shells reduce QD toxicity attributed to the release of
   Cd2+, but do not eliminate toxic effects caused by the nanoparticles
   themselves.}},

Abstract = {{The development of miniaturized Golay cell arrays would enable the
   combination of the high sensitivity of a Golay cell with the imaging
   capability of focal plane arrays. The critical component of a
   miniaturized Golay cell is the deflecting membrane, which must
   simultaneously have a high breaking strength and a low flexural
   rigidity. Graphene suits this purpose ideally on account of its high
   strength and atomic thickness, in contrast with thicker polymeric
   membranes. Low flexural rigidity is critical to deflection sensitivity
   in response to temperature changes of the gas enclosed within a Golay
   cell scaled to the 10 mu m to 100 mu m scale. We report here a simple
   method for fabrication of suspended graphene membranes suitable for
   Golay cells. The technique is based on chemical vapour deposition of
   graphene on copper, followed by a sacrificial etch of the copper
   substrate. By this organic-free technique, graphene can be suspended
   over 10 - 20 mu m apertures in copper thin films free of surface
   contamination and with high structural integrity. The cavities are
   sealed on the back-side with an indium film to produce
   proof-of-principle miniature cells with a flexible, suspended graphene
   membrane. Atomic force microscopy enables the force versus deflection
   curve of a graphene-enclosed cell to be characterized. We further report
   the temperature dependent equilibrium deflection (up to 60 degrees C) of
   a graphene-enclosed cell by atomic force microscopy measurements taken
   with heat directly applied to the cell substrate.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{160}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{F731-F743}},
Abstract = {{A pore network model of the gas diffusion layer of PEMFCs is presented.
   Unlike previous attempts based on cubic lattices, this model has a
   random 3D architecture based on Delaunay tessellations to represent the
   pore space and Voronoi tessellations to represent the fiber structure.
   Very few input parameters are required to generate the model. Fiber
   diameter is specified, the number of pores per unit volume is adjusted
   to achieve a desired porosity, and the network is scaled to impart some
   in-plane vs. through-plane anisotropy. The resulting network possesses
   physical properties (such as pore and throat size) and transport
   properties (such as effective diffusivity tensor) that are in excellent
   agreement with available values. Capillary pressure curve simulations
   were compared with mercury and water injection data. Good agreement with
   the former was attained if the equivalent throat diameter was used in
   the calculation of entry pressures. Comparisons to water injection data
   were very poor unless the converging-diverging geometry of the throat
   was considered, in which case very close agreement was achieved. A
   relatively simple analytical equation was used to account for the throat
   geometry and its use is strongly recommended over the traditionally used
   equation for cylindrical capillary tubes. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical

Title = {{Neural network approach to sizing an electrical machine}},

   ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The conventional starting point for the design of an
   electrical machine (or any low-frequency electromagnetic device) is
   known as ``sizing{''}. In this process, a simple magnetic circuit is
   used to estimate the main geometric parameters. This does not work for
   many devices, particularly where eddy currents and non-linearity
   dominate. The purpose of this paper is to investigate an approach using
   a neural network trained on a large database of existing designs as a
   general sizing system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on a combination of
   a radial basis function neural network and a database of stored
   performances of electrical machines. The network is trained based on a
   set of typical performance requirements for a machines design problem.
   The resulting design is analyzed using finite elements to determine if
   the design performance is acceptable.
   Findings - The number of neurons in the network was varied to determine
   the approximation and generalization capabilities. The finite element
   analysis showed that the network produced initial design parameters
   which resulted in an appropriate performance.
   Research limitations/implications - The research has looked at only one
   class of machine. Further work is needed on a range of machines to
   determine how effective the approach can be.
   Practical implications - The approach can provide a good initial design
   and thus can reduce overall design time significantly.
   Originality/value - The paper proposes a novel, fast and effective
   generalized approach to sizing low frequency electromagnetic devices.}},

   shells is 3,000 times tougher than the brittle mineral it is made of, a
   level of toughness amplification currently unmatched by any engineering
   material. For this reason, nacre has become the model for bioinspiration
   for novel structural materials. The structure of nacre is organized over
   several length scales, but the microscopic brick-and-mortar arrangement
   of the mineral tablets is prominent. This staggered structure provides a
   universal approach to arranging hard building blocks in nature and is
   also found in bone and teeth. Recent models have demonstrated how an
   attractive combination of stiffness, strength, and toughness can be
   achieved through the staggered structure. The fabrication of engineering
   materials that duplicate the structure, mechanics, and properties of
   natural nacre still present formidable challenges to this day.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing is one of the most widely used
   methods to implement biosensors due to its sensitivity and capacity for
   label-free detection. Most conventional SPR sensors measure the change
   in reflectance at a metal-dielectric interface as a function of either
   angle or wavelength. However, it has recently been shown that an
   increase in sensitivity and a greater robustness against noise can be
   achieved by measuring reflectivity in both domains simultaneously, in a
   so-called spectro-angular SPR biosensor. This provides a surface plasmon
   dispersion curve captured on an image sensor that can be tracked in real
   time. A single value decomposition method is used to project the
   dispersion curve onto a basis set and allow the image obtained from an
   unknown refractive index sample to be compared very accurately with a
   pre-calculated reference set. The objective of the current work is to
   further improve the detection limit of the spectro-angular biosensor.
   Simulations have shown that the spatial resolution and numerical
   precision of the image sensor have a significant impact on the accuracy
   of the refractive index change measurement. Therefore, upgrading the
   cameras used for the data acquisition could significantly improve the
   detection limit of the SPR biosensor. In this work, simulation results
   are presented to justify the modifications of the experimental system
   and to estimate the expected improvement in the detection limit of the
   spectro-angular biosensor by using higher spatial resolution and higher
   data precision cameras. Experimental results are presented and compared
   with the previous design.}},

Title = {{epsilon-NASH MEAN FIELD GAME THEORY FOR NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC DYNAMICAL
   SYSTEMS WITH MAJOR AND MINOR AGENTS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{3302-3331}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies large population dynamic games involving nonlinear
   stochastic dynamical systems with agents of the following mixed types:
   (i) a major agent and (ii) a population of N minor agents where N is
   very large. The major and minor agents are coupled via both (i) their
   individual nonlinear stochastic dynamics and (ii) their individual
   finite time horizon nonlinear cost functions. This problem is analyzed
   by the so-called epsilon-Nash mean field game theory. A distinct feature
   of the mixed agent mean field game problem is that even asymptotically
   (as the population size N approaches infinity) the noise process of the
   major agent causes random fluctuation of the mean field behavior of the
   minor agents. To deal with this, the overall asymptotic (N -> infinity)
   mean field game problem is decomposed into (i) two nonstandard
   stochastic optimal control problems with random coefficient processes
   which yield forward adapted stochastic best response control processes
   determined from the solution of (backward in time) stochastic
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (SHJB) equations and (ii) two stochastic
   coefficient McKean-Vlasov (SMV) equations which characterize the state
   of the major agent and the measure determining the mean field behavior
   of the minor agents. This yields a stochastic mean field game (SMFG)
   system which is in contrast to the deterministic mean field game systems
   of standard MFG problems with only minor agents. Existence and
   uniqueness of the solutions to SMFG systems (SHJB and SMV equations) is
   established by a fixed point argument in the Wasserstein space of random
   probability measures. In the case where minor agents are coupled to the
   major agent only through their cost functions, the epsilon(N)-Nash
   equilibrium property of the SMFG best responses is shown for a finite N
   population system where epsilon(N) = O(1/root N).}},

Journal = {{BIOFOULING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{457-468}},
Abstract = {{Bacteriophages are emerging as strong candidates for combating bacterial
   biofilms. However, reports indicating that host populations can, in some
   cases, respond to phage predation by an increase in biofilm formation
   are of concern. This study investigates whether phage predation can
   enhance the formation of biofilm and if so, if this phenomenon is
   governed by the emergence of phage-resistance or by non-evolutionary
   mechanisms (eg spatial refuge). Single-species biofilms of three
   bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica
   serotype Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) were pretreated and
   post-treated with species-specific phages. Some of the phage treatments
   resulted in an increase in the levels of biofilm of their host. It is
   proposed that the phenotypic change brought about by acquiring phage
   resistance is the main reason for the increase in the level of biofilm
   of P. aeruginosa. For biofilms of S. aureus and S. enterica Typhimurium,
   although resistance was detected, increased formation of biofilm
   appeared to be a result of non-evolutionary mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{There is a lack of an optimal transplant material for small calibre
   blood vessels. This could be overcome by tissue engineering. The optimal
   construct is to be derived from autologous cells and present mechanical

   developed the self-assembly approach to produce tissue sheets that can

   technique that can indicate environmental factors such as pH and redox
   potential by the effect of these factors on the fluorescence lifetimes
   of fluorophores. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are highly sensitive
   to environment and so are ideal for use in FLIM, although certain
   experimental parameters must be carefully considered for QD imaging to
   account for their long lifetimes and two-photon behavior. We image the
   uptake of three types of QDs in cultured fibroblasts and show some
   preliminary results on the effects of endosomes and lysosomes on QD
   lifetimes. These results indicate the feasibility of FLIM for studies

   formation mechanism instead of surface adsorption. The degradation of
   the arsenic local structure in the crystalline arsenical nickel
   hydroxide is observed. The XAFS of annabergites are compared to that of

Abstract = {{Multi-step analytical tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) require delivery of multiple fluids into a reaction zone and
   counting of incubation time at different steps. This paper presents a
   new type of paper-based magnetic valves that can count the time and turn
   on or off a fluidic flow accordingly, enabling timed fluid control in
   paper-based microfluidics. The timing function of these valves is
   realized using a paper timing channel with an ionic resistor, which can
   detect the event of a solution flowing through the resistor and trigger
   an electromagnet (through a simple circuit) to open or close a paper
   cantilever valve. Based on this principle, we developed normally-open
   and normally-closed valves with a timing period up to 30.3 +/- 2.1
   minutes (sufficient for ELISA on paper-based platforms). Using the
   normally-open valve, we performed an enzyme-based colorimetric reaction
   commonly used for signal amplification of ELISAs, which requires a timed
   delivery of enzyme substrate to a reaction zone. This design adds a new
   fluid-control component to the tool set for developing paper-based
   microfluidic devices, and has the potential to improve the
   user-friendliness of these devices.}},

Abstract = {{A high-speed data-search mechanism, called a synchronous overlapped
   search mechanism (SOSM) that enables a next-word search after searching
   just a few bits of the current word by simple pre-computation in most
   cases, is introduced for a content-addressable memory (CAM). Since there
   are no delay elements in the proposed hardware based on the SOSM, the
   hardware is robust against timing variation, maintaining high-throughput
   computing under serious process variation. A 128x64-bit CAM is designed
   with considering 30\% variations of threshold voltages under a 45nm CMOS
   technology and operates at 4.2x faster throughput than that of a
   conventional CAM with 12.3\% energy overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Meeting production targets in terms of ore quantity and quality is
   critical for a successful mining operation. In-situ grade variability
   and uncertainty about the spatial distribution of ore and quality
   parameter cause both deviations from production targets and general
   financial deficits. A stochastic integer programming formulation (SIP)
   is developed herein to integrate geological uncertainty described by
   sets of equally possible scenarios of the unknown orebody. The SIP
   formulation accounts not only for discounted cashflows and deviations
   from production targets, discounts geological risk, while accounting for
   practical mining. Application at an iron ore deposit in Western
   Australia shows the ability of the approach to control a risk of
   deviating from production targets over time. Comparison shows that the
   stochastically generated mine plan exhibits less risk in deviating from
   quality targets than the traditional mine planning approach based on a
   single interpolated orebody model.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{160}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) was prepared via a novel process
   comprising low-temperature (<100 degrees C) aqueous synthesis and
   annealing of the hydrous intermediate phase Li1.81H0.19Ti2O5 center dot
   2H(2)O (LTH) using only LiOH and TiCl4 as precursors.
   Nanosheet-structured LTH converted to either LTO nanosheets (102 m(2) .
   g(-1)) or LTO nanoparticles (28 m(2) . g(-1)) upon annealing at 400 and
   600 degrees C respectively, each exhibiting unique electrochemical
   performance properties. The nanosheet-structured LTO exhibited higher
   initial charge capacity (228.3 vs. 187.3 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 V cutoff and
   C/24 rate) than the nanoparticle-structured LTO. Furthermore, the LTO
   nanosheets taking advantage of their short diffusion path exhibited
   better rate capability than the LTO nanoparticles; for example their
   discharge capacity at 15 C was 115 mAh . g(-1) vs. 68.4 mAh . g(-1) at
   1.2 V cutoff for the LTO nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the LTO nanoparticles
   exhibited better cyclability than the LTO nanosheets because of their
   higher crystallinity. Thus after 130 1 C cycles with cut off at 1.2 V
   (vs. Li/Li+), the discharge capacity of the nanosheets was 132.9 mAh .
   g(-1) while that of nanoparticles was 150.7 mAh . g(-1), corresponding
   to 85 and 97\% discharge capacity retention respectively. The newly
   synthesized nanostructured LTO material can offer a low cost scalable
   solution for high-performance LIB anodes. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{A novel fabrication method comprising screen-printing and sintering of
   nanotitania/carbon paste has been developed allowing the construction of
   binder-free electrodes with superior lithium-ion intercalation
   properties. As a model active material to demonstrate the advantages of
   the new fabrication process, commercial P25 nanotitania product was
   used. The newly fabricated electrodes were compared to those fabricated
   using the standard binder-based method. Physical characterization
   demonstrated that the novel binder-free paste provides for significant
   carbon dispersion due to smaller agglomerate size resulting in enhanced
   inter-particle (active-conducting) mixing and packing density than the
   standard one. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge
   testing proved the novel method-built electrodes to exhibit dramatically
   improved performance over the standard electrode in terms of
   conductivity, specific charge capacity, and reversibility. Thus the
   specific charging (delithiation) capacity of the novel method electrode
   (92\% TiO2/7.5\% C) was 174 mA h g(-1), compared to 124 mA h g(-1) for
   the standard method electrode (85\% TiO2/7.5\% C/7.5\% PVDF),
   representing 103, and 74\% of the theoretical capacity (corresponding to
   Li0.5TiO2), respectively. At the same time after 10 cycles, the
   novel-built electrode exhibited 90-94\% coulombic efficiency and more
   than 92\% capacity retention while the corresponding values for the
   standard electrode were only 80-82\% and 53\% respectively. (C) 2013 The

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{67}},

Pages = {{2651-2660}},
Abstract = {{Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) aims at finding practical
   and sustainable solutions to water resource issues. Research and
   practice have shown that innovative methods and tools are not sufficient
   to implement IWRM - the concept needs to also be integrated in
   prevailing management paradigms and institutions. Water governance
   science addresses this human dimension by focusing on the analysis of
   regulatory processes that influence the behavior of actors in water
   management systems. This paper proposes a new methodology for the
   integrated analysis of water resources management and governance systems
   in order to elicit and analyze case-specific management paradigms. It
   builds on the Management and Transition Framework (MTF) that allows for
   the examination of structures and processes underlying water management
   and governance. The new methodology presented in this paper combines
   participatory modeling and analysis of the governance system by using
   the MTF to investigate case-specific management paradigms. The linking
   of participatory modeling and research on complex management and
   governance systems allows for the transfer of knowledge between
   scientific, policy, engineering and local communities. In this way, the
   proposed methodology facilitates assessment and implementation of
   transformation processes towards IWRM that require also the adoption of
   adaptive management principles. A case study on flood management in the
   Tisza River Basin in Hungary is provided to illustrate the application
   of the proposed methodology.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{2609-2614}},
Abstract = {{Multi-step analytical tests, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent

   a new type of paper-based magnetic valves that can count the time and
   turn on or off a fluidic flow accordingly, enabling timed fluid control
   in paper-based microfluidics. The timing capability of these valves is
   realized using a paper timing channel with an ionic resistor, which can
   detect the event of a solution flowing through the resistor and trigger
   an electromagnet (through a simple circuit) to open or close a paper
   cantilever valve. Based on this principle, we developed normally-open
   and normally-closed valves with a timing period up to 30.3 +/- 2.1 min
   (sufficient for an ELISA on paper-based platforms). Using the
   normally-open valve, we performed an enzyme-based colorimetric reaction
   commonly used for signal readout of ELISAs, which requires a timed
   delivery of an enzyme substrate to a reaction zone. This design adds a
   new fluid-control component to the tool set for developing paper-based
   microfluidic devices, and has the potential to improve the
   user-friendliness of these devices.}},

Abstract = {{We present an integrated thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) based multilayer
   microfluidic device with an embedded peristaltic micropump and
   through-holes membrane for high throughput particle sorting and
   separation. Fluidic and pneumatic layers of the device were fabricated
   using hot-embossing lithography and commercially available polycarbonate
   membranes were succcessfully sandwiched between two thermoplastic
   elastomer fluidic layers integrated to a peristaltic micropumping layer.
   The integrated peristaltic micropump induces turbulence at the
   top-microfluidic layer ring which successfully avoids particle
   aggregation and membrane blocking even at nanorange size. We present
   herein the general design of the device structure and pumping
   characteristics for three devices with membrane pore sizes of 10 mm, 5
   mm and 800 nm. By using this design we have successfully demonstrated a
   separation efficiency as high as 99\% of polystyrene microbeads with
   different sizes and most importantly the separation of 390 nm particles
   from 2 mm beads was achieved. Using this device, we were also able to
   separate red blood cells with size of about 6-8 mm from osteoblasts
   typically larger than 10 mm to demonstrate the potential applicability
   of this platform for biological samples. The produced microfluidic chip
   operating at flow rates up to 100 mu l min(-1) allows us to achieve
   efficient high-throughput sorting and separation of target
   particles/cells.}},

Abstract = {{The small thiol beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) has been used as an
   anti-blinking reagent for CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), although its
   effects on QD photoluminescence are complex. It acts as an antioxidant
   as well as a hole scavenger on both CdSe and CdTe, which leads to
   changes in emission intensity and lifetime that vary qualitatively
   according to BME concentration, time of incubation, and pH of the
   solution. Because the band edge energies of InP/ZnS are shifted from
   those of CdTe and CdSe, it may be expected that thiols including BME
   might be unable to trap holes from these QDs. In this study, we use
   steady-state and time-resolved emission spectroscopy with physical
   fitting models combined with blinking analysis to compare the effects of
   different concentrations of BME on CdSe/ZnS vs. InP/ZnS QDs over time.
   We also find excellent correspondence between simple physical model
   parameters and blinking off times, a finding that will be useful for all
   blinking studies involving semiconductor nanoparticles. BME alters
   blinking in InP/ZnS QDs with a single ZnS shell, but not those with
   double thickness shells. The effects are similar to those seen with
   CdSe/ZnS, despite very different effects of BME on steady-state spectra,
   and highly pH-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Iridescence is an example of structured color that is widespread in the
   biosphere, exhibited by multilayer inorganic thin films for optical
   filters, photonic crystals and other materials in which the periodic
   patterning of matter interacts with an electromagnetic field.
   Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) can be cast in the form of thick
   iridescent films whose color originates in the multi-domain chiral
   nematic texture created by self-assembly of the rigid rod crystallites.
   Scanning electron microscopy confirms the periodic layer structure that
   arises from the helical twist axis of the chiral nematic mesophase film.
   In effect, the film comprises multi-domain Bragg reflectors. On exposure
   to liquid water, and high relative humidity (RH), a reversible shift in
   the film iridescence from dry state blue-green to wet state red-orange
   is observed. This color change, which requires no pigment, is quantified
   by reflectance spectroscopy. The color transition is attributed to
   sorption of water that causes the pitch of the Bragg reflector to
   enlarge, and this leads to a red shift in the iridescence. The
   subsequent expansion of the film thickness was observed using polarized
   optical microscopy. The effect resembles molecular dopant and electric
   field induced pitch tuning along the helicoid axis in one-dimensional
   photonic crystal-like chiral nematic molecular systems. The color shift
   for a 40 mu m thick NCC film is slow, occurring on timescale of 1-3 min.
   Thinner films change color in less than 2 s. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Nano-/micro-scale alpha and beta NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ crystals with
   ultra-efficient upconversion (UC) of near infrared (NIR)-to-visible
   (VIS) light were prepared by annealing following citrate-assisted
   hydrothermal synthesis at 200 degrees C. Excess fluoride ({[}F]/{[}Y +
   Er + Yb] molar ratio = 9) helped promote the formation of the hexagonal
   beta phase while simultaneous addition of citrate led to crystal shape
   and size control. The citrate caused the morphology of the beta phase
   crystals to change from irregular elongated microtubes to hexagonal
   prisms, with particle size decreasing with increasing citrate
   concentration. However the presence of citrate led to significant
   deterioration of the upconversion luminescence of the beta
   NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ crystals due to surface quenching by adsorbed citrate
   moieties. We have found that annealing at 700 degrees C restored the
   NIR-to-VIS upconversion luminescence (predominantly green) of the
   citrate-modified beta NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ crystals and also led to a
   dramatic enhancement (over several orders of magnitude) not previously
   reported. According to Raman spectroscopic evidence, annealing led to
   improved upconversion efficiency via elimination of internal defects and
   surface hydroxyl/citrate groups. Further, we report on the preparation
   of unexpectedly strong upconverting (predominantly red) alpha cubic
   phase NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanocrystals.}},

Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{53}},

Pages = {{900-908}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic transformation behavior of deformed austenite was studied in
   a 0.79\%C high carbon steel over the temperature range 743-823 degrees
   C. The experiments were carried out in torsion under an atmosphere of
   argon and 5\% H-2. All these temperatures are above the orthoequilibrium
   Ae(3) temperature of the steel. Strains of 0.25-4 were applied at a
   strain rate of 4 s(-1). The experimental parameters were varied in order
   to determine the effects of strain and temperature on the formation of
   strain-induced ferrite and cementite. The critical strain for dynamic
   transformation was about 0.20. The volume fractions of the transformed
   phases increased with strain and decreased with temperature. The
   observed ferrite structures are Widmanstatten in nature and appear to
   have formed displacively. The carbon diffusion times required for
   formation of the observed spheroidal cementite particles were
   calculated; these are consistent with the occurrence of interstitial
   diffusion during deformation. Similar calculations indicate that
   substitutional diffusion does not play a role during dynamic
   transformation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the design of a combined backstepping/Lyapunov
   controller for the attitude, velocity and height control of an unmanned,
   unstable, fin-less airship. As the airship actuation has more degrees of
   freedom than the motion controlled, the controller includes a quadratic
   optimization algorithm to find the optimal thruster commands. The
   control law developed provides attitude and velocity control for the
   entire airship flight regime, i.e., hover, vertical ascent and descent
   as well as cruise, all with a single controller. Controller performance
   is first verified using a simulation that includes detailed modeling of
   sensor noise, computational delays and actuation dynamics. Subsequently,
   the controller is tested in outdoor flight tests. The controller has
   been found to perform well both in simulation and flight tests. The
   controller parameters were identical in simulation and flight test
   demonstrating the high fidelity of the simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The thermo-mechanical nonlinear vibrations and stability of a
   hinged-hinged axially moving beam, additionally supported by a nonlinear
   spring-mass support are examined via two numerical techniques. The
   system is subjected to a transverse harmonic excitation force as well as
   a thermal loading. Hamilton's principle is employed to derive the
   equations of motion; it is discretized into a multi-degree-freedom
   system by means of the Galerkin method. The steady state resonant
   response of the system for both cases with and without an internal
   resonance between the first two modes is examined via the
   pseudo-arclength continuation technique. In the second method, direct
   time integration is employed to construct bifurcation diagrams of
   Poincare maps of the system.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we report on the development of a multifunctional and
   photo-inducible nanoplex made of chitosan (Ch) and hyaluronic acid (HA)
   for delivery of nucleic acid. Self-assembled Ch/HA nanoparticles were
   attached to ortho-nitrobenzyl (o-NB) photo-labile molecules (PL)-gold
   nanoparticles via thiol groups and to QDs-conjugate ssDNA through amide
   bond linkage to form nanoplexes (Ch:HA:AuPL:QD-DNA). The composition of
   DNA nanocarriers was validated by nuclear magnetic resonance,
   transmission electronic microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray
   spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. The change in
   zeta potential (34 +/- 11 to -26 +/- 11 mV) and the loss of the o-NB
   characteristic peaks in nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, after the
   exposure of the PL molecule to ultraviolet light, both confirmed the
   photo-labile properties of the system. The potential of the nanoplexes
   to induce high cell transfection was assessed by flow cytometry and
   fluorescent microscopy imaging. Over 30\% transfection of HEK-293 was
   obtained with the nanoplexes after a one-minute exposure of cells to UV
   light. This corresponds to a 15\% increase in the transfection
   efficiency compared to unexposed Ch:HA:AuPL:QD-DNA nanocarriers. This
   high transfection efficiency was associated with the unique design of
   the carrier system and its photo-responsiveness feature for facilitating
   the DNA release.}},

Abstract = {{Presently, sewage sludge from wastewater treatment systems has become a
   critical problem in many regions of the world because it can inflict
   harm on human beings and the environment. Gasification technology is
   widely held to be a suitable and convenient approach to convert waste
   materials to energy with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. In a
   pilot-scale experiment on sewage sludge gasification ultimately aimed at
   generating electricity, the reactor temperature profile, syngas
   characteristics, and performance of the syngas in the production of
   electricity were tied to the equivalence ratio (ER) and syngas flow rate
   (i.e., 100, 150, or 180 N m(3) h(-1)). An increase of the ER resulted in
   an increase of the temperature inside the gasifier, causing a variation
   in syngas characteristics and the level of tar and dust contamination.
   Calorific values at different syngas flow rates were found to vary from
   4.20 to 4.87 MJ N-1 m(-3). The syngas obtained at flow rates of 150 and
   180 N m(3) h(-1) could be used in an engine-generator set to generate 21
   or 47 kW of electrical power, respectively, whereas at the flow rate of
   100 N m(3) h(-1), the syngas could only run the engine without
   electrical load. The specific sewage sludge consumption, which is the
   amount of feedstock required to generate electricity, decreased with an
   increase in the syngas flow rate. The performance evaluation of the
   sewage sludge gasification system, i.e., gasification efficiency,
   engine-generator set efficiency, and electrical efficiency, showed that
   these were in the range of those obtained from biomass, such as
   agricultural residues. Overall, sewage sludge can serve as a feedstock
   for electricity generation using a pilot-scale downdraft gasification
   system.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, two very compact designs of miniaturized four-element
   planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) are proposed for 2.45 GHz
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) applications. The first
   configuration exhibits pattern diversity, while the second exploits
   hybrid pattern and polarization diversity. Both the configurations are
   designed over a small ground plane measuring 105 55 mm in area, while
   each antenna element occupies a volume of only 0.455 cm. Diversity
   performance criteria, namely envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) and
   mean effective gain (MEG), are studied. Effective diversity gain (EDG)
   using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) are
   then derived for a Rayleigh fading environment. The diversity gains are
   also measured in the reverberation chamber, which emulates Rayleigh
   fading, and show excellent agreement with the analytical results. In
   addition, MIMO channel capacities measured in the chamber depict how
   robust and efficient the two multiantenna configurations are in the rich
   scattering environment.}},

Abstract = {{self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) was
   formed on a 316L stainless steel (SS) surface, using a cyclic
   potentiodynamic electrochemical technique (cyclic voltammetry). The
   presence of the formed monolayer was confirmed by polarized modulation
   infrared reflection adsorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), contact angle
   (CA), ellipsometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The
   stability of the monolayer was investigated by PM-IRRAS, CA and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). XPS showed that the MUA is
   attached to the 316L SS surface mostly through the sulfur atom, but some
   MUA molecules are also attached to the surface through both the thiol
   and carboxylate groups. PM-IRRAS demonstrated that the formed SAM is
   semi-ordered. The SAM was stable in a corrosive environment (phosphate
   buffer saline, PBS) for seven days, and also withstood the exposure to
   elevated temperatures and fluid shear stress. EIS results revealed that
   the SAM also inhibited general corrosion of 316L SS over a period of
   seven days of constant immersion in PBS, with an average inhibition
   efficiency of 94\%.}},

Abstract = {{An energy-based ordinary differential equation is derived for a plastic
   wave propagating through a Taylor impact test specimen. Using the
   definition of true strain, an analytical equation is presented to
   calculate the strain rate across the plastic wave front. Having
   considered a Johnson-Cook plasticity model for the projectile material,
   the derived energy equation accompanied by a governing kinematics
   relation and the strain rate equation is numerically integrated to
   obtain the final deformed profile of the specimen. The results of the
   energy based model are then compared with those of the commonly used
   momentum-based approach as well as the existing experimental data in
   literature for copper, aluminum and steel specimens. Moreover, the
   entire plastic profile of the specimens obtained from energy and
   momentum approach is compared with 3D finite element results. It can be
   concluded that the energy-based model exhibits a closer agreement with

Abstract = {{Nanoindentation studies on thin films of the widely used azo polymer
   pDR1A and a supramolecular polymer-azobenzene complex p4VP(DY7)(0.5)
   demonstrate significant light-induced softening upon visible-light
   irradiation due to trans-cis-trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene
   units. More specifically, the strain-rate sensitivities of pDR1A and
   p4VP(DY7)(0.5) upon 532 nm irradiation increase by 80\% and 120\%,
   respectively. These results imply a photosoftening contribution to the
   mechanisms of light-induced surface patterning of azo polymers and the
   photomechanical effect. The finding that under the experimental
   conditions used photosoftening is more significant in the supramolecular
   complex than in the covalently functionalized polymer highlights the
   potential of noncovalent functionalization strategies in designing
   materials with efficient photomechanical response, and nanoindentation
   provides a powerful technique to quantify the connection between the
   photoinduced changes in mechanical properties and photoinduced
   macroscopic movement of azo polymer films.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1520-1538}},
Abstract = {{Greenhouse carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment from biomass residues was
   investigated using exhaust gas from the combustion of syngas produced by
   gasification. Near complete syngas combustion is essential to achieve
   CO2 levels which increase plant yields while maintaining a safe
   environment for workers. Wood pellets were supplied to a downdraft
   gasifier to produce syngas fed to a steel swirl burner. The preliminary
   results were encouraging and represented a first step toward a
   successful development of this technology. The burner required an
   equivalence ratio (the actual air to fuel ratio relative to the
   stoichiometric air to fuel requirements) of 2.6 for near complete
   combustion. Concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ethylene (C2H4)
   emissions were either below critical concentrations or negligible. In
   60\% of the trials, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were below ASHRAE
   standards for indoor air quality. However, the average nitrogen oxide
   (NOx) emission was 23.6 ppm, and it would need to be reduced below the
   0.05 ppm to meet ASHRAE standards. Proposed improvements to the syngas
   burner design to lower NOx emissions and increase efficiency are:
   integration of a low swirl design, mesh catalysers, a higher quality
   refractory material, and a more efficient heat exchanger. Theoretically,
   combustion or gasification of biomass could provide more CO2 for
   greenhouse enrichment than propane or natural gas per unit of energy.}},

Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{145-151}},
Abstract = {{The 63 flow curves published previously in ISIJ Int. (2012) are
   re-analyzed for the presence of departures from simple work hardening
   (dynamic recovery) behavior. These curves were determined on a 0.019\%C
   plain C, a 0.11\%C Nb microalloyed, and a 1.56\%Mn-1.56\%Si Nb-modified
   TRIP steel by means of hot compression tests carried out from 900 to
   1150 degrees C and at strain rates up to 1 s(-1). Two sets of second
   derivative minima are shown to be associated with all 63 curves, in
   contrast to the single minima reported earlier. It is shown that double
   minima can only be obtained when the polynomial order of the fitting
   procedure on the whole flow curve is 11 or higher. By contrast, when
   only the ascending portion of the flow curve is fitted, double minima
   are found as long as the polynomial order is at least 8. The first set
   of minima corresponds to the initiation of dynamic transformation (DT),
   as shown in an earlier analysis of torsion flow curves. The second set
   of minima is associated with the nucleation of dynamic recrystallization
   (DRX); these were the only minima reported earlier. The temperature
   dependences of the two sets of minima intersect at higher temperatures,
   indicating that the only softening mechanism operating at high austenite
   deformation temperatures (in addition to dynamic recovery) is DRX.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Modification of gut microflora has been reported as altering energy and
   lipid homeostasis, leading to changes in body composition. We evaluated
   whether consumption of Lactobacillus amylovorus (LA) and Lactobacillus
   fermentum (LF) as novel probiotics alters body adiposity through
   modification of gut microflora. Healthy, but overweight participants (n
   = 28) consumed yogurt containing 1.39 x 10(9) colony-forming unit (CPU)
   microencapsulated LA, 1.08 x 10(9) CFU microencapsulated LF, or a
   control yogurt using a randomized, double-blind crossover design. Body
   composition measurements showed that body fat mass was reduced in all
   treatments, with the greatest reduction from LA consumption. Bacterial
   distribution of gut microflora determined a significant reduction in the
   abundance of Clostridial cluster IV from LA consumption and significant
   increases in the abundance of Lactobacillus in both LF and LA
   treatments. The results suggest that modulation of gut microbial
   composition from probiotic consumption may contribute to altered energy
   metabolism and body composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Genome-scale metabolic modeling to provide insight into the production
   of storage compounds during feast-famine cycles of activated sludge}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{469-476}},
Abstract = {{Studying storage metabolism during feast-famine cycles of activated
   sludge treatment systems provides profound insight in terms of both
   operational issues (e.g., foaming and bulking) and process optimization
   for the production of value added by-products (e.g., bioplastics). We
   examined the storage metabolism (including poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate
   {[}PHB], glycogen, and triacylglycerols {[}TAGs]) during feast-famine
   cycles using two genome-scale metabolic models: Rhodococcus jostii RHA1
   (iMT1174) and Escherichia coli K-12 (iAF1260) for growth on glucose,
   acetate, and succinate. The goal was to develop the proper objective
   function (OF) for the prediction of the main storage compound produced
   in activated sludge for given feast-famine cycle conditions. For the
   flux balance analysis, combinations of three OFs were tested. For all of
   them, the main OF was to maximize growth rates. Two additional sub-OFs
   were used: (1) minimization of biochemical fluxes, and (2) minimization
   of metabolic adjustments (MoMA) between the feast and famine periods.
   All (sub-)OFs predicted identical substrate-storage associations for the
   feast-famine growth of the above-mentioned metabolic models on a given
   substrate when glucose and acetate were set as sole carbon sources
   (i.e., glucose-glycogen and acetate-PHB), in agreement with experimental
   observations. However, in the case of succinate as substrate, the
   predictions depended on the network structure of the metabolic models
   such that the E. coli model predicted glycogen accumulation and the R.
   jostii model predicted PHB accumulation. While the accumulation of both
   PHB and glycogen was observed experimentally, PHB showed higher dynamics
   during an activated sludge feast-famine growth cycle with succinate as
   substrate. These results suggest that new modeling insights between
   metabolic predictions and population ecology will be necessary to
   properly predict metabolisms likely to emerge within the niches of
   activated sludge communities. Nonetheless, we believe that the
   development of this approach will help guide the optimization of the
   production of storage compounds as valuable by-products of wastewater
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural system models are useful tools to synthesize field
   experimental data and to extrapolate results to longer periods of
   weather and to other cropping systems. The objectives of this study
   were: (i) to quantify the effects of crop management practices and
   tillage on soil water and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production
   in a continuous spring wheat system using the RZWQM2 model (coupled with
   CERES-Wheat) under a dryland condition, and (ii) to extend the RZWQM2
   model results to longer term weather conditions and propose alternate
   cropping systems and management practices. Measured soil water content,
   yield, and total aboveground biomass under different tillage and plant
   management practices were used to calibrate and evaluate the RZWQM2
   model. The model showed no impacts of tillage but late planting greatly
   reduced grain yield and biomass, in agreement with observed differences
   among treatments. The hydrologic analysis under long-term climate
   variability showed a large water deficit (32.3 cm) for spring wheat.
   Fallowing the cropland every other year conserved 4.2 cm of water for
   the following wheat year, of which only 1.7 cm water was taken up by
   wheat, resulting in a yield increase of 249 kg ha(-1) (13.7\%); however,
   the annualized mean yield decreased 782 kg ha(-1) (43.1\%) due to 1 yr
   of fallow. Other long-term simulations showed that optimal planting
   dates ranged from 1 March to 10 April and the seeding rates with optimum
   economic return were 3.71 and 3.95 x 10(6) seeds ha(-1) for conventional
   and ecological management treatments, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes are a recently discovered family of capacity-achieving codes
   that are seen as a major breakthrough in coding theory. Motivated by the
   recent rapid progress in the theory of polar codes, we propose a
   semi-parallel architecture for the implementation of successive

   polar codes to make efficient use of processing resources. The derived
   architecture has a very low processing complexity while the memory
   complexity remains similar to that of previous architectures. This
   drastic reduction in processing complexity allows very large polar code
   decoders to be implemented in hardware. An N = 2(17) polar code
   successive cancellation decoder is implemented in an FPGA. We also
   report synthesis results for ASIC.}},

Abstract = {{Early and accurate disease diagnosis still remains a major challenge in
   clinical settings. Biomarkers could potentially provide useful tools for
   the detection and monitoring of disease progression, treatment safety
   and efficacy. Recent years have witnessed prodigious advancement in
   biosensor development with research directed towards rapid, real-time,
   label-free and sensitive biomarker detection. Among emerging techniques,
   nanoplasmonic biosensors pose tremendous potential to accelerate
   clinical diagnosis with real-time multiplexed analysis, rapid and
   miniaturized assays, low sample consumption and high sensitivity. In
   order to translate these technologies from the proof-of-principle
   concept level to point of care clinical diagnosis, integrated, portable
   devices having small footprint cartridges that house low-cost disposable
   consumables are sought. Towards this goal, we developed an all-polymeric
   nanoplasmonic microfluidic (NMF) transmission surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) biosensor. The device was fabricated in thermoplastics using a
   simple, single step and cost-effective hot embossing technique amenable
   to mass production. The novel 3D hierarchical mold fabrication process
   enabled monolithic integration of blazed nanogratings within the
   detection chambers of a multichannel microfluidic system. Consequently,
   a single hard thermoplastic bottom substrate comprising plasmonic and
   fluidic features allowed integration of active fluidic elements, such as
   pneumatic valves, in the top soft thermoplastic cover, increasing device
   functionality. A simple and compact transmission-based optical setup was
   employed with multiplexed end-point or dual-channel kinetic detection
   capability which did not require stringent angular accuracy. The
   sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the transmission SPR
   biosensor was demonstrated through label-free immunodetection of soluble
   cell-surface glycoprotein sCD44 at clinically relevant picomolar to
   nanomolar concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the significant expenses involved in the fabrication of very

   was performed on two of the bridge piers. Ultrasonic pulse velocity
   tomography was used to assess the integrity of the structure before and

Abstract = {{Hydrostatic pressure-driven flows through soft tissues and gels cause
   deformations of the solid network to occur, due to drag from the flowing
   fluid. This phenomenon occurs in many contexts including physiological
   flows and infusions through soft tissues, in mechanically stimulated
   engineered tissues, and in direct permeation measurements of hydraulic
   permeability. Existing theoretical descriptions are satisfactory in
   particular cases, but none provide a description which is easy to
   generalize for the design and interpretation of permeation experiments
   involving a range of different boundary conditions and gel properties.
   Here a theoretical description of flow-induced permeation is developed
   using a relatively simple approximate constitutive law for
   strain-dependent permeability and an assumed constant elastic modulus,
   using dimensionless parameters which emerge naturally. Analytical
   solutions are obtained for relationships between fundamental variables,
   such as flow rate and pressure drop, which were not previously
   available. Guidelines are provided for assuring that direct measurements
   of hydraulic permeability are performed accurately, and suggestions
   emerge for alternative measurement protocols. Insights obtained may be
   applied to interpretation of flow-induced deformation and related
   phenomena in many contexts. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4023095]}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the feasibility of using a one dimensional 16-element
   flexible ultrasonic transducer (FUT) array for nondestructive testing at
   150 degrees C is demonstrated. The FUT arrays were made by a sol-gel
   sprayed piezoelectric film technology; a PZT composite film was sprayed
   on a titanium foil of 75 mu m thickness. Since the FUT array is
   flexible, it was attached to a steel pipe with an outer diameter of 89
   mm and a wall thickness of 6.5 mm at 150 degrees C. Using the ultrasonic
   pulse-echo mode, pipe thickness measurements could be performed.
   Moreover, using the ultrasonic pulse-echo and pitch-catch modes of each
   element of FUT array, the defect detection was performed on an Al alloy
   block of 30 mm thickness with a side-drilled hole (SDH) of phi 3 mm at
   150 degrees C. In addition, a post-processing algorithm based on the
   total focusing method was used to process the full matrix of these
   A-scan signals of each single transmitter and multi-receivers, and then
   the phase-array image was obtained to indicate this defect-SDH. Both
   results show the capability of FUT array being operated at 150 degrees C

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-32}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Downscaling methods for describing the linkage between global-scale
   climate variables and local climatic conditions have been frequently
   used in climate-related impact assessment studies. Previous works,
   however, have been mainly dealing with downscaling of climatic processes
   for a single site, but very few studies are concerned with the
   downscaling of these processes for multi-sites because of the complexity
   in accurately describing both observed at-site temporal persistence and
   spatial dependence between different locations. In the present study, a
   multi-site multivariate statistical downscaling (SD) approach was
   developed for simulating daily maximum (T max) and minimum (T min)
   temperature series at many sites concurrently. The proposed approach
   consists of a combination of a linear regression component to describe
   the linkage between global climate predictors and local temperature
   extremes, and a stochastic component based on a spatial moving average
   process to reproduce the observed spatial dependence between temperature
   extremes at different sites. The feasibility of the suggested SD method
   was assessed using observed daily extreme temperature data available at
   10 weather stations located in the southwest region of Quebec and the
   southeast region of Ontario in Canada, as well as climate predictors
   from the NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis dataset
   for the 1961-1990 period. It was found that the proposed SD approach was
   able to accurately describe various T max and T min characteristics,
   including their spatial and temporal variation as well as their
   interannual anomalies. In addition, comparison of the results from the
   proposed multi-site multivariate SD method and one simulation series
   from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) at a 45-km resolution (a
   dynamic downscaling procedure) has indicated that the suggested SD
   approach was able to more accurately describe the observed spatial and
   temporal characteristics of extreme temperature series at the regional
   scale than the CRCM-based dynamic downscaling method. Copyright (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Purpose To accurately calculate the cross-sectional area of typical
   scaphoid fracture patterns and compare the amount of fracture surface
   area available for healing when a screw was positioned in the center of
   the scaphoid (central) versus perpendicular (eccentric) to the fracture
   plane.
   Methods We employed a laser scanning technique to create 3-dimensional
   models of the scaphoid and permit the precise calculation of area along
   any cross-sectional cut of the bone. We computed approximate bone
   apposition areas for typical acute Herbert and Fisher fractures for 10
   dry bone specimens. Next, we modeled internal fixation for each of these
   fracture geometries with screws placed either along the central axis of
   the scaphoid or eccentrically, perpendicular to the fracture plane. We
   calculated the proportional areas occupied by the screw and remaining
   area available for fracture healing.
   Results The mean surface area of the simulated distal oblique, complete
   waist, and proximal pole fractures was 131, 86, and 58 mm(2),
   respectively. There was little difference in available area for complete
   waist and proximal pole fractures, but eccentric screw fixation
   perpendicular to the plane in distal oblique fractures consumed
   significantly less area than the centrally placed position.
   Conclusions The area available for apposition is widely variable and
   depends on each bone's unique morphology, the orientation of the
   fracture plane, and the design of the screw. Of the 3 fracture patterns
   studied, the obliquity of the screw with respect to the long axis was
   greatest for distal oblique fractures where perpendicular (eccentric)
   placement is preferable to maximize surface area available for healing.
   Clinical relevance Given the poor vascular supply of the scaphoid and
   morbidity associated with scaphoid fracture nonunions, this study
   examined a key determinant of bone healing by characterizing the area of
   these fractures and amount of bone apposition available for blood flow
   and healing when internally fixed with a compression screw. (J Hand Surg

Abstract = {{This paper presents key parameters that affect numerical modeling of
   steel frame structures for reliable collapse simulations. The collapse
   assessment is based on experimental data obtained from a full-scale
   shaking table collapse test of a 4-story steel moment frame and a blind
   numerical analysis contest that was organized in parallel with the
   collapse test. It is shown that (1) there is no clear advantage between
   three-dimensional (3D) and 2D analyses in the prediction of a sidesway
   collapse mechanism for buildings with a regular plan view as in the case
   of study; (2) the assumption of Rayleigh damping leads to better
   predictions of structural response compared with stiffness proportional
   damping; and (3) accurate prediction of collapse necessitates that P-D
   effects always be considered in the analysis. It is also proven that
   accurate simulation of steel component deterioration is a key factor for
   reliable prediction of collapse behavior. On the basis of a synthesis of
   experimental and analytical studies, a few collapse mitigation
   alternatives are investigated. In particular, the effects of the
   strong-column/weak-beam ratio and exposed base plates on the collapse
   capacity are assessed. It is notable that a combination of bending
   strength increase and delay of local buckling in first-story columns is
   most effective for the enhancement of seismic performance against
   collapse. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000608. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{A common assumption in geostatistics is that the underlying joint
   distribution of possible values of a geological attribute at different
   locations is stationary within a homogeneous domain. This joint
   distribution is commonly modeled as multi-Gaussian, with correlations
   defined by a stationary covariance function. This results in attribute
   maps that fail to reproduce local changes in the mean, in the variance
   and, particularly, in the spatial continuity. The proposed alternative
   is to build local distributions, variograms, and correlograms. These are
   inferred by weighting the samples depending on their distance to
   selected locations. The local distributions are locally transformed into
   Gaussian distributions embedding information on the local histogram. The
   distance weighted experimental variograms and correlograms are able to
   adapt to local changes in the direction and range of spatial continuity.
   The automatically fitted local variogram models and the local Gaussian
   transformation parameters are used in spatial estimation algorithms
   assuming local stationarity. The resulting maps are rich in
   nonstationary spatial features. The proposed process implies a higher
   computational effort than traditional stationary techniques, but if data
   availability allows for a reliable inference of the local distributions
   and statistics, a higher accuracy of estimates can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Urban water demand (UWD) is highly dependent on interacting natural and
   socio-economic factors, and thus a wide range of data analysis and
   forecasting methods are required to fully understand the issue. This
   study applies, for the first time, the continuous wavelet transform to
   determine changes in the temporal pattern of UWD and its potential
   meteorological drivers for three major Canadian cities: Calgary,
   Montreal, and Ottawa. This analysis is complemented by Fourier and
   cross-spectral analysis to determine inter-relationships and the
   significance of the patterns detected. The results show that the annual
   (365 days) cycle provides the most consistent and significant
   relationship between UWD and meteorological drivers. Wavelet analysis
   shows that UWD is only sensitive to air temperature in the summer months
   when mean daily temperatures are greater than 10 to 12 A degrees C. For
   the three cities studied, the UWD increases by between 10 ML (Montreal)
   and 50 ML (Calgary) per day with every 1 A degrees C increase in air
   temperature. In an area with low precipitation (Calgary), there is an
   inverse relationship between UWD and precipitation during summer months.
   Wavelet transform and Fourier analysis also detected a 7-day cycle in
   UWD, particularly in the more industrialized city of Montreal, which is
   related to the working week. In general, applying the season dependent
   linear relationships between UWD and temperature is suggested as perhaps
   being more appropriate and potentially successful for forecasting,
   rather than continuous complex nonlinear algorithms that are designed to
   explain variability in the entire UWD record.}},

Abstract = {{Under conditions of free fluid flow, highly hydrated fibrillar collagen
   gels expel fluid and undergo gravity driven consolidation
   (self-compression; SC). This process can be accelerated by the
   application of a compressive stress (plastic compression; PC) in order
   to generate dense collagen scaffolds for tissue engineering. To define
   the microstructural evolution of collagen gels under PC, this study
   applied a two-layer micromechanical model that was previously developed
   to measure hydraulic permeability (k) under SC. Radially confined PC
   resulted in unidirectional fluid flow through the gel and the formation
   of a dense lamella at the fluid expulsion boundary which was confirmed
   by confocal microscopy of collagen immunoreactivity. Gel mass loss due
   to PC and subsequent SC were measured and applied to Darcy's law to
   calculate the thickness of the lamella and hydrated layer, as well as
   their relative permeabilities. Increasing PC level resulted in a
   significant increase in mass loss fraction and lamellar thickness, while
   the thickness of the hydrated layer dramatically decreased. Permeability
   of lamella also decreased from 1.8 x 10(-15) to 1.0 x 10(-15) m(2) in
   response to an increase in PC level. Ongoing SC, following PC, resulted
   in a uniform decrease in mass loss and k with increasing PC level and as
   a function SC time. Experimental k data were in close agreement with
   those estimated by the Happel model. Calculation of average k values for
   various two-layer microstructures indicated that they each approached
   10(-15)-10(-14) m(2) at equilibrium. In summary, the two-layer
   micromechanical model can be used to define the microstructure and
   permeability of multi-layered biomimetic scaffolds generated by PC. (C)

Abstract = {{Delivery of therapeutic molecules to the brain for the treatment of
   Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) is a challenging task. This manuscript
   introduces a novel scheme of synthesizing peptide-tagged polyethylene
   glycol (PEG)ylated chitosan polymer to develop nanoparticles for siRNA
   delivery for use in ND. Specifically, this manuscript proposes a facile
   chemoselective conjugation of monomethoxy PEG, at the C2 hydroxyl group
   of chitosan polymer, with conjugation of PEG to a cell-penetrating
   peptide, Trans-Activator of Transcription. The synthesized
   Chitosan-PEG-TAT polymer was used to form the nanoparticles of
   approximately 5 nm, complexing siRNA to be delivered in neuronal cells
   (Neuro 2a), with no/minimal toxicity. The various intermediates and the
   final product formed during the synthesis were characterized using H-1
   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
   spectra. The morphological details of the nanoparticles were studied
   using Transmission Electron Microscopy. The nanoparticles were tested to
   deliver a functional siRNA against the Ataxin-1 gene in an in-vitro
   established model of a ND Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) over-expressing
   ataxin protein. The results indicate successful suppression of the SCA1
   protein following 48 h of transfection. Result of this study has
   potential in ND like SCA, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and others. Crown

   state-of-the-art power-efficient reconfigurable pipelined ADCs, this ADC
   provides a larger bandwidth-resolution reconfigurability space, while
   maintaining a highly competitive FOM over this entire space. To achieve
   such low-power performance in a low-voltage nanometer CMOS process, this
   work utilizes: 1) a current-scalable frequency-compensation technique to

   switched-capacitor technique to design dynamic comparators with low

Title = {{Characterization of fracture toughness exhaustion in pig aorta}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Background: Spontaneous rupture of the aorta (SRA) without aneurysm,
   dissection, inflammation or infection of the aortic wall can be of two
   types: traumatic and non-traumatic. SRA is most of the time a fatal
   event. Consequently, it is important to understand the conditions which
   lead to the aortic rupture, and, in the case of non-traumatic SRA, to
   predict the temporal likelihood of rupture.
   Method of approach: The present work incorporates the temporal aspect by
   examining the effects of fatigue on aortic wall properties, and adopts
   an energy approach, based on fracture toughness, to evaluate the aorta's
   resistance to rupture. Fracture toughness characterization is a
   destructive testing process and as a consequence cannot be implemented
   as a clinical tool. However, using concepts in damage mechanics, in
   theory, it should be possible to indirectly assess fracture toughness
   from other mechanical properties, such as aortic wall stiffness. Tissue
   samples from non-aneurysmal porcine aortas were fatigued and were
   subjected to both biaxial and guillotine tests to assess wall stiffness
   variations and fracture toughness exhaustion, respectively.
   Results: The experiments reveal that aortic wall stiffness variations
   and fracture toughness exhaustion decreased as a function of loading
   cycles and can be modeled with exponential functions. After one million
   loading cycles, the stiffness ratio between the non-fatigued sample and
   the fatigued sample, dropped to about 0.85, while the fracture toughness
   ratio counterpart fell to about 0.80.
   Conclusion: Consequently, the changes in both stiffness and fracture
   toughness as a function of applied fatigue cycles can be measured in
   aortic tissues. Moreover, these results suggest the possibility to use
   fracture toughness exhaustion curves as a fatigue criterion. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{We show that water soluble InP/ZnS core/shell QDs are a safer
   alternative to CdSe/ZnS QDs for biological applications, by comparing
   their toxicity in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (animal model
   Drosophila). By choosing QDs with comparable physical and chemical
   properties, we find that cellular uptake and localization are
   practically identical for these two nanomaterials. Toxicity of CdSe/ZnS
   QDs appears to be related to the release of poisonous Cd2+ ions and
   indeed we show that there is leaching of Cd2+ ions from the particle
   core despite the two-layer ZnS shell. Since an almost identical amount
   of In(III) ions is observed to leach from the core of InP/ZnS QDs, their
   very low toxicity as revealed in this study hints at a much lower
   intrinsic toxicity of indium compared to cadmium.}},

Pages = {{1913-1920}},
Abstract = {{The structure of oblique detonation waves stabilized on a hypersonic
   wedge in mixtures characterized by a large activation energy is
   investigated via steady method of characteristics (MoC) calculations and
   unsteady computational flowfield simulations. The steady MoC solutions
   show that, after the transition from shock-induced combustion to an
   overdriven oblique detonation, the shock and reaction complex exhibit a
   spatial oscillation. The degree of overdrive required to suppress this
   oscillation was found to be nearly equal to the overdrive required to
   force a one-dimensional piston-driven detonation to be stable,
   demonstrating the equivalence of two-dimensional steady oblique
   detonations and one-dimensional unsteady detonations. Full unsteady
   computational simulations of the flowfield using an adaptive refinement
   scheme showed that these spatial oscillations are transient in nature,
   evolving in time into transverse waves on the leading shock front. The
   formation of left-running transverse waves (facing upstream) precedes
   the formation of right-running transverse waves (facing downstream).
   Both sets of waves are convected downstream away from the wedge in the
   supersonic flow behind the leading oblique front, such that the
   mechanism of instability must continuously generate new transverse waves
   from an initially uniform flow. Together, these waves define a cellular
   structure that is qualitatively similar to a normal propagating
   detonation. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1957-1963}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of the detonation velocity near the limits is investigated.
   Circular tubes of diameters 65, 44 and 13 mm are used. To simulate a
   quasi two-dimensional rectangular geometry thin annular channels are
   also used. The annular channels are formed by a 1.5 m long insert of a
   smaller diameter tube into the larger outer diameter detonation tube.
   Premixed mixtures of C2H2 + 2.5O(2) + 70\%Ar, CH4 + 2O(2) and C2H2 +
   5N(2)O + 50\%Ar are used in the present study. The high argon dilution
   stoichiometric C2H2 + 2.5O(2) mixture has a regular cell size and
   piecewise laminar reaction zone and thus referred to as ``stable{''}.
   The other two mixtures give highly irregular cell pattern and a
   turbulent reaction zone and are hence, referred to as ``unstable{''}
   mixtures. Pressure transducers and optical fibers spaced 10 cm apart
   along the tube are used for pressure and velocity measurements. Cell
   size of the three mixtures studied is also determined using smoked foils
   in both the circular tubes and annular channels. The ratio d/lambda
   (representing the number of cells across the tube diameter) is found to
   be an appropriate sensitivity parameter to characterize the mixture. The
   present results indicate that well within the limit, the detonation
   velocity is generally a few percent below the theoretical
   Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) value. As the limit is approached, the velocity
   decreases rapidly to a minimum value before the detonation fails. The
   narrow range of values of d/lambda of the mixture where the velocity
   drops rapidly is found to correspond to the range of values for the
   onset of single headed spinning detonations. Thus we may conclude that
   the onset of single headed spin can be used as a criterion for defining
   the limits. Spinning detonations are also observed near the limits in
   annular channels. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{2213-2220}},
Abstract = {{A premixed methane-air bunsen-type flame is seeded with micron-sized
   (d(32) = 5.6 mu m) atomized aluminum powder over a wide range of solid
   fuel concentrations. The burning velocities of the resulting two-phase
   hybrid flame are determined using the total surface area of the inner
   flame cone and the known volumetric flow rate, and spatially resolved
   flame spectra are obtained with a spectral scanning system. Flame
   temperatures are derived through polychromatic fitting of Planck's law
   to the continuous part of the spectrum. It is found that an increase in
   the solid fuel concentration changes the aluminum combustion regime from
   low temperature oxidation to full-fledged flame front propagation. For
   stoichiometric methane-air mixtures, the transition occurs in the
   aluminum concentration range of 140-220 g/m(3) and is manifested by the
   appearance of AlO sub-oxide bands and an increase in the flame
   temperature to 2500 K. The flame burning velocity is found to decrease
   only slightly with an increase in aluminum concentration, in contrast to
   the rapid decrease in flame speed, followed by quenching, that is
   observed for flames seeded with inert SiC particles. The observed
   behavior of the burning velocity and flame temperature leads to the
   conclusion that intense aluminum combustion in a hybrid flame only
   occurs when the flame front propagating through the aluminum suspension
   is coupled to the methane-air flame. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{Steady, laminar, mixed convection in a straight and vertically oriented
   pipe conveying slurries of a microencapsulated phase-change material
   (MCPCM) suspended in distilled water (flowing upwards), with essentially
   uniform heat flux imposed on its outside surface, are considered. A
   cost-effective homogenous mathematical model is proposed and shown to be
   applicable to the aforementioned mixed convection phenomena with
   slurries of a sample MCPCM. Correlations for the effective properties of
   the sample MCPCM slurries and procedures for their implementation are
   presented. The energy equation, in which the latent-heat effects are
   handled using an effective specific heat, is cast in a form akin to that
   of a general advection-diffusion transport equation. Difficulties with
   the standard definition of bulk temperature when the specific heat of
   the fluid changes significantly with temperature are elaborated, and a
   modified bulk temperature that overcomes these difficulties is proposed.
   A finite volume method (FVM) was used to solve the mathematical model.
   The proposed model and FVM were validated by using them to solve
   problems involving slurries of the sample MCPCM, and comparing the
   results to those of a complementary experimental investigation. The
   numerical results compare very well with those of the complementary
   experimental investigation. They also demonstrate the need for
   optimizing the various parameters involved, if full benefits of the
   MCPCM slurries are to be achieved for specific applications. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{NO formation and flame propagation are studied in premixed flames of
   iso- and n-isomers of butane and butanol through experimental
   measurements and direct simulation of experimental profiles. The
   stabilized flame is realized through the impingement of a premixed
   combustible jet from a contraction nozzle against a
   temperature-controlled plate. The velocity field is obtained by means of
   Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and nitric oxide concentration profiles
   are measured using Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF), calibrated
   using known NO seeding levels. It is found that NO formation in n- and
   iso-isomers is comparable under the conditions considered, except for
   rich butanol mixtures, whereby NO formation is higher for iso-butanol.
   Generally, less NO is formed in butanol flames than in the butane
   flames. The experiment is simulated by a 1D chemically reacting
   stagnation flow model, using literature models of C1-C4 hydrocarbons
   {[}Wang et al., 2010] and butanol combustion chemistry {[}Sarathy et
   al., 2009, 2012]. NO prediction is tested using two of these mechanisms
   with a previously-published NOx submechanism added into the butane and
   butanol models. While a good level of agreement is observed in the
   velocity field prediction under lean and stoichiometric conditions,
   discrepancies exist under rich conditions. Greater discrepancies are
   observed in NO prediction, except for the C1-C4 mechanism which shows
   good agreement with the experiment under lean and stoichiometric
   conditions. The current study provides data for further development of
   mechanisms with NOx prediction capabilities for the fuels considered
   here. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

   who, how, and when each commuter to McGill generates travel-related GHG.

   by a 2011 travel survey that we conducted across the University, from
   which daily individual GHG emissions are estimated. Details about these
   trips not only reveal who the largest polluters are and where they are
   coming from, but also the seasonality of their emissions. These
   associations are then used to narrate scenarios which present
   alternatives to the structure of individuals' commutes by examining the
   outcomes of selected shifts in travel behavior on total GHG emissions.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Vascular development is believed to occur first by vasculogenesis
   followed by angiogenesis. Though angiogenesis is the formation of new
   vessels, we found that vascular density actually decreases during this
   second stage. The onset of the decrease coincided with the entry of
   erythroblasts into circulation. We therefore measured the level of shear
   stress at various developmental stages and found that it was inversely
   proportional to vascular density. To investigate whether shear stress
   was inhibitory to angiogenesis, we altered shear stress levels either by
   preventing erythroblasts from entering circulation ({''}low{''} shear
   stress) or by injection of a starch solution to increase the blood
   plasma viscosity ({''}high{''} shear stress). By time-lapse microscopy,
   we show that reverse intussusception (merging of two vessels) is
   inversely proportional to the level of shear stress. We also found that
   angiogenesis (both sprouting and splitting) was inversely proportional
   to shear stress levels. These effects were specific to the arterial or
   venous plexus however, such that the effect on reverse intussusception
   was present only in the arterial plexus and the effect on sprouting only
   in the venous plexus. We cultured embryos under altered shear stress in
   the presence of either DAPT, a Notch inhibitor, or DMH1, an inhibitor of
   the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. DAPT treatment phenocopied
   the inhibition of erythroblast circulation ({''}low{''} shear stress)
   and the effect of DAPT treatment could be partially rescued by injection
   of starch. Inhibition of the BMP signaling prevented the reduction in
   vascular density that was observed when starch was injected to increase
   shear stress levels.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclists may experience increased exposure to traffic-related air
   pollution owing to increased minute ventilation and close proximity to
   vehicle emissions. The aims of this study were to characterize personal
   exposures to air pollution among urban cyclists and to identify
   potential determinants of exposure including the type of cycling lane
   (separated vs on-road), traffic counts, and meteorological factors. In
   total, personal air pollution exposure data were collected over 64
   cycling routes during morning and evening commutes in Montreal, Canada,
   over 32 days during the summer of 2011. Measured pollutants included
   ultrafine particles (UFPs), fine particles (PM2.5), black carbon (BC),
   and carbon monoxide (CO). Counts of diesel vehicles were important
   predictors of personal exposures to BC, with each 10 vehicle/h increase
   associated with a 15.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 5.7\%, 24.0\%)
   increase in exposure. Use of separated cycling lanes had less impact on
   personal exposures with a 12\% (95\% CI: 43\%, 14\%) decrease observed
   for BC and smaller decreases observed for UFPs (mean: 1.3\%, 95\% CI:
   20\%, 17\%) and CO (mean: 5.6\%, 95\% CI: 17\%, 4\%) after adjusting for
   meteorological factors and traffic counts. On average, PM2.5 exposure
   increased 7.8\% (95\% CI: 17\%, 35\%) with separate cycling lane use,
   but this estimate was imprecise and not statistically significant. In
   general, our findings suggest that diesel vehicle traffic is an
   important contributor to personal BC exposures and that separate cycling
   lanes may have a modest impact on personal exposure to some air
   pollutants. Further evaluation is required, however, as the impact of
   separate cycling lanes and/or traffic counts on personal exposures may
   vary between regions. Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{The determination of particular reaction forces in the analysis of
   redundantly constrained multibody systems requires the consideration of
   the stiffness distribution in the system. This can be achieved by
   modeling the components of the mechanical system as flexible bodies. An
   alternative to this, which we will discuss in this paper, is the use of
   penalty factors already present in augmented Lagrangian formulations as
   a way of introducing the structural properties of the physical system
   into the model. Natural coordinates and the kinematic constraints
   required to ensure rigid body behavior are particularly convenient for
   this. In this paper, scaled penalty factors in an index-3 augmented
   Lagrangian formulation are employed, together with modeling in natural
   coordinates, to represent the structural properties of redundantly
   constrained multibody systems. Forward dynamic simulations for two
   examples are used to illustrate the material. Results showed that scaled
   penalty factors can be used as a simple and efficient way to accurately
   determine the constraint forces in the presence of redundant
   constraints.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1054-1065}},
Abstract = {{A systematic, computational and scaling analysis of defect textures in
   polygonal arrangement of cylindrical particles embedded in a cholesteric
   (Ch) liquid crystal matrix is performed using the Landau-de Gennes model
   for chiral self-assembly, with strong anchoring at the particles'
   surface. The defect textures and LC phases observed are investigated as
   a function of chirality, elastic anisotropy (monomeric and polymeric
   mesogens), and polygonal arrangement and size of particles. The presence
   of a polygonal network made of N circular inclusions results in defect
   textures of a net charge of -(N - 2)/2 per unit polygonal cell, in
   accordance with Zimmer's rule. As the chirality increases, the LC matrix
   shows the following transition sequence: weakly twisted cholesterics, 2D
   blue phases with non-singular/singular defect lattices, cholesteric
   phases with only disclinations, and finally fingerprint cholesteric
   textures with disclinations and dislocations. For monomeric mesogens at
   concentrations far from the I-Ch phase transition and low chirality, for
   a given symmetry of the LC phase, the particle with weaker (stronger)
   confinement results in a phase with lower (higher) elastic energy, while
   at high chirality the elastic energy of the LC phase is proportional to
   the number of particles that form the polygonal network. Thus, hexagonal
   (triangular) particle arrangement results in low elastic energy at low
   (high) chirality. For semiflexible polymeric mesogens (high elastic
   anisotropy), defect textures with fewer disclinations/dislocations arise
   but due to lamellar distortions we find a higher elastic energy than
   monomeric mesogens. The defects arising in the simulations and the
   texture rules established are in agreement with experimental
   observations in cellulosic liquid crystal analogues such as plant cell
   walls and helical biological polymeric mesophases made of DNA, PBLG and
   xanthan. A semi-quantitative phase diagram that shows different LC
   phases and defect textures as a function of chirality and elastic
   anisotropy is obtained. The inclusion of particles has a stabilizing
   effect on the LC phases, as they occupy lambda(+1) disclination cores,
   thereby reducing the free energy cost associated with these
   disclinations. These findings provide a comprehensive set of trends and
   mechanisms that contribute to the evolving understanding of biological
   plywoods and serve as a platform for future biomimetic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The thermo-mechanical nonlinear dynamics of a buckled axially moving
   beam is numerically investigated, with special consideration to the case
   with a three-to-one internal resonance between the first two modes. The
   equation of motion of the system traveling at a constant axial speed is
   obtained using Hamilton's principle. A closed form solution is developed
   for the post-buckling configuration for the system with an axial speed
   beyond the first instability. The equation of motion over the buckled
   state is obtained for the forced system. The equation is reduced into a
   set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations via the Galerkin
   method. This set is solved using the pseudo-arclength continuation
   technique to examine the frequency response curves and direct-time
   integration to construct bifurcation diagrams of Poincar, maps. The
   vibration characteristics of the system at points of interest in the
   parameter space are presented in the form of time histories, phase-plane

Abstract = {{Assessing the probability of collapse is a computationally demanding
   component of performance-based earthquake engineering. This paper
   examines various aspects involved in the computation of the mean annual
   frequency of collapse (?c) and proposes an efficient method for
   estimating the sidesway collapse risk of structures in seismic regions.
   By deaggregating the mean annual frequency of collapse, it is shown that
   the mean annual frequency of collapse is typically dominated by
   earthquake ground motion intensities corresponding to the lower half of
   the collapse fragility curve. Uncertainty in the collapse fragility
   curve and mean annual frequency of collapse as a function of the number
   of ground motions used in calculations is also quantified, and it is
   shown that using a small number of ground motions can lead to unreliable
   estimates of a structure's collapse risk. The proposed method is shown
   to significantly reduce the computational effort and uncertainty in the
   estimate. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Abstract = {{Microfluidic probes (MFPs) combine the concepts of microfluidics and of
   scanning probes and constitute a contact-free and channel-free
   microfluidic system. Whereas classically the sample is introduced into
   the microfluidic device, with a MFP, the microfluidic stream is applied
   to the sample. MFPs use hydrodynamic flow confinement instead of walls
   to constrain a microfluidic stream between the MFP tip and a substrate.
   Because MFPs are free to move, they can be used to process large areas
   and samples in a selective manner. The development of MFP technology is
   recent and has numerous potential applications in several fields, most
   notably in the life sciences. In this review, we discuss the concept of
   MFPs and highlight their application in surface biopatterning,
   controlling the cellular microenvironments, local processing of tissue
   slices, and generating concentration gradients of biochemicals. We hope
   that this manuscript will serve as an interdisciplinary guide for both
   engineers as they further develop novel MFPs and applications and for
   life scientists who may identify novel uses of the MFP for their
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Manifold learning based techniques have been found to be useful for
   feature space transformations and semi-supervised learning in speech
   processing. However, the immense computational requirements in building
   neighborhood graphs have hindered the application of these techniques to
   large speech corpora. This paper presents an approach for fast
   computation of neighborhood graphs in the context of manifold learning.
   The approach, known as locality sensitive hashing (LSH), has been
   applied to a discriminative manifold learning based feature space
   transformation technique that utilizes a cosine-correlation based
   distance measure. Performance is evaluated first in terms computational
   savings at a given level of ASR performance. The results demonstrate
   that LSH provides a factor of 9 reduction in the computational
   complexity with minimal impact on speech recognition performance. A
   study is also performed comparing the efficiency of the LSH algorithm
   presented here and other LSH approaches in identifying nearest

Abstract = {{In this paper, the application of semi-supervised manifold learning
   techniques to the task of verifying hypothesized occurrences of spoken
   terms is investigated. These techniques are applied in a two stage
   spoken term detection framework where ASR lattices are first generated
   using a large vocabulary ASR system and hypothesized occurrences of
   spoken query terms in the lattices are verified in a second stage. The
   verification process is performed using a fixed dimensional feature
   representation derived from each hypothesized term occurrence. Two
   semi-supervised approaches namely, manifold regularized least squares
   (RLS) classification and spectral clustering, are investigated for
   distinguishing correct hypotheses from false alarms. It is shown that,
   exploiting unlabeled data in addition to labeled data using
   semi-supervised approaches, significantly improves the verification
   performance compared to the case where only the labeled data is used.
   This improvement in performance increases as the ratio of unlabeled to
   labeled data augments. It is also shown that, when training data is very
   limited, a comparable verification performance can be gained by
   exploiting only the acoustic similarity between the test samples using
   the spectral clustering approach.}},

Abstract = {{Residual stresses (RS) imparted during the finishing stages of machining
   constitute an essential measure of surface integrity and an acceptance
   criterion for the safety of critical aerospace parts. To build a
   predictive tool for machining-induced residual stresses in titanium
   alloy Ti-6Al-4V, a finite element-based model of orthogonal cutting is
   developed using DEFORM-2D. A full factorial orthogonal cutting
   experiment is conducted using sharp tools to investigate the effect of
   feed rate (f) and cutting speed (v) on residual stresses under
   finish-turning conditions. For every cutting condition, machining forces
   are measured using a piezoelectric dynamometer, surface temperatures in
   the vicinity of the cutting zone are captured with an infra-red camera,
   and surface residual stresses in the cutting direction are measured by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD). Experimental results for forces, temperatures
   and RS are used to validate the finite element model. Once a high
   confidence level in finite element predictions is obtained, a numerical
   investigation of the effects of cutting tool edge radius (r) and cutting
   speed on RS is carried out. Within the investigated range of parameters,
   residual stresses are found to be compressive in nature. It is observed
   that residual stresses become more compressive with increasing feed rate
   and less compressive with increasing edge radius or cutting speed. (C)

   Smart Grid has been solved using a modified application of partial order
   theory (POT), which is an analytical way of dealing with decision making

   Probability Matrix (RPM) is produced which leads us to a total order
   ranking of the MCDM alternatives. The aim of this paper is to resolve
   some disadvantages of several conventional methods of determining the
   best alternative. Thus, the deficiencies of older methods are discussed
   and their incapability in handling large numbers of alternatives and
   attributes are resolved. In addition, the uncertainty factor is going to
   play its role in decision making. We have illustrated the efficiency of
   our method by implementing it to an IT infrastructure selection problem

Abstract = {{We study the use of sparse structured associative memories as a
   memory-efficient and computationally-efficient data structure for
   representing a set of elements when one wishes to perform set-membership
   queries and some errors (false positives) are tolerable. Associative
   memories, when viewed as representing a set, enjoy a number of
   interesting properties, including that set membership queries can be
   carried out even when the input (query element) is only partially known
   or is partially corrupted. The associative memories considered here
   (initially proposed in {[}Gripon and Berrou, 2011]) encode the set in
   the edge structure of a graph. In this paper we generalize this
   construction to encode the set in the edge structure of a hypergraph. We
   derive bounds on the false positive rates (the probability that the
   associative memory erroneously declares that an element is in the stored
   set when it, in fact, was not). Interestingly, the proposed structures
   enjoy many of the same properties as Bloom filters (e.g., they have zero
   false negative rate, the time to perform an insert and lookup does not
   depend on the number of elements stored, and the false positive rate can
   be reduced by using additional memory for storage), while also offering
   the properties of associative memories (allowing for queries on partial
   or corrupted inputs).}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to characterize the coordination of grasp and
   twist in hand function of normal and post-stroke subjects using a two
   degree of freedom hand robot. Results of the analysis of data from eight
   control subjects indicated that normal grip coordination involves the
   linear modulation of grip force with load torque. Thus, there was a high
   correlation between grip force and load torque. Also, the force
   generated by the thumb was highly correlated with the force generated by
   the index, middle and ring fingers. Finally, the safety margin used to
   stabilize grasp and avoid slip was consistent across normal subjects. In
   contrast, results from chronic post-stroke subjects indicated that they
   generally: (1) exerted excessive grip force to stabilize grasp using
   their ipsilesional hand; (2) lost the close amplitude coupling between
   grip force and load torque; and (3) lost the close modulation of the
   thumb force with finger force. These results suggest that our methods
   may provide objective, quantitative means of characterizing coordination
   problems following stroke.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the spectral efficiency of amplify-and-forward (AF)
   half-duplex relaying schemes, we propose a multi-destination AF relaying
   protocol, in which the source sends two different data streams in two
   time-slots to two destinations with the aid of two relay nodes. In
   contrast to the conventional single-destination AF relaying protocol,
   the proposed multi-destination AF relaying protocol allows mutual
   interference in the transmission of the two data streams due to
   non-orthogonal resource allocation. Two relay nodes are
   opportunistically selected from a set of available relay nodes to
   maximize the minimum achievable rate of two data streams. We take into
   account the mutual interference and derive the ergodic capacity of the
   proposed protocol by deriving closed-form approximation. We show that
   the proposed protocol outperforms the conventional opportunistic AF
   relaying when the average power of interference is less than a crossover
   point and the proposed scheme has larger performance gain as the number
   of relay nodes increases in terms of the ergodic capacity.}},

Abstract = {{We consider full-duplex (FD) bidirectional communication between a pair
   of nodes and investigate the impact of residual self-interference on
   sum-rate performance. We first analyze a situation where channel state
   information is available only at receiver (CSIR). For this case, we
   derive an exact expression and a lower bound to the sum-rate performance
   of FD and hence characterize the effect of residual self-interference.
   The study shows that, FD sum-rate performance is limited by the
   effective signal-to-residual self-interference power ratio (effective
   SIR). In particular, for a fixed effective SIR, FD achieves almost twice
   the sum-rate of half-duplex (HD) in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   regimes whilst FD performance is surpassed by HD in high SNR regions. A
   closed-form approximation to this crossover SNR is derived. We then
   investigate the sum-rate of FD assuming channel state information is
   available to both transmitter and receiver (CSIT). Comparison of FD
   sum-rates of CSIR and CSIT shows that, in low SNR regions, a significant
   benefit can be achieved with CSIT while the gain is small in high SNR
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems that
   employ single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) for uplink
   transmissions can provide high data rates with increased spectral
   efficiency under severe channel conditions. However, the availability of
   accurate channel estimates at the base station (BS) receiver is crucial
   for achieving peak performance. In this paper, we investigate the use of
   subspace decomposition and derive a novel algorithm for the blind
   estimation of MU-MIMO channels in SC-FDE systems, as specified by the
   3GPP LTE. By exploiting the long data blocks available in LTE standards,
   our proposed blind algorithm can obtain accurate estimates of the
   MU-MIMO channels over every block of transmitted data. This provides for
   a bandwidth-efficient solution in SC-FDE systems by eliminating
   (reducing) the need to allocate an entire block of pilot sequences for
   each active transmitter. Furthermore, since the channel estimation is
   deployed at the BS, the computational complexity is not considered to be
   a significant burden for future systems in exchange for the increased
   spectral efficiency. The results of simulations over fading channels,
   using realistic system parameters representative of LTE-Advanced,
   demonstrate the advantages of our proposed blind subspace-based channel
   estimation algorithm and support the feasibility of the resulting
   MU-MIMO SC-FDE scheme with reduced training.}},

Abstract = {{Power markets are modelled as dynamic large population games where
   suppliers and consumers submit their bids in real-time. The agents are
   coupled in their dynamics and cost functions through the price process.
   Here, a common unpredictable partially observed major agent is added to
   the system which represents common unpredictable disturbance factors
   (e.g. wind) and exogenous market factors (e.g. competing energy resource
   prices), etc.
   In previous work, the Mean Field Game (MFG) methodology was used to
   study the limit (Le., infinite population) behaviour of large population
   market systems without a major agent; this results in a decentralized
   algorithm where agents submit their bids solely using statistical
   information on the dynamics of the entire population. When a major agent
   is absent, the system exhibits the standard counter intuitive property
   of MFG solutions that agents need not observe the behaviour (i.e.,
   inputs and state trajectories, market price evolution, etc.) of any
   other agent (individually or collectively) in order that simple
   decentralized control actions achieve a mass epsilon-Nash equilibrium
   (with epsilon vanishing as the population goes to infinity) and
   individual L-2 stability.
   The contribution of this paper is the extension of the MFG theory to
   cover the addition of a major agent to the power market problem. In
   general, the addition of a major agent in the MFG framework makes the
   mean field stochastic in contrast to the situation with purely minor
   agents where the mean field is deterministic.
   In the general situation of sporadic noisy observations of the mean
   field and the state of the major agent, the extended MFG theory (with
   estimation of the mean field and the major agent state) yields simple
   decentralized control laws which achieve a mass epsilon-Nash equilibrium
   (with epsilon vanishing as the population goes to infinity) and
   individual L-2 stability. In this paper, this is carried out for the MFG
   formulation of the power market problem in order to fit the situation
   where sporadic noisy observations of the state of the major agent and of
   the market price are available for recursive mean field state
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{A decentralized quantity allocation problem over networks has been
   studied in (Jia and Caines, 2013) where two-level network based auction
   dynamics are formulated so as to achieve efficient resource allocations
   (in the sense of maximization of social welfare). The adjustment of the
   quantities provided to any supplier in the higher-level network is
   facilitated via a cooperative dynamical system which exchanges
   quantities among the supplier's neighbors based upon the corresponding
   lower-level buyer auctions' limit prices. This paper considers such a
   network based auction system with incomplete information and stochastic
   disturbances. First, in the lower-level networks, assuming that all
   buyers apply a so-called Mean Field Games (MFG) strategy, efficient
   allocation is achieved rapidly when the distribution of the demand
   functions is known to each buyer. Second, in the higher-level network,
   suppliers are associated with a stochastic dynamical system with inputs
   (i.e., the local auctions' limit prices) and outputs determining their
   quantity exchange rate. We analyze this stochastic dynamical game within
   the MFG control framework. We show that the set of MFG control laws has
   an epsilon-Nash equilibrium property where epsilon goes to zero as the
   supplier population size goes to infinity; moreover, a weighted average
   consensus on quantities is reached asymptotically with all local limit
   prices being equal in the lower-level networks, i.e., efficient quantity
   allocation is achieved asymptotically. A potential application of this
   work is to small cell communication networks.}},

   from the channel capacity, IR-type HARQ schemes can significantly reduce
   the loss due to an early-termination effect. We find the sub-optimal
   coding rate of a codeword for given parameters such as signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR), error probability constraint, and L. In addition, we scale
   the gap between the channel capacity and the average transmission rate
   of the IR-type HARQ and show that the gap decreases in the order of 1/L

   Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) aiming to take advantage of

   access probabilities to different users, this method prioritizes users
   who gain most from using a channel, and hence, improves channel
   utilization in comparison with a simple random access scheme.
   Furthermore, in this method, access probabilities are designed to
   achieve long-term fairness by keeping a same average access probability
   for all users. Performance of the proposed adaptive CSMA/CA is evaluated
   in terms of collision probability and saturation throughput by analysis
   and simulation. Illustrative and analytical results show that A-CSMA/CA
   significantly improves the throughput by controlling contention among
   users and decreasing the collision probability, specifically in a large

   proposed as a potential technique for increasing the spectral efficiency
   of wireless systems. FD communication systems suffer from the
   self-interference generated from one's own transmitter to one's own
   receiver in the same time and frequency slot. The self-interference
   signal is typically significantly larger than the received signal. The
   majority of existing work focuses on the suppression of
   self-interference without focusing on the effect on the forward channel.
   This paper presents a self-interference pricing based approach to
   suppress the self-interference without overly penalizing the forward
   channel. Simulation results show that even in the case of high
   self-interference, the proposed approach can provide significant
   data-rate improvements.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we maximize the parameterized energy efficiency (EEP) of
   a multi-channel fading communication link that simultaneously transmits
   data corresponding to delay-sensitive and delay-insensitive applications
   subject to a constraint on the minimum effective capacity (EC) of
   delay-sensitive traffic. EEP, in b/s/Hz, is defined as the difference
   between the spectral efficiency (SE) and the transmit power scaled by a
   parameter which represents the penalty on the transmit power. We provide
   an optimal power adaptation policy to this problem which is either given
   by the global optimum, if feasible, or given by the boundary point where
   the objective function intersects the constraint. Further, we apportion
   the total transmit power into delay-sensitive power, which is the
   minimum power required to meet the EC constraint and delay-insensitive
   power, which is the residual power used to maximize the EEP of the link.
   Simulation results show that delay-sensitive power is an exponentially
   increasing function of minimum EC while delay-insensitive power decays
   to zero for higher values of minimum EC. Further, delay-insensitive
   power increases while delay-sensitive power exponentially decreases with
   number of subchannels in the system.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic networking targets networks where end-to-end communication
   paths between nodes may not exist and it becomes important to seize
   opportunities to forward data to neighbouring nodes in the hope that it
   will eventually be propagated to the destination. Forwarding algorithms
   must address the trade-off between delivery performance (success ratio,
   end-to-end delay) and resource consumption (memory and bandwidth).
   Incorporating information about the contact pattern between nodes helps
   to distinguish nodes based on their forwarding capabilities. Aggregating
   contact events into weighted graphs, and thus forming a contact graph,
   enables us to detect communities and learn about the neighbourhoods of
   nodes. In this paper we incorporate this learning into a contact
   graph-based forwarding algorithm that makes decisions based on network
   communities. We compare the performance of this algorithm to existing
   forwarding schemes using simulations built on two real word
   contact-trace datasets that have distinct characteristics. Index

Abstract = {{Methods for distributed optimization are necessary to solve large-scale
   problems such as those becoming more common in machine learning. The
   communication cost associated with transmitting large messages can
   become a serious performance bottleneck. We propose a consensus-based
   distributed algorithm to minimize a convex separable objective. Each
   node holds one component of the objective function, and the nodes
   alternate between a computation phase, where local gradient steps are
   performed based on the local objective, and a communication phase, where
   consensus steps are performed to bring the local states into agreement.
   The nodes use local decision rules to adaptively determine when
   communication is not necessary. This results in significantly lower
   communication costs and allows a user to tradeoff the amount of
   communication with the accuracy of the final output. Experiments on a
   cluster using simulated and real datasets illustrate the tradeoff.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problems of distributed online prediction and
   optimization. Each node in a network of processors processes a stream of
   data in an online manner. Before the next data point arrives, the
   processor must make a prediction. Then, after receiving the next point,
   the processor accrues some loss or regret. The goal of the processors is
   to minimize the total aggregate regret. We propose a consensus-based
   distributed optimization method for fitting a model used to make the
   predictions online. After observing each data point, nodes individually
   make gradient descent-like adjustments to their model parameters, and
   then consensus iterations are performed to synchronize models across the
   nodes. We prove that the proposed method achieves the optimal regret
   bound when the loss function has Lipschitz continuous gradients, and the
   amount of communication required depends on the network structure.}},

Abstract = {{Associative memories are structures that can retrieve previously stored
   information given a partial input pattern instead of an explicit address
   as in indexed memories. A few hardware approaches have recently been
   introduced for a new family of associative memories based on
   Sparse-Clustered Networks (SCN) that show attractive features. These
   architectures are suitable for implementations with low retrieval
   latency, but are limited to small networks that store a few hundred data
   entries. In this paper, a new hardware architecture of SCNs is proposed
   that features a new data-storage technique as well as a method we refer
   to as Selective Decoding (SD-SCN). The SD-SCN has been implemented using
   a similar FPGA used in the previous efforts and achieves two orders of
   magnitude higher capacity, with no error-performance penalty but with
   the cost of few extra clock cycles per data access.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the maximization of the weighted sum-rate

   channel (BC). Studied is the multicell network operating on the same
   frequency channel with multiple mobile stations (MS) per cell. With
   interference coordination (IC) between the multiple cells, the
   base-station (BS) at each cell only transmits information signals to the
   MSs within its cell using the dirty paper coding (DPC) technique, while
   coordinating the inter-cell interference (ICI) induced to other cells.
   The main focus of this work is to jointly optimize the encoding
   covariance matrices at the BSs in order to maximize the network-wide
   WSR. Since this optimization problem is shown to be nonconvex, obtaining
   its globally optimal solution is highly complex. By applying a
   successive convex approximation technique, this work proposes a
   distributed algorithm that efficiently achieves a locally optimal
   solution. Simulations then show that the proposed algorithm can
   significantly improve the network-wide sum-rate, compared to the schemes

   It is assumed that the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is

   adapt the transmission rate of all cooperating nodes. Considering

   find the optimal rate adaptation policy for both the Source node and the

Abstract = {{This paper presents an optimal energy-efficient power allocation scheme
   for a point-to-point multicarrier link over frequency-selective fading
   channel subject to a delay-outage probability constraint. For a target
   delay-outage limit, the energy efficiency (EE) objective function is
   formulated as the ratio of the achieved link effective capacity to the
   total expenditure power, expressed in units of b/J/Hz. We first prove
   that this objective function is quasi-concave in the transmission power,
   and, hence, the global maximum solution of the underlying optimization
   problem can be obtained using fractional programming. Subsequently, we
   develop a two-step optimal power allocation algorithm by first obtaining
   the average sum power level corresponding to the maximum achievable EE,
   followed by jointly distributing this obtained average power over time
   and frequency. Analytical results show that the EE-based power
   allocation has a structure similar to that of the QoS-driven
   spectral-efficient scheme, but with a different cut-off threshold below
   which no transmission power is allocated. Simulation results show that
   the proposed joint optimal power allocation scheme provides significant
   EE gains over the simple independent subcarrier optimization scheme,
   where these performance advantages become more pronounced with tighter
   delay constraints and in fading channels with more severe frequency
   selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, achievable rates and power allocation (PA) schemes are
   studied for a two-way (TW) amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying system over
   Rayleigh fading channels in high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   regimes. We consider three different AF techniques: i) the channel
   inversion (CI) scheme where the relay has full channel side information
   (CSI) of the two incoming links; ii) the fixed-gain scheme where the
   relay has only channel distribution information (CDI); and iii) a mixed
   (MX) scheme where the relay has CSI of one link but only CDI of the
   other. First, focusing on high SNR regimes, approximations to the
   achievable rates of the three systems are derived. The approximations
   are shown to be tight and can be used to analyze the systems under
   consideration. In particular, it is demonstrated that the CI system
   provides the best sum rate performance, followed by the MX and CDI
   techniques. A suboptimal yet effective PA scheme to maximize the sum
   rate at high SNR is then proposed. In low SNR regimes, we first derive
   rate approximations for the considered AF systems. It is then shown that
   the three systems achieve a similar sum rate. An asymptotically optimal
   PA is then proposed to maximize the sum rate at low SNRs. Finally, the
   sum rate of the direct transmission (DT) scheme is compared to that of
   the TWAF system. Although the TWAF is proved to be inferior at low SNRs,
   it outperforms the DT at high SNRs in various network configurations.}},

   show that the (mean) stability of the network continues to be
   insensitive to the choice of the combination weights and to the network

   saving from capacitor size reduction, made possible by the even harmonic
   elimination methods, comes to naught when large ac fault currents charge
   the capacitors to voltages destructive to IGBTs. Deadbeat in preventing
   the voltage levels from rising ensures that cost saving from capacitor

Abstract = {{We present a CMOS capacitance to frequency convertor for capacitive MEMS
   sensors working in high temperature environments. Many MEMS sensors are
   needed to work at the extended military temperature range from -55
   degrees C to 175 degrees C and require a suitable readout circuitry to
   detect, process, and transmit the sensor measurement data. The proposed
   CMOS circuitry uses a current to frequency conversion circuit to convert
   the sensor capacitance output into a digital output modulated in
   frequency. Pulse width control is implemented on-chip to control the
   pulse width of the output digital signal. The circuitry is implemented
   using IBM 0.13 mu m CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the
   circuitry has excellent stability over wide temperature range, good
   accuracy and high sensing resolution. The novelty in this work lies in
   the fact that a digital output is achieved without using complex analog
   to digital converter (ADC).}},

   for monitoring and surveillance applications. In these applications,
   latency is often an important criterion. Identifying the factors the
   latency depends on helps minimize the latency in the network. The
   dependence of the latency experienced by a node on its geographical
   location is an area that has not been explored in detail. This paper
   describes the results of our research in determining whether the
   geographical location of the nodes has an impact on the delay
   experienced by them. Networks with different node densities were
   considered. The results of our research show that the latency
   experienced by a node is indeed dependent on its geographical location
   as well as the node density.}},

   is described. Second, semi-tied covariance transformations are applied
   as an alternative to full-covariance Gaussians to make acoustic model
   training less sensitive to issues of insufficient training data. These
   techniques are applied to Hindi and Marathi language data obtained for
   an agricultural commodities dialog task in multiple Indian languages.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria can be used as microcarriers for the transport of
   nano-components. By exploiting specific taxes such as chemotaxis,
   aerotaxis or phototaxis, to name but a few examples, sensory-based
   transports of nano-components towards or away from a specific source of
   chemical, oxygen, or light for instance, can be achieved. Using
   microbial adhesion methods, such nano-components can be attached to the
   surface of magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), allowing for precise
   magnetotaxis computer controlled transport of these nano-components
   along a planned path on a planar surface or towards a specific region
   within a 3D space. Here, the possibility of attaching a large number of
   nano-components to the surface of magnetotactic bacteria combined with
   the possibility of aggregating a large number of cells in a 3D space
   suggests the possibility of delivering and aggregating a large number of
   nano-components at a specific region within a relatively large 3D space
   using relatively low electrical energy.}},

Abstract = {{Paper-based microfluidic devices have emerged as simple yet powerful
   platforms for performing low-cost analytical tests. This paper reports a
   microfluidic paper-based electrochemical biosensor array for multiplexed
   detection of disease markers. Different from existing paper-based
   electrochemical biosensors, our device includes an array of eight
   electrochemical sensors and utilizes a custom-made, handheld
   electrochemical reader (potentiostat) for signal readout. The biosensor
   array can detect several analytes in a sample solution and produce
   multiple measurement data for each analyte from a single run. Using the
   device, we demonstrate simultaneous detection of three disease-relevant
   metabolic biomarkers (glucose, lactate, and uric acid), with analytical
   performance comparable to that of the existing commercial and
   paper-based platforms. The paper-based biosensor array and the
   electrochemical reader will enable the acquisition of high-density,
   statistically-meaningful diagnostic information at the point of care in
   a rapid and cost-efficient way.}},

Title = {{Bath Concentration of Anionic Contrast Agents Does Not Affect Their

Abstract = {{Objective: Differences in contrast agent diffusion reflect changes in
   composition and structure of articular cartilage. However, in clinical
   application the contrast agent concentration in the joint capsule
   varies, which may affect the reliability of contrast enhanced cartilage
   tomography (CECT). In the present study, effects of concentration of
   x-ray contrast agents on their diffusion and equilibrium distribution in
   cartilage were investigated. Design: Full-thickness cartilage discs (d =
   4.0 mm, n = 120) were detached from bovine patellae (n = 24). The
   diffusion of various concentrations of ioxaglate (5, 10, 21, 50 mM) and
   iodide (30, 60, 126, 300 mM) was allowed only through the articular
   surface. Samples were imaged with a clinical peripheral quantitative
   computed tomography scanner before immersion in contrast agent, and
   after 1, 5, 9, 16, 25, and 29 hours in the bath. Results: Diffusion and
   partition coefficients were similar between different contrast agent
   concentrations. The diffusion coefficient of iodide (473 +/- 133 mu
   m(2)/s) was greater (P <= 0.001) than that of ioxaglate (92 +/- 46 mu
   m(2)/s). In full-thickness cartilage, the partition coefficient (at 29
   h) of iodide (71 +/- 5\%) was greater (P <= 0.02 with most
   concentrations) than that of ioxaglate (62 +/- 6\%). Conclusions:
   Significant differences in partition and diffusion coefficient of two
   similarly charged (-1) contrast agents were detected, which shows the
   effect of steric interactions. However, the increase in solute
   concentration did not increase its partition coefficient. In clinical
   application, it is important that contrast agent concentration does not
   affect the interpretation of CECT imaging.}},

Title = {{Development and characterization of chitosan-PEG-TAT nanoparticles for
   the intracellular delivery of siRNA}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Recently, cell-penetrating peptides have been proposed to translocate
   antibodies, proteins, and other molecules in targeted drug delivery. The
   proposed study presents the synthesis and characterization of a
   peptide-based chitosan nanoparticle for small interfering RNA (siRNA)
   delivery, in-vitro. Specifically, the synthesis included polyethylene
   glycol (PEG), a hydrophilic polymer, and trans-activated transcription
   (TAT) peptide, which were chemically conjugated on the chitosan polymer.
   The conjugation was achieved using N-Hydroxysuccinimide-PEG-maleimide
   (heterobifunctional PEG) as a cross-linker, with the bifunctional PEG
   facilitating the amidation reaction through its N-Hydroxysuccinimide
   group and reacting with the amines on chitosan. At the other end of PEG,
   the maleimide group was chemically conjugated with the cysteine-modified
   TAT peptide. The degree of substitution on chitosan with PEG and on PEG
   with TAT was confirmed using colorimetric assays. The resultant polymer
   was used to form nanoparticles complexing siRNA, which were then
   characterized for particle size, morphology, cellular uptake, and
   cytotoxicity. The nanoparticles were tested in-vitro on mouse
   neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a). Particle size and surface charge were
   characterized and an optimal pH condition and PEG molecular weight were
   determined to form sterically stable nanoparticles. Results indicate
   7.5\% of the amines in chitosan polymer were conjugated to the PEG and
   complete conjugation of TAT peptide was observed on the synthesized
   PEGylated chitosan polymer. Compared with unmodified chitosan
   nanoparticles, the nanoparticles formed at pH 6 were monodispersed and
   of,100 nm in size, exhibiting maximum cell transfection ability and very
   low cytotoxicity. Thus, this research may be of significance in
   translocating biotherapeutic molecules for intracellular delivery
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the high speed routing of Carbon Fiber Reinforced
   Polymers (CFRP). Most of the work in the literature has focused on the
   drilling of CFRR In this paper, an extensive experimental study has been
   conducted to better understand the dynamic, tribological, and thermal
   characteristics of high speed milling of CFRPs, in the range of 10,000
   to 40,000 rpm (200 to 800 m/min, for 6.35 nun end-mill). The material
   used was a quasi-isotropic laminate comprising 35 plies of woven
   graphite epoxy. The tool wear was investigated on the flank and the rake
   faces. The machined slots were characterized in terms of straightness
   errors, dimensional errors, surface roughness, and delamination. The
   tool over-hang controls the tool dynamics, in this high speed range, and
   significantly affect various quality attributes of the produced holes;
   roughness, dimensional errors, and straightness. Similar trends were
   observed for the forces and the temperatures, whereby there is a given
   speed at which they reach a minimum and then they start to increase for
   higher speeds. The machining force and temperature trends with varying
   speeds and feeds are controlled by the chip load, the specific cutting
   pressures, and the effect of the frictional forces. The increased tool
   wear was found to directly affect the cutting forces and consequently
   lead to high delamination and surface roughness. The milled surface
   quality was mainly controlled by the feed rate. Limited surface
   delamination was observed due to the low axial forces associated with
   the routing process.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate predictions of the workpiece vibrations during high speed
   machining of aerospace structural components is a critical issue since
   it affects the accuracy of the final part. For fixture design purposes,
   and for force predictions, the computational efficiency of the dynamic
   models predicting the workpiece vibrations is a crucial factor since it
   affects the cycle time for the design and optimization of the fixtures.
   Most of the available dynamic models are based on computationally
   prohibitive techniques, such as finite element analysis. In this work,
   an integrated approach, based on recently developed semi-analytical
   models, is presented for the analysis of the effect of the fixture
   layout on the dynamics of thin-walled structures while taking into
   account the continuous change of thickness of the workpiece, and the
   effect of rigid and deformable fixture supports. The developed approach
   is based on plate models with holonomic constraints and finite stiffness
   springs. This approach, together with all the developed models and
   formulations are validated numerically for different workpiece
   geometries and various types of loading. An experimental study has been
   performed to validate this approach through the machining of thin-walled
   components. It was found that this approach led to prediction errors
   within 10\% and more than 20 times reduction in the computation time.
   The challenge of filtering the effect of the dynamics of the force
   measurement system from the measured signals was overcome by developing
   a new hybrid semi-analytical methodology for accurate measurement of the
   machining forces.}},

   polynomials and a linear analysis is conducted to obtain the natural
   frequencies and mode shapes. Then, the energy functional is discretized
   by using the natural modes of vibration and a system of nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations with cubic and quadratic nonlinear terms
   is obtained. A pseudo arc-length continuation and collocation scheme is
   employed to carry out a bifurcation analysis. The effect of number of
   modes retained in the approximation, thickness ratio and geometric
   imperfections on the trend of nonlinearity is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter presents the design and microfabrication of a glass-based
   microfluidic device for trapping and immobilization of single mouse
   embryos. The use of the device is demonstrated in automated robotic
   microinjection of mouse embryos for large-scale biomolecule testing. The
   working principle of the device is based on the hydrodynamic trapping
   effect generated when a vacuum (e.g., negative pressure) is applied to
   micrometer-sized through-holes on a glass substrate. A novel
   microfabrication process is developed for device construction, which
   includes two-sided glass wet etching and polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS)glass oxygen plasma bonding. Experimental results of single embryo
   trapping and microinjection demonstrate that the device is capable of
   trapping and immobilizing 25 mouse embryos within 31 s, and that the
   hydrodynamic immobilization does not produce negative effects on
   embryonic development after microinjection.}},

Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the traverse shear instabilities
   in open-channel flow are conducted using the shallow-water equations for
   the convective Froude numbers of Fr-c = 0.01, 0.1 and 0.8. The
   simulations determine the evolution of a small disturbance with time in
   the transverse shear flow for a range of wave number. It also produces
   the nonlinear development that leads to the formation of eddies at the
   low convective Froude numbers of Fr-c= 0.01 and the shocklets at the
   higher convective Froude number of Fr-c = 0.8. The exchanges across the
   shocklets are characterized by the radiation of gravity wave and reduced
   rate of the shear instabilities. Five different flux limiting schemes
   are employed for the DNS. Four stages of the grid refinement determine
   the order of convergence toward the true solution for each of the
   computational schemes. The results for the initial exponential growth
   are in agreement with the linear stability analysis using the normal
   mode approach. The gravity-wave radiation from the open channel flow has
   the similar effect on the shear instabilities as the radiation of the
   sound from the shear flow in compressible gas. The dependence on the
   convective Froude number for the transverse shear flow in open channel
   is shown to be analogous to the shear instability in compressible gas
   and is consistent with the shear instability calculation results
   obtained for the ideal gas by Sandham \& Reynolds (1990).}},

   feasibility of the suggested SD method was tested using the NCEP

   the 1961-2001 period at two study sites located in completely two
   different climatic regions: the Seoul station in tropical-climate Korea
   and the Dorval Airport station in cold-climate Canada. It was found that
   it is feasible to link large-scale climate predictors given by GCM
   simulation outputs with daily precipitation characteristics at both
   stations. Furthermore, the proposed SD method could provide more

Abstract = {{A skeletal chemical kinetic model for jet fuel combustion, comprising
   four representative fuel components, is presented. The sub model for the
   three components, toluene, methyl cyclohexane (MCH) and n-dodecane, is
   deduced from a detailed model for jet fuel surrogate proposed by Wang et
   al. {[}Wang et al., 2010]. The reduction is based on a species
   sensitivity approach, herein referred to as Alternate Species
   Elimination (ASE). The sub model for the fourth component, iso-octane,
   is established through semi-detailed kinetic modeling, considering
   existing reactions and species of the smaller hydrocarbon systems as
   well as species and reactions pertinent to the n-dodecane system.
   The performance of the resulting model is assessed by comparing
   predictions of ignition delay times and laminar burning velocities with
   those of the detailed model. It is shown that the skeletal model retains
   the predictive ability of the detailed model with respect to the three
   components, n-dodecane, MCH and toluene. The complementary iso-octane
   sub model is also found to reasonably predict high-temperature ignition
   delay times and laminar burning velocities.
   The four component skeletal model is tested against shock tube ignition
   data and laminar burning velocities of jet fuel surrogates. It is
   observed that high-temperature ignition is fairly well predicted while
   low-temperature ignition delay times are longer than experimentally
   observed. While the predictions of laminar burning velocities of
   atmospheric flames of jet fuels at 400 K are reasonable, slower flames
   are predicted at higher temperatures. The proposed skeletal model has
   192 species and 1291 reactions, compared to the detailed multi-component
   model, with 348 species and 2163 elementary reactions, albeit without
   isooctane. This results in improvement in the associated computational
   costs for combustion analysis. Further development of the skeletal model
   is needed to improve its prediction ability over a wider range of
   combustion properties and thermodynamic conditions.}},

   conventional aviation fuel, yielding a bioderived synthetic paraffinic
   kerosene (Bio-SPK). Two considered blends are biofuel and Jet A-1
   mixtures, while the third is a 90\% Bio-SPK mixture with 10\% aromatic
   additives. Premixed flame speed measurements are conducted at an
   unburned temperature of 400 K and atmospheric pressure using a jet-wall
   stagnation flame apparatus. Since the laminar flame speed cannot be
   studied experimentally, a strained (or reference) flame speed is used as
   the basis for the initial comparison. Only by using an appropriate
   surrogate fuel were the reference flame speed measurements extrapolated
   to zero flame strain, accomplished using a direct comparison of
   simulations to experiments. This method has been previously shown to
   yield results consistent with non-linear extrapolations. Vapor pressure
   measurements of the biojet blends are also made from 25 to 200 degrees C
   using an isoteniscope. Finally, the biojet blends are compared to the
   Jet A-1 benchmark on the basis of laminar flame speed at different
   equivalence ratios, as well as on the basis of vapor pressure over a
   wide temperature range, and the suitability of a binary laminar flame
   speed surrogate for these biojet fuels is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenology of rotor-casing setups experiencing contact
   interactions is still poorly understood, particularly when complex
   geometries such as centrifugal compressors are involved. Although
   interaction phenomena have been witnessed and recorded during industrial
   experiments, the physical understanding of what occurs during these
   interactions is limited. The usual design approach is to consider
   possible modal interaction points in a linear framework and move these
   outside of normal operating conditions by means of minor geometric
   changes.
   Based on this linear approach, no information on the severity of these
   interactions is available to the designer. Besides, a possible
   interaction point appearing in the linear framework may not produce any
   harmful interactions, thereby increasing design restrictions. Based on
   an in-house numerical strategy previously presented, contact
   interactions for a flexible centrifugal compressor from a helicopter
   engine and rigid casing setup are investigated. By imposing a small
   deformation on the casing geometry, blade/casing contact is initiated
   and subsequent interactions feature complex phenomena that are analyzed.
   In comparison to previous interaction simulations involving axial
   compressors, a higher degree of complexity of the numerical simulations
   stems from a strong curvature of the blade and very significant
   blade-disk coupling. This coupling presents itself towards the trailing
   edge where compressor mode shapes indicate a significant component
   normal to the casing surface. Accordingly, these modes may lead to large
   amplitude contact forces.
   Time simulation results are confronted with experimental observations,
   and the consistency of the behavior of the numerical model with respect
   to industrial observations is underlined. A frequency domain
   post-processing of the results reveals specific engine order
   interactions and frequency spectra are plotted in order to interpret the
   phenomenon of interest. Such methodology will enable designers to more
   efficiently discriminate potential critical interaction speeds as
   compared to the classical linear frequency approach.}},

Abstract = {{In modem turbomachinery, abradable materials are implemented on casings
   to reduce operating tip clearances and mitigate direct unilateral
   contact occurrences between rotating and stationary components. However;
   both experimental and numerical investigations revealed that
   blade/abradable interactions may lead to blade failures.
   In order to comprehend the underlying mechanism, an accurate modeling of
   the abradable removal process is required. Time-marching strategies
   where the abradable removal is modeled through plasticity are available
   but another angle of attack is proposed in this work. It is assumed that
   the removal of abradable liners shares similarities with machine tool
   chatter encountered in manufacturing. Chatter is a self-excited
   vibration caused by the interaction between the machine and the
   workpiece through the cutting forces, and the corresponding dynamics are
   efficiently captured by delay differential equations. They differ from
   ordinary differential equations in that previous states of the system
   are involved. This mathematical framework is here employed for the
   exploration of the blade stability during abradable removal.
   The proposed tool advantageously features a reduced computational cost
   and consistency with existing time-marching solution methods.
   Potentially dangerous interaction regimes are accurately predicted and
   instability lobes match both flexural and torsional modal responses.
   Essentially, the regenerative nature of chatter in machining processes
   can also be attributed to abradable coating removal in turbomachinery.}},

Title = {{Trace elements can influence the physical properties of tooth enamel}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{In previous studies, we showed that the size of apatite nanocrystals in
   tooth enamel can influence its physical properties. This important
   discovery raised a new question; which factors are regulating the size
   of these nanocrystals? Trace elements can affect crystallographic
   properties of synthetic apatite, therefore this study was designed to
   investigate how trace elements influence enamel's crystallographic
   properties and ultimately its physical properties.
   The concentration of trace elements in tooth enamel was determined for
   38 extracted human teeth using inductively coupled plasma-optical
   emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The following trace elements were
   detected: Al, K, Mg, S, Na, Zn, Si, B, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb,
   Sb, Se and Ti. Simple and stepwise multiple regression was used to
   identify the correlations between trace elements concentration in enamel
   and its crystallographic structure, hardness, resistance to crack
   propagation, shade lightness and carbonate content. The presence of some
   trace elements in enamel was correlated with the size (Pb, Ti, Mn) and
   lattice parameters (Se, Cr, Ni) of apatite nanocrystals. Some trace
   elements such as Ti was significantly correlated with tooth
   crystallographic structure and consequently with hardness and shade
   lightness. We conclude that the presence of trace elements in enamel
   could influence its physical properties.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Process technology scaling, lagging supply voltage scaling, and the
   resulting exponential increase in power density, have made temperature a
   first-class design constraint in today's microprocessors. Prior work has
   shown that the silicon substrate acts as a spatial low-pass filter for
   temperature. This phenomenon, spatial thermal filtering, has clear
   implications for thermal management: depending on the size of
   dissipators, either design-time strategies, such as dividing and
   distributing functionality spatially, or runtime strategies, such as
   isolating functionality temporally (duty cycling), may be the most
   effective way to control peak temperature. To assist designers with such
   trade-offs, we have performed extensive analysis and simulation to
   evaluate the extent and effect of spatial filtering on thermal
   management in a number of microarchitecture design scenarios.
   We begin our exploration of spatial filtering with an analytical study
   of the heat conduction problem, followed by a series of studies to
   validate the effect and extent of spatial filtering under realistic
   system assumptions. In particular, we investigate the effect of power
   dissipator size, location, and aspect ratio in the context of
   high-performance computing. We then extend these experiments with two
   microarchitectural studies. First, we perform a study of spatial
   filtering in many-core architectures. Our results show that as cores
   shrink, the granularity of effective thermal management increases to the
   point that even turning cores on and off has a limited effect on peak
   temperature. Second, we investigate spatial filtering in caches. We
   discover that despite the size and aspect ratio of cache lines,
   pathological code behavior can heat caches to undesirable levels,
   accelerating wear-out. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{107-118}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Homokinetic motion transmission between two shafts with axes
   intersecting at right angles is a recurrent problem; the term
   quasi-homokinetic indicates that a constant 1:1 velocity ratio between
   the input and output is the design target, even though this cannot be
   fully met with a four-bar linkage. A four-bar spherical linkage is
   optimally designed, which performs ``homokinetically{''} with minimum
   error through a 120 degrees rotation of its input link, large enough for
   one specific robotics application. This is done via: (i) minimizing the
   root-mean-square value of the design error, i.e.. the residual of the
   synthesis equations at the prescribed set of input values; and (ii)
   directly minimizing the structural error, i.e., the deviation of the
   generated output angles from the prescribed set. The novelty of the
   first method lies in that it provides all stationary points, and hence,
   the global minimum; finding a continuum of minima leaves ample room for
   maximizing the transmission quality. Further, the effect of data-set
   cardinality on the structural error is analyzed, which is then minimized
   directly. A new mechanism is thus obtained with a minimum structural
   error, but with a slightly compromised transmission quality. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Aims: Probiotics were microencapsulated in raspberry juice through spray
   drying.
   Methods \& Results: A combination of probiotics (Lactobacillus
   acidophilus NRRL B-4495 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus NRRL B-442) was
   chosen to offer high viability. Maltodextrin's role as a carbon source
   was also assessed for its prebiotic potential. Spray drying inlet
   temperature (degrees C), total solids: maltodextrin ratio, and inlet
   feed rate (mL/min) were fixed as independent variables while \%
   recovery, \% survival and color were the dependent outputs.
   Conclusions \& Significance: High temperatures during spray drying are
   detrimental to probiotics and can be circumvented by sub-lethal thermal
   shock (50 degrees C for L acidophilus and 52.5 degrees C for L
   rhamnosus). Increasing the microencapsulating material concentration
   increased the survival rate of the probiotics. Non-dairy probiotic foods
   are becoming popular as they do not pose problems of lactose intolerance

Abstract = {{The effect of scalar-field (temperature) boundary conditions on the
   inertial-convective-range scaling exponents of the high-order passive
   scalar structure functions is studied in the turbulent, heated wake
   downstream of a circular cylinder. The temperature field is generated
   two ways: using (i) a heating element embedded within the cylinder that
   generates the hydrodynamic wake (thus creating a heated cylinder) and
   (ii) a mandoline (an array of fine, heated wires) installed downstream
   of the cylinder. The hydrodynamic field is independent of the
   scalar-field boundary conditions/injection methods, and the same in both
   flows. Using the two heat injection mechanisms outlined above, the
   inertial-convective-range scaling exponents of the high-order passive
   scalar structure functions were measured. It is observed that the
   different scalar-field boundary conditions yield significantly different
   scaling exponents (with the magnitude of the difference increasing with
   structure function order). Moreover, the exponents obtained from the
   mandoline experiment are smaller than the analogous exponents from the
   heated cylinder experiment (both of which exhibit a significant
   departure from the Kolmogorov prediction). Since the observed deviation
   from the Kolmogorov n/3 prediction arises due to the effects of internal
   intermittency, the typical interpretation of this result would be that
   the scalar field downstream of the mandoline is more internally
   intermittent than that generated by the heated cylinder. However,
   additional measures of internal intermittency (namely the
   inertial-convective-range scaling exponents of the mixed, sixth-order,
   velocity temperature structure functions and the non-centred
   autocorrelations of the dissipation rate of scalar variance) suggest
   that both scalar fields possess similar levels of internal intermittency
   - a distinctly different conclusion. Examination of the normalized
   high-order moments reveals that the smaller scaling exponents (of the
   high-order passive scalar structure functions) obtained for the
   mandoline experiment arise due to the smaller thermal integral length
   scale of the flow (i.e. the narrower inertial-convective subrange) and
   are not solely the result of a more intermittent scalar field. The
   difference in the passive scalar structure function scaling exponents
   can therefore be interpreted as an artifact of the different, finite
   Peclet numbers of the flows under consideration an effect that is
   notably less prominent in the other measures of internal intermittency.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations are still ongoing to discover the mechanism by which
   surfactants promote hydrate growth. This paper investigates the effects
   of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a common surfactant for promoting
   hydrate growth, on methane solubility and mole fraction in the bulk
   liquid phase. Hydrates were formed in a stirred 600 cm(3)
   isobaric/isothermal reactor containing 343 cm(3) of liquid. Bulk
   solubility experiments under hydrate-liquid, liquid-gas, and
   hydrate-liquid-gas equilibria were performed at temperatures ranging
   from 275.1 K to 283.3 K and pressures ranging from 3049 kPa to 6500 kPa
   with pure water as well as SDS solutions. Kinetic experiments were also
   performed with water and 360-ppm solutions of SDS at temperatures of
   275.1 K, 277.1 K and 279.1 K and pressures of 4545 kPa, 5180 kPa and
   6080 kPa respectively. Measurements of the mole fraction of methane in
   the bulk liquid were taken at 0 s, 225 s and 450 s after hydrate
   nucleation. Experiments showed that SDS has no effect on bulk methane
   solubility at concentrations that significantly promote hydrate growth.
   SDS was found to increase methane mole fraction in the bulk liquid
   during hydrate growth following nucleation. Results were analyzed using
   the solubility model previously developed by Bergeron and Servio. The
   increase in methane mole fraction was found to be the major contributor
   to the increase in hydrate growth rate. It is estimated that other
   factors, such as changes in hydrate particle surface area, may also
   affect the growth rate and should be investigated further. (C) 2012

Title = {{Design, implementation, and application of a microresonator platform for
   measuring energy dissipation by internal friction in nanowires}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Accurate measurements of internal friction in nanowires are required for
   the rational design of high-Q resonators used in nanoelectromechanical
   systems and for fundamental studies of nanomechanical behavior. However,
   measuring internal friction is challenging because of the difficulties
   associated with identifying the contributions of material dissipation to
   structural damping. Here, we present an approach for overcoming these
   difficulties by using a composite microresonator platform that is
   calibrated against the ultimate limits of thermoelastic damping. The
   platform consists of an array of nanowires patterned at the root of a
   low-loss single-crystal silicon microcantilever. The structure is
   processed using a lift-off technique, implemented using electron-beam
   lithography, to achieve excellent control over the size, alignment,
   dispersion and location of the nanowire array. As the first application
   of this platform, we measured internal friction at room temperature in
   aluminum nanowires that ranged from 50 to 100 nm in thickness and 100 to
   400 nm in width. Internal friction is similar to 0.03 at frequencies of
   6.5-21 kHz. Transmission electron microscopy of the nanocrystalline
   grain structure, and comparison with previously measured values of
   internal friction in continuous thin films of aluminum, suggest that
   grain-boundary sliding is a major source of internal friction in these
   nanowires.}},

Title = {{Using discrete wavelet transforms to analyze trends in streamflow and

Volume = {{475}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to detect trends in mean flow and total precipitation
   data over southern parts of Quebec and Ontario, Canada. The main purpose
   of the trend assessment is to find out what time scales are affecting
   the trends observed in the datasets used. In this study, a new trend
   detection method for hydrological studies is explored, which involves
   the use of wavelet transforms (WTs) in order to separate the rapidly and
   slowly changing events contained in a time series. More specifically,
   this study co-utilizes the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique
   and the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend tests to analyze and detect trends in
   monthly, seasonally-based, and annual data from eight flow stations and
   seven meteorological stations in southern Ontario and Quebec during
   1954-2008. The combination of the DWT and MK test in analyzing trends
   has not been extensively explored to date, especially in detecting
   trends in Canadian flow and precipitation time series. The mother
   wavelet type and the extension border used in the wavelet transform, as
   well as the number of decomposition levels, were determined based on two
   criteria. The first criterion is the mean relative error of the wavelet
   approximation series and the original time series. In addition, a new
   criterion is proposed and explored in this study, which is based on the
   relative error of the MK Z-values of the approximation component and the
   original time series. Sequential Mann-Kendall analysis on the different
   wavelet detail components (with their approximation component added)
   that result from the time series decomposition was also used and found
   to be helpful because it depicts how harmonious each of the detail
   components (plus approximation) is with respect to the original data.
   This study found that most of the trends are positive and started during
   the mid-1960s to early 1970s. The results from the wavelet analysis and
   Mann-Kendall tests on the different data types (using the 5\%
   significance level) reveal that in general, intra- and inter-annual
   events (up to 4 years) are more influential in affecting the observed
   trends. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The in-plane components of the electrical conductivity tensor for gas
   diffusion layers (GDLs) used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells
   were measured using an alternative method that has not previously been
   applied to GDLs. This method uses a square electrode configuration,
   which offers many practical and theoretical advantages over
   conventionally used linear four point probe methods. Results obtained
   using this method were in excellent agreement with reported values where
   applicable. Pronounced anisotropy was found in the in-plane electrical
   conductivity for all samples, in agreement with other findings.
   Conductivity measurements were also performed on samples rotated
   relative to a fixed axis to determine the full extent of anisotropy,
   assumed to be due to fiber alignment, allowing the intrinsic components
   of the conductivity tensor to be found. The maximum and minimum
   conductivities were found at a rotation angle different from the main
   directions of the GDL sheet from which the tested samples were cut. The
   average in-plane conductivity of GDL samples was independent of rotation
   angle. Because the direction of maximum conductivity was found to differ
   from the main sheet axis, the measured conductivity tensor was rotated
   to yield the corrected 2-dimensional tensor relative to the main GDL
   axis. The method for performing this correction is discussed and an
   experimental method for measuring the necessary data from only a single
   sample is proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical study of the elastic properties of bulk
   nanocrystalline materials based on a continuum theory, introduced by
   Fried and Gurtin (2009), for nanoscale polycrystalline elasticity that
   captures length-scale effects and accounts for interactions across grain
   boundaries via interface and junction conditions. The theory involves a
   balance equation containing fourth-order gradients of the displacement
   field. A relatively inexpensive, non-conforming finite-element method
   based on C-0-continuous basis functions is presented. We develop the
   variational form of the method and establish consistency. The
   formulation weakly enforces continuity of derivatives of the
   displacement field across interelement boundaries and stabilization is
   achieved via Nitsche's method. Based on this approach, numerical studies
   are performed for a polycrystal subject to an uniaxial deformation.
   Results indicate that the theory predicts lower Young's modulus for bulk
   nanocrystalline materials than for conventional coarsely-grained
   polycrystals. Moreover, as the grain size decreases below a certain
   threshold, the effective elastic modulus decreases and the effective
   Poisson's ratio increases. The distribution of the effective stress
   shows that the theory captures high strain gradients in the vicinity of
   the grain boundaries and triple junctions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We propose a training symbol based channel estimation (TS-EST) algorithm
   that estimates the 2 x 2 Jones channel matrix. The estimated matrix
   entries are then used as the initial center taps of the 2 x 2 butterfly
   equalizer. Employing very few training symbols for TS-EST, ultrafast
   polarization tracking is achieved and tap update can be initially
   pursued using the decision-directed least mean squares (DD-LMS)
   algorithm to mitigate residual intersymbol interference (ISI). We
   experimentally verify the proposed TS-EST algorithm for 112 Gbps
   PDM-QPSK and 224 Gbps PDM-16QAM systems using 10 and 40 training symbols
   for TS-EST, respectively. Steady-state and transient bit error rates
   (BERs) achieved using the TS-EST algorithm are compared to those
   obtained using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and the training
   symbol least mean squares (TS-LMS) algorithm and results show that the
   proposed TS-EST algorithm provides the same steady-state BER with a
   superior convergence speed. Also, the tolerance of the proposed TS-EST
   algorithm to laser phase noise and fiber nonlinearity is experimentally
   verified. Finally, we show by simulation that the superior tracking
   speed of the TS-EST algorithm allows not only for initial polarization
   tracking but also for tracking fast polarization transients if four
   training symbols are periodically sent during steady-state operation
   with an overhead as low as 0.57\%. (C)2012 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Resting-State Connectivity of the Sustained Attention Network Correlates
   with Disease Duration in Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), a normal
   electroencephalogram between generalized spike and wave (GSW) discharges
   is believed to reflect normal brain function. However, some studies
   indicate that even excluding GSW-related errors, IGE patients perform
   poorly on sustained attention task, the deficit being worse as a
   function of disease duration. We hypothesized that at least in a subset
   of structures which are normally involved in sustained attention,
   resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is different in IGE patients
   compared to controls and that some of the changes are related to disease
   duration.
   Method: Seeds were selected based on a sustained attention study in
   controls. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   data was obtained from 14 IGE patients and 14 matched controls. After
   physiological noise removal, the mean time-series of each seed was used
   as a regressor in a general linear model to detect regions that showed
   correlation with the seed. In patients, duration factor was defined
   based on epilepsy duration. Between-group differences weighted by the
   duration factor were evaluated with mixed-effects model. Correlation was
   then evaluated in IGE patients between the FC, averaged over each
   significant cluster, and the duration factor.
   Results: Eight of 18 seeds showed significant difference in FC across
   groups. However, only for seeds in the medial superior frontal and
   precentral gyri and in the medial prefrontal area, average FC taken over
   significant clusters showed high correlation with the duration factor.
   These 3 seeds showed changes in FC respectively with the premotor and
   superior frontal gyrus, the dorsal premotor, and the supplementary motor
   area plus precentral gyrus.
   Conclusion: Alterations of FC in IGE patients are not limited to the
   frontal areas. However, as indicated by specificity analysis, patients
   with long history of disease show changes in FC mainly within the
   frontal areas. Citation: Maneshi M, Moeller F, Fahoum F, Gotman J, Grova

Abstract = {{We present both theoretically and experimentally a novel blind and fast
   method for estimating the State of Polarization (SOP) of a single
   carrier channel modulated in square Dual Polarization (DP) MQAM format
   for optical coherent receivers. The method can be used on system
   startup, for quick channel reconfiguration, or for burst mode receivers.
   It consists of converting the received waveform from Jones to Stokes
   space and looping over an algorithm until a unitary polarization
   derotation matrix is estimated. The matrix is then used to initialize
   the center taps of the subsequent classical decision-directed stochastic
   gradient algorithm (DD-LMS). We present experimental comparisons of the
   initial Bit Error Rate (BER) and the speed of convergence of this blind
   Stokes space polarization recovery (PR) technique against the common
   Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA). We demonstrate that this technique
   works on any square DP-MQAM format by presenting experimental results
   for DP-4QAM, -16QAM and -64QAM at varying distances and baud rates. We
   additionally numerically assess the technique for varying differential
   group delays (DGD) and sampling offsets on 28 Gbaud DP-4QAM format and
   show fast polarization recovery for instantaneous DGD as high as 90\% of
   symbol duration. We show that the convergence time of this blind PR
   technique does not depend on the initial SOP as CMA does and allows
   switching to DD-LMS faster by more than an order of magnitude. For
   DP-4QAM, it shows a convergence time of 5.9 ns, which is much smaller
   than the convergence time of recent techniques using modified CMA
   algorithms for quicker convergence. BER of the first 20 x 10(3) symbols
   is always smaller by several factors for DP-16QAM and -64QAM but not
   always for DP-4QAM. (C)2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Chaotic vibrations of functionally graded doubly curved shells subjected
   to concentrated harmonic load are investigated. It is assumed that the
   shell is simply supported and the edges can move freely in in-plane
   directions. Donnell's nonlinear shallow shell theory is used and the
   governing partial differential equations are obtained in terms of
   shell's transverse displacement and Airy's stress function. By using
   Galerkin's procedure, the equations of motion are reduced to a set of
   infinite nonlinear ordinary differential equations with cubic and
   quadratic nonlinearities. A bifurcation analysis is carried out and the
   discretized equations are integrated at (i) fixed excitation frequencies
   and variable excitation amplitudes and (ii) fixed excitation amplitudes
   and variable excitation frequencies. In particular, Gear's backward
   differentiation formula (BDF) is used to obtain bifurcation diagrams,
   Poincare maps and time histories. Furthermore, maximum Lyapunov exponent
   and Lyapunov spectrum are obtained to classify the rich dynamics. It is
   revealed that the shell may exhibit complex behavior including
   sub-harmonic, quasi-periodic and chaotic response when subjected to
   large harmonic excitations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the dynamic response and order-tuning of vibration
   absorbers fitted to a rotating flexible structure under traveling wave
   (TW) engine order excitation. Of specific interest is the extension of
   previous results on the so-called no-resonance zone, that is, a region
   in linear tuning parameter space in which the coupled structure/absorber
   system does not experience resonance over all rotation speeds. The
   no-resonance feature was shown to exist for cyclic rotating structures
   with one structural and one absorber degree of freedom (DOF) per sector.
   This work uses a higher-fidelity structural model to investigate the
   effects of higher modes on the cyclically-coupled system. It is shown
   that the no-resonance zone is replaced by a resonance-suppression zone
   in which one structural mode is suppressed, but higher-order resonances
   still exist with the addition of the absorbers. The results are general
   in the sense that one vibration mode can be eliminated using a set of
   identically-tuned absorbers on a rotating structure with arbitrarily
   many DOFs per sector. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007564]}},

Abstract = {{ACE inhibitory activity was investigated for protein hydrolysates
   derived from protein isolates of three Phaseolus vulgaris varieties,
   namely, navy bean, black bean and small red bean. Hydrolysis was
   performed using sequential digestion of Alcalase/Flavourzyme (AF) or
   Alcalase/papain (AP). Samples of the protein isolates were heated prior
   to hydrolysis and the results (i.e., degree of hydrolysis (DH),
   electrophoresis profiles, and ACE inhibitory activities) were compared
   to unheated samples. For all varieties, significantly higher DH values
   (P<0.05) were obtained for the AF hydrolysates compared to the AP
   hydrolysates. Heat treatments improved the DH values of navy bean and
   small red bean, however, lower values were observed for the heated black
   bean samples. For all unheated samples, phaseolins were degraded slowly
   to fragments with an estimated molecular mass around 20-24 kDa which
   were resistant to further AF or AP digestions. Extensive degradations
   were observed for heat-treated samples and phaseolins were hydrolyzed
   into smaller peptides at the initial stage of digestions. AP
   hydrolysates for all investigated varieties presented higher ACE
   inhibitory activity than the AF hydrolysates. The highest ACE inhibitory
   activities were obtained after 100 min of AP digestion for heated
   samples from navy bean, and 95 min of AP digestion for heated samples
   from both black and small red beans, which yielded an IC50 of 68 +/- 5
   mu g protein/ml, 83 +/- 13 mu g protein/ml and 78 +/- 7 mu g protein/ml,
   respectively. Stabilities of these hydrolysates were tested by simulated
   in vitro gastrointestinal digestion followed by ACE inhibition studies,
   and lower IC50 values were determined for all three hydrolysates. Crown

   Improvement and Pragmatic Approach for Near-Capacity Performance in

Abstract = {{This paper studies the mutual information improvement attained by
   rotated multidimensional (multi-D) constellations via a unitary precoder
   G in Rayleigh fading. At first, based on the symmetric cut-off rate of
   the N-D signal space, we develop a design criterion with regard to the
   precoder G. It is then demonstrated that the use of rotated
   constellations in only a reasonably low dimensional signal space can
   significantly increase the mutual information in high-rate regimes.
   Based on parameterizations of unitary matrices, we then construct good
   unitary precoder G in 4-D signal space using a simple optimization
   problem, which involves only four real variables and it is applicable to
   any modulation scheme. To further illustrate the potential of multi-D
   constellation and to show the practical use of mutual information
   improvement, we propose a simple yet powerful bit-interleaved coded
   modulation (BICM) scheme in which a (multi-D) mapping technique employed
   in a multi-D rotated constellation is concatenated with a short-memory
   high-rate convolutional code. By using extrinsic information transfer
   (EXIT) charts, it is shown that the proposed technique provides an
   exceptionally good error performance. In particular, both EXIT chart
   analysis and simulation results indicate that a turbo pinch-off and a
   bit error rate around 10(-6) happen at a signal-to-noise ratio that is
   well below the coded modulation and BICM capacities using traditional
   signal sets. For example, with code rates ranging from 2/3 to 7/8, the
   proposed system can operate 0.82 dB-2.93 dB lower than the BICM capacity
   with QPSK and Gray labeling. The mutual information gain offered by
   rotated constellations can be therefore utilized to design simple yet
   near Shannon limit systems in the high-rate regions.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the burst assembly algorithms employed in optical burst
   switching (OBS) networks preserve the IP traffic self-similarity
   property in the burst traffic. We introduce a mathematical model for
   performance evaluation of an OBS core node employing either no, a
   partial or a full wavelength conversion strategy. The model assumes
   long-range dependent (LRD) traffic arrivals to the OBS intermediate node
   whose inter-arrival times are accurately modeled by a Pareto
   distribution, whereas exponential holding times are assumed. In our
   proposed model, each output port in the node is modeled as a GI/M/w/w
   queue with partial server accessibility. An imbedded Markov chain
   approach is used to derive the limiting state probability distribution
   for the number of bursts currently served by an output port as seen by
   arriving bursts. Next, the average burst loss probability is evaluated
   from steady-state occupancy probabilities. In addition, the results of
   our mathematical model are validated via simulation. Furthermore, the
   results of the model are compared with those when assuming short-range
   dependent Poisson arrivals. Comparison shows that traditional Poisson
   traffic models yield over-optimistic performance measures compared to
   the LRD Pareto traffic models, especially for light traffic scenarios.
   Furthermore, we study the impact of varying different traffic
   parameters, such as the average arrival rate and the Hurst parameter, on
   the burst loss probability. Finally, the impact of varying the
   wavelength conversion capability on the burst loss probability is
   studied, where we compare two strategies for contention resolution:
   adding new channels (wavelengths) or adding wavelength converters, while
   taking the cost into consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Irrigation scheduling is still a serious issue for water managers to
   achieve efficient water utilization. The dynamic nature of rainfall
   occurrence may lead to deep percolation, runoff and/or crop water
   stress, when the saturation allowance is not precisely determined for
   irrigation scheduling. In this paper, it was proposed to eliminate the
   fixed maximum allowable soil moisture from simulation-based irrigation
   scheduling modeling and replace it with dynamic dependent values
   calculated by a fuzzy inference engine. In this case, the maximum
   allowable irrigation depth was not controlled by the field capacity
   level of soil moisture, and the saturation allowance is considered to
   store rain in the crop root zone. For this purpose, a classical
   simulation-based irrigation scheduling model is modified based on an
   intelligent state dropping (ISD) mechanism. The theoretical basis of the
   ISD mechanism was previously developed by Ganji and Pouyan (2011).
   Application of the ISD mechanism considers water balance uncertainty by
   determining the maximum weekly allowable soil moisture (the level of
   saturation allowance). The proposed model is used to calculate a real
   case study of irrigation depth control of winter wheat, and the results
   are compared with classical irrigation depth control that considers a
   fixed level of saturation allowance. The results showed that the newly
   developed model of irrigation control depth effectively improves the
   results of classical models. As a result of 60?years of simulation,
   water loss and required irrigation depth were equal to (76.6, 1890) and
   (155, 2370) for the fuzzy and classical models, respectively. These
   results show a reduction in water loss of around 49\%. It was also shown
   that although the total irrigation depth has been decreased for the
   fuzzy irrigation control model, the maximum crop water demand was
   supplied by the proposed fuzzy model completely. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Abstract = {{An efficient cooperative Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol for

   However, relays which can not receive the packet successfully have the
   ability to listen to the retransmission and decode the packet with high
   probability. Therefore, we consider to let these relays join in the next
   possible retransmission. We prove that the proposed cooperative ARQ
   protocol has a lower packet loss rate and average retransmission number
   than conventional ARQ protocol. Finally, the simulation results verify
   our theoretical results and show that the proposed ARQ protocol is
   suitable for the relay networks where the source node is close to the

Abstract = {{Objectives: The mechanism of tooth bleaching using peroxide oxidizers is
   not fully understood. It is unknown whether peroxide radicals make teeth
   whiter by deproteinizing, demineralizing, or oxidizing tooth tissues.
   This study was designed to define the mechanism of tooth bleaching and
   determine which of tooth enamel chemical components is/are affected by
   bleaching.
   Methods: Sixty sound teeth were collected from adult patients. The teeth
   were divided into 6 equal groups (n = 10). Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were
   treated for 4 days with one of the following solutions: deproteinizing
   (NaOH) that removes organic content, demineralizing (EDTA) that
   decalcifies the mineral content, oxidizing (H2O2) and distilled water
   (control). Group 5 and 6 were pre-treated with either deproteinizing or
   demineralizing solutions before treating them with oxidizing solutions
   for 4 days. Changes in enamel elemental ratios, crystallinity index and
   tooth shade parameters of the treated teeth were examined by means of
   EDS, Raman spectroscopy and shade-spectrophotometry. The data obtained
   was analysed with Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test, and the statistical
   signicance was set at p < 0.05.
   Results: Tooth deproteinization increased the lightness by 4.8 +/- 2.7
   degrees, tooth demineralization resulted in 8.5 +/- 5.6 degrees decrease
   in the lightness and tooth oxidization induced 19.9 +/- 6.5 degrees
   increase in the lightness. Oxidization of the deproteinized teeth did
   not influence shade parameters, but oxidation of the demineralized teeth
   resulted in 10.7 +/- 5.8 degrees increase in the lightness.
   Conclusion: Hydrogen peroxide does not induce significant changes in
   tooth enamel organic and inorganic relative contents, and it whitens
   teeth just by oxidizing their organic matrix. These findings are of
   great clinical significance since they explain the mechanism of tooth
   bleaching, and help understanding its limitations and disadvantages. (c)

Abstract = {{The individual and cumulative effects of in situ pulsed laser ablation
   and continuous laser pre-heating on adhesion and cohesion strength of
   cold sprayed Ti-6Al-4V coatings are investigated. Laser beams were
   coupled to a cold spray gun in order to ablate and pre-heat the
   substrate surface a few milliseconds prior to the impact of the spray
   particles. Cohesion and adhesion strength were evaluated by scratch
   test, standard ASTM C633 pull test and laser shock (LASAT) technique.
   The effects of laser ablation before and during cold spray operations
   were investigated. Results demonstrate that laser ablation of the
   substrate before cold spraying led to a smooth surface which improved
   adhesion strength. However, when laser ablation was maintained
   throughout the cold spray process, i.e., in between the coating layers,
   a reduction of cohesion and adhesion was observed. These negative
   effects were circumvented when laser ablation and laser pre-heating were
   combined.}},

Abstract = {{In flotation, frothers provide two main functions: control of pulp
   hydrodynamic properties and control of froth properties. In this paper
   dual-frother systems (blends) are investigated to determine combinations
   which provide independence over these two functions. Using a column on
   an air-water system, Sauter mean bubble diameter (D-32) and gas holdup
   (E-g) were measured as the hydrodynamic properties and water superficial
   overflow rate (J(wO)) as the froth property. Blends of Alcohols with
   Polypropylene Glycols (PPGs) and Polyethylene Glycols (PEGs) were
   tested. Pre-mixed frother blends did not provide independence. The
   second approach was to use Alcohols as base and PPGs and PEGs as
   additives. Candidate blends were eliminated for a variety of reasons:
   with 1-Hexanol/TetraEG, J(wO) converged to roughly the same level as
   TetraEG concentration was increased; with 1-Butanol/PPG, D-32 increased
   upon addition of PPG. The search was eventually successful:
   1-Butanol/PEG blends gave independent control provided PEG had four or
   more EO groups. The increase in D-32 noted with 1-Butanol/PPG blends was
   traced to partitioning of 1-Butanol to the froth which reduced 1-Butanol
   concentration below the critical coalescence concentration. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear forced dynamics of an axially
   moving viscoelastic beam in the supercritical speed regime, when the
   system is beyond the first instability. Both cases with and without
   internal resonances are examined. The beam configurations beyond the
   first bifurcation as well as the critical speeds are obtained
   analytically. The equation of motion about the buckled state is obtained
   by substituting the buckled configuration into the main equation of
   motion. A distributed external excitation load is then applied to the
   buckled system. The partial differential equation of motion about the
   buckled state is then discretized by means of the Galerkin method,
   yielding a set of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations
   with cubic and quadratic terms. The nonlinear resonant responses as well
   as bifurcation diagrams of Poincare maps of the system are analyzed
   using the pseudo-arclength continuation technique along with direct time
   integration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of woven textile reinforcements in composite structures

   based on finite element method that utilizes three-dimensional unit cell
   was applied to predict the effective properties of a periodic woven
   fabric composite material. Using the resin processing properties models
   such as cure kinetics, shrinkage, glass transition temperature and
   elastic modulus models, the development of the periodic woven fabric
   composite material thermo-mechanical properties, as the cure progresses
   was predicted. The residual strains and stresses generated in the
   composite unit cell during the cure were also predicted and linked with
   the development of the material properties. The effective properties of
   the cured woven fabric composite material were compared to the one of an
   equivalent cross-ply composite material to verify the validity of
   neglecting the fibre waviness while modelling woven fabric composite.}},

Abstract = {{Expansion of autologous chondrocytes in vitro is used to generate
   adequate populations for cell-based therapies. However, standard (SD)
   culture methods cause loss of chondrocyte phenotype and
   dedifferentiation to fibroblast-like cells. Here, we use a novel surface
   expansion culture system in an effort to inhibit chondrocyte
   dedifferentiation. A highly elastic silicone rubber culture surface was
   continuously stretched over a 13-day period to 600\% of its initial
   surface area. This maintained cells at a high density while limiting
   contact inhibition and reducing the need for passaging. Gene expression
   analysis, biochemical assays, and immunofluorescence microscopy of
   follow-on pellet cultures were used to characterize the results of
   continuous expansion (CE) culture versus SD cultures on rigid
   polystyrene. CE culture yielded cells with a more chondrocyte-like
   morphology and higher RNA-level expression of the chondrogenic markers
   collagen type II, aggrecan, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein.
   Furthermore, the expression of collagen type I RNA and alpha-smooth
   muscle actin protein were significantly reduced, indicating suppression
   of fibroblastic features. Pellet cultures from CE chondrocytes contained
   more sulphated glycosaminoglycan and collagen type II than pellets from
   SD culture. Additional control cultures on static (unexpanded) silicone
   (SS culture) indicated that benefits of CE culture were partially due to
   features of the culture surface itself and partially due to the reduced
   passaging which that surface enabled through CE. Chondrocytes grown in
   CE culture may, therefore, be a superior source for cell-based
   therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The use of percutaneous medical devices often results in nosocomial
   infections. Attachment of microorganisms to the surfaces of these
   medical devices triggers biofilm formation, which presents significant
   complications to the health of a patient and may lead to septicemia,
   thromboembolism, or endocarditis if not correctly treated. Although
   several antimicrobials are commonly used for prevention of biofilm
   formation, they have limited efficacy against formed biofilms. In this
   study, we report the use of an enzymatic, gaseous nitric oxide
   (gNO)-releasing dressing for the prevention and treatment of
   Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
   and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Results show that the bactericidal
   activity against biofilms of the test strains was dependent on time and
   rate of gNO release from the dressing. Following 6 h of treatment,
   gNO-releasing dressings significantly inhibited the growth of test
   strains relative to vehicle control dressings, demonstrating eradication
   of bacterial concentrations of up to 10(5) CFU/cm(2). Complete cell
   death was observed for both prevention of biofilm formation and
   treatment of 24-h-grown biofilms after 6 h of treatment with the
   gNO-releasing dressings. Further, gNO-releasing dressings were more
   efficient against formed biofilms than other antimicrobial agents
   currently used. These results demonstrate that the gNO-releasing
   dressing can produce sufficient levels of gNO over a therapeutically
   relevant duration for maximal bactericidal effects against virulent
   bacterial strains known to cause nosocomial infections.}},

   We explore potential associations between bicycle volumes through

   further investigate this relationship through the comparison of over
   thirty cycling corridors as well as an evaluation of the potential
   exposure of cyclists to air pollution along five routes. We observe NO2
   concentrations to be positively correlated with bicycle flows at the
   intersection level. We also observe that corridors with either a bicycle
   path or cycle track generally rank higher in terms of bicycle volume and
   also have higher NO2 concentrations than corridors without bicycle
   facilities. This indicates that intersections and bicycle facilities
   with a large number of cyclists are also those characterized with the
   highest air pollution levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: To characterize mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase
   activity and chondrocyte apoptosis in an in vitro model of cartilage
   mechanical injury as a function of tissue depth and time post-injury.
   Design: Mechanically injured osteochondral explants were assessed for
   cell viability, MAP kinase and caspase-3 activity over 15 days using
   immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. Zonal distributions of
   cell viability and apoptosis were quantified in the presence of specific
   mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitors.
   Results: Viability rapidly decreased post-injury, most significantly in
   the superficial zone, with some involvement of the middle and deep
   zones, which correlated with increased caspase-3 activity. Transient and
   significant increases in extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK)
   activity were observed in middle and deep zones at 1 and 6 days
   post-injury, while c-Jun-amino terminal protein kinase activity
   increased in the deep zone at 1 and 6 days compared to uninjured
   controls. Changes in p38 activity were particularly pronounced, with
   significant increases in all three zones 30 min post-injury, but only in
   the middle and deep zones after 1 and 6 days. Inhibition of ERK and p38
   increased chondrocyte viability which correlated with decreased
   apoptosis.
   Conclusions: Spatiotemporal patterns of MAP kinase signalling in
   cartilage after mechanical injury strongly correlate with changes in
   cell viability and chondrocyte apoptosis. Importantly, these signals may
   be pro-survival or pro-apoptotic depending on zonal location and time
   post-injury. These data yield mechanistic insights which may improve the
   diagnosis and treatment of cartilage injuries. (C) 2012 Osteoarthritis

Abstract = {{Dendrites carry signals between synapses and the soma and play a central
   role in neural computation. Although they contain many nonlinear ion
   channels, their signal-transfer properties are linear under some
   experimental conditions. In experiments with continuous-time inputs, a
   resonant linear two-port model has been shown to provide a near-perfect
   fit to the dendrite-to-soma input-output relationship. In this study, we
   focused on this linear aspect of signal transfer using impedance
   functions that replace biophysical channel models in order to describe
   the electrical properties of the dendritic membrane. The membrane
   impedance model of dendrites preserves the accuracy of the two-port
   model with minimal computational complexity. Using this approach, we
   demonstrate two membrane impedance profiles of dendrites that reproduced
   the experimentally observed two-port results. These impedance profiles
   demonstrate that the two-port results are compatible with different
   computational schemes. In addition, our model highlights how dendritic
   resonance can minimize the location-dependent attenuation of signals at
   the resonant frequency. Thus, in this model, dendrites function as
   linear-resonant filters that carry signals between nonlinear
   computational units.}},

   Mathematical analysis has shown that a flat cell-by-cell recovery

   Central to our approach is the assumption that the external power

   frame of reference. This assumption is used to derive the basic balance
   laws for forces and torques. By considering inertial forces on par with
   other forces, these laws hold relative to any frame of reference,
   inertial or noninertial. Finally, we introduce a simple set of
   constitutive relations to govern the interactions between rods and find
   restrictions necessary and sufficient for these laws to be consistent
   with thermodynamics. Our framework provides a foundation for a
   statistical mechanical derivation of the macroscopic balance laws
   governing liquid crystals.}},

Abstract = {{Natural materials such as bone, tooth and nacre achieve attractive
   properties through the ``staggered structure{''}, which consists of
   stiff, parallel inclusions of large aspect ratio bonded together by a
   more ductile and tougher matrix. This seemingly simple structure
   displays sophisticated micromechanics which lead to unique combinations
   of stiffness, strength and toughness. In this article we modeled the
   staggered structure using finite elements and small Representative
   Volume Elements (RVEs) in order to explore microstructure-property
   relationships. Larger aspect ratio of inclusions results in greater
   stiffness and strength, and also significant amounts of energy
   dissipation provided the inclusions do not fracture in a brittle
   fashion. Interestingly the ends of the inclusions (the junctions) behave
   as crack-like features, generating theoretically infinite stresses in
   the adjacent inclusions. A fracture mechanics criterion was therefore
   used to predict the failure of the inclusions, which led to new insights
   into how the interfaces act as a ``soft wrap{''} for the inclusions,
   completely shielding them from excessive stresses. The effect of
   statistics on the mechanics of the staggered structure was also assessed
   using larger scale RVEs. Variations in the microstructure did not change
   the modulus of the material, but slightly decreased the strength and
   significantly decreased the failure strain. This is explained by strain
   localization, which can in turn be delayed by incorporating waviness to
   the inclusions. In addition, we show that the columnar and random
   arrangements, displaying different deformation mechanisms, lead to
   similar overall properties. The guidelines presented in this study can
   be used to optimize the design of staggered synthetic composites to
   achieve mechanical performances comparable to natural materials.}},

Abstract = {{The subject of this paper is the elastostatic analysis of robot
   structures. The method of analysis is based on the concept of
   generalized spring, in which each flexible link is replaced with a
   six-dimensional generalized spring. The stiffness matrix of this spring,
   when the link complexity so requires, should be obtained numerically,
   via finite element analysis (FEA). In this study, a novel formulation
   for the modeling of all six lower kinematic pairs (LKP), when connecting
   two flexible links, is introduced. By resorting to this formulation, a
   compact formula for the stiffness matrix of a parallelogram with
   flexible linkages, what is called Pi-joint, is obtained. As an
   illustrative example, the procedure is applied to a Schonflies motion
   generator that features Pi joints. In order to illustrate the online
   feasibility of the computations involved, the minimum eigenvalues of a
   dimensionless factor of the stiffness matrix, used as stiffness
   performance index, are plotted along a standard trajectory adopted by
   the industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of robots for machining operations is growing because of their
   flexibility to perform a broad spectrum of tasks at a lower cost when
   compared with machine tools. In this paper the Jacobian condition number
   is used as a performance index intended to make a better use of
   revolute-jointed six-degree-of-freedom serial robots in five-axis
   machining. This index is of the kinetostatic type, low-frequency dynamic
   effects not being relevant to this study. Indeed, dynamic effects can be
   neglected because, during machining, the robot is not working at high
   speed, the spindle motion affecting only the structural, high-frequency
   modes of the system. The condition number is known to be a measure of
   Jacobian invertibility: it is used here as an index to improve
   joint-rate distribution. A low condition number is shown to translate
   into a smoother joint-rate time history. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Morpholine-functional homopolymers and copolymers (using
   4-acryloylmorpholine (4AM), 2-N-morpholinoethyl acrylate (MEA) and
   2-N-morpholinoethyl methacrylate (MEMA)) were synthesized by nitroxide
   mediated polymerization (NMP) and tested for aqueous
   thermo-responsiveness. MEA homopolymerizations and
   MEMA/9-(4-vinylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole (VBK) were controlled as evidenced
   by linear increases in number-average molecular weight, (M-n) over bar,
   versus conversion (X < 0.75) and relatively low polydispersities
   <(M-w)over bar>/(M-n) over bar, = 1.30 - 1.60. For MEMA/VBK copolymers,
   increases in copolymer (M-n) over bar, VBK content in the copolymer and
   polymer concentration in aqueous solution resulted in a decrease in the
   cloud point temperature, CPT (typically varied between 33.7 and 47.9
   degrees C). 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA)/4AM
   copolymerizations were controlled when initial 4AM molar composition
   f(4AM,0) > 0.10; however, the resulting final copolymers exhibited a
   sharp and completely reversible CPT only when f(4AM,0) < 0.20. Poly(mEA)
   was water-soluble but was not thermo-responsive. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A grid adaptation technique for two-dimensional unstructured grids of
   triangles and quadrilaterals is presented. The error estimation
   procedure is formulated in terms of a node pair-based data structure
   that allows for a unified description of the finite element and finite
   volume schemes. The adaptation algorithm is based on a strategy of
   hierarchical corrections, where a suitable number of intermediate
   adapted grids are generated and successively corrected by employing a
   simple node insertion technique at the midpoint of the element edges.
   Coarsening of the grid is obtained in an implicit fashion by avoiding
   the insertion of new nodes during the correction phase. The adaptation
   history, from the initial to the current grid, including all
   intermediate grids, is stored and updated through the whole process. No
   intermediate grid is therefore required to be stored explicitly. The
   adapted grid is anisotropic, thanks to the adoption of both regular
   triangular and quadrilateral elements with high aspect ratio that are
   gathered in, for example, boundary layer or wake regions. Numerical
   experiments of steady compressible flows, including both inviscid and
   viscous flows, are presented to support the suitability of the
   adaptation technique. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The human vocal folds are layered structures with intrinsically
   anisotropic elastic properties. Most testing methods assume isotropic
   behavior. Biaxial testing of vocal folds is strictly difficult because
   the very soft tissue tends to delaminate under transverse traction
   loads. In the present study, a linear transversely isotropic model was
   used to characterize the tissue in-vitro. Shear rheometry was used in
   conjunction with traction testing to quantify the elasticity of porcine
   vocal fold tissue. Uniaxial traction testing along with optical
   measurements were used to obtain the longitudinal modulus. The alternate
   vocal fold of each animal was subjected to a test-specific sample
   preparation and concurrently tested using dynamic shear rheometry. The
   stiffness ratio (i.e., the ratio of the longitudinal modulus and the
   transverse modulus) varied between similar to 5 and similar to 7 at low
   frequencies. The proposed methodology can be applied to other soft
   tissues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   properties. Water vapor permeability (WVP) of the chitosan/NCC films was
   decreased by 27\% for the optimum 5\% (w/w) NCC content. Swelling
   studies revealed a decrease in water uptake of the NCC-reinforced
   chitosan films. Analyses of thermal properties showed no significant
   effect of NCC whereas X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the appearance
   of crystalline peaks in the nanocomposite films. Surface morphology of

Abstract = {{The coupled longitudinal-transverse nonlinear dynamics of an axially
   accelerating beam is numerically investigated: this problem is
   classified as a parametrically excited gyroscopic system. The axial
   speed is assumed to be comprised of a constant mean value along with
   harmonic fluctuations. Hamilton's principle is employed to derive the
   equations of motion of the system which are in the form of two coupled
   partial differential equations. The equations are discretized using the
   Galerkin method, which yields a set of coupled second-order nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations with time-dependent coefficients. The
   sub-critical dynamics of the system is examined via the pseudo-arclength
   continuation technique, while the global dynamics is investigated using
   direct time integration. The mean axial speed and the amplitude of the
   speed variations are varied so as to construct the bifurcation diagrams
   of Poincare maps. The vibration specifications of the system are
   investigated more detailed via plotting time histories, phase-plane
   portraits, and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Compressed video is usually transmitted over channels which are not
   necessarily error free. Channel errors can result in a mismatch between
   the encoder and the decoder, and because of the predictive structures
   used in video coding, the errors will propagate both temporally and
   spatially. Consequently, the quality of the received video at the
   decoder may degrade significantly. In order to improve the quality of
   the received video, several error resilient methods have been proposed.
   In this paper, the introduced mismatch is reduced by modifying the
   prediction structure and forming a more robust reference frame. The
   proposed technique combines error robustness of previous Intra coded
   blocks, better prediction achieved using the previous reference frame,
   and exponential decay of error propagation caused by the leaky
   prediction. This technique was examined with the scalable extension of
   H.264/AVC. Furthermore, the technique was also used in combination with
   random Intra refresh and error resilience mode decision techniques to
   achieve better robustness. Simulation results show the effectiveness of
   our scheme, especially for medium and high motion sequences. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive hopping transmission strategy for
   secondary users (SUs) to access temporarily idle frequency-slots of a
   licensed frequency band in consideration of the random return of primary
   users (PUs), aiming to maximize the overall SU throughput. A SU
   dynamically hops over multiple idle frequency-slots, each with an
   adaptive activity factor to avoid high-risk data loss due to possible PU
   return. SU activity factor optimization problems are formulated to
   develop the optimal opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) algorithms for
   SUs based on the Lagrange dual decomposition method. Subsequently, a
   fully distributed learning-based OSA algorithm is developed in which
   each SU independently adapts its activity factors to the optimal values
   over time by learning other SUs' behavior from locally available
   information. The convergence and convergence rate that characterize its
   asymptotic behavior and efficiency are analyzed. It is shown that the
   proposed learning-based OSA algorithm converges with probability of 1 to
   the optimal solution. Illustrative results confirm its effectiveness and
   performance gain as compared to existing OSA schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Dehydration may alter vocal fold viscoelastic properties, thereby
   hampering phonation. The effects of water loss induced by an osmotic
   pressure potential on vocal fold tissue viscoelastic properties were
   investigated. Porcine vocal folds were dehydrated by immersion in a
   hypertonic solution, and quasi-static and low-frequency dynamic traction
   tests were performed for elongations of up to 50\%. Digital image
   correlation was used to determine local strains from surface
   deformations. The elastic modulus and the loss factor were then
   determined for normal and dehydrated tissues. An eight-chain
   hyperelastic model was used to describe the observed nonlinear
   stress-stretch behavior. Contrary to the expectations, the mass history
   indicated that the tissue absorbed water during cyclic extension when
   submerged in a hypertonic solution. During loading history, the elastic
   modulus was increased for dehydrated tissues as a function of strain.
   The response of dehydrated tissues was much less affected when the load
   was released. This observation suggests that hydration should be
   considered in micromechanical models of the vocal folds. The internal
   hysteresis, which is often linked to phonation effort, increased
   significantly with water loss. The effects of dehydration on the
   viscoelastic properties of vocal fold tissue were quantified in a
   systematic way. A better understanding of the role of hydration on the
   mechanical properties of vocal fold tissue may help to establish
   objective dehydration and phonotrauma criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating organic and inorganic components into hybrid materials is a
   promising pathway towards unique and useful combinations of stiffness,
   strength, and toughness. Nature provides superb examples of such
   materials: bone, teeth, and mollusk shells are made of stiff inorganic
   mineral inclusions bonded by more compliant proteins and polysaccharides
   that play a critical role by providing large deformations and energy
   absorption. Nanometer-thick polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) provide
   an elegant approach to mimicking natural organic materials, but
   experimental data on their mechanical properties is scarce. In this work
   we have for the first time measured the shear performance and fracture
   toughness of PEM nanointerfaces that join two silicon substrates. Most
   of the properties of PEMs fall between those of a typical office tape
   and an engineering epoxy. However, the energy for failure in shear in
   PEMs exceeds the other two adhesives by far, because of breakage and
   reformation of electrostatic bonds. Interestingly, the properties of
   PEMs can be tuned by, for example, depositing a preliminary
   (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane layer or by adjusting the degree of
   hydration. They can also partially heal, and we demonstrate how only a
   fraction of the initial toughness is lost upon reassembly after
   fracture. This set of mechanical properties will greatly facilitate the
   design and optimization of future hybrid materials inspired from nature.}},

Abstract = {{We study large population leader-follower stochastic multi-agent systems
   where the agents have linear stochastic dynamics and are coupled via
   their quadratic cost functions. The cost of each leader is based on a
   trade-off between moving toward a certain reference trajectory which is
   unknown to the followers and staying near their own centroid. On the
   other hand, followers react by tracking a convex combination of their
   own centroid and the centroid of the leaders. We approach this large
   population dynamic game problem by use of so-called Mean Field (MF)
   linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) stochastic control theory. In this
   model, followers are adaptive in the sense that they use a likelihood
   ratio estimator (on a sample population of the leaders' trajectories) to
   identify the member of a given finite class of models which is
   generating the reference trajectory of the leaders. Under appropriate
   conditions, it is shown that the true reference trajectory model is
   identified by each follower in finite time with probability one as the
   leaders' population goes to infinity. Furthermore, we show that the
   resulting sets of mean field control laws for both leaders and adaptive
   followers possess an almost sure epsilon(N)-Nash equilibrium property
   for a system with population where epsilon(N) goes to zero as goes to
   infinity. Numerical experiments are presented illustrating the results.}},

Abstract = {{Attitude control of satellites using fluid rings is studied in this
   paper. A complete dynamics model of a rigid satellite containing fluid
   rings is developed. It is noticed that when the fluid rings are used as
   passive controllers they can damp out all attitude disturbances if the
   satellite is in a circular orbit and only roll-yaw disturbances if the
   satellite is in an elliptic orbit. However, this passive damping effect
   is fairly slow. Hence, an active controller is developed to reduce the
   settling time. To add redundancy to the attitude control system (ACS) of
   the satellite, four fluid rings in a pyramidal configuration are used.
   Also, the effect of the failure of one fluid ring on the performance of
   the ACS of the satellite is tested. Finally, a hybrid controller that is
   composed of a sliding mode controller and a proportional integral
   derivative is designed in order to cope with the model uncertainties and
   eliminate chattering in the response of the system.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The percentage of hypercholesterolemic
   individuals not reaching their LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) goal remains high
   and additional therapeutic strategies should be evaluated. The objective
   of this study was to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering efficacy and
   mechanism of action of bile salt hydrolase-active Lactobacillus reuteri
   NCIMB 30242 capsules in hypercholesterolemic adults.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 127 subjects completed a randomized,
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multicenter study.
   Subjects were randomized to consume L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 capsules or
   placebo capsules over a 9-week intervention period. The primary outcome
   was LDL-C relative to placebo at the study end point.
   RESULTS: L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 capsules reduced LDL-C by 11.64\%
   (P<0.001), total cholesterol by 9.14\%, (P<0.001), non-HDL-cholesterol
   (non-HDL-C) by 11.30\% (P<0.001) and apoB-100 by 8.41\% (P=0.002)
   relative to placebo. The ratios of LDL-C/HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and
   apoB-100/apoA-1 were reduced by 13.39\% (P=0.006) and 9.00\% (P=0.026),
   respectively, relative to placebo. Triglycerides and HDL-C were
   unchanged. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were
   reduced by 1.05 mg/l (P=0.005) and 14.25\% (P=0.004) relative to
   placebo, respectively. Mean plasma deconjugated bile acids were
   increased by 1.00 mmol/l (P=0.025) relative to placebo, whereas plasma
   campesterol, sitosterol and stigmasterol were decreased by 41.5\%,
   34.2\% and 40.7\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the deconjugation of
   intraluminal bile acids results in reduced absorption of non-cholesterol
   sterols and indicate that L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 capsules may be useful
   as an adjunctive therapy for treating hypercholesterolemia.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale biological fibers, such as collagen, keratin or elastin, serve
   as building blocks for a wide variety of biological tissues (for
   example, bone, skin and hair). As such, the elasticity, strength and
   damage tolerance of these fibers largely control the mechanical
   performance of tissues at the macroscale. While there is a large body of
   experimental data for tests on whole biological tissues at the
   macroscale, mechanical tests on individual biological fibers are scarcer
   because of their small size (400 nm diameter or less). Isolating,
   imaging, handling and testing these fibers in hydrated conditions are
   significant challenges. The AFM-based and MEMS-based techniques
   developed in the past to test such fibers offer high displacement and
   load resolution, but they lack the stroke and force capability required
   to fracture strong and highly extensible fibers such as collagen
   fibrils. In this work, a microscale mechanical testing platform capable
   of measuring the tensile stress-strain response of individual type I
   collagen fibers and fibrils was developed and validated. The platform is
   composed of a capacitance-based, nanoindenter transducer, an optical
   microscope to monitor the deformation of the sample in situ and a set of
   micromanipulators to isolate and handle individual fibers and fibrils.
   Our preliminary results on type I collagen demonstrate the feasibility
   of monotonic and cyclic tensile tests under the optical microscope and
   in hydrated conditions. The setup can be used to study the elasticity,
   strength and damage tolerance of type I collagen fibers and fibrils
   (using cyclic tests), and our preliminary data are consistent with
   existing experiments and predictions from numerical models. This setup
   offers the advantage of being composed from relatively standard
   components (optical microscope, nanoindenter) which means that it can be
   easily duplicated in laboratories that already possess these
   instruments. This technique can be used to assess the effect of
   environment, genetic diseases or therapeutic drugs on biological tissues
   at a fundamental level.}},

Abstract = {{The small magnitude lift forces generated by both a NACA 0012 airfoil
   and a thin flat plate at Re = 29,000 and 54,000 were determined through
   the line integral of velocity, obtained with particle image velocimetry,
   via the application of the Kutta-Joukowsky theorem. Surface pressure
   measurements of the NACA0012 airfoil were also obtained to validate the
   lift coefficient C-l. The bound circulation was found to be insensitive
   to the size and aspect ratio of the rectangular integration loop for
   pre-stall angles. The present C-l data were also found to agree very
   well with the surface pressure-determined lift coefficient for pre-stall
   conditions. A large variation in C-l with the loop size and aspect ratio
   for post-stall conditions was, however, observed. Nevertheless, the
   present flat-plate C-l data were also found to collectively agree with
   the published force-balance measurements at small angles of attack,
   despite the large disparity exhibited among the various published data
   at high angles. Finally, the ensemble-averaged wake velocity profiles
   were also used to compute the drag coefficient and, subsequently, the
   lift-to-drag ratio.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of a tip-mounted 65 degrees-sweep reverse half-delta wing

   a rectangular NACA 0012 wing was investigated experimentally at Re =

   vortex by the use of a reverse half-delta wing. The present results show
   that for RHDW deflection with -5 degrees <= delta <= + 15 degrees, the
   lift was found to increase nonlinearly with increasing delta compared to
   the baseline wing. The lift increment was accompanied by an increased
   total drag. For negative RHDW deflection with delta < -5 degrees, the
   RHDW-induced lift decrement was, however, accompanied by an improved
   drag. The deflected RHDW also significantly modified and weakened the
   tip vortex, leading to a persistently lowered lift-induced drag,
   regardless of its deflection, compared to the baseline wing. Physical
   mechanisms responsible for the observed RHDW-induced phenomenon were
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an asynchronous digital technique for the
   realization of an integrator that takes as input the time-difference
   between two rising edges of digital signals and produces a corresponding
   time-difference output signal. The key element of this circuit is a
   time-memory cell called TLatch. This circuit has the ability to store
   the time-difference between two edges and allow its retrieval at a later
   time. By using two TLatches in parallel, a dual-path high-throughput
   integrator is proposed. Internal mismatches in delays can be removed
   using a simple calibration algorithm that aligns the frequency of two
   internal oscillators, thereby eliminating the need for trimming or any
   reference element. The proposed architecture is fabricated in 1.2 V
   0.13-mu IBM CMOS technology and the experimental results confirm the

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2781-2798}},

Abstract = {{It has become indispensable to locate circuit defects and find the
   root-cause of errors as soon as the prototype of a system
   (first-silicon) gets ready. Various Design-for-Debug (DID) solutions
   have been introduced as a means to increase the observability and
   controllability of internal signals, resulting to a speed-up in
   debugging process and a decrease in the time-to-market of new products.
   Assertion Based Verification (ABV) is one of the instrumental
   pre-silicon verification techniques. Once assertions are converted to
   hardware modules and incorporated into a debug infrastructure, the
   post-silicon debug can benefit from the additional observability
   provided by such assertions. In this paper, we first propose a new
   algorithm that generates clusters of assertion-checkers; in our proposed
   clustering algorithm, we resort to a graph partitioning algorithm to
   find the assertion-checkers that can be placed inside a cluster. The
   proposed method generates the clusters of assertion-checkers by means of
   exploring the logic-cones set of each assertion-checker. Moreover,
   coverage metrics for different configurations of clusters are defined.
   Then, we introduce several mechanisms through which the clusters of
   assertion-checkers can be incorporated into the DID infrastructures. In
   our experiments, several case studies such as AXI bus, PCI bus protocol
   and a memory controller are considered; thereafter, the proposed debug
   infrastructure containing clusters of assertion-checkers is embedded
   into such case studies. It turns out that contrary to a non-clustering
   approach of placing assertion-checkers into a design the clustering
   algorithm along with the proposed method for incorporating
   assertion-checker clusters into a debug infrastructure lead to the
   better results in terms of the energy consumption and design coverage.

   are tested for lasing: (1) a cavity made out of a Fresnel reflection at
   one end of the microwire and a silver coated, broadband mirror at the
   other end, and (2) a cavity made out of Fresnel reflections at both ends
   of the microwire. The microwires are pumped in the C-band, and the
   resulting Raman lasers operate in the L-band. Such an all-chalcogenide
   microwire laser has the potential to operate over the entire
   transmission window of chalcogenide glasses, i.e., in the wavelength
   range of 1.5-10 mu m. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This report describes the modification of polycrystalline gold surfaces
   with mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) containing COOH and one of
   the end groups CH3, OH, or NH2, with the aim of modulating the surface
   physicochemical properties (charge and wettability) and investigating
   the effect of these factors on the surface amount and secondary
   structure of fibronectin (FN), chemically attached to these surfaces. It
   is shown that the SAM composition influenced the substrate surface
   charge, for all three types of binary mixed SAMs, while only the
   CH3/COOH SAM was found to influence the substrate surface wettability.
   It was also found that the covalent binding of FN to the SAMs resulted
   in alteration in the secondary structure of the protein, in comparison
   to the structure in its native state. However, there was no
   straightforward correlation between the SAM composition and the FN
   surface amount and its secondary structure. Further, a simple method for
   evaluating the true surface composition of COOH-based mixed SAMs is
   presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the current retrospective chart review is to describe the

   bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ). 14 charts
   (mean patient age 69.07 +/- 10.37 years) describing 19 BRONJ stage 2
   sites were identified. According to the treatment protocol, all patients
   received conservative treatment. Surgical treatment was delivered only
   to sites that did not respond to conservative treatment. Conservative
   treatment alone was delivered to 11 sites in 8 patients (mean
   postoperative follow-up 17.6 +/- 9.4 months). Surgical treatment was
   delivered to 8 sites in 6 patients (mean postoperative follow-up 10.0
   +/- 6.1 months). Bisphosphonate exposure ranged from 1 to 8 years. In
   most cases, tooth extractions and wearing dentures were reported as
   triggers for BRONJ. At the last follow-up, BRONJ stage 0 was noted in 7
   sites that received conservative treatment and 5 sites that received
   surgical treatment. Within the limitations of the current chart review,
   the results showed that although conservative treatment for BRONJ stage
   2 can provide favourable outcomes, surgical treatment represents a
   suitable alternative in non-responsive cases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the planar nonlinear dynamics of an axially accelerating
   beam in the subcritical speed regime is examined theoretically, via two

   nonlinear ordinary differential equations (NODES) with time-dependent

   pseudo-arclength continuation technique and some of the results are
   tested and verified via direct time integration of the NODEs. The
   analyses include the system tuned to a three-to-one internal resonance,
   as well as for the case where it is not. Results are illustrated through

Abstract = {{Independent component analysis (ICA) has been extensively used in
   individual and within-group data sets in real-world applications, but
   how can it be employed in a between-groups or conditions design? Here,
   we propose a new method to embed group membership information into the
   FastICA algorithm so as to extract components that are either shared
   between groups or specific to one or a subset of groups. The proposed
   algorithm is designed to automatically extract the pattern of
   differences between different experimental groups or conditions. A new
   constraint is added to the FastICA algorithm to simultaneously deal with
   the data of multiple groups in a single ICA run. This cost function
   restricts the specific components of one group to be orthogonal to the
   subspace spanned by the data of the other groups. As a result of
   performing a single ICA on the aggregate data of several experimental
   groups, the entire variability of data sets is used to extract the
   shared components. The results of simulations show that the proposed
   algorithm performs better than the regular method in both the
   reconstruction of the source signals and classification of shared and
   specific components. Also, the sensitivity to detect variations in the
   amplitude of shared components across groups is enhanced. A rigorous
   proof of convergence is provided for the proposed iterative algorithm.
   Thus, this algorithm is guaranteed to extract and classify shared and
   specific independent components across different experimental groups and
   conditions in a systematic way.}},

Abstract = {{The deposition of Inconel 718 powders, by cold spray, was performed on a
   mild steel substrate. The deposits showed a porosity level lower than
   3\%, but lacked interparticle bonding, hence strength. To circumvent the
   problem, the deposits were used as green compacts for pressureless
   sintering at temperatures of 1200, 1225, and 1250 degrees C for 10, 60,
   and 180 min. The grain size, second-phase distribution, micro-hardness,
   and flexural strength were measured. Upon sintering, the flexural
   strength and strain increased from 187 +/- 41 to 1225 +/- 122 MPa, and
   0.026 +/- 0.022 to 0.183 +/- 0.037, respectively. After a conventional
   aging treatment, a maximal strength of 2303 MPa was obtained. During the
   sintering treatment, minimal grain growth occurred in the 1200 and 1225
   degrees C trials where the calculated grain growth exponent was n = 1/8.
   However for the sintering trials at 1250 degrees C, the grain growth
   exponent was found to be n = 1/2. The grain growth was found to be
   influenced by secondary MC carbides that precipitated during the
   sintering treatment but dissolved at 1250 degrees C. The carbides acted
   as a pinning phase during the sintering treatment, explaining the
   reduced grain growth for the 1200 degrees C and 1225 degrees C
   conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of crystallographic texture as well as microstructure in
   an AA5083 aluminum alloy during the accumulative roll bonding (ARB)
   process was investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). It was found that the dominant deformation textures of
   AA5083 were Copper, Dillamore, Goss, and Brass components. When the
   number of ARB cycle was increased, the intensity of texture components
   increased at the beginning, then it became saturated, and finally
   slightly decreased (for Copper, Dillamore, and Rotated Cube). The
   ARB-processed samples showed very strong fibers compared to the initial
   strip with no signs of alpha-fiber, beta-fiber, or tau-fiber. In a
   general trend, the orientations first move into alpha-fiber and
   beta-fiber, simultaneously, and finally towards Goss, Brass, Copper, and
   Dillamore texture components. By increasing the number of ARB cycles,
   the fraction of low angle grain boundaries was decreased whereas the
   fraction of high angle grain boundaries fraction was increased. The
   formation of nano shear bands at the fourth ARB cycle was facilitated by
   the formation of Brass and Goss components. The formation of nano grains
   ( < 100 nm) microstructural was also confirmed by transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) investigation. At the final ARB cycles, the intensity
   of major texture components (Copper and Dillamore) was reduced slightly;
   this can be explained by the formation of equiaxed nano grains due to
   occurrence of redundant shear strain and continuous recrystallization.

Abstract = {{In this work, photoluminescence and micro-Raman scattering experiments
   were performed on undoped InN nanowires. It was found that, besides the
   main photoluminescence peak, a clear phonon sideband emission peak, with
   an extremely narrow linewidth similar to 9 meV, was measured. The phonon
   spectrum revealed by micro-Raman scattering indicates only uncoupled LO
   phonons are involved in such phonon sideband emission. The clearly
   resolved phonon sideband emission peak with a narrow linewidth, together
   with the uncoupled LO phonon modes, suggests the superior quality of the
   presented InN nanowires, i.e., extremely low residual electron density
   and the absence of surface electron accumulation, which is consistent
   with the physical properties of intrinsic InN nanowires as in the
   previous studies. The detailed phonon sideband properties are also
   discussed in the text.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new approach to locating key material transport barriers
   in two-dimensional, non-autonomous dynamical systems, such as unsteady
   planar fluid flows. Seeking transport barriers as minimally stretching
   material lines, we obtain that such barriers must be shadowed by minimal
   geodesics under the Riemannian metric induced by the Cauchy-Green strain
   tensor. As a result, snapshots of transport barriers can be explicitly
   computed as trajectories of ordinary differential equations. Using this
   approach, we locate hyperbolic barriers (generalized stable and unstable
   manifolds), elliptic barriers (generalized KAM curves) and parabolic
   barriers (generalized shear jets) in temporally aperiodic flows defined
   over a finite time interval. Our approach also yields a metric (geodesic
   deviation) that determines the minimal computational time scale needed
   for a robust numerical identification of generalized Lagrangian Coherent
   Structures (LCSs). As we show, an extension of our transport barrier
   theory to non-Euclidean flow domains, such as a sphere, follows
   directly. We illustrate our main results by computing key transport
   barriers in a chaotic advection map, and in a geophysical model flow
   with chaotic time dependence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Ni-base superalloy, Waspaloy, was linear friction welded (LFWed)
   under various processing parameters and then subjected to a post weld
   heat treatment (PWHT). Tensile testing integrated with the optical image
   correlation Aramis (R) system indicated that there is a critical axial
   shortening value (2 mm) below which LFWed and post weld heat treated
   (PWHTed) Waspaloy exhibited weak integrity. At and above this critical
   shortening, the yield strength and ultimate tensile stress (UTS) values
   were more or less the same as for the parent material. However, total
   elongation continued to increase with axial shortening even above the
   critical value due to decrease in width of thermo-mechanically affected
   zone (TMAZ). The sample with the highest axial shortening (4.9 mm)
   exhibited an elongation 91\% of the parent material elongation.
   According to Aramis (R) data, the mixture rule can be used reliably to
   determine the contribution of TMAZ to the tensile elongation of PWHTed
   Waspaloy. Microstructure characterization across the weld in the
   as-LFWed and PWHTed conditions was carried out to correlate the process
   parameters and microstructural changes that affect the tensile
   properties. Weak integrity at axial shortening below 2 mm was mainly due
   to lack of bonding and/or presence of oxides at the weld interface. In
   the as-welded condition, a loss in hardness was observed, and related to
   the extensive dissolution of strengthening phase (gamma') in the weld
   area. The applied PWHT restored the hardness in the weld region. (C)

Abstract = {{Si nanowires (NWs) integrated in a field effect transistor device
   structure are characterized using scanning electron (SEM), atomic force,
   and scanning Kelvin probe force (KPFM) microscopy. Reactive ion etching
   (RIE) and vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth were used to fabricate NWs
   between predefined electrodes. Characterization of Si NWs identified
   defects and/or impurities that affect the surface electronic structure.
   RIE NWs have defects that both SEM and KPFM analysis associate with a
   surface contaminant as well as defects that have a voltage dependent
   response indicating impurity states in the energy bandgap. In the case
   of VLS NWs, even after aqua regia, Au impurity levels are found to
   induce impurity states in the bandgap. KPFM data, when normalized to the
   oxide-capacitance response, also identify a subset of VLS NWs with poor
   electrical contact due to nanogaps and short circuits when NWs cross
   that is not observed in AFM images or in current-voltage measurements
   when NWs are connected in parallel across electrodes. The experiments
   and analysis presented outline a systematic method for characterizing a
   broad array of nanoscale systems under device operation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Little work has been done to characterize the effects of surfactant
   concentration on hydrate growth. The focus of this study is to
   investigate the effects of gemini and conventional surfactants on
   hydrate growth and evaluate growth promotion of a variety of surfactants
   in a consistent manner. The effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and
   DOWFAX 8390 surfactants on methane hydrates formed in a stirred 600
   cm(3) reactor containing 343 cm(3) of liquid were investigated.
   Solubility experiments under liquid-hydrate-gas equilibria were
   conducted at 275.1K with pure water and solutions of each surfactant.
   Kinetic experiments were performed at 275.1 K and 4545 kPa with
   surfactant concentrations ranging from 0 to 1150 ppm for SDS and 0 to
   200 ppm for DOWFAX 8390. Methane mole fraction measurements were taken
   at various times throughout the kinetic experiments. Both surfactants
   were found to have no effect on methane solubility in a
   gas-liquid-hydrate system at equilibrium. The surfactants did however
   have a pronounced effect on bulk methane mole fraction during kinetic
   experiments at surfactant concentrations that significantly promoted
   hydrate growth. Average hydrate growth rate was measured at various
   surfactant concentrations, and a sigmoidal trend was observed for both
   surfactants. Data showed a smooth rather than instantaneous increase in
   growth rate. A mathematical model is proposed and applied to compare the
   effectiveness of both surfactants at promoting hydrate growth. DOWFAX
   8390 and SDS solutions both promote growth more than 4.5 times that of
   water samples, but DOWFAX 8390 achieves this promotion at 1/4 the
   concentration of SDS and has a larger increase in promotion per unit
   mass of surfactant added. The role of surfactants at the hydrate-liquid
   and gas-liquid interfaces is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Water-vapour transport in nanostructured composite materials is poorly
   understood because diffusion and interfacial exchange kinetics are
   coupled. We formulate an interfacial balance that couples diffusion in
   dispersed and continuous phases to adsorption, absorption and
   interfacial surface diffusion. This work is motivated by water-vapour
   transport in cellulose fibre-based barriers, but the model applies to
   nanostructured porous media such as catalysts, chromatography columns,
   nanocomposites, cementitious structures and biomaterials. The
   interfacial balance can be applied in an analytical or a computational
   framework to porous media with any microstructural geometry. Here, we
   explore its capabilities in a model porous medium: randomly dispersed
   solid spheres in a continuous (humid) gas. We elucidate the roles of
   equilibrium moisture uptake, solid, gas and surface diffusion
   coefficients, inclusion size and interfacial exchange kinetics on the
   effective diffusivity. We then apply the local model to predict
   water-vapour transport rates under conditions in which the effective
   diffusivity varies through the cross section of a dense, homogeneous
   membrane that is subjected to a finite moisture-concentration gradient.
   As the microstructural length scale decreases from micrometres to
   nanometres, interfacial exchange kinetics and surface diffusion produce
   a maximum in the tracer flux. This optimal flux is flanked,
   respectively, by interfacial-kinetic-and diffusion-limited transport at
   smaller and larger microscales.}},

Abstract = {{Chitosan (CH), partially N-deacetylated chitin, is a biodegradable and
   biocompatible polymer that has shown great potential in drug delivery
   and tissue engineering applications. Although bioadhesive, CH has
   limited mucoadhesion in wet conditions due to weak interactions with
   biological surfaces. DOPA (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine), a
   catechol-containing molecule naturally present in marine mussel foot
   proteins, has been shown to increase the mucoadhesion of several
   polymers. We report here a simple and bioinspired approach to enhance CH
   mucoadhesion in wet conditions by preparing mixed hydrogels including CH
   and different catechol-containing compounds, namely DOPA, hydrocaffeic
   acid (HCA), and dopamine (DA). We characterized the hydrogels for their
   swelling, release kinetics of the catechol compounds, and mucoadhesive
   strength to rabbit small intestine. The swelling of the hydrogels was pH
   dependent with maximum swelling at pH 1. The hydrogel swelling was
   higher in the presence of the DOPA and DA but lower in the presence of
   HCA. HCA/CH hydrogel also showed the slowest catechol release, most
   likely due to electrostatic interactions between CH and HCA. Lower
   hydrogel swelling and slower HCA release resulted in increased
   mucoadhesion: HCA/CH showed more than 2-fold enhancement of mucoadhesion
   to rabbit small intestine compared to H alone. Since it is known that
   catechol compounds can be oxidized, we analyzed the oxidation of DOPA,
   HCA, and DA at different pH values and its effect on mucoadhesion. We
   found that oxidation occurring before contact with the intestinal mucosa
   did not improve mucoadhesion, while oxidation occurring during the
   contact further increased the mucoadhesion of HCA/CH hydrogels. These
   results show that mucoadhesion of CH hydrogels can be increased with a
   simple bioinspired approach, which has the potential to be applied to
   other polymers since it does not require any chemical modification.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the Thwaites method as an accurate and efficient
   design tool for laminar, axisymmetrical nozzles. Based on historical
   developments, it is improved to describe internal flows with highly
   favorable pressure gradients in cylindrical coordinates. The calculation
   of the core flow velocity distribution based on the continuity equation
   is proposed as a replacement to other sophisticated numerical methods. A
   remarkably good agreement is obtained when comparing the results of the
   current Thwaites method against those of computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) simulations, for which the integral boundary layer thicknesses are
   calculated with equations developed from first principles in the course
   of the work. This consistency among the results and the low time and
   resource costs of the Thwaites method confirm its applicability and
   usefulness as an engineering design and optimization tool. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{To validate the use of acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs) for the
   measurement of turbulent flows, experiments were conducted in an
   axisymmetric turbulent jet and in approximately homogenous isotropic
   turbulence with zero mean flow. The jet experiments show that the
   horizontal RMS velocities measured by the ADV were overestimated when
   compared to both flying hot-film anemometry measurements and the
   accepted values in the literature. However, the vertical component of
   the RMS velocity agrees well with those of other studies. This was
   furthermore confirmed by the ADV measurements in the isotropic
   turbulence with zero mean flow. Given that the overestimated RMS
   velocities in the horizontal directions may be caused by Doppler noise
   and spikes, two postprocessing filters and a Doppler noise-reduction
   method were applied to the jet data in an attempt to correct the data.
   Although the RMS velocities decreased, they remained erroneously higher
   than the accepted values. A noise-reduction method for axisymmetric
   flows that corrects the RMS velocities to within the range of acceptable
   values is presented. Lastly, because the Doppler noise is thought to
   depend on the mean velocity, a series of laboratory experiments were
   undertaken to relate Doppler noise to the mean velocity. The results
   showed no clear relationship between the Doppler noise and the mean
   flow. In addition, subtracting the Doppler noise (measured for a given
   mean velocity) from the measured RMS velocities (at the same mean
   velocity) did not significantly decrease the RMS velocities. DOI:

Volume = {{36-38}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{138-144}},

Abstract = {{Frothers are surface-active agents widely used in flotation to
   facilitate the generation of small bubbles by preventing coalescence and
   increasing the surface area flux, which is the driving factor in
   flotation. Hotation collectors also exhibit frothing capabilities but
   these have never been adequately quantified. In this paper the effect of
   two typical fatty acids, sodium oleate and tall oil, on the coalescence
   of air bubbles was determined by measuring the critical coalescence
   concentration (CCC), gas holdup, and foamability. The results revealed
   that the frothing behavior of fatty acids is qualitatively similar to
   the behavior of other frothers (e.g. MIBC), but the CCC value was
   considerably higher, e.g., for sodium oleate at natural pH the CCC was
   70 mg/L compared to about 10 mg/L for MIBC. Alkaline pH conditions
   produced lower CCC and higher foamability. Since fatty acids are weak
   electrolytes, the effect of pH on the frothing behavior was discussed in
   terms of speciation. Alkaline solutions of fatty acids produced
   considerable foam compared to typical frothers. However, lower pH values
   (7-7.5) completely prevented any foam growth. (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Direct bubble-particle interactions are followed by measuring bubble
   sedimentation potential (BSP) and by visualization at a pendant bubble.
   Alumina and silica were selected as examples of positive and negative
   charge particles, respectively, at the test pH 6-7 along with a
   serpentine sample isolated from an ultramafic Ni-ore. Provided particle
   concentration was not too high. BSP could be measured and interactions
   followed. Alumina and serpentine hydrophobized by anionic surfactant
   made the bubble charge less negative and with silica made hydrophobic by
   cationic surfactant the bubble became less positive. With non-ionic
   surfactant (frother) and electrolyte, BSP increased with alumina
   suggesting an electrostatic (non-hydrophobic) interaction. The
   visualization experiments confirmed attachment of hydrophobic particles
   and revealed attachment of non-hydrophobic alumina, silica and
   serpentine. Non-hydrophobic interactions were explored by introducing
   ionic surfactant to give the bubble the same sign charge as the
   particles which diminished pick-up. Under these same conditions the BSP
   could not be measured attributed to particles being well dispersed from
   the bubbles and giving competing particle sedimentation potential
   signals. The possibility of manipulating bubble charge to depress
   minerals is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several authors have noted bi-modal bubble size distributions (BSDs) in
   flotation systems at low frother or inorganic salt concentrations. The
   origin appears to be related to bubble-bubble interactions. The present
   work examines interactions among bubbles produced at a capillary using
   high-speed imaging. The study provides visual evidence of
   coalescence-related and wake-related mechanisms creating fine bubbles
   and bi-modal distributions. Four coalescence mechanisms are identified:
   coalescence-induced break-up, droplet formation and collision, liquid
   jet formation and collision, liquid jet disruption to droplets and
   collision; and two wake-related events: distortion and break-up of
   trailing bubble, and premature detachment. Comparing to the fine/coarse
   mode ratio in flotation systems (ca. 1/10) the possible relevant
   mechanisms are suggested. Knowing that frothers and certain inorganic
   salts act to retard coalescence, the origin of the bi-modal BSD is
   argued to be coalescence-related. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This article presents methods and circuits for synthesizing test signals
   in the time/frequency domain. An arbitrary signal is first encoded using
   sigma-delta modulation in the digital amplitude-domain and converted to
   the time or frequency domain through a digital-to-time converter (DTC)
   or digital-to-frequency converter (DFC) operation realized in software.
   In hardware, the resulting bit-stream is inputted cyclically to a
   high-order phase-locked loop (PLL) behaving as a time-mode
   reconstruction filter in the appropriate domain (time or frequency). A
   high-speed prototype implementation consisting of a 4th order PLL built
   in 0.13 mu m complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process with
   an off-chip loop filter has been fabricated and used to generate signals
   at 4 GHz. The digital nature and portability of the phase/ frequency
   test signal generation process makes the proposed scheme compatible with
   the IEEE 1149.1 test bus standard and easily amenable to any testing
   environment: production, characterization, design-for-test (DFT), or
   built-in self-test (BIST).}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{185}},

Abstract = {{Membrane flexoelectricity is an electromechanical coupling effect
   between the membrane average curvature and macroscopic electric
   polarization, which is essential to the physiology of hearing.
   Flexoelectric actuation uses an imposed electric field to create
   membrane bending and is used by the Outer Hair Cells (OHCs) located in
   the inner ear. Motivated by the functioning of the OHC, in this paper we
   model the small amplitude oscillatory dynamics of a tethered circular
   membrane immersed in viscoelastic fluid media driven by a small
   amplitude harmonic electric field of arbitrary frequency. The model is
   based on the integration of (i) the flexoelectric membrane shape
   equation applied to a circular membrane attached to the inner surface of
   a circular capillary and (ii) the coupled capillary flow of the
   contacting viscoelastic phases, such that the membrane flexoelectric
   oscillations drive periodic viscoelastic capillary flows. The model for
   membrane average curvature dynamics as a function of the electric field
   dynamics is second order in both inputs and outputs and maps into the
   classical mechanical Burgers solid model. The three dimensional material
   space that characterizes the inertia, viscosity, and elasticity of the
   viscoelastic fluid/flexoelectric membrane material system is defined and
   used to classify and characterize the frequency response of the
   electro-mechanical system. The frequency response is characteristic of a
   second order dynamical system with a second order input and can display
   a single resonant peak in the total power. The amplitude, frequency and
   width of the power peak, of relevance to the functioning of OHC is
   dependent on the inertia emerging from the contacting viscoelastic
   phases and the ratio between the membrane elasticity and the elasticity
   of contacting liquids. The integrated flexoelectric/viscoelastic model
   and the novel findings contribute to the ongoing quest for a fundamental
   understanding of the functioning of outer hair cells (OHCs), especially
   on the role of membrane deformation in delivering mechanical power
   through electromotility and its frequency-dependent power conversion
   efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Global interest in stable energy resources coupled with growing demand
   for bio-oils in various conventional and arising industries has renewed
   the importance of vegetable oil production. To address this global
   interest, oilseed production has been increased in recent decades by
   different approaches, such as extending the cultivation area of oil
   crops, or breeding and growing genetically modified plants. In this
   study, pea (Pisum sativum L.) accessions were screened for lipid content
   using a rapid extraction method. This method quantifies lipid
   concentration in pea seeds and was developed by assessing and comparing
   the results of existing extraction methods used for canola and soybean,
   the top two Canadian oilseeds. Seeds of 151 field pea accessions were
   grown to maturity in 2009 and 2010 at McGill University (Quebec,
   Canada). Overall, lipid concentration in pea seeds ranged from 0.9 to
   5.0\%. Among several seed characteristics, only seed shape (wrinkled
   verses round) had a significant effect on the total lipid production in
   the seeds. Peas are a valuable source of protein and starch, but the
   lipid concentration in their seeds has been undervalued. This research
   supports the idea of developing a novel dual-purpose oilseed pea that
   emulates the protein and oil production in soybean seeds while being
   conveniently adapted to a colder climate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes two Pareto-optimal power control algorithms for a
   two-tier network, where newly-deployed femtocell user equipments (FUEs)
   operate in the licensed spectrum owned by an existing macrocell.
   Different from homogeneous network settings, the inevitable requirement
   of robustly protecting the quality-of-service (QoS) of all prioritized
   macrocell user equipments (MUEs) here lays a major obstacle that hinders
   the successful application of any available solutions. Directly
   targeting at this central issue, the first algorithm jointly maximizes
   the total utility of both user classes. Specifically, we adopt the
   log-barrier penalty method to effectively enforce the minimum
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) imposed by the
   macrocell, paving the way for the adaptation of load-spillage solution
   framework. On the other hand, the second algorithm is applied to the
   scenario where only the sum utility of all FUEs needs to be maximized.
   At optimality, we show that the MUEs' prescribed SINR constraints are
   met with equality in this case. With the search space for Pareto-optimal
   SINRs substantially reduced, the second algorithm features scalability,
   low computational complexity, short converging time, and stable
   performance. We prove that the two developed algorithms converge to
   their respective global optima, and more importantly, they can be
   implemented in a distributive manner at individual links. Effective
   mechanisms are also available to flexibly designate the access priority
   to MUEs and FUEs, as well as to fairly share radio resources among
   users. Numerical results confirm the merits of the devised approaches.}},

Journal = {{MICROSCOPY AND MICROANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews different methods used to perform quantitative
   X-ray microanalysis in the electron microscope and also demonstrates the
   urgency of measuring the fundamental parameters of X-ray generation for
   the development of accurate standardless quantitative methods. Using
   ratios of characteristic lines acquired on the same X-ray spectrum, it
   is shown that the Cliff and Lorimer KA-B factor can be used in a general
   correction method that is appropriate for all types of specimens and
   electron microscopes, providing that appropriate corrections are made
   for X-ray absorption, fluorescence, and indirect generation. Since the
   fundamental parameters appear in the KA-B factor, only the ratio of the
   ionization cross sections needs to be known, not their absolute values.
   In this regard, the measurement of ratios of the KA-B factor (or
   intensities at different beam energies of the same material with no
   change of beam spreading in the material! permits the validation for the
   best models to compute the ratio of ionization cross sections. It is
   shown, using this method, that the nonrelativistic Bethe equation, to
   compute ionization cross section, is very close to the equation of E.
   Casnati et al. (J Phys B 15, 155-167, 1982) and also to the equations
   proposed by D. Bote and F. Salvat (Phys Rev A 77, 042701, 2008) for the
   computation of the ratio of ionization cross sections. The method is
   extended to show that it could be used to determine the values of the
   Coster-Kronig transitions factors, an important fundamental parameter
   for the generation of L and M lines that is mostly known with poor
   accuracy. The detector efficiency can be measured with specimens where
   their intensities were measured with an energy dispersive spectrometer
   detector, the efficiency of which has been measured in an X-ray
   synchrotron (M. Alvisi et al., Microsc Microanal 12, 406-415, 2006). The
   spatial resolution should always be computed when performing
   quantitative X-ray microanalysis and the equations of R. Gauvin (Microsc
   Microanal 13(5), 354-357, 2007) for bulk materials and the one presented
   in this article for thin films should be used. The effects of X-rays
   generated by fast secondary electrons and by Auger electrons are
   reviewed, and their effect can be detrimental for the spatial resolution
   of materials involving low-energy X-ray lines, in certain specific
   conditions. Finally, quantitative X-ray microanalysis of heterogeneous
   materials is briefly reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed medium access control (MAC) protocols are essential for the
   proliferation of low-cost, decentralized wireless local area networks
   (WLANs). Most MAC protocols are designed with the presumption that nodes
   comply with prescribed rules. However, selfish nodes have natural
   motives to manipulate protocols in order to improve their own
   performance. This often degrades the performance of other nodes as well
   as that of the overall system. In this paper, we propose a class of
   protocols that limit the performance gain from selfish manipulation
   while incurring only a small efficiency loss. The proposed protocols are
   based on the idea of a review strategy, with which nodes collect signals
   about the actions of other nodes over a period of time, use a
   statistical test to infer whether or not other nodes are following the
   prescribed behavior, and trigger a punishment if a deviation is
   inferred. We consider the cases of private and public signals and
   provide analytical and numerical results to demonstrate the properties
   of the proposed protocols.}},

Title = {{Laboratory simulations of tensile fracture development in a volcanic

Abstract = {{During volcanic unrest, high magma pressure induces cracking and
   faulting of the country rock, providing conduits for the transport of
   magma and other fluids. These conduits, known as dykes, are fundamental
   structures for the transport of magma to the surface in volcanically
   active regions. The mechanics of dyke propagation is not yet fully
   understood but is crucial to better model dyke emplacement and eruption
   in volcanoes. Central to this need is a greater understanding of the
   mechanical properties of the magma/country rock interaction as a
   function of known magmatic pressure, temperature and stress. Here, we
   report data from a series of experiments in which we cyclically compress
   viscoelastic rhyolitic magma (at 828 degrees C, 892 degrees C and 918
   degrees C) inside a cylindrical conduit-like shell of basalt (from Mt.
   Etna, Italy) until fracture occurs. The compression is performed under
   strain rates cyclically varying between 5 x 10(-6) and 5 x 10(-5) s(-1).
   The resultant monitored (axial) loading and relaxation illustrates how
   the presence of a visco-elastic fluid (magma) controls the stress
   induced at the conduit margin boundary. This is achieved by analysing
   the viscoelastic relaxation (through time) to calculate an apparent
   modulus, which is found to decrease with both increasing temperature and
   time. In the 4 cycles before failure we find that the apparent modulus
   decreases from 180 to 40 GPa, 80 to 20 GPa and 8 to 1 GPa for imposed
   stress cycles at 828 degrees C, 892 degrees C and 918 degrees C,
   respectively. We theoretically estimate a tensile strength at failure of
   approximately 7-11 MPa, consistent with recent field data and in
   agreement with a model derived from the sample geometry and basic
   material parameters. Post-experimental neutron computed tomography and
   microscopic analyses further reveal the fragmentation of the melt and
   generation of tuffisite veins inside the conduit due to spontaneous
   crack nucleation associated with conduit wall fracture. The geometry of
   the rupture area inside the melt is akin to a Mach cone associated with
   supershear fractures. We discuss our findings in terms of magma-rock
   interaction leading to dykes, tuffisite veins and magma fragmentation.

   with previous experiments. Using an asymmetric cavity feedback, 98\% of
   the total output power can be directed in the backward ASE, but with the

   utilized for measuring forces applied to an oocyte and resultant cell
   deformations in real time during oocyte manipulation. To characterize
   elastic and viscoelastic properties of the oocytes, a stress-relaxation
   indentation test is performed. A two-step, large-deformation mechanical
   model is developed to extract the mechanical properties of the oocytes
   from the measured force-deformation data. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the aged oocytes are significantly softer
   (instantaneous modulus: 2.2 vs. 5.2 kPa in young oocytes) but more

Abstract = {{TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method and they were
   coated on alpha-alumina supports to form ultra fine layer of nanosized
   TiO2. The effect of synthesis parameters; molar ratio of
   surfactant/precursor, refiuxing temperature and refluxing time,
   calcination temperature and time was simultaneously investigated on
   crystallite size, crystalline phase content, specific surface area and
   photocatalytic activity of the product, using a statistical approach.
   The powder samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique
   (BET). The results revealed positive effect of refluxing temperature on
   the crystallite size and crystallinity, while a negative effect was
   observed on the anatase phase content. The anatase phase content was
   enhanced by increasing the reflux time. Increasing calcination
   temperature and calcination time resulted to the higher crystallite size
   and relative crystallinity but lower anatase phase content. Application
   of surfactant improved specific surface area and pore size of the
   crystals. The optimal synthesis conditions to achieve maximum content of
   anatase phase, surface area and minimum crystallite size were found to
   be equal molar ratio of surfactant/precursor, refluxing temperature of
   60 degrees C, reflux time of 6 h, calcination temperature of 550 degrees
   C and calcination time of 2 h. The optimal gel product was applied for
   preparing TiO2 thin films by spraying the gel content on the
   alpha-alumina support. The photocatalytic behavior of the coated films
   was examined in photocatalytic degradation of acetaldehyde in gas phase
   batch reactor under UV irradiation and a reduction of 61\% was observed
   for only 0.01 g coated TiO2 film on the ceramic support. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate a novel 20-GSample/s burst-mode clock and
   data recovery (BM-CDR) technique for optical multiaccess networks. The
   BM-CDR incorporates an injection-locking method for clock recovery and a
   clock phase aligner employing space sampling with two multiphase clocks
   at 10 GHz and a phase-picking algorithm for automatic clock phase
   acquisition. The design provides low latency and fast response without
   requiring a reset signal from the network layer. The BM-CDR achieves a
   bit error rate < 10(-1)0 while featuring instantaneous (0-bit) phase
   acquisition for any phase step (+/- 2 pi rad) between successive bursts.
   We also compare the data with probabilistic theoretical predictions to
   validate the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{This study report the development of a nanobiohybrid hydrogel based
   endovascular stent device capable of preventing postangioplasty in-stent
   restenosis (ISR) by promoting significant vascular endothelial recovery
   in a site-specific manner. The hydrogel is comprised of fibrin matrices,
   assembled layer-by-layer (LbL) on stent surface with alternate layers
   carrying endosomolytic Tat peptide/DNA nanoparticles (NPs) or NPs
   hybridized to polyacrylic acid (PM) wrapped single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (NP-CNT). Here, the hydrogel works as a reservoir to carry,
   protect, and simultaneously deliver pro-angiogenic, vascular endothelial
   growth factor (Vegf) and Angiopoietin-1(Ang1), gene carrying NPs to the
   target site. In vitro results demonstrated that CNTs incorporated in the
   hydrogel layers play a major role in tuning the bioactivity of the
   stent. In addition, the developed stent formulation can significantly
   reduce the loss of therapeutics while traversing through the vessel and
   during deployment. In vivo experiments in balloon-injured canine femoral
   artery demonstrated that the NCS (+) group, carrying NPvegf+Ang1, can
   significantly enhance re-endothelialization of injured artery compared
   to control NCS (-), carrying NPNull, and bare metal stent (BMS) groups,
   attenuate stenosis (18.5 +/- 9.03\% vs 39.56 +/- 13.8 vs 45.34 +/-
   8.3\%; n = 8, p < 0.05) and prevent neointima formation (1.53 +/- 0.36

   analyzed angiography and histomorphometric analysis. These data
   collectively implicate that this new technology can be useful for stent
   and other biomedical devices through controlled delivery of multiple
   biotherapeutics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   with added masses}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to develop an approximate analytical solution
   for phase-shift (and thus mass flow) prediction along the length of the
   measuring tube of a Coriolis mass-flowmeter. A single, straight
   measuring tube is considered; added masses at the sensor and excitation
   locations are included in the model, and thus in the equation of motion.
   The measuring tube is excited harmonically by an electromagnetic driver.
   Taking into account thermal effects, the equation of motion is derived
   through use of the extended Hamilton's principle and constitutive
   relations. The equation of motion is discretized into a set of ordinary
   differential equations via Galerkin's technique. The method of multiple
   timescales is applied to the set of resultant equations, and the
   equations of order one and epsilon are obtained analytically for the
   system at primary resonance. The solution of the equation of motion is
   obtained by satisfying the solvability condition (making the solution of
   order epsilon free of secular terms). The flow-related phase-shift in
   the driver-induced tube vibration is measured at two symmetrically
   located points on either side of the mid-length of the tube. The
   analytical results for the phase-shift are compared to those obtained
   numerically. The effect of system parameters on the measured phase-shift
   is discussed. It is shown that the measured phase-shift depends on the
   mass flow rate, of course, but it is also affected by the magnitude of
   the added sensor mass and location, and the temperature change;
   nevertheless, the factors investigated do not induce a zero phase-shift.

Abstract = {{Constant load measurements by nanoindentation offer the potential for
   measuring strain rate sensitivity from individual features and defects
   on a submicron scale. However, recent reports reveal a conflicting load
   dependence (both increasing and decreasing strain rate sensitivity with
   load) which has yet to be fully explained. In this study, constant load
   measurements on five materials (Zn, Al, Cu, Ti, and SiO2) were conducted
   over a range of peak loads, and then compared with both constant strain
   rate results and conventional values in the literature. The load
   dependence was found to be caused by the increasing contribution of
   drift errors throughout the test. A proposed framework, involving higher
   loads, shorter hold and loading times, and a physically sound fitting
   method, was found to produce unambiguous results free from load
   dependencies, with improved correlations to conventional values and
   reduced standard deviations.}},

Abstract = {{Axisymmetric problems for an elastic halfspace are commonly analyzed by
   the boundary element (BE) method by employing the axisymmetric
   fundamental solution for the fullspace. In such cases, the
   discretization of the free surface is required, with its truncation at
   an appropriate location from the axis of symmetry. This paper presents
   the BE implementation of the axisymmetric fundamental solution for an
   elastic halfspace, given in terms of integrals of the Lipschitz-Hankel
   type, that satisfies in advance the boundary condition of zero traction
   on the free surface and the decay of displacements in the far field.
   Explicit equations for post-processing the results at internal points
   are provided, as well as adequate numerical schemes to evaluate the
   boundary integrals arising in the method. This formulation can be easily
   implemented in existing BE computational codes for axisymmetric
   fullspace problems, requiring only a few modifications. Numerical
   results are provided to validate the proposed formulation. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Plant petioles and stems are hierarchical cellular structures,
   displaying structural features defined at multiple length scales. One or
   more of the intermediate hierarchical levels consists of tissues, in
   which the cellular distribution is quasirandom. The current work focuses
   on the realistic modeling of plant tissue microstructures. The
   finite-edge centroidal Voronoi tessellation (FECVT) is here introduced
   to overcome the drawbacks of the semi-infinite edges of a typical
   Voronoi model. FECVT can generate a realistic model of a tissue
   microstructure, which might have finite edges at its border, be defined
   by a boundary contour of any shape, and include complex heterogeneity
   and cellular gradients. The centroid-based Voronoi tessellation is
   applied to model the microstructure of the Philodendron melinonii
   petiole and the Arabidopsis thaliana stem, which both display intense
   cellular gradients. FECVT coupled with a digital image processing
   algorithm is implemented to capture the nonperiodic microstructures of
   plant tissues. The results obtained via this method satisfactorily obey
   the geometric, statistical, and topological laws of naturally evolved
   cellular solids. The predicted models are also validated by experimental
   data.}},

   Evidence of the liquid miscibility gap was observed only in alloys B and
   D, either in the master ingots and the ribbons. After rapid
   solidification, partial amorphisation was achieved for alloys C and D,
   where precipitates of the Ag-rich solid solution, showing various sizes,
   are dispersed in the amorphous matrix. A significant increase in
   hardness was achieved in the case of partially amorphous ribbons of
   alloys C and D (442 HV and 533 HV, respectively). Experimental results
   are discussed on the basis of the recently reassessed ternary Ag-Cu-Zr
   phase diagram. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral-flow immunochromatographic assays are low-cost, simple-to-use,
   rapid tests for point-of-care screening of infectious diseases, drugs of
   abuse, and pregnancy. However, lateral flow assays are generally not
   quantitative, give a yes/no answer, and lack multiplexing. Threads have
   recently been proposed as a support for transporting and mixing liquids
   in lateral-flow immunochromatographic assays, but their use for
   quantitative high-sensitivity immunoassays has yet to be demonstrated.
   Here, we introduce the immunochromatographic assay on thread (ICAT) in a
   cartridge format that is suitable for multiplexing. The ICAT is a
   sandwich assay performed on a cotton thread knotted to a nylon fiber
   bundle, both of which are precoated with recognition antibodies against
   one target analyte. Upon sample application, the assay results become
   visible to the eye within a few minutes and are quantified using a
   flatbed scanner. Assay conditions were optimized, the binding curves for
   C-reactive protein (CRP) in buffer and diluted serum were established
   and a limit of detection of 377 pM was obtained. The possibility of
   multiplexing was demonstrated using three knotted threads coated with
   antibodies against CRP, osteopontin, and leptin proteins. The
   performance of the ICAT was compared with that of the paper-based and
   conventional assays. The results suggest that thread is a suitable
   support for making low-cost, sensitive, simple-to-use, and multiplexed
   diagnostic tests.}},

Abstract = {{The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a well established computational
   tool for fluid flow simulations. This method has been recently utilized
   for low Mach number computational aeroacoustics. Robust and
   nonreflective boundary conditions, similar to those used in
   Navier-Stokes solvers, are needed for LBM-based aeroacoustics
   simulations. The goal of the present study was to develop an absorbing
   boundary condition based on the perfectly matched layer (PML) concept
   for LBM. The derivation of formulations for both two and three
   dimensional problems is presented. The macroscopic behavior of the new
   formulation is discussed. The new formulation was tested using benchmark
   acoustic problems. The perfectly matched layer concept appears to be
   very well suited for LBM, and yielded very low acoustic reflection
   factor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{369}},

Pages = {{330-339}},

Abstract = {{The glycocalyx, and the thicker endothelial surface layer (ESL), are
   necessary both for endothelial barrier function and for sensing
   mechanical forces in the adult. The goal of this study is to use a
   combination of imaging techniques to establish when the glycocalyx and
   endothelial surface layer form during embryonic development and to
   determine the biological significance of the glycocalyx layer during
   vascular development in quail embryos. Using transmission electron
   microscopy, we show that the glycocalyx layer is present as soon as
   blood flow starts (14 somites). The early endothelial glycocalyx (14
   somites) lacks the distinct hair-like morphology that is present later
   in development (17 and 25 somites). The average thickness does not
   change significantly (14 somites, 182 nm +/- 33 nm: 17 somites, 218 +/-
   30 nm: 25 somites, 212 +/- 32 nm). The trapping of circulating
   fluorescent albumin was used to evaluate the development of the ESL.
   Trapped fluorescent albumin was first observed at 25 somites. In order
   to assess a functional role for the glycocalyx during development, we
   selectively degraded luminal glycosaminoglycans. Degradation of
   hyaluronan compromised endothelial barrier function and prevented
   vascular remodeling. Degradation of heparan sulfate down regulated the
   expression of shear-sensitive genes but does not inhibit vascular
   remodeling. Our findings show that the glycocalyx layer is present as
   soon as blood flow starts (14 somites). Selective degradations of major
   glycocalyx components were shown to inhibit normal vascular development,
   examined through morphology, vascular barrier function, and gene
   expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Use of inert gas jets to measure the forces required for mechanical gene
   transfection}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Transferring genes and drugs into cells is central to how we
   now study, identify and treat diseases. Several non-viral gene therapy
   methods that rely on the mechanical disruption of the plasma membrane
   have been proposed, but the success of these methods has been limited
   due to a lack of understanding of the mechanical parameters that lead to
   cell membrane permeability.
   Methods: We use a simple jet of inert gas to induce local transfection
   of plasmid DNA both in vitro (HeLa cells) and in vivo (chicken
   chorioallantoic membrane). Five different capillary tube inner diameters
   and three different gases were used to treat the cells to understand the
   dependency of transfection efficiency on the dynamic parameters.
   Results: The simple setup has the advantage of allowing us to calculate
   the forces acting on cells during transfection. We found
   permeabilization efficiency was related to the dynamic pressure of the
   jet. The range of dynamic pressures that led to transfection in HeLa
   cells was small (200 +/- 20 Pa) above which cell stripping occurred. We
   determined that the temporary pores allow the passage of dextran up to
   40 kDa and reclose in less than 5 seconds after treatment. The optimized
   parameters were also successfully tested in vivo using the
   chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo.
   Conclusions: The results show that the number of cells transfected with
   the plasmid scales with the dynamic pressure of the jet. Our results
   show that mechanical methods have a very small window in which cells are
   permeabilized without injury (200 to 290 Pa). This simple apparatus
   helps define the forces needed for physical cell transfection methods.}},

Abstract = {{The Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay (Microtox) was
   slightly modified to use an in-house diluent containing 2\% DMSO and was
   successfully applied to perform a rapid toxicity screening of 24
   compounds including commercial plasticizers and chemicals currently
   studied as potential ``green{''} plasticizers. Comparison of the EC50
   values obtained indicated that 1,3-propanediol dibenzoate (PrDDB),
   1,4-butanediol dibenzoate (BDDB), and dihexyl maleate (DHM) might not be
   good candidates as ``green{''} plasticizers because of their higher
   toxicity (EC50 < 1 mg L-1). Results also indicated that Microtox is a
   useful technique to better understand the effect of key structural
   features on the toxicity of plasticizers. Comparison of EC50 values of
   similar compounds having a different alkyl chain lengths indicated a
   decrease in toxicity of dibenzoate plasticizers with respect to
   increasing alkyl chain size. The Microtox technique that we adapted to
   test compounds having low solubility was proven to be useful to evaluate
   the toxicity of potential ``green{''} plasticizers relative to
   commercial products. However, these results cannot be used alone to
   select the best candidates. The Microtox technique is complementary to
   biodegradation experiments and plasticizing properties tests and allows,
   at the development stage, the screening of a large number of potential
   ``green{''} plasticizers on the basis of their relative toxicity.}},

   (fAN,0 = 0.100.80) copolymers were synthesized at 90 degrees C in 50 wt
   \% 1,4-dioxane solutions with a unimolecular initiator,
   N-(2-methylpropyl)-N-(1-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethylpropyl)-O-(2-carbox
   ylprop-2-yl) hydroxylamine {[}BlocBuilder (BB)]. In the tBMA/AN
   copolymerizations, 8.08.5 mol \%
   N-tert-butyl-N-(1-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethylpropyl) free nitroxide
   relative to BB was added. The S/AN copolymers exhibited narrow,
   monomodal molecular weight distributions (MWDs) with low
   polydispersities {[}weight-average molecular weight (Mw)/number-average
   molecular weight (Mn) = 1.141.26], and the Mn versus monomer conversion
   (X) plots were relatively linear (Mn = 18.1 kg/mol, X approximate to
   0.7); this suggested that pseudo-living behavior was approached. AN
   proved to be an effective controlling comonomer for tBMA because the
   tBMA/AN copolymers exhibited narrow monomodal MWDs with Mw/Mn = 1.171.50
   and relatively linear Mn versus X plots to reasonably high X values (Mn
   = 15.6 kg/mol, X approximate to 0.6). The AN and S monomer reactivity
   ratios were rAN = 0.07 +/- 0.01 and rS = 0.27 +/- 0.02 (FinemanRoss) and
   rAN = 0.10 +/- 0.01 and rS = 0.28 +/- 0.02 (KelenTudos), respectively;
   these values were in good agreement with conventional free-radical
   polymerization. Error-in-variables model (EVM) analysis indicated that
   the use of cumulative composition S/AN data was more effective than
   typical approaches using low-X data with the MayoLewis model. The AN and
   tBMA reactivity ratios {[}rAN = 0.07 +/- 0.01 and rtBMA = 1.24 +/- 0.20
   (FinemanRoss) and rAN = 0.14 +/- 0.01 and rtBMA = 0.89 +/- 0.19
   (KelenTudos)] were similar to those reported for related alkyl
   methacrylate/AN conventional radical copolymerizations. EVM analysis
   suggested significant experimental error was associated with the tBMA/AN
   system, and this warrants further investigation. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{An investigation was conducted into the beneficial utilization of
   captured CO2 for early-age curing of precast concrete products. The
   performance of the carbonation-cured concrete was compared to that of
   steam curing to investigate the possibility of replacing steam curing
   with carbonation. The early-age carbonation curing was performed for a
   short period after an initial curing in a controlled environment. The
   effect of the carbonation curing was studied in terms of carbon uptake,
   accelerated strength, and durability. It was found that the short-term
   carbonation promoted early strength development, while subsequent
   hydration was essential to obtain later age properties. Durability
   performance of the carbonation-cured concrete was compared with steamed
   and normally hydrated references. The carbonation-cured concrete
   exhibited more resistance to chloride permeability, ion migration,
   sulfate attack, and freeze-thaw damage. The improved durability by
   carbonation is attributed to the significantly reduced calcium hydroxide
   content at the carbonated concrete surface. Despite a reduced pH at the
   carbonated zone, the alkalinity at the core was maintained above the
   threshold value needed to prevent carbonation corrosion. DOI:

   transplantation. In vitro analysis confirmed efficient transduction of
   hASCs expressing 7.65 +/- 0.86 ng functionally active VEGF per 10(6)
   microencapsulated hASCs (ASC-VEGF). To determine the potential of the
   developed system, chronically infarcted rat hearts were treated with
   either empty microcapsules (MC), microencapsulated hASCs expressing MGFP
   reporter protein (MC+ASC-MGFP), or MC+ASC-VEGF, and analyzed for 10
   weeks. Post-transplantation data confirmed higher myocardial VEGF
   expressions with significantly enhanced neovasculature in the

   percentage ejection fraction, also improved significantly in the
   MC+ASC-VEGF group (48.6 +/- 6.1\%) compared to that in MC+ASC-MGFP (38.8

Abstract = {{Eigenvalue analysis of a periodic structure by the finite-element method
   gives its Floquet propagation constant at a given frequency. Using this
   method directly to find the dispersion curve is computationally
   expensive, particularly in 3-D, because a large matrix eigenproblem must
   be solved at each frequency. The cost can be lowered by applying
   model-order reduction. A full-size eigenproblem at one frequency
   provides the information needed to build a much smaller matrix system
   that is sufficient for finding the dispersion over a frequency range. By
   controlling the frequency step-size and estimating eigenvalue errors, it
   is possible to compute dispersion over an arbitrary frequency range in
   an automatic way at a cost that is much lower than using the direct
   approach. Results are presented for a number of 3-D structures with
   rectangular cells: a triply periodic metal cube, three doubly-periodic
   planar structures, and a singly-periodic iris-loaded waveguide.
   Comparisons with previously published results demonstrate the accuracy
   of the method. The computational cost for these cases is at least an
   order of magnitude lower than the cost of solving the full eigenvalue
   problem at each frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Background/introduction: Diseases of the aorta can alter the local
   mechanical properties of the tissue, leading to aneurysms and plaque
   instability. Local tissue properties are best evaluated from surgical
   samples or autopsy tissue using mechanical testing ex vivo. We examined
   whether formalin-fixed tissues preserve regional and local variations in
   tissue properties when compared to fresh tissues in order to determine
   if fixed tissue can be used to infer mechanical changes associated with
   tissue remodeling. Methods: Equibiaxial mechanical tests were performed
   on canine descending thoracic aorta to quantify the regional and local
   tissue stiffness. Samples were taken from four locations along the aorta
   and from the lateral and medial side at each location. Half of the
   samples were randomly formalin fixed and used to measure the effect of
   fixation on local thickness, stiffness, and anisotropy. Results: In
   fresh tissue, regional differences in tissue stiffness and thickness are
   present. Aortic tissue stiffens and thins along the aorta. Fixation did
   not alter thickness, significantly increased tissue stiffness, and
   altered the directional dependency of the mechanical properties
   (anisotropy) at low strain. Formalin fixation altered local stiffness of
   the aorta near the aortic arch. Conclusion: The changes in mechanical
   properties along the aorta were preserved in formalin-fixed samples.
   However, our results show that formalin fixation can change the
   variation in tissue stiffness and significantly affects the anisotropic
   properties of vascular tissues. Formalin fixation introduces spurious
   changes in mechanical properties, and we therefore strongly recommend
   the use of fresh aortic tissues for biomechanical analysis. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this study, the dynamic detonation parameters, namely, the critical
   tube diameter and critical energy for direct initiation, of C2H2/N2O/Ar
   mixtures were measured at various initial conditions. Using chemical
   kinetics with the Konnov mechanism and experimental measured data, a
   simple correlation to evaluate the critical tube diameter of C2H2/N2O/Ar
   detonation is developed, given by d(c) = 594.8 phi(0.623) (1 -
   X-Ar)(0.2176) (p/p(o))(-0.0246) Delta(i) which is applicable for
   stoichiometric mixtures with initial pressures ranging from 50 to 130
   kPa, equivalence ratios from 0.625 to 2.5 and stoichiometric mixtures
   with maximum percentage of argon dilution up to 50\% at the atmospheric
   pressure. By combining this correlation function with a theoretical
   model based on a simple work done concept, the critical energy for
   direct blast initiation can be predicted; and the theoretical
   predictions are found to be in good agreement with the critical energy
   measured experimentally. To assess the detonation sensitivity, the
   critical energy results for direct initiation of detonation in
   C2H2/N2O/Ar mixtures are compared with those in H-2/N2O/Ar mixtures
   {[}Zhang et al., Int. J. Hydrogen Energy 39 (2011) 5707-5716]. The
   results indicate that C2H2/N2O/Ar is more sensitive than H-2/N2O/Ar at
   the same initial conditions. This is also supported qualitatively by the
   chemical kinetic calculation which shows that the ZND induction length
   scale for C2H2/N2O/Ar is relatively smaller than that of H-2/N2O/Ar
   mixture. Lastly, the effect of the oxidizer on the detonation
   sensitivity is studied by comparing the critical energy between
   C2H2/N2O/Ar and C2H2/O-2/Ar mixture. It is found that a higher energy is
   required to successfully initiate a spherical detonation in C2H2/N2O/Ar

Abstract = {{The present study reports the results of an investigation of the effects
   of an axial electric field (200-8000 V/cm) on the propagation of
   detonation waves in mixtures of 2CO + O-2 and C2H2 + O-2 + 85\%Ar. High
   speed streak camera and photodiodes were used for detonation velocity
   measurements. In addition, the voltage across the axial electrodes and
   the current are monitored as the detonation traverses the electric field
   region. The present results show that the neither the detonation
   structure nor its velocity are influenced by the electric field as it
   traverses the region between electrodes except when a breakdown occurs
   ahead of the detonation. The breakdown is due to the progressively
   increasing electric field between the detonation (which acts like a
   travelling quasi-neutral conducting plasma slug) and the downstream
   electrode. For a sufficiently strong electric field an arc discharge
   develops between the detonation and the charged electrode. When a
   discharge occurs in the unburned mixture ahead of the detonation wave,
   the mixture is ignited prior to the detonation arrival. This leads to
   the failure of the detonation since it now propagates into burnt
   products. Re-initiation of the failed detonation may occur downstream of
   the discharge section. The present results provide an explanation of the
   previous observations of Bone et al. {[}2]. (C) 2012 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Underground railways produce significant ground-borne vibration that is
   reported to disturb people living or working near subways. Designers and
   engineers use numerical models to predict vibration levels so as to meet
   the increasingly strict vibration standards. These models commonly
   include simplifying assumptions to reduce the complexity and cost of the
   simulation. This paper reviews six commonly disregarded aspects of the
   underground railway environment and their respective effects on
   vibration prediction values: a second (twin) tunnel, piled foundations,
   track with discontinuous slabs, soil inhomogeneity, inclined soil
   layers, and irregular contact at the tunnel-soil interface. Results
   suggest that accounting for each of these simplifying assumptions can
   result in predictions that vary from the simplified cases by at least 5
   dB and potentially up to 20 dB. This is a significant level of
   uncertainty and should be considered when estimating the predictive
   accuracy of numerical models using simplifying assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, new recording technologies have advanced such that, at
   high temporal and spatial resolutions, high-frequency oscillations (HFO)
   can be recorded in human partial epilepsy. However, because of the
   deluge of multichannel data generated by these experiments, achieving
   the full potential of parallel neuronal recordings depends on the
   development of new data mining techniques to extract meaningful
   information relating to time, frequency and space. Here, we aim to
   bridge this gap by focusing on up-to-date recording techniques for
   measurement of HFO and new analysis tools for their quantitative
   assessment. In particular, we emphasize how these methods can be
   applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and
   potentially productive future directions. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined sediment transport patterns around in-stream
   structures used to enhance fish habitat despite the importance of this
   variable in the successful design of stream restoration schemes. The
   objective of this study is to examine interactions between the
   (excavated) pool morphology, flow and sediment transport in a restored
   reach of the Nicolet River (Quebec, Canada). Bedload transport was
   investigated using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged particles
   that were followed from positions upstream of a pair of current
   deflectors which were designed to maintain the excavated pool
   downstream. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the flow field at
   various flow stages (with emerged or submerged deflectors) were used to
   relate near-bed velocity and bed shear stress to transport patterns and
   to assess the impact of varying the pool location and geometry on the
   flow field and water surface profiles. Results show that from 2005 to
   2008, of the 117 pit-tagged particles that fell in the pool, only 27 are
   known to have exited. None of the 30 largest rocks entering the pool
   escaped. Bed shear stress values simulated at high and peak flow
   (slightly above bankfull level) are not sufficient to move the largest
   rocks in the pool exit zone. Simulations also reveal a complex water
   surface topography when flow is above the height of deflectors, with
   negative water surface slope in the pool zone. When modifying the pool
   geometry so that the deepest zones are close to the apex of the
   in-stream structures instead of in the centre of the channel, both water
   surface slope and near-bed velocity patterns are greatly modified.
   Understanding the interactions between excavated pools, bedload and 3D
   velocity patterns around in-stream structures is essential for long-term
   success of fish habitat restoration projects, and using 3D models to
   test various designs of artificial pools is a promising approach.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Topical application of collagen has been suggested to
   enhance wound healing; however, its long-term effect on wounds has not
   been studied in a rat model.
   HYPOTHESIS: Topical application of collagen type I will not facilitate
   incision healing or cosmesis in rats up to 28 days postwounding.
   METHODS: The effects of bovine collagen type I (6 mg/mL) on the rat
   surgical paired skin incision model were examined. Each rat served as
   its own control in which topical collagen was applied to one incision
   while normal saline (0.9\%) was applied to the other incision. Rats were
   euthanized three (n = 6), seven (n = 6) and 28 (n = 5) days after
   wounding. Tissue harvested from each time point was examined for maximal
   breaking strength, and for biochemical and histological analysis.
   RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences (ie,
   P<0.05) in maximum wound breaking strength between the collagen- and
   saline-treated wounds at all time points. Histological analysis revealed
   a similar infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts in the
   wound edges of all incisions when matched with time of wounding. Western
   blot analysis revealed no differences in fibronectin or collagen I
   content in all wounds in each rat.
   CONCLUSIONS: The topical application of collagen did not facilitate
   wound healing from three to 28 days in the rat wound model.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Delayed-healing traumatic, surgical, and chronic wounds can
   be detrimental to patients and the health care system. The authors set
   out to investigate the effects of complement C5, a naturally occurring
   chemotactic cytokine, on wounds.
   Methods: The authors examined the effects of complement C5 on the rat
   paired skin incision model. Each rat served as its own control where
   topical collagen was applied to one incision and 100 nM of C5 in
   collagen vehicle was applied to the other incision. Rats were killed on
   days 3 (n = 6), 7 (n = 6), and 28 (n = 5) after wounding.
   Results: There was a statistically significant, 65 percent increase in
   maximum wound breaking strength with the topical application of C5 at
   day 3 (p < 0.01). The increase persisted to 14 percent at 7 days after
   wounding (p < 0.05). When compared with the sham group, the C5-treated
   wound strength increased by 83 percent at day 3 and 64 percent at day 7.
   There was no change in breaking strength at 28 days. Western blot
   analysis demonstrated a significant increase in collagen and fibronectin
   content in the C5-treated wounds.
   Conclusions: Topical application of C5 to skin wounds significantly
   increases wound healing maximum breaking strength as early as 3 days and
   up to 7 days after wounding. C5 accelerated wound healing by at least 4
   days in the first week of wounding. This was correlated with an increase
   in vascular permeability, increased inflammatory cell recruitment,
   subsequent fibroblast migration, and increased collagen deposition.

Abstract = {{Salinomycin sodium (BIO-COX) is polyether ionophore, commonly used in
   the poultry industries for the prevention of coccidial infections and
   promotion of growth. Salinomycin sodium (SAL-Na) is very toxic, and may
   be fatal, if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin than many
   other antibiotics, thus evaluating their fate in the soil environment is
   of importance. Sorption of SAL-Na was measured in clay, loamy sand, and
   sandy soil at different pH 4, 7, and 9, and desorption with phosphate
   buffer (pH 7) using batch equilibration technique. SAL-Na was sorbed by
   all the soils studied, the sorption of SAL-Na by the sandy soil
   increased as the pH decreased, while the sorption of salinomycin in clay
   and loamy sand soil increased as the pH increased. Desorption of
   salinomycin from the soil with phosphate buffer (pH 7) over the 24 h
   period was 80-95\% of the amount added. The similar trend was observed
   in desorption with pH 4, 7 and at different concentrations and slight
   less desorption was observed in pH 9. When compared to clay and loamy

Abstract = {{This research presents a disaggregated modeling approach for
   investigating the link between winter road collision occurrence,
   weather, road surface conditions, traffic exposure, temporal trends and
   site-specific effects. This approach is unique as it allows for
   quantification of the safety effects of different winter road
   maintenance activities at an operational level. Different collision
   frequency models are calibrated using hourly data collected from 31
   different highway routes across Ontario, Canada. It is found that
   factors such as visibility, precipitation intensity, air temperature,
   wind speed, exposure, month of the winter season, and storm hour have
   statistically significant effects on winter road safety. Most
   importantly, road surface conditions are identified as one of the major
   contributing factors, representing the first contribution showing the
   empirical relationship between safety and road surface conditions at
   such a disaggregate level. The applicability of the modeling framework
   is demonstrated using several examples, such as quantification of the
   benefits of alternative maintenance operations and evaluation of the
   effects of different service standards using safety as a performance
   measure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Macrophages are present before the onset of blood flow, but
   very little is known about their function in vascular development. We
   have developed a technique to concurrently label both endothelial cells
   and macrophages for time-lapse microscopy using co-injection of
   fluorescently conjugated acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL) and
   phagocytic dye PKH26-PCL. Results: We characterize double-labeled cells
   to confirm specific labeling of macrophages. Double-labeled cells
   circulate, roll along the endothelium, and extravasate from vessels.
   Most observed macrophages are integrated into the vessel wall, showing
   an endothelial-like morphology. We used transgenic quail that express a
   fluorescent protein driven by the endothelial-specific promoter Tie1 in
   conjugation with the phagocytic dye to analyze these cells. Circulating
   PKH26-PCL-labeled cells are mostly Tie1-, but those which have
   integrated into the vessel wall are largely Tie1+. The endothelial-like
   phagocytic cells were generally stationary during normal vascular
   development. We, therefore, induced vascular remodeling and found that
   these cells could be recruited to sites of remodeling. Conclusions: The
   active interaction of endothelial cells and macrophages support the
   hypothesis that these cells are involved in vascular remodeling. The
   presence of phagocytic endothelial-like cells suggests either a
   myeloid-origin to certain endothelial cells or that circulating
   endothelial cells/hematopoietic stem cells have phagocytic capacity.

Abstract = {{This report describes the inhibitory effect of pomegranate rind extract
   (PGRE) on the motility of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), a
   common agent of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). To this
   end, a fliC-lux reporter, as well as Western blot analysis and scanning
   electron microscopy, was used to demonstrate that when UPEC strain
   CFT073 is exposed to PGRE, expression of the flagellin gene, fliC, and
   flagellin production decrease. In agreement with these results, the
   swimming and swarming motilities of UPEC were observed to be hindered in
   the presence of PGRE. To evaluate the effect of other pomegranate
   materials (PMs), the hydrolysable tannins in pomegranate (PG;
   punicalagin) and pomegranate fruit powder (PGP) were also investigated.
   Of the materials tested, PGRE had the strongest inhibitory effect on
   fliC expression and motility. Moreover, a fractionation of PGRE showed
   fractions with a molecular weight between 1000 and 3000 similar to kDa
   to be the strongest inhibitors of fliC expression. Because
   flagellum-mediated motility has been suggested to enable UPEC to
   disseminate to the upper urinary tract; we propose that PGRE might be
   therapeutically beneficial in the treatment and prevention of UTIs.}},

Abstract = {{Culture on silicone rubber surfaces has been shown to partially overcome
   the chondrocyte dedifferentiation characteristic of standard culture on
   rigid polystyrene. These methods typically involve functionalization of
   culture surfaces with proteins. Collagen type I is often used, but more
   cartilage-specific proteins may be more appropriate for chondrocytes. To
   explore this hypothesis, a twofold experimental design was applied.
   First, chondrocytes were cultured in rigid Petri dishes coated with
   silicone rubber ({''}static silicone{''} or SS culture) functionalized
   with either cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) extract or collagen
   type I. Second, chondrocytes were cultured on monotonically expanded
   high extension silicone rubber dishes ({''}continuous expansion{''} or
   CE culture) functionalized with ECM extract and compared to cells grown
   in SS culture. There were no differential effects of surface
   functionalization with the ECM extract vs. collagen type I on
   chondrocyte morphology, viability, proliferation or apoptosis in SS
   culture. However, chondrocyte growth on the ECM extract was associated
   with significantly reduced collagen types I and X gene expression and
   significantly increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) secretion. After 3
   passages (P3) on ECM-coated SS culture, chondrocyte phenotype and GAG
   secretion was enhanced compared to cells passaged on collagen type I.
   Pellet cultures from P3 SS culture displayed enhanced collagen type II
   content when ECM extract was used for functionalization rather than
   collagen type I. In CE culture with ECM functionalization, chondrocyte
   dedifferentiation was significantly inhibited vs. SS cultures, as
   evidenced by both gene expression and pellet cultures. Functionalization
   of extendable culture surfaces with cartilage ECM extract therefore
   supports enhanced preservation of chondrocyte phenotype. (C ) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{Extracellular proteins play a key role in generating and maintaining
   cohesion and adhesion in biological tissues. These ``natural glues{''}
   are involved in vital biological processes such as blood clotting, wound
   healing and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues.
   Macromolecular assemblies of proteins can be functionally stabilized in
   a variety of ways in situ that include ionic interactions as well as
   covalent crosslinking to form protein networks that can extend both
   within and between tissues. Within tissues, myriad cohesive forces are
   required to preserve tissue integrity and function, as are additional
   appropriate adhesive forces at interfaces both within and between
   tissues of differing composition. While the mechanics of some key
   structural adhesive proteins have been characterized in tensile
   experiments at both the macroscopic and single protein levels, the
   fracture toughness of thin proteinaceous interfaces has never been
   directly measured. Here, we describe a novel and simple approach to
   measure the cohesive behavior and toughness of thin layers of
   proteinaceous adhesives. The test is based on the standard
   double-cantilever beam test used for engineering adhesives, which was
   adapted to take into account the high compliance of the interface
   compared with the beams. This new ``rigid double-cantilever beam{''}
   method enables stable crack propagation through an interfacial protein
   layer, and provides a direct way to measure its full traction-separation
   curve. The method does not require any assumption of the shape of the
   cohesive law, and the results provide abundant information contributing
   to understanding the structural, chemical and molecular mechanisms
   acting in biological adhesion. As an example, results are presented
   using this method for thin films of fibrin a protein involved in blood
   clotting and used clinically as a tissue bio-adhesive after surgery with
   the effects of calcium and crosslinking by Factor XIII being examined.
   Finally, a simple model is proposed, demonstrating how a bell-shaped
   cohesive law forms during the failure of the fibrin interface based on
   an eight-chain model whose structure degrades and changes configuration
   with stress. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Enamel is a composite biomaterial comprising a minor organic matrix
   (similar to 2\%) and a hierarchically organized inorganic ultrastructure
   (similar to 96-98\%). Surprisingly, to date there is no available
   information in the literature regarding the possible role of the enamel
   ultrastructure on the nanoscale level in tooth macroscopic properties.
   Understanding this relationship is of especial interest for restorative
   purposes in dentistry. Accordingly, this study was designed to
   investigate how enamel nanocrystals regulate its hardness. We performed
   microindentation analysis on 100 extracted human teeth. The tooth enamel
   hardness was quantified and correlated with changes in enamel chemical
   composition and crystallographic dimensions obtained from Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively.
   Enamel hardness was not related to the variability in organic content,
   but was associated with the size of apatite crystals along the c-axis.
   This association followed the Hall-Petch model for polycrystalline
   materials, indicating that the optimal size of apatite nanocrystals
   (larger than the critical size) provides enamel with the greatest
   hardness, which enables teeth to survive the heavy wear over a human
   lifetime. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Self-cycling fermentation (SCF), a cyclical, semi-continuous process
   that induces cell synchrony, was incorporated into a recombinant protein
   production scheme. Escherichia coli CY15050, a lac- mutant lysogenized
   with temperature-sensitive phage lambda modified to over-express
   beta-galactosidase, was used as a model system. The production scheme
   was divided into two de-coupled stages. The host cells were cultured
   under SCF operation in the first stage before being brought to a second
   stage where protein production was induced. In the first stage, the host
   strain demonstrated a stable cycling pattern immediately following the
   first cycle. This reproducible pattern was maintained over the course of
   the experiments and a significant degree of cell synchrony was obtained.
   By growing cells using SCF, productivity increased 50\% and production
   time decreased by 40\% compared to a batch culture under similar
   conditions. In addition, synchronized cultures induced from the end of a
   SCF cycle displayed shorter lysis times and a more complete culture-wide
   lysis than unsynchronized cultures. Finally, protein synthesis was
   influenced by the time at which the lytic phase was induced in the cell
   life cycle. For example, induction of a synchronized culture immediately
   prior to cell division resulted in the maximum protein productivity,
   suggesting protein production can be optimized with respect to the cell
   life cycle using SCF. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012;109: 22622270. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Introduction: Oral health is affected by its resident microorganisms.
   Three prominent oral disorders are dental caries, gingivitis and
   periodontitis, with the oral microbiota playing a key role in the
   initiation/progression of all three. Understanding the microbiota and
   the diseases they may cause is critical to the development of new
   therapeutics. This review is focused on probiotics for the prevention
   and/or treatment of oral diseases.
   Areas covered: This review describes the oral ecosystem and its
   correlation with oral health/disease. The pathogenesis and current
   prevention/treatment strategies of periodontal diseases (PD) and dental
   caries (DC) are depicted. An introduction of probiotics is followed by
   an analysis of their role in PD and DC, and their potential role(s) in
   oral health. Finally, a discussion ensues on the future research
   directions and limitations of probiotics for oral health.
   Expert opinion: An effective oral probiotic formulation should
   contribute to the prevention/treatment of microbial diseases of the oral
   cavity. Understanding the oral microbiota's role in oral disease is
   important for the development of a therapeutic to prevent/treat dental
   diseases. However, investigations into clinical efficacy, delivery/dose
   optimization, mechanism(s) of action and other related parameters are
   yet to be fully explored. Keeping this in mind, investigations into oral
   probiotic therapies are proving promising.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics associated with the impact of the crutch with the ground is
   an important topic of research, since this is known to be the main cause
   of mechanical energy loss during swing-through gait. In this work, a
   multibody system representing a subject walking with crutches is used to
   investigate the behavior of two different contact models, impulsive and
   continuous, used for impact analysis. In the impulsive (discrete)
   approach, the impact interval is considered to be negligible and,
   therefore, the system configuration is constant. The postimpact state is
   directly obtained from the preimpact one through algebraic equations. In
   the continuous approach, the stiffness and dissipation characteristics
   of the contact surfaces are modeled through nonlinear springs and
   dampers. The equations of motion are integrated during the impact time
   interval to obtain the postimpact state, which, in principle, can differ
   from that obtained by means of the impulsive approach. Although both
   approaches have been widely used in the field of biomechanics, we have
   not found any comparative study in the existing literature justifying
   the model chosen for impact analysis. In this work, we present detailed
   numerical results and discussions to investigate several dynamic and
   energetic features associated with crutch impact. Based on the results,
   we compare the implications of using one contact model or the other.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgae biofuel production can be feasible when a second function is

   phosphorus (P) and growth, making top performer identification
   fundamental. The objective of this screen was to identify dual-purpose

   freshwater Chlorella sp., Monoraphidium minutum sp., and Scenedesmus sp.
   and three marine Nannochloropsis sp., N. limnetica sp., and Tetraselmis
   suecica sp. species were batch cultured in 250 mL flasks over 16 days to
   quantitate total phosphorus (TP) removal and growth as a function of P
   loads (control, and 5, 10, and 15 mg L-1 enrichment of control).
   Experimental design used 100 mu mol m-2 s-1 of light, a light/dark cycle
   of 14/10 h, and no CO2 enrichment. Phosphorus uptake was dependent on
   species, duration of exposure, and treatment, with significant
   interaction effects. Growth was dependant on species and treatment. Not
   all species showed increased P removal with increasing P addition, and
   no species demonstrated higher growth. Nannochloropsis sp and N.
   limnetica sp. performed poorly across all treatments. Two dual-purpose
   candidates were identified. At the 10 mg L-1 treatment Monoraphidium
   minutum sp. removed 67.1\% (6.66 mg L-1 +/- 0.60 SE) of TP at day 8,
   79.3\% (7.86 mg L-1 +/- 0.28 SE) at day 16, and biomass accumulation of
   0.63 g L-1 +/- 0.06 SE at day 16. At the same treatment Tetraselmis
   suecica sp. removed 79.4\% (6.98 mg L-1 +/- 0.24 SE) TP at day 8, 83.0\%
   (7.30 mg L-1 +/- 0.60 SE) at day 16, and biomass of 0.55 g L-1 +/- 0.02
   SE at day 16. These species merit further study using high-density
   wastewater cultures and lipid profiling to assess suitability for a
   nutrient removal and biomass/biofuel production scheme.}},

Title = {{Forecasting Urban Water Demand Via Wavelet-Denoising and Neural Network
   Models. Case Study: City of Syracuse, Italy}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Forecasting urban water demand can be of use in the management of water
   utilities. For example, activities such as water-budgeting, operation
   and maintenance of pumps, wells, reservoirs, and mains require
   quantitative estimations of water resources at specified future dates.
   In this study, we tackle the problem of forecasting urban water demand
   by means of back-propagation artificial neural networks (ANNs) coupled
   with wavelet-denoising. In addition, non-coupled ANN and Linear Multiple
   Regression were used as comparison models. We considered the case of the
   municipality of Syracuse, Italy; for this purpose, we used a 7 year-long
   time series of water demand without additional predictors. Six
   forecasting horizons were considered, from 1 to 6 months ahead. The main
   objective was to implement a forecasting model that may be readily used
   for municipal water budgeting. An additional objective was to explore
   the impact of wavelet-denoising on ANN generalization. For this purpose,
   we measured the impact of five different wavelet filter-banks (namely,
   Haar and Daubechies of type db2, db3, db4, and db5) on a single neural
   network. Empirical results show that neural networks coupled with Haar
   and Daubechies' filter-banks of type db2 and db3 outperformed all of the
   following: non-coupled ANN, Multiple Linear Regression and ANN models
   coupled with Daubechies filters of type db4 and db5. The results of this
   study suggest that reduced variance in the training-set (by means of
   denoising) may improve forecasting accuracy; on the other hand, an
   oversimplification of the input-matrix may deteriorate forecasting
   accuracy and induce network instability.}},

Abstract = {{Dental biomaterials and natural products represent two of the main
   growing research fields, revealing plant-derived compounds may play a

   Therefore, our aim was to collect all available data concerning the
   utilization of plant polysaccharides, proteins and extracts rich in
   bioactive phytochemicals in enhancing performance of dental
   biomaterials. Although compelling evidences are suggestive of a great
   potential of plant products in promoting material-tissue/cell interface,
   to date, only few authors have investigated their use in development of
   innovative dental biomaterials. A small number of studies have reported
   plant extract-based titanium implant coatings and periodontal
   regenerative materials. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the
   first to deal with this topic, highlighting a general lack of research
   findings in an interesting field which still needs to be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Frothers are surfactants commonly used to reduce bubble size in mineral
   flotation. This paper describes a methodology to characterize frothers
   by relating impact on bubble size reduction represented by CCC (critical
   coalescence concentration) to frother structure represented by HLB
   (hydrophile-lipophile balance). Thirty-six surfactants were tested from
   three frother families: Aliphatic Alcohols, Polypropylene Glycol Alkyl
   Ethers and Polypropylene Glycols, covering a range in alkyl groups
   (represented by n, the number of carbon atoms) and number of Propylene
   Oxide groups (represented by m). The Sauter mean size (D-32) was derived
   from bubble size distribution measured in a 0.8 m(3) mechanical
   flotation cell. The D-32 vs. concentration data were fitted to a
   3-parameter model to determine CCC95, the concentration giving 95\%
   reduction in bubble size compared to water only. It was shown that each
   family exhibits a unique CCC95-HLB relationship dependent on n and m.
   Empirical models were developed to predict CCC95 either from HLB or
   directly from n and m. Commercial frothers of known family were shown to
   fit the relationships. Use of the model to predict D-32 is illustrated.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3999-4008}},

Abstract = {{Electro-dewatering is an energy-efficient technology in which an
   electric field can increase the dryness of biosolids from secondary
   wastewater treatment from 15\% w/w to 30-50\% w/w. Here, we address
   bacterial pathogen indicators inactivation (total coliforms, Escherichia
   coli and aerobic endospores) during electro-dewatering, investigating
   the roles of electrochemically generated oxidants, extreme pH, and high
   temperature (from Joule heating). Our results demonstrate that
   temperature is the primary factor affecting total coliforms and E. coli
   inactivation. First, several electro-dewatering cycles were used to
   increase sludge temperature to about 100 degrees C after 6 min, during
   which time the average pH decreased from 7 to 3.6 after 10 min. Total
   coliforms and E. coli MPNs reached their detection limits after 6 min
   (with 4-5 logs of inactivation for total coliforms and 3-4 logs for E.
   coli). In contrast, aerobic endospores were not inactivated under these
   conditions; rather, their germination appeared to be stimulated by 6-8
   min of electro-dewatering. Second, the dewatering cake was separated
   into four horizontal layers. After 8 min of electro-dewatering, the pH
   in the top layers decreased to 3, whereas the pH in the bottom layers
   increased to 8. Inactivation of total coliforms and E. coli in the
   sludge cake was similar in all layers, increasing with time, suggesting
   that oxidants and extreme pH are secondary inactivation factors.
   Finally, electrodes were cooled to maintain a temperature less than 34
   degrees C. Although pH decreased significantly after 12 min of
   electro-dewatering, there was no significant bacterial pathogen
   indicator inactivation at low temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to investigating the impact of
   information and communication technologies (ICTs) on travel behaviour
   and its environmental effects. The paper focuses on the spatial
   dispersion of out-of-home activities and travel (activity space) and
   greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) at the level of the individual. An
   original method, combining spatial analysis in a geographic information
   system with advanced regression techniques, is proposed to explore these
   potentially complex relationships in the case of access to mobile phones
   and the internet, while taking into account the influence of
   socio-economics and built environment factors. The proposed methodology
   is tested using a 7-day activity-based survey in Quebec City in
   2003-2004, a juncture of particular interest because these ICTs had
   recently crossed the threshold of 40 \% (mobile phone) and 60 \%
   (home-based internet) penetration at the time. The study period also
   largely pre-dates the era of mobile internet access. Among other
   results, socio-demographic factors were found to significantly affect
   both ICT access and travel out-comes. The built environment, represented
   by neighbourhood typologies, also played an important role. However, it
   was found that after controlling for the self-selection effect, built
   environment and socio-demographics, those who had a mobile phone
   available produced 30 \% more GHGs during the observed week than those
   who did not. This higher level of GHG pro-duction was accompanied by a
   12 \% higher measure of activity dispersion. On the other hand, having
   internet access at home was associated with lower GHGs (-19 \%) and
   lesser activity dispersion (-25 \%). Possibly, mobile phones enable
   individuals to cover more space and produce more emissions, while the
   internet provides opportunities to stay at home or avoid motorized
   travel thus reducing emissions. The estimated effects of having a mobile
   phone were not only negative but also larger in magnitude from the
   environmental point of view than those of fixed internet access.
   However, the results of this study also suggest that access to mobile
   phones and internet may have substantial and compensatory effects at the
   individual level that are undetected when using model structures that do
   not take into account that unobserved factors may influence both ICT
   choices and travel outcomes.}},

Journal = {{FINITE ELEMENTS IN ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{55-66}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Using a fracture mechanics framework, this paper presents a finite
   element method to simulate the break-up of ice accreted on the wings of
   aircraft. The fully automated ice break-up module is integrated in
   FENSAP-ICE {[}1,2], which is an in-flight ice accretion simulation code
   that solves flow, droplet impingement and ice accretion, in sequence.
   The approach is validated by comparing with published results for a
   single edge cracked plate test case. Numerous complicated ice-shapes are
   analyzed and comparison is performed with a contemporary fracture
   mechanics code. Under typical icing and flow conditions, linear
   elasticity is found to be adequate for ice break-up analysis. An
   important finding of this study is that the breaking of ice has a strong
   dependence on its shape, i.e. under similar aerodynamic loading, some
   ice shapes fail while others do not. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{In theory, graphene should exhibit very high carrier mobility, however
   its measured mobility is usually much lower. This discrepancy between
   theory and empirical observations is believed to be due to disordered
   scattering. We present a systematic first principles study of diffusive
   impurity scattering in short channel graphene. We achieve good agreement
   with experimental data and show that mobility in graphene is strongly
   influenced by impurity scattering. In general, the results show that
   diffusive scattering can play a key role in determining the carrier

   antiferromagnets FeGa2S4 and NiGa2S4}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic susceptibility and muon spin relaxation (mu SR) experiments
   have been carried out on the quasi-2D triangular-lattice spin S = 2
   antiferromagnet FeGa2S4. The mu SR data indicate a sharp onset of a
   frozen or nearly frozen spin state at T{*} = 31(2) K, twice the
   spin-glass-like freezing temperature T-f = 16(1) K. The susceptibility
   becomes field dependent below T{*}, but no sharp anomaly is observed in
   any bulk property. A similar transition is observed in mu SR data from
   the spin-1 isomorph NiGa2S4. In both compounds the dynamic muon spin
   relaxation rate lambda(d)(T) above T{*} agrees well with a calculation
   of spin-lattice relaxation by Chubukov, Sachdev, and Senthil in the
   renormalized classical regime of a 2D frustrated quantum
   antiferromagnet. There is no firm evidence for other mechanisms. At low
   temperatures, lambda(d)(T) becomes temperature independent in both
   compounds, indicating persistence of spin dynamics. Scaling of
   lambda(d)(T) between the two compounds is observed from similar to T-f
   to similar to 1.5T{*}. Although the mu SR data by themselves cannot
   exclude a truly static spin component below T{*}, together with the
   susceptibility data they are consistent with a slowly fluctuating ``spin
   gel{''} regime between T-f and T {*}. Such a regime and the absence of a
   divergence in lambda(d)(T) at T{*} are features of two unconventional
   mechanisms: (1) binding/unbinding of Z(2) vortex excitations, and (2)
   impurity spins in a nonmagnetic spin-nematic ground state. The absence
   of a sharp anomaly or history dependence at T{*} in the susceptibility
   of FeGa2S4, and the weakness of such phenomena in NiGa2S4, strongly
   suggest transitions to low-temperature phases with unconventional
   dynamics.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3460-3469}},

Abstract = {{Calcium carbonate is the most abundant biomineral that is biogenically
   formed with a vast array of nano and microscale features. Among the less
   stable polymorphs present in mineralized organisms, the most soluble,
   amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), formed in chitin exoskeletons of some
   crustacea, is of particular interest since aqueous stability of isolated
   ACC is limited to a few hours in the absence of polyanions or magnesium.
   Here the influence of a selection of biopolymer gels on the
   mineralization of calcium carbonate is investigated. Mineralization is
   achieved in all biopolymers tested, but is particularly abundant in
   collagen hydrogels, in which a significant proportion of the calcium
   carbonate (similar to 18\%) is found to be amorphous. In dense collagen
   gels, this amorphous fraction does not crystallize for up to six weeks
   in deionized water at room temperature. The reason why collagen in
   particular should stabilize this phase remains obscure, although the
   results suggest that the fiber diameter, fiber spacing, and the
   amphoteric nature of collagen fibers are important. Upon immersion in
   phosphate containing solutions, the calcium carbonate present within the
   collagen hydrogels is readily converted to carbonated hydroxyapatite,
   enabling the formation of a stiff bone-like composite containing 78 wt\%
   mineral, essentially equivalent to cortical bone.}},

Abstract = {{A method was developed to assess leaching of several poly(vinyl
   chloride) (PVC) plasticizers in aqueous media using gas chromatography
   (GC), and compared to a gravimetric standard test method (ASTM Method
   D13239). The GC method was a more direct measurement of plasticizer
   concentration in the aqueous phase. The leaching of commercial
   plasticizers, as well as several series of ``green{''} candidate
   plasticizers, were assessed as a function of their molecular
   characteristics and compared to the industry standard PVC plasticizer,
   di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). It was found that plasticizers
   containing longer alkyl chains or non-polar branching emanating from
   polar structural units, increased the hydrophobicity of the molecule and
   reduced its aqueous leaching rate. Several ``green{''} plasticizer
   candidates were found to minimize aqueous leaching to rates ten times
   below that of DEHP; notably dioctyl succinate (DOS), dihexyl maleate
   (DHM), methyl cyclohexyl diester (MCDE), diethylhexyl succinate (DENS),
   hexanediol dibenzoate (C6), and the commercially available Hexamoll (R)

   measured after Folin-Ciocalteu's assay at 289, 298, 343 and 765 nm, in
   order to calibrate the predictive PLS and ANN models. The accuracy and
   the predictive ability of the models ranged from good to excellent as
   indicated by RPD values (the ratio of the standard deviation of the
   reference values to the standard error of prediction) of 5.03-13.7. The

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a carrier phase recovery (CPR) algorithm using
   a modified superscalar parallelization based phase locked loop
   (M-SSP-PLL) combined with a maximum-likelihood (ML) phase estimation.
   Compared to the original SSP-PLL, M-SSP-PLL + ML reduces the required
   buffer size using a novel superscalar structure. In addition, by
   removing the differential coding/decoding and employing ML phase
   recovery it also improves the performance. In simulation, we show that
   the laser linewidth tolerance of M-SSP-PLL + ML is comparable to blind
   phase search (BPS) algorithm, which is known to be one of the best CPR
   algorithms in terms of performance for arbitrary QAM formats. In 28
   Gbaud QPSK (112 Gb/s) and 16-QAM (224 Gb/s), and 7 Gbaud 64-QAM (84
   Gb/s) experiments, it is also demonstrated that M-SSP-PLL + ML can
   increase the transmission distance by at least 12\% compared to BPS for
   each of them. Finally, the computational complexity is discussed and a
   significant reduction is shown for our algorithm with respect to BPS.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dispersion stability of multiwall carbon nanotubes

   microscope with a hot stage was used to study the evolution of the
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) dispersion during the cure of the resin. A new
   image processing approach is then introduced to quantify dispersion and
   identify the source of dispersion degradation during the cure. The
   results showed that the reduction of the resin viscosity at temperatures
   greater than 100 degrees C caused an irreversible re-agglomeration of
   the CNTs in the matrix. It was shown that the fine-tuning of the ratio
   and type of curing agent as well as the curing temperature directly
   affect the dispersion stability of MWNTs in the epoxy polymer. The
   dispersion quality was then directly correlated to the fracture
   toughness of the modified resin and a maximum of 20\% improvement was
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater is a life-sustaining resource that supplies water to
   billions of people, plays a central part in irrigated agriculture and
   influences the health of many ecosystems(1,2). Most assessments of
   global water resources have focused on surface water(3-6), but
   unsustainable depletion of groundwater has recently been documented on
   both regional(7,8) and global scales(9-11). It remains unclear how the
   rate of global groundwater depletion compares to the rate of natural
   renewal and the supply needed to support ecosystems. Here we define the
   groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater use and
   groundwater-dependent ecosystem services) and show that humans are
   overexploiting groundwater in many large aquifers that are critical to
   agriculture, especially in Asia and North America. We estimate that the
   size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3.5 times
   the actual area of aquifers and that about 1.7 billion people live in
   areas where groundwater resources and/or groundwater-dependent
   ecosystems are under threat. That said, 80 per cent of aquifers have a
   groundwater footprint that is less than their area, meaning that the net
   global value is driven by a few heavily overexploited aquifers. The
   groundwater footprint is the first tool suitable for consistently
   evaluating the use, renewal and ecosystem requirements of groundwater at
   an aquifer scale. It can be combined with the water footprint and
   virtual water calculations(12-14), and be used to assess the potential
   for increasing agricultural yields with renewable groundwaterref(15).
   The method could be modified to evaluate other resources with renewal
   rates that are slow and spatially heterogeneous, such as fisheries,
   forestry or soil.}},

Abstract = {{Nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP) of 4-vinylpyridine (4VP) using
   2-({[}tert-butyl{[}1-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-2,2-dimethylpropyl]amino]oxy)-

   Controlled homo polymerization of 4VP using 10 mol\%

   nitroxide (SG1) relative to BlocBuilder was limited to low conversions
   (X = 0.20-0.30) due to interaction between the pyridine group of 4VP and
   BlocBuilder's carboxylic acid group. Converting BlocBuilder into a
   succinimidyl ester terminated form (NHS-BlocBuilder) resulted in 4VP
   polymerizations with a linear increase in number average molecular
   weight, (M-n) over bar, versus X to X = 0.80, while maintaining a narrow
   molecular weight distribution ((M-w) over bar/(M-n) over bar < 1.2).
   Final poly(4VP) samples were determined to be pseudo-{''}living{''} by
   subsequent chain extension with a fresh batch of 4VP, with very few dead
   chains. Attempts to homopolymerize 4VP in the presence of as little as
   0.04 wt\% C-60 relative to 4VP resulted in inhibition, preventing the
   polymerization from exceeding beyond X = 0.40 and thus 4VP/C-60
   complexation has to be done post-polymerization.}},

Volume = {{233}},

Abstract = {{Employing the advection-diffusion-reaction equation as a model problem
   we present a multiscale method that yields a stabilized finite element
   formulation for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based turbulence
   models. The multiscale method arises from a decomposition of the scalar
   field into coarse (resolved) and fine (unresolved) scales. Modeling of
   the unresolved scales corrects the lack of stability of the standard
   Galerkin formulation. The proposed method possesses superior properties
   like that of the Streamline Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method and the
   Galerkin/Least-Squares (GLS) method. The stabilization terms appear
   naturally and the resulting formulation provides effective stabilization
   in turbulent computations where reaction-dominated effects strongly
   influence the boundary layer prediction. A family of 2D and 3D elements
   is developed and comparison of the proposed method with the SUPG method
   is presented. The multiscale formulation is then applied to the
   Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model {[}1] in FENSAP-ICE {[}2-7] for
   detached-eddy simulation (DES). Numerical results obtained by the
   proposed method are compared with experimental and DNS results for
   backward-facing step problem at Reynolds number of 5000. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The spatial Burmester problem is studied in this work, focusing on the

   developed in such a way that it leads to a robust solution, based on a
   semigraphical approach, which produces all the real solutions to the
   problem of CC-dyad synthesis for five given poses. This eases the
   equation-solving process by filtering out the complex solutions, while
   allowing for the handling of the special cases of none or infinitely
   many solutions. The synthesis procedure is illustrated with examples for

Abstract = {{We propose and test a new systematic approach to set load shedding
   under-frequency relays that replaces much of the conventional
   simulation-based trial-and-error heuristics by a mixed-integer linear
   program that can then be solved by commercially available highly
   efficient solvers such as CPLEX. The new formulation can account for an
   arbitrary number of random generator outages and for the particularities
   of the power system such as inertia, damping and regulation parameters,
   and under-frequency/time limitations. The under-frequency relays are
   characterized by a sequence of frequency set points and allowed time
   spans below such levels together with the amount of load shedding needed
   to meet all specified time and frequency criteria. The objective
   function is to minimize the average amount of load shed over a set of
   random generator outages. Two simulation studies are presented to
   illustrate the use of the proposed method to obtain suitable relay

   less than the deflection angle required for an oblique Chapman-Jouguet

   it is shown that, for such low wedge or cone angles, a CJ oblique
   detonation is eventually initiated following an induction process. It
   its thus demonstrated that shock-induced combustion with the reaction
   front remaining uncoupled to the oblique shock in the far field is not a
   valid solution. Simulations with semi-infinite cones reveal that the
   effect of the front curvature around the cone axis allows oblique
   detonations to be formed at angles lower than that of a planar CJ

   glassy carbon and stainless steel mesh cathodes alone. The CNF cathode
   was also found to be highly selective, yielding a 99.3 +/- 0.6\% pure

Abstract = {{Higher aircraft energy efficiency may be achieved by minimizing the
   clearance between the rotating blade tips and respective surrounding
   casing. A common technical solution consists in the implementation of an
   abradable liner which improves both the operational safety and the
   efficiency of modern turbomachines. However, unexpected abradable wear
   removal mechanisms were recently observed in experimental set-ups as
   well as during maintenance procedures. Based on a numerical strategy
   previously developed, the present study introduces a
   numerical-experimental comparison of such occurrence. Attention is first
   paid to the review and analysis of existing experimental results. Good
   agreement with numerical predictions is then illustrated in terms of
   critical stress levels within the blade as well as final wear profiles
   of the abradable liner. Numerical results suggest an alteration of the
   abradable mechanical properties in order to explain the outbreak of a
   divergent interaction. New blade designs are also explored in this
   respect and it is found that the interaction phenomenon is highly
   sensitive to (1) the blade geometry, (2) the abradable material
   properties, and (3) the distortion of the casing. {[}DOI:

   plays a key role in the through-film transport process. This effect
   vanishes in the more open films formed from micro-fibrillated cellulose

Abstract = {{Structural engineers routinely use rational dynamic analysis methods for
   the seismic analysis of buildings. In linear analysis based on modal
   superposition or response spectrum approaches, the overall response of a
   structure (for instance, base shear or inter-storey drift) is obtained
   by combining the responses in several vibration modes. These modal
   responses depend on the input load, but also on the dynamic
   characteristics of the building, such as its natural periods, mode
   shapes, and damping. At the design stage, engineers can only predict the
   natural periods using eigenvalue analysis of structural models or
   empirical equations provided in building codes. However, once a building
   is constructed, it is possible to measure more precisely its dynamic
   properties using a variety of in situ dynamic tests. In this paper, we
   use ambient motions recorded in 27 reinforced concrete shear wall (RCSW)
   buildings in Montreal to examine how various empirical models to predict
   the natural periods of RCSW buildings compare to the periods measured in
   actual buildings under ambient loading conditions. We show that a model
   in which the fundamental period of RCSW buildings varies linearly with
   building height would be a significant improvement over the period
   equation proposed in the 2010 National Building Code of Canada. Models
   to predict the natural periods of the first two torsion modes and second
   sway modes are also presented, along with their uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Conditional simulation of random fields based on integrating multi-scale
   spatial data using wavelets is detailed herein. Course scale data are
   first simulated using sequential Gaussian co-simulation. For all finer
   scales, wavelet coefficients are simulated by using a template matching
   algorithm borrowing information from a training image. Spatial
   up-scaling is performed through the inverse wavelet transformation.
   Examples using an exhaustive dataset show that the proposed method works
   well and is robust when changing the amount of hard data and resolution
   of secondary data. Sensitivity analysis shows that the selection of a
   suitable template size can improve the performance of the proposed
   method. A comparative study shows that the proposed algorithm is
   computationally faster than the well-known simpat and filtersim
   algorithms, as well as reasonably accurate in terms of reproduction of
   continuity in complex geologic environments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In natural mixed-sulphide assemblages, galvanic interaction between
   stibnite and pyrite has been shown to increase the dissolution of
   stibnite, leading to enhanced antimony leaching. The objective of this
   study was to determine the impact of pyrite on the dissolution rate of
   stibnite in binary mixtures of the two minerals. Finely ground pyrite
   and stibnite were mixed in various ratios and the mixtures were
   subjected to water leaching in flow-through columns for 6 days. An
   increased oxidation rate of stibnite was noted in the presence of
   pyrite, with a greater accumulation of oxidized, solid-phase Sb in the
   systems containing higher pyrite inputs. This study provides evidence
   that galvanic interaction can enhance the oxidation of stibnite in
   unconsolidated mixtures of sulphides when stibnite is in close contact
   with pyrite. In the context of mine wastes, galvanic interaction may
   thus constitute a mechanism enhancing Sb release but its overall
   significance remains to be clarified as natural processes may occur to
   attenuate the aqueous transport of the released Sb.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, experiments were conducted on the flapping dynamics of
   flags immersed in fairly noisy axial flow. The experimental set-up was
   first validated by comparing the critical conditions for flapping onset
   with relevant results from other experimental investigations, numerical
   simulations and theoretical models found in the literature. Short and
   long flags, as well as flags with aspect ratio equal to unity, were
   considered. Nonlinear dynamic analyses including power spectra,
   phase-space portraits. Poincare sections and circle maps obtained from
   the flag transverse displacement time-series indicate that the observed
   non-periodic flapping mainly arises through a quasi-periodic scenario.
   This paper also reports for the first time a ``switching{''} oscillation
   phenomenon, which is closely related to hysteresis and bistability
   phenomena. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We suggest new directions for research on the effectiveness of
   concurrent product development. These models relate overlapping or
   functional integration to performance using analytical, simulation, or
   statistical methods. By collecting quantitative data from 82 research
   articles, we ascertain the percentage of a methodology's models that
   have incorporated each of certain significant theoretical features. We
   then use this information to recommend important underutilized features
   and a comprehensive theory that integrates the features. Analytical and
   simulation modelers could make more use of functional integration, while
   statistical modelers could attend more to overlapping, rework, and the
   constituent phases of the development process. Then, in finding a subset
   of interrelated features appearing simultaneously in a majority of a
   methodology's models, we identify a core theory upon which models in the
   mainstream build. Next, our study offers specific mutual learning
   suggestions through which modeling efforts in any one methodology might
   facilitate modeling efforts in another methodology. Analytical and
   simulation modelers could study the reluctance to transmit and use
   preliminary information, while statistical researchers could develop
   dynamic models. Finally, the study provides a template for researchers
   willing to apply our evaluation methods to other areas.}},

Abstract = {{Anomaly detection techniques are widely used in a variety of
   applications, e. g., computer networks, security systems, etc. This
   paper describes and analyzes an approach to anomaly detection using
   proximity graphs and the PageRank algorithm. We run a variant of the
   PageRank algorithm on top of a proximity graph comprised of data points
   as vertices, which produces a score quantifying the extent to which each
   data point is anomalous. Previous work in this direction requires first
   forming a density estimate using the training data, e. g., using kernel
   methods, and this step is very computationally intensive for
   high-dimensional data sets. Under mild assumptions and appropriately
   chosen parameters, we show that PageRank produces point-wise consistent
   probability density estimates for the data points in an asymptotic
   sense, and with much less computational effort. As a result, big
   improvements in terms of running time are witnessed while maintaining
   similar detection performance. Experiments with synthetic and real-world
   data sets illustrate that the proposed approach is computationally
   tractable and scales well to large high-dimensional data sets.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the design, modeling, and characterization of apodized comb
   filters in the silicon-on-insulator platform. These devices are based on
   sampled gratings, wherein the comb response is generated by a
   convolution of a regular grating by a predetermined periodic sampling
   function. We show that dual and complementary apodization of the etch
   depth in the marks and spaces ensures a near-zero dc index change over
   the length of the device and avoids the unwanted sidelobes obtained in a
   single apodized device. Comb filters with a 40-dB side-mode suppression
   ratio, a 92-GHz clear bandwidth, 200-GHz channel spacing, and a
   120-dB/dec rolloff have been theoretically proposed. An experimental
   demonstration of the fabricated devices is also presented, and the
   performance is compared with the numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{High speed rolling (HSR) of 1000 m min(-1) was employed to successfully

   comparison with low speed rolling (15 m min(-1)), improved
   significantly. It is suggested that the double peak and weaker basal
   texture obtained after HSR are attributed to the activation of
   compression and double twins. After annealing, the double peak basal
   texture is replaced by a single peak one, which may be due to
   preferential grain growth of basal grains.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA CHEMISTRY AND PLASMA PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{845-858}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{It was found in this study that the air plasma treatment of particular
   kaolinite has led to the change of its wettability, which was reflected
   in the decreased values of water contact angles of wetting from 88.7A
   degrees for virgin kaolinite to 86.3A degrees for 30 min air plasma
   treated one. Plasma treated samples show higher average surface energies
   in the wide range of coverage regimes in comparison to the virgin
   samples as determined by inverse gas chromatography. Results of these
   measurements confirmed our assumption, that air plasma treatment
   activates surface energy of the crystal planes of the kaolinite as
   reflected in the broadened dispersive surface energy distribution after
   10 min treatment time. However with prolonged 30 min treatment time the
   dispersive surface energy distribution profile was decreased. We assume,
   that the latter decrease reflects the distorsion of the crystal lattice
   of the kaolinite as confirmed by FTIR analysis as reflected in changes
   of Si-O-Si and Al2O-H characteristic absorption bands. Calculated
   dispersive surface free energy for 24 \% surface coverage was increased
   from original 35 mJ/m(2) to 40.3 and 40.8 mJ/m(2) for 10 and 30 min
   treatment times. There were determined yield locus and flow function
   dependencies at different stress levels for virgin and different time
   plasma treated samples (flow index-ff (c) , effective angle of internal
   friction-phi (e) , unconfined yield strength-I integral (c) ). It was
   found that by plasma treatment the character of the flow was shifting
   from region of very cohesive (ff (c) = 2.39) to the cohesive (ff (c) =
   3.19). For untreated samples effective angle of internal friction was
   decreased with increasing applied consolidation stress, while for plasma
   treated kaolinite it was increased.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{62-72}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Longwall mining is one of the most widely used underground mining
   methods most suitable in relatively flatlying, thick, and uniform
   coalbeds. Due to extraction of the coal seam, the panel roof strata
   above the mined zone will be destressed and then the roof loads will be
   redistributed and transferred to the front abutment and neighboring
   solid sections with higher load bearing capacity where the adjacent
   access tunnels and the corresponding barrier pillars are located. The
   height of destressed zone (HDZ). in this paper is taken as equivalent to
   the combined height of the caving and fracturing zones above the mined
   panel roof induced due to longwall mining. The height of destressed zone
   plays a vital role in accurate determination of the amount of loads
   being transferred towards front abutment and panel sides. The paper
   describes the mechanism of development of the height of this zone.
   Finally, five new simple, yet conclusive, mathematical approaches to
   estimate the height of destressed zone are presented. The results of the
   methods proposed are compared with each other and with the comparable
   methods. The methods proposed are further compared and verified with
   in-situ measurements reported in the literatures. The comparative
   results confirm the agreement that exist among the methods and those
   with the in-situ measurements as well. Finally the methods have shown
   that, in short term, the height of destressed zone ranges from 6.5 to 24
   times the extraction coal seam height; while, in long term, the height
   of destressed zone ranges from 11.5 to 46.5 times the extraction coal
   seam height. Therefore, beyond this height the overburden pressure will
   be transferred towards the front abutment, the adjacent access tunnels,
   the intervening barrier pillars as well as the panel rib-sides. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Scratch tests, reciprocating microwear, and scanning wear tests were

   terms of mechanical properties, friction coefficient, and wear behavior.
   The results were correlated to the tribofilm formation, which was
   analyzed using ex situ characterization of the wear track with a
   Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), micro-Raman spectrometer, and an
   atomic force microscope (AFM). It was observed that the nanocomposite
   Au-MoS2 coatings increased the wear resistance compared to pure Au
   films, which was explained by the increase in hardness values and the
   decrease in surface adhesion forces. Similarly for bilayer Au/MoS2
   samples, the wear resistance of the Au film was enhanced by the MoS2 top
   layer, which behaved as a sacrificial layer protecting the Au. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the stabilization problem of vibration of
   linearized three-dimensional nonlocal micropolar elasticity. For this
   purpose, we need to demonstrate the well-posedness of the system of
   equations governing the vibration of three-dimensional nonlocal
   micropolar media for both forced (i.e. with boundary feedback) and
   unforced cases. We assume the non-homogeneous system of equations for
   the unforced (uncontrolled) case to establish the well-posedness. It
   should be pointed out that the well-posedness of the evolution equations
   in micropolar case has been studied by many authors; but, the
   well-posedness in the nonlocal micropolar is an open problem. Our tools
   in well-posedness analysis are the semigroup techniques. Afterwards, we
   pursue the stabilization problem and show that the vibration of the
   nonlocal micropolar elastic media will be eventually dissipated under
   boundary feedback actions consisting of stress and couple stress
   feedback laws. These control laws are simple, linear and can be easily
   implemented in practical applications. The stabilization proof is
   accomplished using Lyapunov stability and LaSalle's invariant set
   theorems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, which is an extended version of our work at LVA/ICA 2010
   {[}1], the problem of Inter Symbol Interface (ISI) Sparse channel
   estimation and equalization will be investigated. We firstly propose an
   adaptive method based on the idea of Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm
   and the concept of smoothed I-o (SLO) norm presented in {[}2] for
   estimation of sparse ISI channels. Afterwards, a new non-adaptive fast
   channel estimation method based on SLO sparse signal representation is
   proposed. ISI channel estimation will have a direct effect on the
   performance of the ISI equalizer at the receiver. So, in this paper we
   investigate this effect in the case of optimal Maximum Likelihood
   Sequence-by-Sequence Equalizer (MLSE) {[}3]. In order to implement this
   equalizer, we first introduce an equivalent F-model for sparse channels,
   and then using this model we propose a new method called pre-filtered
   parallel Viterbi algorithm (or pre-filtered PVA) for general ISI sparse
   channels which has much less complexity than ordinary Viterbi Algorithm
   (VA) and also with no considerable loss of optimality, which we have
   examined by doing some experiments in Matlab/Simulink. Indeed,
   simulation results clearly show that the proposed concatenated
   estimation-equalization methods have much better performance than the
   usual equalization methods such as Linear Mean Square Equalization
   (LMSE) for ISI sparse channels, while preserving simplicity at the
   receiver. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a low complexity and energy efficient 45 Gb/s

   10(-12) for long block length LDPC(32768,26803) code. The performance
   over a hard decision front-end is 1.9 dB for this code. It is shown that
   the soft-decision circuit can also be used as a 2-bit flash type
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC), in conjunction with equalization

Abstract = {{Waves in shallow water are computed by moving blocks of water in the
   direction of the flow using a Lagrangian method. The mass and momentum
   in the displaced-and-deformed blocks after the Lagrangian advection are
   re-distributed back on to the Eulerian mesh to form new blocks at every
   increment of time. This Lagrangian block advection guarantees for
   positive water depth. It also prevents the occurrence of unphysical
   numerical oscillations. Several numerically challenging problems are
   considered in a series of simulations using the method. The first
   problem is the tracking of wetting-and-drying interface in a parabolic
   bowl. The second problem is the capture of depth and velocity
   discontinuities across the shock waves. Finally, the block advection
   method is applied to calculate the flood waves overtopping a meandering
   river. The results of the simulations are compared with the exact
   solutions. The convergence of Lagrangian block advection towards the
   exact solutions is first-order accurate in the simulations of the
   depth-and-velocity discontinuities. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1, 1}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{Theory and simulations of simultaneous chemical demixing and phase
   ordering are performed for a mixed order parameter system with an
   isotropic-isotropic (I-I) phase separation that is metastable with
   respect to an isotropic-nematic (I-N) phase-ordering transition. Under
   certain conditions, the disordered phase transforms into an ordered
   phase via the motion of a double front containing a metastable phase
   produced by I-I demixing, a thermodynamically driven mechanism not
   previously reported. Different kinetic regimes are found depending on
   the location of the initial conditions in the thermodynamic phase
   diagram and the ratio between diffusional and nematic phase-ordering
   mobilities. For a diffusional process, depending if the temperature is
   above or below the critical codissolution point, an inflection point or
   a phase separation takes place in the depletion layer. This phase
   separation leads to the formation of a second interface where the
   separation of the two metastable isotropic phases grows monotonically
   with time. The observed deviations from the typical Fickian
   concentration profiles are associated with strong positive deviations of
   the mixture from ideality due to couplings between concentration and
   nematic ordering. Although systems of interest include
   liquid-crystalline nanocomposites, this mechanism may apply to any
   mixture that can undergo an order-disorder transition and demix.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport phenomena mediate many aspects of the physiology and
   contrast agent-based clinical imaging of articular cartilage.
   Temperatures up to 10 degrees C below standard body temperature (37
   degrees C) are common in articulating joints during normal activities
   and clinically (e.g. cold treatment of injuries). Therefore it is of
   interest to characterize the effects of temperature changes on solute
   transport parameters in cartilage. A range of fluorescent solutes
   including fluorescein isothiocyanate, 4 and 40 kDa dextrans, myoglobin,
   insulin and chondroitin sulfate were prepared and used in assays of
   solute effective partition coefficient and effective diffusivity in
   bovine intermediate zone articular cartilage explants maintained at 10,
   22 or 37 degrees C. Trends for increasing partition coefficient with
   increasing temperature were evident for all solutes except chondroitin
   sulfate, with significant changes between 22 and 37 degrees C for 4 kDa
   dextran, insulin and myoglobin. Diffusivities of most solutes tested
   also tended to increase with increasing temperature, with significant
   changes between 10 and 22 degrees C for FITC, 40 kDa dextran and
   myoglobin. Oddly, insulin diffusivity decreased significantly as
   temperature increased from 22 to 37 degrees C while chondroitin sulfate
   diffusivity exhibited no clear temperature dependence. These results
   highlight solute-specific temperature dependences of transport phenomena
   which may depend upon molecular weight, chemical structure, molecular
   conformation, and solute-matrix and solute-solute interactions. The
   articular cartilage explants themselves exhibited small but significant
   changes in water and glycosaminoglycan contents during experiments,
   underscoring the importance of solute-matrix interactions. Solute
   transport parameters in cartilage and their temperature dependences are
   therefore not easily predicted, and case-by-case experimental
   determination may be essential. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{204-237}},

Abstract = {{The equations that govern, away from equilibrium and accounting for
   dissipation, the evolution of the contact line of an evaporating or
   condensing sessile drop on a rigid, planar substrate are derived. Aside
   from the normal and tangential components of the standard
   (\textbackslash{}Newtonian) force balance, these include a
   configurational force balance. At equilibrium, the normal component of
   the standard force balance reduces to the modified Young's equation
   first mentioned by Gibbs. The remaining balances are purely dissipative
   and hence are vacuous in equilibrium. A complete description of
   contact-line dynamics generally involves all three equations. The theory
   is embedded in a thermodynamic framework that ensures consistency of all
   constitutive relations with the second law. In the linearly dissipative
   case, these involve six contact-line viscosities. When viscous coupling
   is neglected, only three viscosities remain. One is associated with
   stretching of the fluid along the contact line. The remaining two are
   related to dissipation that accompanies mass transfer between liquid and
   vapour phases during evaporation or condensation.}},

Abstract = {{High crystalline quality, vertically aligned AlxGa1-xN nanowire
   heterostructures are grown on GaN nanowire templates on Si (111)
   substrates by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The nanowires

   the near-surface region. The emission wavelength can be varied across
   nearly the entire ultraviolet A (similar to 3.10-3.94 eV) and B (similar
   to 3.94-4.43 eV) spectral range by controlling the Al compositions. Such
   nanowire structures can exhibit extremely high internal quantum
   efficiency (up to similar to 58\%) at room-temperature, which is
   attributed to the superior carrier confinement offered by the core-shell
   structures and to the use of defect-free GaN nanowire templates. (C)

Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{We have modified single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with well
   defined matrix-based architectures to improve interface interaction in
   SWCNT/epoxy composites. The hardener and two pre-synthesized oligomers
   containing epoxy and hardener moieties were covalently attached to the
   SWCNT walls by in situ diazonium or carboxylic coupling reactions. In
   this way, SWCNTs bearing amine or epoxide-terminated fragments of
   different molecular weights, which resemble the chemical structure of
   the cured resin, were synthesized. A combination of characterization
   techniques such as Raman and infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy,
   elemental analysis and coupled thermogravimetry-FTIR spectroscopy were
   used to identify both the functional groups and degree of
   functionalization of SWCNTs synthesized by the laser ablation and
   arc-discharge methods. Depending on the type of reaction employed for
   the chemical functionalization and the molecular weight of the attached
   fragment, it was possible to control the degree of functionalization and
   the electronic properties of the functionalized SWCNTs. Improved
   dispersion of SWCNTs in the epoxy matrix was achieved by direct
   integration without using solvents, as observed from optical microscopy
   and rheology measurements of the SWCNT/epoxy mixtures. Composite
   materials using these fillers are expected to exhibit improved
   properties while preserving the thermosetting architecture.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Utilizing the coordinate transformation method, together with exchange
   of variables between Maxwell's equations and the acoustic equations with
   axial-invariance in cylindrical coordinates, the acoustic parameters
   (anisotropic density and scalar bulk modulus) for an ideal cloak and an
   ideal anti-cloak are obtained. An anti-cloak allows the inside object to
   `see' outside, but to be invisible from outside; whereas a cloak is
   invisible from outside, but `blind' from inside. Utilizing a scattering
   algorithm developed in this paper, the pressure field calculation of the
   cloak/anti-cloak is performed and the concepts and characteristics of
   the acoustic cloak/anti-cloak are revisited. To be more easily
   achievable experimentally, a multilayered cloak/anti-cloak model with
   homogeneous isotropic materials is introduced, and its corresponding
   pressure distributions are calculated. Also, the total scattering
   cross-section curves for the multilayered cloak and anti-cloak over a
   certain frequency range are presented and compared. Finally, an active
   acoustic metamaterial made up of piezo-diaphragm cavity arrays is
   designed for the cloak/anti-cloak. Taking into account the coupling
   between adjacent cavity cells, a multi-control strategy for
   piezo-diaphragm cavity arrays is exploited, rendering possible wide
   ranges of effective densities and effective bulk moduli (or acoustic
   speeds), or even double-negative transformation medium (i.e. both
   density and bulk modulus parameters are negative). With such sets of
   active acoustic metamaterials, the cloak and anti-cloak may become both
   theoretically and experimentally realizable.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy strategy
   for surface chemical analysis of materials. Our approach is based on the
   acquisition of photoelectron spectra at constant kinetic energies with
   the help of a tunable synchrotron X-radiation source. This ensures both
   constant and tunable information depth for all elements in a very thin
   organic layer. Many of the problems known to XPS depth profiling using
   laboratory equipment are thereby avoided. Using our methodology, the
   95\% information depth, z(95\%), can be tuned down to about 0.7 nm in
   organic materials. The upper limit in our study at the HE-SGM
   monochromator dipole magnet beamline at the synchrotron radiation source
   BESSY II is about 4.3 nm. Elemental quantification is achieved through
   relative sensitivity factors (RSF) specific to the measurement
   conditions, determined either with the help of calculated
   photoionization cross sections and inelastic mean free paths or
   experimentally. The potential of the technique is demonstrated for the
   in-depth analysis of plasma deposited nitrogen-rich organic thin films

   systems. ADDCE retrieves an estimation of the phase noise value after an
   initial decision making stage by extracting and averaging the phase
   drift of all OFDM sub-channels. Moreover, it updates the channel
   transfer matrix on a symbol-by-symbol basis. We experimentally compare
   the performance of the ADDCE and the conventional equalizer (CE)
   combined with maximum-likelihood (ML) phase noise compensation and
   inter-subcarrier-frequency-averaging (ISFA) algorithms. The study is
   conducted at 28 GBaud for RGI-DP-CO-OFDM systems with
   quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK) and 16 quadrature amplitude
   modulation (16-QAM) formats. Using ADDCE, zero-overhead laser phase
   noise compensation is accomplished and the overhead due to training
   symbol (TSs) insertion is significantly reduced. In addition, ADDCE
   offers a superior performance over the CE in the presence of
   synchronization timing errors and residual chromatic dispersion (CD). We
   also achieve a longer transmission distance than when using the CE. At a
   forward-error-correction (FEC) threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3), using a
   cumulative overhead of less than 2.6\%, transmission distances of 5500
   km and 400 km were achieved for the cases of QPSK and 16-QAM
   RGI-DP-CO-OFDM, respectively. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium-manganese, M1, alloy is preferred for extrusion applications
   due to its extrudability. It is mainly used as a sacrificial anode or as
   a creep resistant alloy at elevated temperatures in the nuclear
   industry. Since Mn does not provide a significant strengthening effect,
   the alloy is not considered for structural applications. The basal
   texture which forms after extrusion orients the basal planes parallel to
   the extrusion direction causing anisotropy in mechanical properties.
   This basal texture, as well as the low strength of the alloy are the
   main challenges in its widespread applications. In this study, the
   effect of Sr addition on the texture and mechanical properties of M1
   alloy was studied. M1-Sr alloys showed weakened texture by developing
   random texture components during extrusion. The texture randomisation is
   attributed to particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) around Mg-Sr
   intermetallics during recrystallisation. M1-Sr compositions are found to
   show improved strength and ductility as well as reduced yield asymmetry.

Abstract = {{Direct comparisons of different types of nanoparticles for drug delivery
   have seldom been performed. In this study we compare the physical
   properties and cellular activity of doxorubicin (Dox) conjugates to gold
   nanoparticles (Au) and InP quantum dots of comparable diameter. Although
   the Au particles alone are non-toxic and InP is moderately toxic, Au-Dox
   is more effective than InP-Dox against the Dox-resistant B16 melanoma
   cell line. Light exposure does not augment the efficacy of InP-Dox,
   suggesting that conjugates are breaking down. Electron and confocal
   microscopy and atomic absorption spectroscopy reveal that over 60\% of
   the Au-Dox conjugates reach the cell nucleus. In contrast, InP-Dox
   enters cell nuclei to a very limited extent, although liberated Dox from
   the conjugates does eventually reach the nucleus. These observations are
   attributed to faster Dox release from Au conjugates under endosomal
   conditions, greater aggregation of InP-Dox with cytoplasmic proteins,
   and adherence of InP to membranes. These findings have important
   implications for design of active drug-nanoparticle conjugates.}},

Abstract = {{Well-controlled laboratory column experiments were conducted to
   understand the influence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)
   biofilms on the transport of selected engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in
   granular porous media representative of groundwater aquifers or
   riverbank filtration settings. To understand the importance of particle
   size on retention in the biofilm-coated granular (quartz sand) matrix,
   column experiments were carried out using nanosized (20 nm) and
   micrometer-sized (1 mu m) sulfate-functionalized polystyrene latex
   particles (designated as 20nSL and I mSL, respectively). Additional
   experiments conducted with nanosized (20 nm) carboxyl-modified latex
   particles (20nCL) and carboxyl-modified CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs)
   provide information on the influence of particle surface chemistry on
   retention. Biofilm grown on the surface of the sand was characterized by
   total biomass quantification, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM),
   and electrokinetic analysis. All four particles exhibit increased
   retention in the biofilm-coated packed bed: e.g., the attachment
   efficiency (alpha) of the 1mSL particle increases from 0.40 to 1.7,
   whereas alpha for the 20nSL particle increases from 0.04 to 0.10 in the
   biofilm-coated system. Particle surface chemistry can also influence the
   affinity of the ENPs for the biofilm coating as revealed by the greater
   attachment of the 20nSL particle onto the biofilm-coated sand (alpha =
   0.10) than its carboxylated counterpart (alpha = 0.04). Column
   experiments conducted using sand coated with growth medium (LB) or
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) extracted from P. aeruginosa
   biofilms further reveal that particle surface chemistry influences the
   interaction between the different ENPs and these coated sand surfaces.
   Namely, coating of sand surfaces with LB medium or bacterial EPS does
   not affect the transport of the sulfonated nanoparticle, but the LB
   coating leads to decreased retention of the carboxylated latex
   nanoparticle. Furthermore, our results show that EPS coatings are not
   necessarily good surrogates for biofilm-coated sand. Electrokinetic
   characterization of the clean and coated sand surfaces also reveals that
   the extent of particle retention is not controlled by electrical double
   layer interactions. Future studies should thus be aimed at improving our
   understanding of the fundamental mechanisms (both colloidal and
   noncolloidal) governing nanoparticle transport and fate in biofilm-laden
   granular aquatic environments.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) solid films derived from spruce pulp
   exhibit iridescence when cast from chiral nematic aqueous phase
   suspensions of the nanocrystals. The iridescence has potential for overt
   encryption as an anti-counterfeiting measure and also offers an
   intrinsic level of covert encryption since films of NCC reflect
   left-circularly polarized light. Addition of TINOPAL, an optical
   brightening agent (OBA), adds a third level of (covert) encryption
   potential since the chromophore exhibits strong fluorescence when
   excited with ultraviolet (UV) light. The overall result is a selectively
   polarizing fluorescent iridescent film. We examined the impact of
   additions of OBA on NCC iridescence, optical activity, and physical
   structure variation with polarized optical microscopy, circular
   dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry, and zeta potential analysis.
   Increasing OBA additions increase the chiral nematic pitch of NCC films
   and alter chiral nematic domain structure in the solid film. Under
   low-concentration conditions, OBA yields intense UV fluorescence without
   compromising the visible light iridescent properties of the film. The
   potential security offered by the NCC film can be authenticated using a
   UV light source, a circular polarizer in conjunction with an iridescent
   feature that can be verified by the eye or by chiral spectrometry. (c)
