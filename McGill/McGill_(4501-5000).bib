Abstract = {{We experimentally investigate the performance of a low-complexity
   non-iterative phase noise induced inter-carrier interference (ICI)
   compensation algorithm in reduced-guard-interval dual-polarization
   coherent-optical orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing
   (RGI-DP-CO-OFDM) transport systems. This interpolation-based ICI
   compensator estimates the time-domain phase noise samples by a linear
   interpolation between the CPE estimates of the consecutive OFDM symbols.
   We experimentally study the performance of this scheme for a 28 Gbaud
   QPSK RGI-DP-CO-OFDM employing a low cost distributed feedback (DFB)
   laser. Experimental results using a DFB laser with the linewidth of 2.6
   MHz demonstrate 24\% and 13\% improvement in transmission reach with
   respect to the conventional equalizer (CE) in presence of weak and
   strong dispersion-enhanced-phase-noise (DEPN), respectively. A brief
   analysis of the computational complexity of this scheme in terms of the
   number of required complex multiplications is provided. This practical
   approach does not suffer from error propagation while enjoying low
   computational complexity. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The optimal design of production phases and ultimate pit limit for an
   open pit mining operation may be generated using conventional or
   stochastic approaches. Unlike the conventional approach, the stochastic
   framework accounts for expected variability and uncertainty in metal
   content by considering a set of equally probable realizations (models)
   of the orebody. This paper evaluates the performance of a new stochastic
   network flow approach for the development of optimal phase design and
   ultimate pit limit using a gold deposit as the case study. The
   stochastic and conventional frameworks as considered here utilize the
   maximum flow and Lerchs-Grossman (LG) algorithms, respectively. The LG
   algorithm is restricted to considering an estimated (average-type)
   orebody model, while the stochastic maximum flow algorithm is developed
   to simultaneously use a set of simulated orebody realizations as an
   input. The case study demonstrates that, when compared to the
   conventional LG algorithm as used in the industry, the stochastic
   approach generates a 30 per cent increase in discounted cash flow, a 21
   per cent larger ultimate pit limit, and about 7 per cent more metal,
   while it maintains a consistency in phase size.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancement of endogenous bone regeneration is a priority for
   integration of joint replacement hardware with host bone for stable
   fixation of the prosthesis. Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) 18 regulates
   skeletal development and could therefore have applications for bone
   regeneration and skeletal repair. This study was designed to determine
   if treatment with FGF 18 would promote bone regeneration and integration
   of orthopedic hardware in FGF receptor 3 deficient (FGFR3(-/-)) mice,
   previously characterized with impaired bone formation. Rigid nylon rods
   coated with 200 nm of titanium were implanted bilaterally in the femora
   of adult FGFR3(-/-) and FGFR3(+/+) mice to mimic human orthopedic
   hardware. At the time of surgery, LEFT femora received an intramedullary
   injection of 0.5 mu g FGF18 (Merck Serono) and RIGHT femora received PBS
   as a control. Treatment with FGF18 resulted in a significant increase in
   peri-implant bone formation in both FGFR3(+/+) and FGFR3(-/-) mice, with
   the peri-implant fibrous tissue frequently seen in FGFR3(-/-) mice being
   largely replaced by bone. The results of this pre-clinical study support
   the conjecture that FGF18 could be used in the clinical setting to
   promote integration of orthopedic hardware in poor quality bone.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a truly unsteady approach for the numerical
   simulation of in-flight electrothermal anti-icing or de-icing, using a
   conjugate heat transfer technique. This numerical approach has been
   implemented in FENSAP-ICE to compute the complex heat transfer phenomena
   occurring during in-flight de-icing with multiple heating elements
   following independent cycling. At each time step, the energy fluxes
   through the aircraft's solid skin, the melting ice layer, the liquid
   water film, and the external fluid are computed. The ice shape is then
   modified by taking into account the opposing mass balance effects of ice
   accreting due to the impact of supercooled droplets and/or water
   runback, and the partial or total melting of the existing ice layer due
   to heating. The results of the verification of this phase-change
   conduction code are presented, followed by a study of intercycle
   de-icing on a wing, showing intercycle ice growth.}},

   that this approach is capable of refining the Si eutectic phase to a
   fibrous morphology, due to the solidification front velocity exceeding
   the transitional value of 0.9 mm s(-1). The hardness was found constant
   throughout the height of the freeformed component (70 HV). The bending
   strength was measured to be similar to as cast components, 388 +/- 35
   MPa for the freeform versus 357 +/- 11 MPa for the as cast, but the
   ductility was doubled, from 9 +/- 1\% to 18 +/- 2\%, and was associated

   the surface of the ESD were similar in evolution and nature to the scale
   produced on the substrates, but the thickening was found to be

   the surface created by the small grain size of the ESD deposit.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular cardiomyoplasty employs stem cell therapy to regenerate
   myocardium. Characterized by their potential for proliferation,
   differentiation and capacity for self-renewal, stem cells are ideally
   suited for use in regenerative medicine. Supplementing traditional
   therapeutic modalities aimed at the palliation of congestive heart
   failure, cellular cardiomyoplasty is an innovative approach aimed at
   producing functional, viable myocardium following an acute infarction.
   The primary focus is to prevent the onset of congestive heart failure;
   however, potential applications aimed at reversing ischemic heart
   disease are concurrently in development. After decades of research,
   cellular cardiomyoplasty has moved beyond traditional in vitro and
   animal models; it is currently being implemented in clinical trials.
   Despite this monumental advance, certain limitations remain inherent in
   this process, preventing stem cell therapy from reaching its full
   potential. On a cellular level, stem cell retention and viability
   postimplantation continues to be problematic. Solutions under
   investigation include pioneering advances in cell delivery, in vitro
   pretreatment, and tissue engineering. Moreover, questions surrounding
   optimal cell type and cellular mechanisms concerning cellular
   cardiomyoplasty remain unanswered. Clarification of these issues is
   essential to ensure continued progression of this new technology. Stem
   cell therapy has been highly successful within the in vitro and in vivo
   environment. However, as clinical trials abound, cellular
   cardiomyoplasty must transition from an experimental concept to an
   effective therapeutic treatment. This process is hindered by discordance
   between scientific accrue and practical applicability. This review will
   provide a comprehensive summary of current innovations on cellular
   cardiomyoplasty, and future prospects. There will be a particular
   emphasis on the clinical aspects of stem cell therapy in an attempt to
   bridge the gap between science and medicine. Overcoming this barrier
   will render cellular cardiomyoplasty accessible to patients on a global
   basis.}},

   applicability for runoff forecasting in these areas. In light of this,
   accurate forecasting methods that do not necessitate extensive data sets
   are required for runoff forecasting in mountainous watersheds. In this
   study, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), wavelet transform
   artificial neural network (WA-ANN), and regular artificial neural
   network (ANN) models were developed and compared for runoff forecasting
   applications in the mountainous watershed of Sainji in the Himalayas, an
   area with limited data for runoff forecasting. To develop and test the
   models, three micro-watersheds were gauged in the Sainji watershed in
   Uttaranchal State in India and data were recorded from July 1 2001 to
   June 30 2003. It was determined that the best WA-ANN and MARS models
   were comparable in terms of forecasting accuracy, with both providing
   very accurate runoff forecasts compared to the best ANN model. The
   results indicate that the WA-ANN and MARS methods are promising new
   methods of short-term runoff forecasting in mountainous watersheds with
   limited data, and warrant additional study.}},

Abstract = {{A neural network based on dynamic neural units has the capability to
   handle any type of nonlinearity. In addition, it can adapt itself to
   parameter changes in real time. In this paper, such a dynamic neural
   network is used to design a controller through inverse modeling to
   address the attitude control of an Earth-pointing magnetically actuated
   spacecraft. Furthermore, normalization of weights of the dynamic neural
   units is proposed to ensure their convergence for proper learning. The
   dynamic neural controller developed in this paper, being adaptive, not
   only takes care of any unknown disturbance torques, but it is also
   robust and can adapt itself if there are any large changes in the
   parameters in the plant, such as the moments of inertia. It is shown,
   that the stabilization accuracy of the plant is better under the
   proposed neural controller as compared with a proportional-derivate
   controller. Proof of stability, for the dynamic neural units and the
   system as a whole, is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{The sheet resistance of graphene has been recently reduced below the
   level of previous optically transparent conductive materials, making
   graphene, with its additional advantage of mechanical flexibility, the
   best candidate for future transparent electronics. We investigate here
   the viability of microwave planar components using graphene sheets as
   conductors towards optically transparent and flexible radio systems.
   Specifically, we study the waveguiding and nonreciprocal properties of
   such components, through the arbitrary example of a coplanar waveguide
   (CPW) structure, using the 2-D finite difference frequency domain (FDFD)
   technique. It is shown that reciprocal graphene-based components of
   acceptably low loss levels are achievable using graphene sheets of the
   lowest available resistivity, while nonreciprocal components with
   graphene conductors still exhibit prohibitive loss due to a fundamental
   trade-off between nonreciprocity and carrier density in graphene.}},

   Neurophysiol 108: 39-56, 2012. First published March 28, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/jn.01092.2011.-Humans routinely use coordinated eye-head
   gaze saccades to rapidly and accurately redirect the line of sight (Land
   MF. Vis Neurosci 26: 51-62, 2009). With a fixed body, the gaze control
   system combines visual, vestibular, and neck proprioceptive sensory
   information and coordinates two moving platforms, the eyes and head.
   Classic engineering tools have investigated the structure of motor
   systems by testing their ability to compensate for perturbations. When a
   reaching movement of the hand is subjected to an unexpected force field
   of random direction and strength, the trajectory is deviated and its
   final position is inaccurate. Here, we found that the gaze control
   system behaves differently. We perturbed horizontal gaze shifts with
   long-duration torques applied to the head that unpredictably either
   assisted or opposed head motion and very significantly altered the
   intended head trajectory. We found, as others have with brief head
   perturbations, that gaze accuracy was preserved. Unexpectedly, we found
   also that the eye compensated well-with saccadic and rollback
   movements-for long-duration head perturbations such that resulting gaze
   trajectories remained close to that when the head was not perturbed.
   However, the ocular compensation was best when torques assisted,
   compared with opposed, head motion. If the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR)
   is suppressed during gaze shifts, as currently thought, what caused
   invariant gaze trajectories and accuracy, early eye-direction reversals,
   and asymmetric compensations? We propose three mechanisms: a gaze
   feedback loop that generates a gaze-position error signal; a
   vestibular-to-oculomotor signal that dissociates self-generated from
   passively imposed head motion; and a saturation element that limits
   orbital eye excursion.}},

   releasing a strained semiconductor bilayer and are picked up by abruptly

   embedded in the tube structure, these microtubes show dynamical thermal
   effects at wavelengths around 1525 nm and 1578 nm, while they are
   passive at longer wavelengths near 1634 nm. The photon absorption
   induced thermal effect is visualized by generating a pair of

   for passive or active applications by utilizing appropriate resonance

Abstract = {{Flaxseed extracts obtained by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) were
   cleaned of leftover salts from hydrolysis by solid phase extraction
   (SPE). The SPE set up was affordable, non-automated and vacuum-driven.
   The recovery patterns of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG),
   p-coumaric acid glucoside (PCouAG), and ferulic acid glucoside (FerAG)
   were modeled in two stages using regression procedures (p<0.05). At
   stage one, the recovery patterns were predicted as a function of SPE
   eluent concentration in ethanol (10-50\%). At stage two, the accuracy of
   the predictions was increased by enlarging the SPE eluent regressor's
   range (0-100\% ethanol in water) and arranging the solvent system into
   three practical elution groups. The groups 1, 2 and 3 reflected the
   major loss, the major recovery and the minor loss of SDG, respectively.
   Second degree polynomial regression models were fitted for accurately
   predicting the recoveries of compounds. Microwave-assisted extracts
   obtained from 0.6 and 1.5 g defatted flaxseed meal were purified; the
   total SDG recoveries from the SPE funnel were 97.8 and 99.8\%; and the
   SDG amounts obtained were 8.54 and 20 mg, respectively. The HPLC
   analysis of eluates pooled into practical groups allows for significant
   reductions in HPLC analysis time and solvent consumption which could
   have a positive impact on future purification studies. The results of
   this study allow for designing simplified, efficient and economical
   pilot scale studies for the purification of SDG from flaxseed extracts.

Abstract = {{We study a class of linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problems
   with decision makers, where the basic objective is to minimize a social
   cost as the sum of individual costs containing mean field coupling. The
   exact socially optimal solution (determining a particular Pareto
   optimum) requires centralized information for each agent and has high
   implementational complexity. As an alternative we subsequently exploit a
   mean field structure in the centralized optimal control problem to
   develop decentralized cooperative optimization so that each agent only
   uses its own state and a function which may be computed offline; the
   resulting set of strategies asymptotically achieves the social optimum
   as. A key feature in this scheme is to let each agent optimize a new
   cost as the sum of its own cost and another component capturing its
   social impact on all other agents. We also discuss the relationship
   between the decentralized cooperative solution and the so-called Nash
   Certainty Equivalence based solution presented in previous work on mean
   field LQG games.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the concept of a dc transmission controller
   integrated in a multiterminal HVDC system. The controller is based on a
   thyristor-based converter topology and it is inserted in series on a dc
   transmission line. A three-terminal voltage-source connverter-based dc
   grid is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC to demonstrate the operation and the
   stability of such a system. Simulation test cases include terminal loss
   and bidirectional ability of the thyristor power-flow controller. It is
   concluded that such a controller enhanced the performance and
   controllability of a dc grid.}},

Abstract = {{The use of heavy gauge steel sheets for structural applications often
   requires a combination of high yield strength and adequate toughness.
   The most cost effective way to achieve high yield strength and high
   ductility in low alloyed steels is through grain refinement. In
   industrial practice, such refinement is commonly obtained by
   thermomechanical controlled processing (TMCP). This approach comprises
   slab reheating to well defined temperatures, a large amount of hot
   deformation below the non-recrystallisation temperature T-nr and
   accelerated cooling. In practice, the T-nr is generally raised by the
   addition of microalloying elements such as Nb and Ti. As these elements
   contribute substantially to the alloying costs, optimisation of their
   use allows for a decrease in production cost. Better understanding of
   the T-nr assists in tuning the rolling process so that optimum
   mechanical properties can be produced. One area of importance is to
   recognise that the concept of the T-nr was originally developed for
   reversing mills and the production of plate steels. Methods of defining
   and determining it must be modified if it is to be applied to strip
   mills and their associated short interpass times. The main goal of this
   review is to provide a concise and complete overview of the current
   understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control the T-nr and to
   address the different methods that can be used to determine it.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We consider the problem of channel estimation for amplify-and-forward
   (AF) two-way relay networks (TWRNs). Most works on this problem focus on
   pilot-based approaches which impose a significant training overhead that
   reduces the spectral efficiency of the system. To avoid such losses, we
   propose blind channel estimation algorithms for AF TWRNs that employ
   constant-modulus (CM) signaling. Our main algorithm is based on the
   deterministic maximum likelihood (DML) approach. Assuming M-PSK
   modulation, we show that the resulting estimator is consistent and
   approaches the true channel with high probability at high SNR for
   modulation orders higher than 2. For BPSK, however, the DML algorithm
   performs poorly and we propose an alternative algorithm that yields much
   better performance by taking into account the BPSK structure of the data
   symbols. For comparative purposes, we also investigate the Gaussian
   maximum-likelihood (GML) approach which treats the data symbols as
   Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameters. We derive the Cramer-Rao bound
   and use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the mean squared error
   (MSE) performance of the proposed algorithms. We also compare the
   symbol-error rate (SER) performance of the DML algorithm with that of
   the training-based least-squares (LS) algorithm and demonstrate that the
   DML offers a superior tradeoff between accuracy and spectral efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple description coding (MDC) was originally developed to combat
   channel failures and packet losses. For the particular case of
   fixed-rate scalar quantization, it has been shown that the multiple
   description scalar quantizer (MDSQ) can be made robust to binary
   transmission errors, through a proper binary labelling of the indices
   transmitted in each description. The design of this so-called index
   assignment (IA) is computationally very demanding, especially for
   systems with large redundancy or high bit rates. In this paper, we
   propose an alternative low-complexity IA design for this problem. For
   low redundancy, this new design provides results that are close to
   optimum (in the sense of minimizing the side distortions for a given
   central distortion), while maintaining the robustness to transmission
   errors and being amenable to designing systems with large redundancy or
   high bit rates. For high redundancy, the proposed design provides high
   robustness while allowing for successive decoding of different signal
   qualities. Thus, it can be applied for the case of progressive
   quantization and transmission. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Relaying communications has been proposed as a way to provide spatial

   achieve the maximal diversity order with a low system complexity. One
   enabling technique is equal gain combining (EGC) and its application in
   relaying systems is the main focus of this paper. In particular, the
   techniques of EGC and smart relaying are combined in the
   decode-and-forward (DF) processing method. It is shown that for a system
   with one relay and M-ary phase-shift-keying (M-PSK) modulation, maximal
   diversity orders of 2m and 2 are achieved over Nakagami-m and Hoyt
   fading environments, respectively. With K relays, simulation results

Abstract = {{In the High Arctic, groundwater fluxes are limited by the presence of
   continuous permafrost, although it has been hypothesized that there may
   be localized groundwater flow and hydraulic connectivity beneath large
   lakes, due to the presence of taliks, or large regions of unfrozen
   ground. However, due to the logistical difficulty of employing seepage
   meters and piezometers in deep, ice-covered lakes, relatively little is
   known about groundwater discharge to polar lakes. One method of
   assessing groundwater discharge is through the use of geochemical
   tracers. We conducted a pilot study to quantify groundwater discharge
   into a High Arctic lake using dissolved radon gas as a geochemical
   tracer. Lake water was collected in 15 L polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags
   with minimal atmospheric interaction from a 25-m deep lake near
   Shellabear Point, Melville Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. Sample
   bags were aerated through a closed water loop for 60 min to allow
   sufficient radon to equilibrate in a coupled air circuit. Radon in air
   concentrations were measured on a Durridge RAD7 portable alpha
   spectrometer. The field trial in a remote setting and separate tests
   with groundwater samples collected from a temperate site demonstrate the
   utility of the methodology. The limited results suggest that radon
   levels in the lower water column are elevated above background levels
   following nival melt in the surrounding watershed. Although these
   results are insufficient to quantify groundwater discharge, the results
   suggest subsurface flow may exist, and further study is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{We study the capacity of discrete memoryless channels with
   synchronization errors and additive noise. We first show that with very
   large alphabets, their capacity can be achieved by independent and
   identically distributed input sources, and establish proven tight lower
   and upper capacity bounds. We also derive tight numerical capacity
   bounds for channels where the synchronization between the input and
   output is partly preserved, for instance using incorruptible
   synchronization markers. Such channels include channels with duplication
   errors, channels that only insert or delete zeros, and channels with
   bitshift errors studied in magnetic recording. Channels with small
   alphabets and corrupted by synchronization errors have an infinite
   memory. Revisiting the theoretical work of Dobrushin and adapting
   techniques used to compute capacity bounds for finite-state
   source/channel models, we compute improved numerical capacity lower
   bounds for discrete memoryless channels with small alphabets,
   synchronization errors, and memoryless noise. An interesting and
   somewhat surprising result is that as long as the input sequences are
   not completely deleted, the capacity of channels corrupted by discrete
   timing errors is always nonzero even if all the symbols are corrupted.}},

   traditional definition is pessimistic. In the presence of feedback, an
   opportunistic definition is given. Capacity is defined as the maximum
   rate that is determined at the end of communication such that
   communication is reliable. Thus, the transmission rate can adapt to the
   realized channel. Under this definition, feedback communication over a
   compound channel is conceptually similar to multiterminal communication.
   Transmission rate is a vector rather than a scalar; channel capacity is
   a region rather than a scalar; error exponent is a region rather than a
   scalar. In this paper, variable length communication over a compound
   channel with feedback is formulated, its opportunistic capacity region
   is characterized, and lower bounds for its error exponent region are
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{For a binary linear code, the pseudocodeword redundancy with respect to
   the additive white Gaussian noise channel, the binary symmetric channel,
   or the max-fractional weight is defined to be the smallest number of
   rows in a parity-check matrix such that the corresponding minimum
   pseudoweight is equal to the minimum Hamming distance of the code. It is
   shown that most codes do not have a finite pseudocodeword redundancy.
   Also, upper bounds on the pseudocodeword redundancy for some families of
   codes, including codes based on designs, are provided. The
   pseudocodeword redundancies for all codes of small length (at most 9)
   are computed. Furthermore, comprehensive results are provided on the
   cases of cyclic codes of length at most 250 for which the eigenvalue

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Selenium removal from aqueous solutions can be a significant
   industrial problem, particularly in the metallurgical industry. In order
   to evaluate new reducing agents for this application, the reduction of
   selenious acid (H2SeO3) species with stannous ions (Sn2+) from weakly
   acidic sulfate solutions containing 300 mg L-1 of selenium at 23 degrees
   C was studied. RESULTS: At initial pH values < 1.3 and molar ratio = 2,
   less than 0.5 mu g L-1 of selenium(IV) remained in solution after
   reduction. The reductive precipitation reaction started as soon as the
   stannous ions were added to the selenium-bearing solution and was
   completed in less than 5 min. The reaction products, characterized using
   X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, particle and surface area
   measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and chemical analysis,
   were composed of approximately equal amounts of tin selenide and tin
   dioxide. In addition to tin selenide a minor amount of selenium(IV) was
   found to be removed via adsorption on the tin dioxide formed in situ.
   Tests with a complex industrial solution also resulted in full and
   stable selenium precipitation. CONCLUSION: Stannous ions were found to
   be very effective in removing selenious ions from synthetic and
   industrial solutions, producing very stable precipitates. Copyright (c)

Title = {{Solubilization and Bio-conjugation of Quantum Dots and Bacterial
   Toxicity Assays by Growth Curve and Plate Count}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{65}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) are fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles with
   size-dependent emission spectra that can be excited by a broad choice of
   wavelengths. QDs have attracted a lot of interest for imaging,
   diagnostics, and therapy due to their bright, stable fluorescence(1,2
   3,4,5). QDs can be conjugated to a variety of bio-active molecules for
   binding to bacteria and mammalian cells(6).
   QDs are also being widely investigated as cytotoxic agents for targeted
   killing of bacteria. The emergence of multiply-resistant bacterial
   strains is rapidly becoming a public health crisis, particularly in the
   case of Gram negative pathogens(7). Because of the well-known
   antimicrobial effect of certain nanomaterials, especially Ag, there are
   hundreds of studies examining the toxicity of nanoparticles to
   bacteria(8). Bacterial studies have been performed with other types of
   semiconductor nanoparticles as well, especially TiO29,10-11, but also
   ZnO12 and others including CuO13. Some comparisons of bacterial strains
   have been performed in these studies, usually comparing a Gram negative
   strain with a Gram positive. With all of these particles, mechanisms of
   toxicity are attributed to oxidation: either the photogeneration of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the particles or the direct release of
   metal ions that can cause oxidative toxicity. Even with these materials,
   results of different studies vary greatly. In some studies the Gram
   positive test strain is reportedly more sensitive than the Gram
   negative(10); in others it is the opposite(14). These studies have been
   well reviewed(15).
   In all nanoparticle studies, particle composition, size, surface
   chemistry, sample aging/breakdown, and wavelength, power, and duration
   of light exposure can all dramatically affect the results. In addition,
   synthesis byproducts and solvents must be considered(16 17).
   High-throughput screening techniques are needed to be able to develop
   effective new nanomedicine agents.
   CdTe QDs have anti-microbial effects alone(18) or in combination with
   antibiotics. In a previous study, we showed that coupling of antibiotics
   to CdTe can increase toxicity to bacteria but decrease toxicity to
   mammalian cells, due to decreased production of reactive oxygen species
   from the conjugates(19). Although it is unlikely that cadmium-containing
   compounds will be approved for use in humans, such preparations could be
   used for disinfection of surfaces or sterilization of water.
   In this protocol, we give a straightforward approach to solubilizing
   CdTe QDs with mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The QDs are ready to use
   within an hour. We then demonstrate coupling to an antimicrobial agent.
   The second part of the protocol demonstrates a 96-well bacterial
   inhibition assay using the conjugated and unconjugated QDs. The optical
   density is read over many hours, permitting the effects of QD addition
   and light exposure to be evaluated immediately as well as after a
   recovery period. We also illustrate a colony count for quantifying
   bacterial survival.}},

Abstract = {{A variable stiffness design can increase the structural performance of a
   composite plate and provides flexibility for trade-offs between
   structural properties. In this paper, we examine the simultaneous
   optimization of stiffness and buckling load of a composite laminate
   plate with curvilinear fiber paths. The problem, which falls in the area
   of multi-objective optimization, is formulated and solved through a
   surrogate-based optimization algorithm capable of finding the set of
   optimum Pareto solutions. We integrate surrogate modeling into an
   evolutionary algorithm to reduce the high computational cost required to
   solve the optimization process. The results show that a curvilinear
   fiber path can increase both buckling load and stiffness simultaneously
   over the quasi-isotropic laminate. Furthermore, the optimum direction
   for varying the fiber angle is dependent on the loading direction and
   boundary conditions. The results for a plate under uniform compression
   with free transverse edges shows that varying the fiber orientation
   perpendicular to the loading direction can increase the buckling load by
   116\% with respect to that of a quasi-isotropic laminate. (c) 2012

Title = {{Film flow for power-law fluids: Modeling and linear stability}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS B-FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{70-84}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{The paper deals with modeling of a power-law fluid film flowing down an
   inclined plane for small to moderate Reynolds numbers. A model, accurate
   up to second order {[}first order] for dilatant {[}pseudoplastic] fluids
   is proposed to describe the nonlinear behavior of the flow. The modeling
   procedure consists of a combination of the lubrication theory and the
   weighted residual approach using an appropriate projection basis. A
   suitable choice of weighting functions allows a significant reduction of
   the dimension of the problem. The resulting model is naturally unique,
   i.e., independent of the particular form of the trial functions. Reduced
   models are proposed for the evolution of the local film thickness and
   flow rate; their linear spectra are compared to that obtained from the
   full Orr-Sommerfeld numerical solution. To obtain the latter, a new
   formulation of the eigenvalue problem is proposed to overcome the
   classical divergence of the apparent viscosity at the free surface. The
   full model and its reduced forms all have the advantage of the Benney
   like model close to criticality. Far from the instability threshold the
   full model continues to follow the Orr-Sommerfeld solution up to
   sufficiently large Reynolds numbers and gives better predictions than
   the depth averaging model. An incomplete regularization procedure is
   performed to cure the rapid divergence of the reduced two-equation
   model. Due to its relative simplicity the latter might be preferred in
   practice to the full model, at least at the initial stage of the
   nonlinear regime. It is also shown that the convective nature of the
   instability is not affected by the variation of the power law index. (C)

Abstract = {{The forced non-linear vibrations of an axially moving beam fitted with

   The equation of motion is obtained via Hamilton's principle and
   constitutive relations. This equation is then discretized via the
   Galerkin method using the eigenfunctions of a hinged-hinged beam as
   appropriate basis functions. The resultant non-linear ordinary
   differential equations are then solved via either the pseudo-arclength
   continuation technique or direct time integration. The sub-critical
   response is examined when the excitation frequency is set near the first
   natural frequency for both the systems with and without internal
   resonances. Bifurcation diagrams of Poincar, maps obtained from direct
   time integration are presented as either the forcing amplitude or the
   axial speed is varied; as we shall see, a sequence of higher-order
   bifurcations ensues, involving periodic, quasi-periodic,

Abstract = {{Nano-encapsulation of catechin (CAT) with beta-cyclodextrin (BCD) at 1:1
   ratio resulted in the production of nano-encapsulated powder (BCD + CAT)
   by molecular inclusion method. The interactions between CAT and BCD were
   analyzed by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Raman laser
   spectroscopy (RLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray
   diffractometer (XRD). The results obtained strongly confirmed supra
   molecular complex formation. DSC thermograph obtained for
   nano-encapsulated powder resulted in the appearance of new endothermic
   melting peak at 250 degrees C with complete disappearance of peaks at
   100, 150 and 200 degrees C present in catechin and beta-cyclodextrin
   indicating the inclusion complex formation which was also confirmed by
   spectral characterization (RLS). Particles ranging from 67 to 470 nm
   were obtained by SEM micrographs. Structural characterization by XRD at
   20 angle from 0 degrees to 80 degrees for nano-encapsulated powder
   indicated change of state from crystalline to amorphous phase with
   average particle size of 518.78 nm. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The microstructure and texture evolution in the Mg-2.9Y and Mg-2.9Zn
   solid solution alloys were investigated following rolling and subsequent
   isothermal annealing. The Mg-2.9Y alloy was hot rolled, and the Mg-2.9Zn
   alloy was rolled at room temperature in order to evaluate the
   possibility of attaining texture weakening by the suppression of dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) and promotion of static recrystallization (SRX).
   It was found that texture weakening can be attained in Mg even in the
   absence of Y when there is no DRX, and SRX occurs during annealing. In
   solid solution, Y suppresses DRX during hot rolling, and retards the
   kinetics of SRX and grain coarsening in Mg. In the two alloys, the
   orientation of statically recrystallized grains at bands/twins (TSRX
   grains) is close to that of double and compression twins, exhibiting a
   much more evenly distributed and slightly wider orientation than that of
   basal parent grains and twins. In both Mg-2.9Zn and Mg-2.9Y alloys, a
   continuous texture weakening is observed with the progress of SRX, which
   results in a bimodal microstructure consisting of small TSRX grains and
   larger ones. With the increase in grain size during coarsening, the
   maximum intensity of basal pole figures rises linearly, with the slope
   of the lines being nearly identical in the two alloys. This texture
   strengthening was ascribed to the consumption of small TSRX grains by
   larger ones.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the effect of slag composition during the RH

   refractories were immersed for 10 min at 1600 degrees C in a ladle slag,
   two FeO-rich slags (20 and 40 wt\% FeO) and two CaO-Al2O3 slags.
   Corrosion of magnesia carbon refractory by the ladle and CaO-Al2O3 slags
   was limited as the refractory carbon phase efficiently prevented slag
   infiltration. Severe degradation was observed in contact with FeO-rich
   slags. FeO oxidized the carbon phase with formation of Fe droplets at
   the hot face. Regarding magnesia-chromite refractory, the corrosion
   mechanism consisted of severe slag infiltration, high temperature
   inactivation of the secondary chromite and primary chromite dissolution
   in the infiltrating slag. The FeO-rich slags seem to have generated more
   severe conditions as the infiltrating slag pushed apart the periclase
   grains, leading to severe refractory erosion. The degradation mechanisms
   are discussed by combining experimental results and thermodynamic
   calculations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal and physical properties of Detarium microcarpum seed flour, were
   studied. Thermophysical properties such as apparent density, bulk
   density, porosity and water activity of dry ground powder of the sample
   were determined and found to be 1.79 g/cm(3), 0.44 g/cm(3), 75.51\% and
   0.549, respectively. The Brix of the aqueous solutions of the sample
   ranged from 1.45 to 4.00 degrees Bx. Thermal properties studied include
   glass transition (T-g), which varied from -74.9 to -73.2 degrees C for
   the aqueous solutions of the sample and showed two midpoints at 11.2 and
   59 degrees C for the dry powdered D. microcarpum. Heat capacity of the
   aqueous solutions of the sample ranged from 1.79 to 18.83 J/g degrees C,
   while dry sample heat capacity was from 0.81 to 1.79 J/g degrees C.
   There was significant effect (P < 0.05) of heating temperature and
   sample concentration on the variation observed in heat capacity. The
   glass transition temperature and specific heat capacity also varied
   significantly (P < 0.05). A nonlinear regression model provided a good
   fit of the specific heat capacity data from 5 degrees C upward for the
   aqueous media, while dry sample data gave a good fit with a linear
   relationship with temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A latent class modeling approach for identifying vehicle driver injury
   severity factors at highway-railway crossings}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{119-127}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we aim to identify the different factors that influence
   injury severity of highway vehicle occupants, in particular drivers,
   involved in a vehicle-train collision at highway-railway grade
   crossings. The commonly used approach to modeling vehicle occupant
   injury severity is the traditional ordered response model that assumes
   the effect of various exogenous factors on injury severity to be
   constant across all accidents. The current research effort attempts to
   address this issue by applying an innovative latent segmentation based
   ordered logit model to evaluate the effects of various factors on the
   injury severity of vehicle drivers. In this model, the highway-railway
   crossings are assigned probabilistically to different segments based on
   their attributes with a separate injury severity component for each
   segment. The validity and strength of the formulated collision
   consequence model is tested using the US Federal Railroad Administration
   database which includes inventory data of all the railroad crossings in
   the US and collision data at these highway railway crossings from 1997
   to 2006. The model estimation results clearly highlight the existence of
   risk segmentation within the affected grade crossing population by the
   presence of active warning devices, presence of permanent structure near
   the crossing and roadway type. The key factors influencing injury
   severity include driver age, time of the accident, presence of snow
   and/or rain, vehicle role in the crash and motorist action prior to the
   crash. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoblast differentiation is regulated by the presence of collagen type
   I (COL I) extracellular matrix (ECM). We have recently demonstrated that
   Factor XIIIA (FXIIIA) transglutaminase (TG) is required by osteoblasts
   for COL I secretion and extracellular deposition, and thus also for
   osteoblast differentiation. In this study we have further investigated
   the link between COL I and FXIIIA, and demonstrate that COL I matrix
   increases FXIIIA levels in osteoblast cultures and that FXIIIA is found
   as cellular (cFXIIIA) and extacellular matrix (ecmFXIIIA) forms. FXIIIA
   mRNA, protein expression, cellular localization and secretion were
   enhanced by ascorbic acid (AA) treatment and blocked by dihydroxyproline
   (DHP) which inhibits COL I externalization. FXIIIA mRNA was regulated by
   the MAP kinase pathway. Secretion of ecmFXIIIA, and its enzymatic
   activity in conditioned medium, were also decreased in osteoblasts
   treated with the lysyl oxidase inhibitor beta-aminopropionitrile, which
   resulted in a loosely packed COL I matrix. Osteoblasts secrete a latent,
   inactive dimeric ecmFXIIIA form which is activated upon binding to the
   matrix. Monodansyl cadaverine labeling of TG substrates in the cultures
   revealed that incorporation of the label occurred at sites where
   fibronectin co-localized with COL I, indicating that ecmFXIIIA secretion
   could function to stabilize newly deposited matrix. Our results suggest
   that FXIIIA is an integral part of the COL I deposition machinery, and
   also that it is part of the ECM-feedback loop, both of which regulate
   matrix deposition and osteoblast differentiation. J. Cell. Physiol. 227:

Abstract = {{The capacity to isolate small numbers of neurons in vitro is an
   essential tool to study the cell biology of synapses and the development
   of neuronal networks by specific cell types. Microisland culture assays
   allow for single neurons, or simple neural networks, to be isolated on
   islands of glial cells; however, the techniques commonly used to produce
   microisland substrates are expensive, challenging to control, and
   typically result in many discarded substrates. Here, we used
   microcontact printing to pattern a glass surface with islands of
   extracellular matrix proteins known to support neural cell growth and
   differentiation. To promote segregation of the cells to the islands, the
   substrate surrounding the islands was backfilled with polyethylene
   glycol (PEG), forming a relatively non-permissive surface on which cell
   attachment is limited. Astrocytes, and subsequently hippocampal neurons,
   were then seeded onto the islands of patterned protein. Using this
   method, readily reproducible patterns of protein islands were produced
   that permit cell attachment, differentiation, and growth. The technique
   is a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable means to generate patterned
   substrates appropriate for microisland cultures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of
   intrinsic and Si-doped InN nanowires are studied in detail. For
   intrinsic InN nanowires, the emission is due to band-to-band carrier
   recombination with the peak energy at similar to 0.64 eV (at 300 K) and
   may involve free-exciton emission at low temperatures. The PL spectra
   exhibit a strong dependence on optical excitation power and temperature,
   which can be well characterized by the presence of very low residual
   electron density and the absence or a negligible level of surface
   electron accumulation. In comparison, the emission of Si-doped InN
   nanowires is characterized by the presence of two distinct peaks located
   at similar to 0.65 and similar to 0.73- 0.75 eV (at 300 K). Detailed
   studies further suggest that these low-energy and high-energy peaks can
   be ascribed to band-to-band carrier recombination in the relatively
   low-doped nanowire bulkregion and Mahan exciton emission in the
   high-doped nanowire near-surface region, respectively; this is a natural
   consequence of dopant surface segregation. The resulting surface
   electron accumulation and Fermi-level pinning, due to the enhanced
   surface doping, are confirmed by angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy measurements on Si-doped InN nanowires, which is in direct
   contrast to the absence or a negligible level of surface electron
   accumulation in intrinsic InN nanowires. This work elucidates the role
   of charge-carrier concentration and distribution on the optical
   properties of InN nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate the impact of equalization-enhanced phase
   noise (EEPN) on the performance of 56 Gbaud dual-polarization (DP) QPSK
   long haul transmission systems. Although EEPN adds additional noise to
   the received symbols, we show that this reduces the phase variance
   introduced by the LO laser, and therefore should be considered when
   designing the carrier phase recovery (CPR) algorithms and estimating
   system performance. Further, we experimentally demonstrate the
   performance degradation caused by EEPN when a LO laser with a large
   linewidth is used at the receiver. When using a 2.6 MHz linewidth
   distributed feedback (DFB) laser instead of a similar to 100 kHz
   linewidth external-cavity laser (ECL) as a LO, the transmission distance
   is reduced from 4160 km to 2640 km due to EEPN. We also confirm the
   reduction of the phase variance of the received symbols for longer
   transmission distances showing its impact on the CPR algorithm
   optimization when a DFB laser is used at the receiver. Finally, the
   relationship between the EEPN-induced penalty versus the signal baud
   rate and the LO laser linewidth is experimentally evaluated, and
   numerically validated by simulations. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the removal of ibuprofen
   (IBP) using the oxidants hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium persulfate
   (Na2S2O8). The ability of magnetite (Fe3O4) to activate persulfate (PS)
   and H2O2 for the oxidation of IBP at near neutral pH was evaluated as
   well. The use of soluble Fe2+ to activate H2O2 and Na2S2O8 was also
   investigated. H2O2 and Na2S2O8 were inactive during the sixty-minute
   experiments when used alone. However, activation using Fe2+ increased
   the removal to 95\% in the presence of H2O2 (Fenton reaction) and 63\%
   in the presence of Na2S2O8 at pH 6.6. Chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   removal was also greater for Fenton oxidation (65\%) than for
   iron-activated PS oxidation (25\%). Activation of H2O2 and PS by Fe3O4
   was only observed at a high oxidant concentration and over 48 h of
   reaction time. A second order rate kinetic constant was determined for
   H2O2 (3.0.10(-3) M-1 s(-1)) and Na2S2O8 (1.59.10(-3) M-1 s(-1)) in the
   presence of Fe3O4. Finally, several of the degradation products formed
   during oxidation of IBP in the presence of H2O2 and Na2S2O8 (activated
   by Fe2+) were identified. These include oxalic acid, pyruvic acid,
   formic acid, acetic acid, 4-acetylbenzoic acid, 4-isobutylacetophenone
   (4-IBAP) and oxo-ibuprofen. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing first-principles quantum transport calculations, we
   investigate the role of local fields in conductor surface
   electromigration. A nanometer-thick Ag(100) thin film is adopted as our
   prototypical conductor, where we demonstrate the existence of intense
   local electric fields at atomic surface defects under an external bias.
   It is shown that such local fields can play an important role in driving
   surface electromigration and electrical breakdown. The intense fields
   originate from the relatively short (atomic-scale) screening lengths
   common to most elemental metals. This general short-range screening
   trend is established self-consistently within an intuitive picture of
   linear response electrostatics. The findings shed new light on the
   underlying physical origins of surface electromigration and point to the
   possibility of harnessing local fields to engineer electromigration at

Abstract = {{The re-occurrence pattern of major extremes in hydrology, such as the
   timing and intensity of river floods, is related to a variety of natural
   and anthropogenic factors. In this study, the particular temporal
   regional influence of similar to 11 year solar radiation cyclicities on
   the maximum annual streamflow (MAS) records from six stations from four
   eco-zones in Southern Canada were investigated. Wavelet analysis
   decomposition and re-composition techniques were applied to extract the
   similar to 11 year signals in the hydrological records. An similar to 11
   year cyclicity is evident in all eco-zones but it is superimposed by
   non-periodic variability in the 2 to 18 year wavebands that are due to
   El Nino/Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation related
   precipitation variability or random components in the records. The
   similar to 11 year MAS cyclicity is strong in the Mountain ecozone
   (Rocky Mountains) and less strong in the Boreal Shield. In these
   eco-zones, it was found that years that experienced major floods were
   most likely to occur during low sunspot number years, in the spring time
   approximately 6-7 years after the last solar maximum. The results of the
   wavelet analysis demonstrate that major floods are more likely to occur
   during sunspot cycles with relatively low sunspot numbers after the last
   maximum. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Microarray-to-Microarray Transfer of Reagents by Snapping of Two Chips
   for Cross-Reactivity-Free Multiplex Immunoassays}},

Abstract = {{Whereas microarray and microfluidic technologies have progressed on many
   fronts, servicing microchips with minute amounts of reagents still
   constitutes an important challenge for many applications. Recently,
   chip-to-chip reagent transfer methods were introduced that simplify the
   delivery of reagents but required manual, visual alignment, custom-built
   microwells, and only showed the reaction of a single sample with
   multiple chemicals. Here, we present the snap chip, which uses common
   glass slides for transfer, back-side alignment for achieving precise
   alignment in spite of mirroring, and a snap-apparatus for facile
   transfer of arrays of chemicals at once by snapping the two slides
   together. We recently established that cross-reactivity was a
   significant problem in multiplex assays both theoretically and
   experimentally and found that it can be eliminated by avoiding mixing,
   but which necessitates delivering each detection antibody to a single
   spot with the cognate capture antibody.(18) Using the snap chip,
   multiplexed sandwich immunoassays without mixing were performed: a slide
   with multiple arrays of 10 different capture antibodies was incubated
   with a sample, and then all detection antibodies transferred at once by
   snapping, each to the single cognate spot. All binding curves were
   established and limits of detection in the pg/mL range were obtained.
   Snap chips were stored up to 3 months prior to usage. The snap chip, by
   dissociating microarray production, which requires expensive equipment,
   from assay execution, which can be achieved using a hand-held alignment
   apparatus, will allow for multiplex reactions to be performed using a
   user-friendly kit. This new liquid handling format can be easily adapted
   to other applications that require transfer of minute amounts of
   different reagents in parallel.}},

Abstract = {{Ten different types of biomass served as fuel to generate electricity
   using a pilot-scale downdraft biomass gasification power plant. The
   gasifier temperature profile, along with the syngas quality and
   performance were determined for varying flow rates. It was found that
   temperature profiles depended on syngas flow rate and type of biomass
   feedstock and can be divided into three groups. An increase in syngas
   flow rate from 105 to 211 m(3) h(-1) (across all biomass types) was
   found to have little effect on gas composition, causing calorific values
   peaking between 4.2 and 5.6 MJ (Nm)(-3). Maximum electrical power output
   of each tested biomass feedstocks was observed at the highest syngas
   flow rate, ranging from 47 to 63 kW with specific biomass consumption
   below 2.0 kg kW(-1) h(-1). Among them, gasification efficiency exceeding
   70\% was achieved from Eucalyptus and corncob, and Giant Leucaena.
   Engine-generator set efficiency and electrical efficiency ranged from
   11.0 to 25.8\% and from 6.3 to 18.6\%, respectively. Overall, biomasses
   varying widely in their properties showed a strong potential for
   electricity generation using downdraft gasification technology.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-texturing of glass micro-channel surfaces during machining by
   spark assisted chemical engraving (SACE) technology is reported. A range
   of surface textures is obtained from feathery-like to porous spongy-like
   textures. It is demonstrated that the texture formed on the channel
   surface is a mimic of the electrolyte flow patterns induced during
   machining. The electrolyte viscosity is found to be the most significant
   factor influencing the channel texture among other factors including
   tool-work piece gap, machining voltage, and tool travel speed. Pulsed
   voltage, used to control the local temperature at the machining spot,
   has also proved to influence the surface texture. As a result, different
   channel surface textures were obtained during SACE machining by
   controlling the mentioned parameters. Further this work demonstrates the
   capability of SACE to both micro machine and texture glass surfaces in
   one machining operation. The present results add to the importance of
   SACE technology, knowing the significance of channel micro-texturing in
   microfluidic and biomedical applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{429-448}},

Abstract = {{Revealing vibration characteristics of sub-cellular structural
   components such as membranes and microtubules has a principal role in
   obtaining a deeper understanding of their biological functions.
   Nevertheless, limitations and challenges in biological experiments at
   this scale necessitates the use of mathematical and computational models
   as an alternative solution. As one of the three major cytoskeletal
   filaments, microtubules are highly anisotropic structures built from
   tubulin heterodimers. They are hollow cylindrical shells with a similar
   to 25 nm outer diameter and are tens of microns long. In this study, a
   mechanical model including the effects of the viscous cytosol and
   surrounding filaments is developed for predicting the coupled
   oscillations of a single microtubule immersed in cytoplasm. The
   first-order shear deformation shell theory for orthotropic materials is
   used to model the microtubule, whereas the motion of the cytosol is
   analyzed by considering the Stokes flow. The viscous cytosol and the
   microtubule are coupled through the continuity condition across the
   microtubule-cytosol interface. The stress and velocity fields in the
   cytosol induced by vibrating microtubule are analytically determined.
   Finally, the influences of the dynamic viscosity of the cytosol,
   filament network elasticity, microtubule shear modulus, and
   circumferential wave-number on longitudinal, radial, and torsional modes
   of microtubule vibration are elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Probiotic organisms have shown promise in treating diseases. Previously,

   This study investigates the safety and toxicology of oral ingestion of
   microencapsulated L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 in a yogurt formulation. A
   randomized group of 120 subjects received a dose of 5 x 10(10) CFU
   microencapsulated L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 in yogurt (n = 59) or placebo
   yogurt (n = 61) twice/day for 6 weeks. Clinical chemistry and
   hematological parameters of safety were analyzed. Fecal samples were
   collected at these time points for the analysis of deconjugated bile
   acids. The frequency, duration and intensity of adverse events (AEs) and
   clinical significance of safety parameters were recorded for both
   groups. No clinically significant differences between the probiotic
   yogurt and placebo yogurt treated groups were detected in either the
   blood clinical chemistry or hematology results and there was no
   significant increase in fecal deconjugated bile acids (P > 0.05) between
   treated and control groups. The frequency and intensity of AEs was
   similar in the two groups. These results demonstrate the safe use of
   this formulation in food. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   pilot-symbol-assisted architecture of M-ary frequency-shift-keying (FSK)
   modulation in amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-relay networks. It is
   shown that, at the expense of the low spectral efficiency inherent in
   FSK modulation, every transmitted symbol from the source to the
   destination can be used as a pilot symbol. In the proposed detection
   scheme, the destination combines the signals from the source and the
   relays to perform detection by using the estimated channels obtained
   from the implicit pilot symbols. Using the Gaussian approximation for
   the effective noise at the destination, an upper bound of the
   approximated bit-error-rate (BER) is provided. Simulation results reveal
   that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the BER performance
   when compared to previously proposed schemes in a temporally-correlated
   fading environment. The simulation results also verify the obtained
   upper bound on the approximated BER.}},

   unknown free surfaces and arbitrary curved-shaped boundaries. These
   features make the problem more complicated than flow under a sluice gate
   or over a weir. The fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible

Title = {{Patterns of altered functional connectivity in mesial temporal lobe

Journal = {{EPILEPSIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{53}},

Pages = {{1013-1023}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) the epileptogenic area
   is confined to the mesial temporal lobe, but other cortical and
   subcortical areas are also affected and cognitive and psychiatric
   impairments are usually documented. Functional connectivity methods are
   based on the correlation of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
   signal between brain regions, which exhibit consistent and reproducible
   functional networks from resting state data. The aim of this study is to
   compare functional connectivity of patients with MTLE during the
   interictal period with healthy subjects. We hypothesize that patients
   show reduced functional connectivity compared to controls, the interest
   being to determine which regions show this reduction. Methods: We
   selected electroencephalographyfunctional magnetic resonance imaging
   (EEG-fMRI) resting state data without EEG spikes from 16 patients with
   right and 7 patients with left MTLE. EEG-fMRI resting state data of 23
   healthy subjects matched for age, sex, and manual preference were
   selected as controls. Four volumes of interest in the left and right
   amygdalae and hippocampi (LA, RA, LH, and RH) were manually segmented in
   the anatomic MRI of each subject. The averaged BOLD time course within
   each volume of interest was used to detect brain regions with BOLD
   signal correlated with it. Group differences between patients and
   controls were estimated. Key Findings: In patients with right MTLE,
   group difference functional connectivity maps (RMTLE - controls) showed
   for RA and RH decreased connectivity with the brain areas of the default
   mode network (DMN), the ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions, and
   contralateral mesial temporal structures; and for LA and LH, decreased
   connectivity with DMN and contralateral hippocampus. Additional
   decreased connectivity was found between LA and pons and between LH and
   ventromesial limbic prefrontal structures. In patients with left MTLE,
   functional connectivity maps (LMTLE - controls) showed for LA and LH
   decreased connectivity with DMN, contralateral hippocampus, and
   bilateral ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions; no change in
   connectivity was detected for RA; and for RH, there was decreased
   connectivity with DMN, bilateral ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions,
   and contralateral amygdala and hippocampus. Significance: In unilateral
   MTLE, amygdala and hippocampus on the affected and to a lesser extent on
   the healthy side are less connected, and are also less connected with
   the dopaminergic mesolimbic and the DMNs. Changes in functional
   connectivity between mesial temporal lobe structures and these
   structures may explain cognitive and psychiatric impairments often found
   in patients with MTLE.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the correlated surface electronic and optical
   properties of {[}0001]-oriented epitaxial InN nanowires grown directly
   on silicon. By dramatically improving the epitaxial growth process, we
   have achieved, for the first time, intrinsic InN both within the bulk
   and at nonpolar InN surfaces. The near-surface Fermi-level was measured
   to be similar to 0.55 eV above the valence band maximum for undoped InN
   nanowires, suggesting the absence of surface electron accumulation and
   Fermi-level pinning. This result is in direct contrast to the
   problematic degenerate two-dimensional electron gas universally observed
   on grown surfaces of n-type degenerate InN. We have further demonstrated
   that the surface charge properties of InN nanowires, including the
   formation of two-dimensional electron gas and the optical emission
   characteristics can be precisely tuned through controlled n-type doping.
   At relatively high doping levels in this study, the near-surface
   Fermi-level was found to be pinned at,similar to 0.95-1.3 eV above the
   valence band maximum. Through these trends, well captured by the
   effective mass and ab initio materials modeling, we have unambiguously
   identified the definitive role of surface doping in tuning the surface
   charge properties of InN.}},

Abstract = {{The critical conditions for initiation of reaction by shock loading in
   various compositions that produce little or no gas upon reaction were
   investigated. Shock recovery experiments using Mn+S were first carried
   out in two different apparatus geometries and for two different initial
   sample densities. In one geometry, the sample was subjected to a planar
   shock followed by interactions with the confining walls. In the other
   geometry, a curved shock free of wall interactions was delivered to the
   sample. The low-density (55?\% TMD) Mn+S was found to be significantly
   more sensitive to the curved shock than to the planar shock with wall
   interactions. For high-density (90?\% TMD) Mn+S samples however, shock
   sensitivity was the same in both apparatuses. Next, the reaction onset
   temperature and the critical initiating shock pressure were determined
   for a number of powder mixtures using DTA and shock recovery (in the
   geometry producing planar shocks with interactions with the confinement
   walls), respectively. For the majority of the mixtures tested, the
   minimum shock energy required to cause the entire sample mixture to
   react was found to be much less than the enthalpy of the sample at its
   reaction onset temperature, with no significant correlation between
   these two parameters. The process of arrested ball-milling, which
   results in a reduction of the reaction onset temperature of a mixture,
   may lead to an increase in shock sensitivity. Additionally, thermal
   sensitivity in the particular mixtures considered was not increased when
   they were first shock-compacted by sub-critical shocks.}},

Abstract = {{New tetrahedral finite elements are described for the analysis of vector
   electromagnetic fields. They are singular elements that are more
   accurate than conventional, polynomial-based elements near sharp edges
   and corners. They are hierarchical, meaning that elements of different
   orders (accuracies) are available and may be placed together in the same
   mesh without violating continuity of the field. The elements are formed
   from a series of scalar singular elements by taking the gradient, and
   are therefore called gradient singular. Results using the new elements
   in p-adaptive analysis, orders 1 to 3, demonstrate that when they are
   used in place of conventional elements the scattering parameters are as
   much as 10 times more accurate for the same number of unknowns.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method to maximize the soliton self-frequency shift (SSFS)
   in microwires with diameter profiles varying nonuniformly along the
   soliton propagation path. The method is divided into two steps. The
   first step consists in selecting the input microwire diameter that leads
   to the highest rate of frequency shift per unit of propagation length.
   The second step consists in increasing gradually the microwire diameter
   along the soliton path to suppress dispersive wave emission and maintain
   a large rate of frequency shift per unit of propagation length. We first
   propose and apply a rule to select the initial diameter using the
   adiabatic theory. The optimal diameter profile is then achieved by
   maintaining the redshifting soliton at a fixed spectral separation from
   the zero-dispersion wavelengths. The optimized profile supports solitons
   with different input energies that allow a wavelength shift up to 650 nm
   from the 2100 nm pump wavelength in a 20 cm microwire length. We compare
   our results with the SSFS generated in microwires with uniform diameter
   profile to illustrate the enhancement of wavelength shift in the
   designed nonuniform microwire. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To correlate degenerative changes in cartilage and
   subchondral bone in the third carpal bone (C3) of Standardbred
   racehorses with naturally occurring repetitive trauma-induced
   osteoarthritis.
   Design: Fifteen C3, collected from Standardbred horses postmortem, were
   assessed for cartilage lesions by visual inspection and divided into
   Control (CO), Early Osteoarthritis (EOA) and Advanced Osteoarthritis
   (AOA) groups. Two osteochondral cores were harvested from corresponding
   dorsal sites on each bone and scanned with a micro-computed tomography
   (CT) instrument. 2D images were assembled into 3D reconstructions that
   were used to quantify architectural parameters from selected regions of
   interest, including bone mineral density and bone volume fraction. 2D
   images, illustrating the most severe lesion per core, were scored for
   architectural appearance by blinded observers. Thin sections of paraffin
   embedded decalcified cores stained with Safranin O-Fast Green, matched
   to the micro-CT images, were scored using a modified Mankin scoring
   system.
   Results: Subchondral bone pits with deep focal areas of porosity were
   seen more frequently in AOA than EOA but never in CO. Articular
   cartilage damage was seen in association with a reduction in bone
   mineral and loss of bone tissue. Histological analyses revealed
   significant numbers of microcracks in the calcified cartilage of EOA and
   AOA groups and a progressive increase in the score compared with CO
   bones.
   Conclusion: The data reveal corresponding, progressive degenerative
   changes in articular cartilage and subchondral bone, including striking
   focal resorptive lesions, in the third carpal bone of racehorses
   subjected to repetitive, high impact trauma. (C) 2012 Osteoarthritis

Abstract = {{Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30253 was shown to have potential as a
   probiotic by reducing the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8.
   Moreover, this strain was evaluated, by in vitro and in vivo techniques,
   for its safety for human consumption. The identity of the strain was
   investigated by metabolic profiling and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and in
   vitro safety evaluations were performed by molecular and metabolic
   techniques. Genetic analysis was confirmed by assessing the minimum
   inhibitory concentration to a panel of antibiotics, showing that the
   strain was susceptible to 8 antibiotics tested. The ability of the
   strain to produce potentially harmful by-products and antimicrobial
   compounds was evaluated, showing that the strain does not produce
   biogenic amines and does not show bacteriocin activity or reuterin
   production. A 28-day repeated oral dose study was conducted in normal
   Sprague-Dawley rats to support the in vivo strain safety. Oral
   administration of the strain resulted in no changes in general condition
   and no clinically significant changes to biochemical and haematological
   markers of safety relative to vehicle control treated animals. This
   comprehensive assessment of safety of L. reuteri NCIMB 30253 supports
   the safety of the strain for use as a probiotic.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a 65A degrees sweep reverse half-delta wing (RHDW),
   mounted at the squared tip of a rectangular NACA 0012 wing, on the tip
   vortex was investigated experimentally at Re = 2.45 x 10(5). The RHDW
   was found to produce a weaker tip vortex with a lower vorticity level
   and, more importantly, a reduced lift-induced drag compared to the
   baseline wing. In addition to the lift increment, the RHDW also produced
   a large separated wake flow and subsequently an increased profile drag.
   The reduction in lift-induced drag, however, outperformed the increase
   in profile drag and resulted in a virtually unchanged total drag in
   comparison with the baseline wing. Physical mechanisms responsible for
   the RHDW-induced appealing aerodynamics and vortex flow modifications
   were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and parameter identification of soft tissue are essential in
   establishing an accurate contact model for tool-tissue interaction,
   which can be used in the development of high-fidelity surgical
   instruments. This paper discusses the interaction between a tissue and a
   tactile sensor in minimally invasive surgery, the focus being a novel
   technique for robotic-assisted mitral valve repair, in which tactile
   sensors are used to distinguish between different kinds of tissue by
   their relative softness. A discrete viscoelastic model is selected to
   represent the tissue behavior. To populate the model of the tissue with
   actual data, a set of tissue-testing experiments is designed and
   implemented on the atrial tissue of a swine heart by analyzing its
   dynamic response. By means of a genetic algorithm, data of the complex
   compliance are extracted and used to find the coefficients of the model.
   Further, a viscoelastic contact model is developed to model the
   interaction between the tissue and the tactile sensor with annular
   shape. Finally, the relation among the indentation displacement, the
   ratio of the radii, and the applied force is established parametrically.}},

Abstract = {{Security aspects of the index coding with side information (ICSI)
   problem are investigated. Building on the results of Bar-Yossef et al.
   (2006), the properties of linear index codes are further explored. The
   notion of weak security, considered by Bhattad and Narayanan (2005) in
   the context of network coding, is generalized to block security. It is
   shown that the linear index code based on a matrix L, whose column space
   code C(L) has length, minimum distance D, and dual distance
   d(perpendicular to), is (d - 1 - t)-block secure (and hence also weakly
   secure) if the adversary knows in advance t <= d - 2 messages, and is
   completely insecure if the adversary knows in advance more than n -
   d(perpendicular to) messages. Strong security is examined under the
   conditions that the adversary: 1) possesses t messages in advance; 2)
   eavesdrops at most mu transmissions; 3) corrupts at most delta
   transmissions. We prove that for sufficiently large, an optimal linear
   index code which is strongly secure against such an adversary has length
   kappa(q) + mu + 2 delta. Here, kappa(q) is a generalization of the
   min-rank over F-q of the side information graph for the ICSI problem in
   its original formulation in the work of Bar-Yossef et al.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that the design of optimal transmit beamforming vectors for
   cognitive radio multicast transmission can be formulated as indefinite
   quadratic optimization programs. Given the challenges of such nonconvex
   problems, the conventional approach in literature is to recast them as
   convex semidefinite programs (SDPs) together with rank-one constraints.
   Then, these nonconvex and discontinuous constraints are dropped allowing
   for the realization of a pool of relaxed candidate solutions, from which
   various randomization techniques are utilized with the hope to recover
   the optimal solutions. However, it has been shown that such approach
   fails to deliver satisfactory outcomes in many practical settings,
   wherein the determined solutions are found to be unacceptably far from
   the actual optimality. On the contrary, we in this contribution tackle
   the aforementioned optimal beamforming problems differently by
   representing them as SDPs with additional reverse convex (but
   continuous) constraints. Non-smooth optimization algorithms are then
   proposed to locate the optimal solutions of such design problems in an
   efficient manner. Our thorough numerical examples verify that the
   proposed algorithms offer almost global optimality whilst requiring
   relatively low computational load.}},

Abstract = {{Economically viable production of solvents through
   acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation requires a detailed
   understanding of Clostridium acetobutylicum. This study focuses on the
   proteomic profiling of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 from the stationary
   phase of ABE fermentation using xylose and compares with the exponential
   growth by shotgun proteomics approach. Comparative proteomic analysis
   revealed 22.9\% of the C. acetobutylicum genome and 18.6\% was found to
   be common in both exponential and stationary phases. The proteomic
   profile of C. acetobutylicum changed during the ABE fermentation such
   that 17 proteins were significantly differentially expressed between the
   two phases. Specifically, the expression of five proteins namely,
   CAC2873, CAP0164, CAP0165, CAC3298, and CAC1742 involved in the solvent
   production pathway were found to be significantly lower in the
   stationary phase compared to the exponential growth. Similarly, the
   expression of fucose isomerase (CAC2610), xylulose kinase (CAC2612), and
   a putative uncharacterized protein (CAC2611) involved in the xylose
   utilization pathway were also significantly lower in the stationary
   phase. These findings provide an insight into the metabolic behavior of
   C. acetobutylicum between different phases of ABE fermentation using
   xylose.}},

Title = {{Analysis of WC/Ni-Based Coatings Deposited by Controlled Short-Circuit

Abstract = {{This study investigates the recently developed controlled short-circuit
   metal inert gas (CSC-MIG) welding system for depositing WC/Ni-based
   claddings on carbon steel substrates. WC/Ni-based coatings deposited by
   CSC-MIG were analyzed by optical light microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and
   electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) capabilities. X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) and hardness measurements of depositions are also reported. The
   CSC-MIG welding system provides a significant amount of user control
   over the current waveform during welding and has lower heat input when
   compared with traditional MIG welding. Heat input for the analyzed
   coatings ranged from 10.1 to 108.7 J/mm. Metallurgically bonded coatings
   free from spatter and with 0.75\% average porosity were produced. It was
   found that the detrimental decarburization of the WC particles seen in
   thermal spray systems does not occur when welding with the CSC-MIG.
   Precipitation of a reaction layer around the reinforcing phase was
   identified as WC; the average thickness of which increases from 3.8 to
   7.2 mu m for the low and high heat input condition, respectively.
   Precipitation of newly formed WC particles was observed; their size
   distribution increased from D (50) of 2.4 mu m in the low heat input
   weldment to 6.75 mu m in the high heat input weldment. The level of
   dilution of the reinforcing phase increases significantly with heat
   input. The hardness of the deposited coatings decreases from 587 HV10 to
   410 HV10 when the energy input was increased from 10.1 to 108.7 J/mm.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the design of sampled-data infinite impulse response (IIR)
   filters based on time-mode signal processing (TMSP) circuits is
   presented. Time-mode signal processing, defined as the processing of
   sampled analog information using time-difference variables, is still a
   relatively new technology, and therefore, there is still much
   development needed to extend the technology into a general
   signal-processing tool. In this work, a set of general building blocks
   will be introduced that perform the most basic mathematical operations
   in the time-mode. By arranging these basic structures, higher-order
   time-mode systems, specifically, time-mode IIR filters, will be
   realized. A second low-pass time-mode IIR filter is implemented using
   discrete components. Measured results confirmed that the circuit
   performed low-pass filtering, providing a maximum SNR of 45.2 dB and
   SNDR of 35.3 dB.}},

Abstract = {{An optimized microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method was evaluated
   through repeatability, recovery and efficiency testing. The
   repeatability tests, performed by three users over time, were not
   significantly different. The recovery of lignan throughout the
   extraction, preparation and analysis steps is 97.5\% with a coefficient
   of variation < 1\%. The MAE method is efficient for extracting lignans
   from the plant matrix, and it achieves significantly higher extraction
   yields than the two established reference methods. The applicability of
   the MAE method was demonstrated by extracting lignans from a variety of
   plant samples. The secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) content of
   seven flaxseed cultivars grown in Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil, QC, in 2009
   ranged from 14.6 to 18.9 mg SDG per gram of seed. Flax hulls produced in
   Winchester, ON, in 2010 were very rich in lignan; their SDG content was
   40.0 mg/g of flax hull. Sesame seeds contained 0.18-1.89 mg SECO
   (aglycone of SDG) per gram of seed, with significant differences among
   black, white and brown sesame seed. Chia seeds contained 0.99-1.29 mg
   SECO per gram of seed, with significant differences among batches of
   seeds. Sunflower seeds had 0.046 mg SECO per gram of sample and almonds
   had 0.029 mg SDG per gram of sample. The optimized and evaluated MAE
   method is recommended for the general analytical quantification of
   lignans in plant samples.}},

   investigated for treating ischaemic and infected full-thickness dermal
   wounds in a New Zealand white rabbit model for ischaemic wound healing.
   KaplanMeier survival curves showed increased wound closure with
   gNO-producing patch-treated wounds over 21 days of therapy (log-rank P =
   0.0225 and Wilcoxon P = 0.0113). Cox proportional hazard regression
   showed that gNO-producing patch-treated wounds were 2.52 times more
   likely to close compared with control patches (hazard P = 0.0375, score
   P = 0.032 and likelihood ratio P = 0.0355), and histological analysis

Abstract = {{Semiconductive polymer composites are used in a wide range of sensors
   and measurement devices. This paper discusses the development of a model
   and a new theoretical formulation for predicting piezoresistive behavior
   in semiconductive polymer composites, including their creep behavior and
   contact resistance. The relationship between electrical resistance and
   force applied to the piezoresistive force sensor can be predicted by
   using the proposed theoretical formulation. In order to verify the
   proposed formulation, the piezoresistive behavior of Linqstat, a
   carbon-filled polyethylene, was modeled mathematically. In addition,
   some experimental tests, such as thermo gravitational analysis and SEM,
   have been performed on Linqstat to find the volume fraction and size of
   carbon particles, which are essential for modeling. In addition, on a
   fabricated force sensor using Linqstat, a force versus resistance curve
   was obtained experimentally, which verified the validity and reliability
   of the proposed formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies posit energy as a constraint on the coding and
   processing of information in the brain due to the high cost of resting
   and evoked cortical activity. This suggestion has been addressed
   theoretically with models of a single neuron and two coupled neurons.
   Neural mass models (NMMs) address mean-field based modeling of the
   activity and interactions between populations of neurons rather than a
   few neurons. NMMs have been widely employed for studying the generation
   of EEG rhythms, and more recently as frameworks for integrated models of
   neurophysiology and functional MRI (fMRI) responses. To date, the
   consequences of energy constraints on the activity and interactions of
   ensembles of neurons have not been addressed. Here we aim to study the
   impact of constraining energy consumption during the resting-state on
   NMM parameters. To this end, we first linearized the model, then used
   stochastic control theory by introducing a quadratic cost function,
   which transforms the NMM into a stochastic linear quadratic regulator
   (LQR). Solving the LQR problem introduces a regime in which the NMM
   parameters, specifically the effective connectivities between neuronal
   populations, must vary with time. This is in contrast to current NMMs,
   which assume a constant parameter set for a given condition or task. We
   further simulated energy-constrained stochastic control of a specific
   NMM, the Wilson and Cowan model of two coupled neuronal populations, one
   of which is excitatory and the other inhibitory. These simulations
   demonstrate that with varying weights of the energy-cost function, the
   NMM parameters show different time-varying behavior. We conclude that
   constraining NMMs according to energy consumption may create more
   realistic models. We further propose to employ linear NMMs with
   time-varying parameters as an alternative to traditional nonlinear NMMs
   with constant parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A major part of the design process for Integrated Circuits (IC) is the
   process of circuit verification, in which the correctness of a circuit's
   design is evaluated. Discrete event simulation is a central tool in this
   effort. As proscribed by Moore's law, the number of transistors which
   can be placed on an IC doubles every 18 months. As a result, simulation
   has become the major bottleneck in the circuit design process. To
   alleviate this difficulty, it is possible to make use of parallel (or
   distributed) circuit simulation. In this paper, we make use of a
   parallel gate-level simulator which we developed and which is based upon
   Time Warp. Gate-level simulations exhibit two characteristics which can
   easily result in either instability or severely degraded simulation
   performance. Because of the low computational granularity of a
   gate-level simulation and because the computational load varies
   throughout the course of the simulation, the performance of Time Warp
   can be either severely degraded or be unstable. Restraining the optimism
   of Time Warp via a bounded window and utilizing dynamic load balancing
   are approaches to deal with these difficulties. In this paper, we make
   use of learning techniques from artificial intelligence (multiagent
   Q-learning, simulated annealing) to develop a combined bounded window
   and dynamic load balancing algorithm for parallel digital logic
   simulation. We evaluated the performance of these algorithms on open
   source Sparc and Leon designs and on two Viterbi decoder designs. We
   observed up to 60 percent improvement in simulation time of one of the
   decoders using this approach.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of approximating a 3D solid with a union of

   solid while using fewer spheres. The spheres generated by our method are
   internal and tangent to the solid's boundary, which permits an exact
   error analysis, fast updates under local feature size preserving
   deformation, and conservative dilation. We show that our dilated spheres
   offer superior time and error performance in approximate separation
   distance tests than the state-of-the-art method for sphere set
   approximation for the class of (sigma, theta)-fat solids. We envision
   that our sphere-based approximation will also prove useful for a range

Abstract = {{A deconvolution enhancement of the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model for
   turbulent flow is introduced. The energy and energy-dissipation rate for
   the enhanced model are derived. It is also shown that the consistency
   error, relative to the Navier-Stokes equations, and the microscale of
   the enhanced model are less than those of the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta
   model. The proposed model is used to simulate the Taylor-Green vortex
   problem and results show a qualitatively improved representation of the
   mean-square vorticity when compared to the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta
   model. Numerical studies of the energy spectrum and the alignment
   between the vorticity and the eigenvectors of the stretching tensor for
   three-dimensional turbulent flows with Re = 200 are used to explore the
   utility of the model. A benchmark problem of a two-dimensional channel
   flow over a step for Re = 600 also indicates that this model can be
   applied to more general flows than those involving periodic boundary

Abstract = {{Osteoclast differentiation is affected by substrate characteristics and
   environmental conditions; these parameters are therefore of interest for
   understanding bone remodeling. As a step toward osteoclast
   mechanotransduction experiments, we aimed to optimize conditions for
   osteoclast differentiation on extendable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)
   substrates. Because cells attach poorly on PDMS alone, chemical
   modification by covalent attachment of collagen type I was performed.
   Effects of collagen surface concentrations on monocyte fusion and
   osteoclast differentiation were examined. Osteoclasts differentiated on
   modified PDMS were fewer in number (by similar to 50\%) than controls on
   polystyrene physically modified by nonspecific attachment of collagen,
   and exhibited somewhat different morphologies. Nevertheless, for certain
   choices of the chemical modification procedures, appropriate
   differentiation on PDMS was still evident by qRT-PCR analysis for
   tartrate-resistant acid phosphate (TRAP) and cathepsin K (CTSK) gene
   expression, positive TRAP staining, fluorescent phalloidin staining
   showing actin ring formation and bone resorption assays. At relatively
   high collagen surface densities, monocyte clumps appeared on PDMS
   suggesting substrate-induced alterations to monocyte fusion. Covalently
   bound collagen can therefore be used to promote osteoclast
   differentiation on extendable PDMS substrates. Under appropriate
   conditions osteoclasts retain similar functionality as on polystyrene,
   which will enable future studies of osteoclast interactions with
   microstructured surfaces and mechanostimulation. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The forced nonlinear dynamics of an axially moving beam with coupled
   longitudinal and transverse displacements is numerically investigated in
   this paper with special consideration to the case with a three-to-one
   internal resonance. The two coupled nonlinear partial differential
   equations for the longitudinal and transverse motions are discretized
   via the Galerkin technique, and the resulting set of nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations is solved either by means of the pseudo-arclength
   continuation method or via direct time integration. Specifically, the
   frequency-response curves of the system are obtained using the
   pseudo-arclength continuation technique, and the bifurcation diagrams of
   Poincare maps via direct time integration. The effect of system
   parameters on the above-mentioned diagrams is examined and the results
   are presented in the form of time histories, phase-plane portraits,
   Poincare maps, and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). It is shown that
   depending on the system parameters, the system displays a wide variety
   of rich dynamics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A conventional flexural beam test subjected to environmental
   conditioning, especially cyclic wetting and drying, results in a
   non-uniformly damaged specimen at the cross section as well as
   non-uniform stress distributions. Some limitations for durability
   evaluation can cause an erroneous behavior of fiber pullout. To obtain a
   uniform stress distribution at the failure surface with minimized
   thickness, this paper evaluated transport properties affecting the
   movement of deleterious materials into FRC. The most common fiber types
   and volume fractions used in industry were chosen with input from the
   manufacturers. Steel fiber at 1\%, PP fiber at 0.5\%, and PVA fiber at
   0.75\% were used. The absorption test by capillary action was identified
   as the critical transport mechanism to produce an effective cyclic
   wetting conditioning and uniformly damaged specimen. It was found that a
   7-day conditioning cycle and 25 mm thickness were appropriate to
   maximize the transport of the harmful materials with a minimized
   conditioning period. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A review of thermodynamic, materials science, and rheological liquid
   crystal models is presented and applied to a wide range of biological
   liquid crystals, including helicoidal plywoods, biopolymer solutions,

   the strong correspondence between different synthetic and biological
   materials is established. Biological polymer processing based on liquid
   crystalline precursors includes viscoelastic flow to form and shape
   fibers. Viscoelastic models for nematic and chiral nematics are reviewed
   and discussed in terms of key parameters that facilitate understanding
   and quantitative information from optical textures and rheometers. It is
   shown that viscoelastic modeling the silk spinning process using liquid
   crystal theories sheds light on textural transitions in the duct of
   spiders and silk worms as well as on tactoidal drops and interfacial

Abstract = {{Marbling is an important factor in evaluating pork quality and can be
   estimated by marbling scores based on the official marbling standards.
   The marbling score is normally assessed by experienced graders by
   comparing pork chops with the standardized chart system. In this paper,
   the potentials of automatic objective prediction of marbling scores were
   studied. The region of interest (ROI) of the marbling standards and the
   pork samples was automatically determined for marbling extraction.
   Marblings were regarded as kind of line patterns and thereby extracted
   by the wide line detector. Proportion of marblings (PM) was used for
   determinating the marbling score. The stepwise procedure was employed to
   select prediction models. A multiple linear regression equation was used
   as the initial model of the procedure and the PM of marbling standards
   at all three channels as potential variables. Three models were
   developed by the stepwise procedure with different first entry variable
   of the initial model. The multiple linear model obtained by the PM of
   marbling standards at all three RGB channels outperformed the two simple
   linear models respectively developed at the green and blue channels. The
   adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) of the multiple linear model
   was 0.9992 and the root mean square error of leave-one-out
   cross-validation (RMSECV) was 0.0938. Forty pork loin samples were used
   to predict marbling scores. The prediction results of the three models
   showed that the prediction ability of the simple linear model developed
   at the blue channel was comparable with the multiple linear model. (C)

Abstract = {{Several studies have reported limited or no reduction in serum
   cholesterol in response to probiotic formulations. Recently, probiotics
   have shown promise in treating metabolic disease due to improved strain
   selection and delivery technologies. The aim of the present study was to
   evaluate the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of a yoghurt formulation
   containing microencapsulated bile salt hydrolase ((BSH)-active
   Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242, taken twice per d over 6 weeks, in
   hypercholesterolaemic adults. A total of 114 subjects completed this
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-arm, multi-centre
   study. This interventional study included a 2-week washout, 2-week
   run-in and 6-week treatment period. Subjects were randomised to consume
   either yoghurts containing microencapsulated L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 or
   placebo yoghurts. Over the intervention period, subjects consuming
   yoghurts containing microencapsulated L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 attained
   significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) of 8.92\% (P = 0.016),
   total cholesterol (TC) of 4.81\% (P = 0.031) and non-HDL-cholesterol
   (HDL-C) of 6.01\% (P = 0.029) over placebo, and a significant absolute
   change in apoB-100 of -01.9 mmol/l (P = 0.049). Serum concentrations of
   TAG and HDL-C were unchanged over the course of the study. Present
   results show that consumption of microencapsulated BSH-active L. mitten.
   NCIMB 30242 yoghurt is efficacious and safe for lowering LDL-C, TC,
   apoB-100 and non-HDL-C in hypercholesterolaemic subjects. The efficacy
   of microencapsulated BSH-active L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 yoghurts appears
   to be superior to traditional probiotic therapy and akin to that of
   other cholesterol-lowering ingredients.}},

Abstract = {{The toughness of fiber-reinforced composites largely relies on crack
   bridging. More specifically, intact fibers left behind the tip of a
   propagating crack are progressively pulled out of the matrix,
   dissipating energy which translates into toughness. While short fibers
   are traditionally straight, recent work has showed that they can be
   shaped to increase the pullout strength, but not necessarily the energy
   to pullout. In this work we have modeled, fabricated and tested short
   fibers with tapered ends inspired from a high-performance natural
   material: nacre from mollusc shells. The main idea was to duplicate a
   key mechanism where a slight waviness of the inclusion can generate
   strain hardening and energy dissipation when the inclusion is pulled
   out. We have incorporated a similar feature to short fibers, in the form
   of tapered ends with well defined opening angles. We performed pullout
   tests on tapered steel fibers in epoxy matrices, which showed that the
   pullout of tapered fiber dissipates up to 27 times more energy than
   straight fibers. The experimental results also indicated the existence
   of an optimum taper angle to maximize work of pullout while preventing
   the brittle fracture of the matrix. An analytical model was developed to
   capture the pullout mechanism and the interaction between fiber and
   matrix. The analytical model can guide the design of tapered fibers by
   providing predictions on the influence of different parameters. (C) 2012

Title = {{Full three-dimensional investigation of structural contact interactions

Abstract = {{Minimizing the operating clearance between rotating bladed-disks and
   stationary surrounding casings is a primary concern in the design of
   modern turbomachines since it may advantageously affect their energy
   efficiency. This technical choice possibly leads to interactions between
   elastic structural components through direct unilateral contact and dry
   friction, events which are now accepted as normal operating conditions.
   Subsequent nonlinear dynamical behaviors of such systems are commonly
   investigated with simplified academic models mainly due to theoretical
   difficulties and numerical challenges involved in non-smooth large-scale
   realistic models. In this context, the present paper introduces an
   adaptation of a full three-dimensional contact strategy for the
   prediction of potentially damaging motions that would imply highly
   demanding computational efforts for the targeted aerospace application
   in an industrial context. It combines a smoothing procedure including
   bicubic B-spline patches together with a Lagrange multiplier based
   contact strategy within an explicit time-marching integration procedure
   preferred for its versatility.
   The proposed algorithm is first compared on a benchmark configuration
   against the more elaborated bi-potential formulation and the commercial
   software Ansys. The consistency of the provided results and the low
   energy fluctuations of the introduced approach underlines its reliable
   numerical properties. A case study featuring blade-tip/casing contact on
   industrial finite element models is then proposed: it incorporates
   component mode synthesis and the developed three-dimensional contact
   algorithm for investigating structural interactions occurring within a

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have performed a detailed investigation of the
   temperature- and current-dependent emission characteristics of nanowire
   light-emitting diodes, wherein InGaN/GaN dot-in-a-wire nanoscale
   heterostructures and a p-doped AlGaN electron blocking layer are
   incorporated in the device's active region to achieve white-light
   emission and to prevent electron overflow, respectively. Through these
   studies, the Auger coefficient is estimated to be in the range of
   similar to 10(-34) cm(6) s(-1) or less, which is nearly four orders of
   magnitude smaller than the commonly reported values of planar InGaN/GaN
   heterostructures, suggesting Auger recombination plays an essentially
   negligible role in the performance of GaN-based nanowire light-emitting
   diodes. It is observed, however, that the performance of such nanowire
   LEDs suffers severely from Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, which can
   account for nearly 40\% of the total carrier recombination under
   moderate injection conditions (similar to 100 A cm(-2)) at room
   temperature. The Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative lifetime is estimated
   to be in the range of a few nanoseconds at room temperature, which
   correlates well with the surface recombination velocity of GaN and the
   wire diameters used in this experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The homogeneous and seed-assisted precipitation of dicalcium phosphate
   dihydrate (DCPD or brushite) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) under controlled
   supersaturation regimes in chloride media at room temperature (22
   degrees C) is investigated. Prior to their reactive crystallization the
   metastable zones of precipitation for the two calcium orthophosphates
   were determined. The effects of supersaturation, reaction time, and
   seeding on the stoichiometry and crystallinity of these compounds were
   studied. Acidified solutions (pH approximate to 2.0) of NaH2PO4 (2-90
   mmol/L) and CaCl2 (2-150 mmol/L) were mixed in order to get Ca to P
   molar ratios in initial solution of 1.0 or 1.67 (the stoichiometric
   ratios for dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and hydroxyapatite).The
   supersaturation in solution was built up by the slow addition of 100
   mmol/L NaOH solution. In seed-assisted precipitation tests (Ca/P = 1)
   the metastable calcium phosphate solution (37.5 mmol/L) was neutralized
   until the precipitation pH of 5 was reached and 10 g/L of seed was
   added. The homogeneous precipitation of DCPD at pH 5.4 was fast and
   equilibrium was reached in 30 min. In the presence of seed, the
   precipitation rate was slower due to reduced supersaturation. Even so,
   in both cases well crystalline plate-like crystals matching the
   stoichiometry of brushite were produced. Calcium-deficient
   hydroxyapatite with nanocrystalline structure (nanocrystallite size
   similar to 20 nm) was produced at pH 7.6 under controlled
   supersaturation. The homogeneously produced material consisted of
   irregularly shaped agglomerates of the order of 5-15 mu m while the
   product obtained by seed-assisted precipitation was in the form of
   rather coarse (ca. 20-30 mu m) and dense spheroids. The highest Ca:P
   ratio material (Ca:P = 1.58) was obtained with seed-assisted
   precipitation at a slow addition rate.}},

Title = {{Modeling bacteriophage attachment using adsorption efficiency}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{22-29}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Typically, models of bacteriophage adsorption consider the process in
   two steps: reversible and irreversible attachment. In this study, a
   recently introduced one-step adsorption model, the adsorption efficiency
   model, is used to describe the adsorption of T-series bacteriophages to
   Escherichia coli. The adsorption efficiency model simplifies phage
   attachment to a single step: irreversible binding.The adsorption
   efficiency (epsilon) is used to account for unadsorbed phages. The model
   accurately describes T-series phage adsorption (T2, T4, T5, T6, and T7)
   under a variety of conditions. In addition, the model is compared to a
   commonly used two-step adsorption model, the sequential model.
   Experimental data support the assumptions of the adsorption efficiency
   model and suggest that the reversible first step of T-series phage
   adsorption is equivalent to irreversible attachment under the conditions
   tested. The adsorption efficiency model was not appropriate for a phage
   lambda strain lacking side tail fibers. However, the model did agree
   with data previously published for a strain of phage lambda possessing
   side tail fibers, as is the case of all T-series strains tested. This
   suggests that the adsorption efficiency model applies to phages
   containing side tail fibers (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear Schrodinger equation can be solved by split-step methods,
   where in each step, linear dispersion and nonlinear effects are treated
   separately. This paper considers the optimal design of an FIR filter as
   the time-domain implementation for the linear part. The objective is to
   minimize the integral of the squared error between the FIR frequency
   response and the desired dispersion characteristics over the band of
   interest. This least square ( LS) problem is solved in two approaches:
   the normal equation approach gives the explicit solution, whereas the
   singular value decomposition approach, which is based on the theory of
   discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, provides geometrical insights and
   reveals that the normal equation could be ill-conditioned. In addition,
   the frequency response might exhibit singular behaviors such as
   overshoot. We propose two filters that both can mitigate these
   shortcomings: the regularized LS filter achieves this by adding a
   regularization term to the objective function; the quadratically
   constrained quadratic programming-based filter addresses overshooting
   more efficiently by imposing a maximum magnitude constraint on the
   frequency response. Numerical results show that these filters can
   suppress the overshoots, control the squared error, reduce the filter
   length and lower the computational complexity. For both single channel
   and wavelength-division multiplexing channels, the proposed methods
   generate similar outputs as the standard split-step Fourier method.}},

Abstract = {{Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population based
   optimization algorithm which has attracted attentions of many
   researchers. This method has great potentials to be applied to many
   optimization problems. Despite its robustness the standard version of
   PSO has some drawbacks that may reduce its performance in optimization
   of complex structures such as laminated composites. In this paper by
   suggesting a new variation scheme for acceleration parameters and
   inertial weight factors of PSO a novel optimization algorithm is
   developed to enhance the basic version's performance in optimization of
   laminated composite structures. To verify the performance of the new
   proposed method, it is applied in two multi-objective design
   optimization problems of laminated cylindrical. The numerical results
   from the proposed method are compared with those from two other
   conventional versions of PSO-based algorithms. The convergancy of the
   new algorithms is also compared with the other two versions. The results
   reveal that the new modifications in the basic forms of particle swarm
   optimization method can increase its convergence speed and evade it from
   local optima traps. It is shown that the parameter variation scheme as
   presented in this paper is successful and can evenfind more preferable
   optimum results in design of laminated composite structures.}},

Abstract = {{Abandoned mines are often associated with enduring liabilities, which
   involve significant costs for decades after the decommissioning of the
   mine. Using a decommissioned mine as a geothermal resource can offset
   the environmental costs by supplying green heat to the communities
   living in and around the mine area. In this paper, a numerical
   assessment of geothermal heat extraction from underground mine workings
   using an open loop geothermal system is carried out. In this study, our
   focus is on fully flooded mines where the heat flow from the rock mass
   to the mine cavities is dominantly controlled by conduction in the rock
   mass. The sustainable heat flux into the mine workings is assessed using
   a transient two-dimensional axisymmetric heat transfer model. Finite
   volume method is applied to solve the model and simulate the transient
   temperature fields in the rock mass and within the water (flowing
   through cavities). The model is capable of controlling the rate of heat
   extraction through continuous adjustment of the rate of water flow
   through the mine. Sustainable rate of heat extraction is calculated for
   seasonally varied heat loads and for different project life cycles. It
   is shown that, with proper resource management, each kilometre of a
   typical deep underground mine tunnel, can produce about 150 kW of usable
   heat in a sustainable manner. The model is validated by comparing its
   results with other published models and realistic data available from
   Springhill mine, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is found that the sustainable
   heat extraction is controlled dominantly by virgin rock temperature,
   thermal conductivity of the rock mass, and seasonal heat load
   variations. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics

   uniform air pressure loading are examined both experimentally and
   computationally. In particular, the effect of crack length and its
   orientation on the overall pressure-deflection behaviour of the
   composite plate is investigated. The layered composite CFRP plate used
   in the experimental investigation consisted of 11 layers of a polyester
   matrix unidirectionally reinforced with carbon fibres. The bulk fibre
   volume fraction in the plate was approximately 61\%. The stacking of
   cracked laminae is used to construct a model of the plate. The
   experimental results for the central deflection of the plate were used
   to establish the validity of a computational approach that also accounts
   for large deflections of the plate within the small strain range.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofioxacin (LEVO) was
   studied in two oxidation processes: photocatalysis (UVC lamp (254 nm),
   TiO2) and ozonation. LEVO (C-o = 20 mg/L) was no longer detected after
   an ozone dose of 20.5 mg/L and after 180 min of photocatalytic
   oxidation. COD removals of 59\% and 70\% were measured for 270 mg/L of
   transferred ozone dose and 300 min of photocatalytic oxidation,
   respectively. Extensive treatment with ozone did not result in further
   reduction in COD levels reaching a plateau at the above mentioned value,
   however increased irradiation time led to increased COD removal during
   photocatalytic treatment. Both treatment methods proved to be effective
   ways of removing antibacterial activity. From agar diffusion test with
   Escherichia coli, it was observed that a transferred ozone dose of at
   least 20.5 mg/L and 180 min of irradiation were enough to completely
   remove antibacterial activity. Both treatments methods were shown to
   efficiently remove LEVO and its antibacterial activity and show
   promising results as possible applications for removal of antibiotics in
   wastewater. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   silicon, and holographically ordered porous polymer gratings (Bragg
   structures). These materials offer several advantages including low
   cost, ease of fabrication, high surface to volume ratio,
   biocompatibility, functionality with various recognition elements, and
   the ability to modify the material surface/volume properties and
   porosity. In addition, several optical sensing modalities can be
   employed using these materials including luminescence emission and
   lifetime sensing, diffraction, refractive index modulation, colorimetry,
   ratiometry, and reflection (or transmission). Finally, we review
   emerging techniques employing these materials that aim toward improving
   detection efficiency, sensitivity, and selectivity in optical sensors
   including plasmonics, photonic bandgap structures, and molecular

Abstract = {{The reversed cyclic loading behavior of full-scale shear wall specimens
   was investigated before and after retrofit. The wall specimens were
   designed and detailed to simulate nonductile reinforced concrete
   construction of the 1960s, having lap splices of the longitudinal
   reinforcement in the potential plastic hinge region, and having
   inadequate confinement of the boundary regions. The lap splices in these
   walls failed in a brittle manner before yielding occurred in the main
   flexural reinforcement. The use and effectiveness of carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) wrap for improving the lap splice
   behavior and the shear strength of the walls were investigated. The
   walls were tested under reversed cyclic loading with loading applied
   near the tip of the walls. The retrofit technique improved the
   displacement ductility, energy dissipation, and prevented premature
   failure of the lap splices. The target ductility level of 2.0 was
   achieved with this CFRP retrofit. DOI:

Abstract = {{In neural prosthetic systems, microelectrodes implanted in the brain
   record the electro-potentials elicited by specific thoughts and relay
   the signals to algorithms trained to translate the electrical activity

   optoelectronic neural electrodes that can record electrical signals and
   specific neural biomarkers. Specifically, the authors describe the
   integration of optical oxygen (O-2) sensors with silicon neural
   microelectrodes. The O-2 sensors are sol-gel derived xerogel thin films,
   that are coated on the exposed core of an optical fibre, that
   encapsulate O-2 responsive luminophores
   tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium(II) in their porous
   structures. The electrodes were inserted into the trunk region of the
   somatosensory cortex and lowered into the barrel field of a rat. Oxygen
   and action potential recordings during whisker stimulation provide
   support for the potential utility of the device. The proposed
   optoelectronic neural electrodes, which can reach depths greater than 10
   mm in the brain, could help the development of intelligent and more
   user-friendly neural prosthesis/ brain machine interfaces as well as aid
   in providing answers to complex brain diseases and disorders.}},

   Effect of hyperbaric treatments on the quality attributes of tomato.
   Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 541-551. An experimental hyperbaric system was
   conceptualized, designed and built to explore the effect of hyperbaric
   treatment on the quality attributes of tomato. Tomato fruits at the
   early breaker stage were subjected to hyperbaric pressures of 1, 3, 5, 7
   or 9 atm(abs) for different durations (5, 10 or 15 d) at 13 degrees C.
   The effect of hyperbaric treatment on postharvest quality of tomato
   fruit was evaluated with an emphasis on weight loss, firmness, color,
   titratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids (TSS). Hyperbaric
   treated tomato fruit ripened more slowly and were characterized by lower
   respiration rate than fruits kept under ambient conditions. Significant
   differences in weight loss, color, lycopene concentration and firmness
   were found between hyperbaric treated and control tomato fruit. No
   significant difference was found in the sugar/acid ratio (TSS/TA).}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{342-345}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Climate change and human population growth are expected to have
   substantial impacts on global water resources throughout the
   twenty-first century(1,2). Coastal aquifers are a nexus(3) of the
   world's oceanic and hydrologic ecosystems and provide a water source for
   the more than one billion people living in coastal regions(4,5).
   Saltwater intrusion caused by excessive groundwater extraction is
   already impacting diverse regions of the globe(5-7). Synthesis
   studies(8,9) and detailed simulations(10-13) have predicted that rising
   sea levels could negatively impact coastal aquifers through saltwater
   intrusion and/or inundation of coastal regions. However, the relative
   vulnerability of coastal aquifers to groundwater extraction and
   sea-level rise has not been systematically examined. Here we show that
   coastal aquifers are more vulnerable to groundwater extraction than to
   predicted sea-level rise under a wide range of hydrogeologic conditions
   and population densities. Only aquifers with very low hydraulic
   gradients are more vulnerable to sea-level rise and these regions will
   be impacted by saltwater inundation before saltwater intrusion. Human
   water use is a key driver in the hydrology of coastal aquifers, and
   efforts to adapt to sea-level rise at the expense of better water
   management are misguided.}},

Abstract = {{Human aortas are subjected to large mechanical stresses because of blood
   flow pressurization and through contact with the surrounding tissue. It
   is essential that the aorta does not lose stability by buckling with
   deformation of the cross-section (shell-like buckling) (i) for its
   proper functioning to ensure blood flow and (ii) to avoid high stresses
   in the aortic wall. A numerical bifurcation analysis employs a refined
   reduced-order model to investigate the stability of a straight aorta
   segment conveying blood flow. The structural model assumes a nonlinear
   cylindrical orthotropic laminated composite shell composed of three
   layers representing the tunica intima, media and adventitia. Residual
   stresses because of pressurization are evaluated and included in the
   model. The fluid is formulated using a hybrid model that contains the
   unsteady effects obtained from linear potential flow theory and the
   steady viscous effects obtained from the time-averaged NavierStokes
   equations. The aortic segment loses stability by divergence with
   deformation of the cross-section at a critical flow velocity for a given
   static pressure, exhibiting a strong subcritical behaviour with partial
   or total collapse of the inner wall. Preliminary results suggest
   directions for further study in relation to the appearance and growth of
   dissection in the aorta. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the critical energies required for direct initiation of
   spherical detonations in four gaseous fuels (C2H2, C2H4, C3H8 and
   H-2)-oxygen mixtures at different initial pressures, equivalence ratios
   and with different amounts of argon dilution are reported. Using these
   data, a scaling analysis is performed based on two main parameters of
   the problem: the explosion length R (o) that characterizes the blast
   wave and a characteristic chemical length that characterizes the
   detonation. For all the undiluted mixtures considered in this study, it
   is found that the relationship is closely given by R-o, where lambda is
   the characteristic detonation cell size of the explosive mixture. While
   for C2H2-2.5O(2) mixtures highly diluted with argon, in which cellular
   instabilities are shown to play a minor role on the detonation
   propagation, the proportionality factor increases to 37.3, 47 and 54.8
   for 50, 65 and 70\% argon dilution, respectively. Using the ZND
   induction length Delta (I) as the characteristic chemical length scale
   for argon diluted or `stable' mixtures, the explosion length is also
   found to scale adequately with R-o approximate to 2320 Delta(I) .}},

Abstract = {{Traditional geostatistical modelling of orebodies and estimation of
   grade-tonnage curves do not account for the uncertainty of the orebody
   grades and tonnages. Geological interpretations of complex shapes are
   often over-constrained, and therefore do not properly identify the
   location of the ore. In these situations, tonnage is often
   under-estimated and grade is over-estimated, resulting in orebody models
   used for mine planning that lead to costly financial decisions. This
   paper presents an approach aiming to better assess the uncertainty in an
   orebody model. The approach is applied to Vale's West Orebody of the
   Coleman McCreedy Mine, a poly-metallic deposit containing nickel,
   copper, gold, platinum and palladium. To encapsulate the orebody's
   variability and uncertainty, the nickel-copper sulphide mineralized zone
   is simulated using the single normal equation simulation method. The
   realizations serve as the orebody models from which the grades of
   multiple elements are jointly simulated using Min/Max Autocorrelation
   Factors. The final result is a series of equiprobable representations of
   the mineralization that incorporates both grade and tonnage uncertainty.
   The case study indicates that had conventional orebody estimations been
   used, there would have been a 10\% over-estimation of orebody volume,
   along with significant over-estimation of low-grade material and
   under-estimation of high-grade material. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A single layer of foam bubbles between parallel plates fails (fractures)
   when subjected to an applied pressure. The fracture can occur in both a

   during propagation of a brittle crack lead to a spontaneous
   brittle-to-ductile transition, which occurs dynamically during fracture
   and can be experimentally resolved in its details. The transition occurs
   when the driving pressure at the crack tip drops below that necessary to
   maintain supersonic propagation of the brittle crack. A theory taking
   into account the lateral crack opening together with air flow in the
   crack successfully predicts the occurrence and location of this novel
   spontaneous transition. (C) 2012 The Society of Rheology.

Abstract = {{The intrinsic complexity of tissues and organs demands tissue
   engineering approaches that extend beyond planar constructs currently in
   clinical use. However, the engineering of cylindrical or tubular tissue
   constructs with a hollow lumen presents significant challenges arising
   from geometrical and architectural considerations required to tailor
   biomaterials for tissue and organ repair. Type I collagen is an ideal
   scaffolding material due to its outstanding biocompatibility and high
   processability. However, the highly hydrated nature of collagen
   hydrogels results in their lack of mechanical properties and
   instability, as well as extensive cell-mediated contraction, which must
   be overcome to achieve process control. Herein, tubular dense collagen
   constructs (TDCCs) were produced simply and rapidly (in less than 1 h)
   by circumferentially wrapping plastically compressed dense collagen gel
   sheets around a cylindrical support. The effects of collagen source,
   i.e. rat-tail tendon and bovine dermis-derived acid solubilized
   collagen, and concentration on TDCC properties were investigated through
   morphological, mechanical and chemical characterizations. Both tensile
   strength and apparent modulus correlated strongly with physiologically
   relevant collagen gel fibrillar densities. The clinical potential of
   TDCC as a tubular tissue substitute was demonstrated mechanically,
   through circumferential tensile properties, theoretical burst pressure,
   which ranged from 1225 to 1574 mm Hg, compliance values of between 8.3\%
   to 14.2\% per 100 mm Hg and suture retention strength in the range of
   116-151 grams-force, which were compatible with surgical procedures.
   Moreover, NIH/3T3 fibroblast viability and uniform distribution within
   the construct wall were confirmed up to day 7 in culture. TDCCs with
   fibrillar densities equivalent to native tissues can be readily
   engineered in various dimensions with tunable morphological and
   mechanical properties, which can be easily handled for use as tissue
   models and adapted to clinical needs. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design and development of a low-power
   LC-VCO with improved phase noise performance by implementing a new
   capacitor divider varactor configuration and a 2nd order notch filter.
   We propose a new time-weighted approach to model the effective
   capacitance experienced by the oscillating signal over the oscillation
   period. The modeled effective capacitance is used in the calculation of
   the oscillation frequency, which agrees well with the simulation
   results. Two VCOs are designed and fabricated in TSMC 0.18 mu m
   technology. The oscillation frequency is tunable from 759 to 910 MHz
   with a tuning range of 18\%. At 900 MHz carrier, the measured phase
   noise is -126.1 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset with 4.5 mW power

Abstract = {{In this paper, a frequency-coupled optimum linear energy combiner (OLEC)

   detection framework introduced by Quan et al., to take further advantage
   of subband occupancy correlation in cooperative wideband spectrum
   sensing. In particular, the design of the detection thresholds and
   fusion weights used by a bank of subband multiuser OLECs is formulated
   as a joint optimization problem, i.e. maximization of aggregate
   opportunistic throughput under interference constraints (or vice versa).
   Through numerical experiments with a Markov model of subband occupancy,
   the proposed scheme is shown to significantly enhance CR network
   performance in terms of these global metrics.}},

Abstract = {{The study considers the effects of different dispersion levels of
   nanoclay on the crosslinking reaction of thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV)
   nanocomposites based on polypropylene/ethylene propylene diene M-class
   rubber (PP/EPDM). PP nanocomposites with dispersion level ranging from
   intercalated structures to a mixture of intercalated tactoids and
   exfoliated layers were used as the thermoplastic phase. Dimethylol
   phenolic resin or octylphenol-formaldehyde resin was used as curing
   agents, along with stannous chloride dihydrate as the catalyst, to
   vulcanize the rubber phase during the reactive extrusion process.
   Initially, temperature effects were investigated in internal batch
   mixer. Subsequently, the effects of screw speed (i.e., shear rate and
   residence time) were evaluated along the screw length. Different
   criteria such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal line width,
   bound curative content, and residual diene concentration were used to
   evaluate the extent of crosslinking, along with normalized storage
   modulus and gel content. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs showed that the
   dynamic vulcanization process improves the dispersion level of nanoclay
   in the final TPVs. It was found that the presence of nanoclay influences
   the crosslinking reaction, mainly through its effect on the continuity

Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{Phthalate plasticizers are used in the plastics industry to aid in
   processing and impart flexibility to plastics. Due to the broad use of
   plastics, and the tendency of plasticizers to leach out of polymers,
   plasticizers have become ubiquitous in the environment. Concerns about
   the testicular toxicity of phthalate plasticizers, in particular
   di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), have arisen due to their ability to
   cause male reproductive tract abnormalities in animal models. It has
   been assumed that the DEHP metabolite, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
   (MEHP), is the active compound, however, metabolites such as
   2-ethylhexanol, 2-ethylhexanal and 2-ethylhexanoic acid, have not been
   thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   anti-androgenic potential of these metabolites in vitro with a mouse
   Leydig tumor cell line, MA-10 cells. DEHP, MEHP and 2-ethylhexanal were
   found to decrease cell viability, as well as steroidogenic potential.
   The latter was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) to quantify steroid production and quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to assess gene expression analysis
   of key steroidogenic enzymes. 2-Ethylhexanal proved to be the most
   potent steroidogenic disruptor, offering intriguing implications in the
   search for the mechanism of phthalate testicular toxicity. Overall, the
   study suggests the involvement of multiple active metabolites in the
   testicular toxicity of DEHP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce and study a variational model for the formation of patterns
   induced by bringing the surface of a rigid plate into contact proximity
   with the surface of a polymeric film strongly bonded to a substrate. We
   treat the film as a homogeneous, isotropic, hyperelastic solid and
   account for both attractive and repulsive van der Waals interactions
   between the film surface and the proximate contractor. Aside from
   confirming the intuitive expectation that the presence of a repulsive
   contribution to the van der Waals potential should stabilize patterns
   that form on the film surface, we elucidate the role of repulsive
   interactions at the onset of instability. For a recently proposed van
   der Waals potential involving two parameters, the Hamaker constant A and
   the equilibrium spacing de, our results include estimates for the
   critical gap d(c) at which undulations appear on the film surface, the
   corresponding wavenumber k(c) of the undulations, and a lower bound f(m)
   for the attractive force needed to induce the undulations. To leading
   order, d(c) similar to(Ah/mu)(1/4), k(c) similar to 1/h, and f(m)
   similar to (mu(3)A/h(3))(1/4), where h and mu denote the thickness and
   infinitesimal shear modulus of the film. Correction terms due to
   repulsive interactions indicate that, while k(c) may be influenced by mu
   and A, d(c) may also be influenced by d(e). Granted knowledge of mu and
   A, our results also suggest a simple experimental protocol for
   determining d(e). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interfaces between subsystems in collaborative product development
   projects are presently defined by interface control documents. This
   paper presents a computer aided methodology for defining and controlling
   subsystem interfaces. Interfaces are considered as interconnections
   between subsystem ports. Ports are specified by using an ontology that
   ensures consistency of interface definitions among different design
   teams. Every port that is based on the ontology is eventually defined by
   a set of attributes that are derived from its form and function.
   Interfaces between ports are formed when ports are mated. The essence of
   port mating is described by logical information that is expressed in two
   forms. First, a set of requirements are defined for an individual port
   to ensure that it functions properly. Second, connectivity rules are
   expressed between ports to guarantee that they integrate correctly. A
   software architecture that operates on port information and controls the
   status of subsystem interfaces during collaboration is described. A
   piece of software is implemented based on the proposed architecture and
   its functionality is demonstrated by two examples. The examples show how
   the software can be used to replace interface control documents and
   support collaboration. The software allows designers to load subsystem
   descriptions from a shared repository and connect them together by
   defining connectivity rules. The software reports errors to designers
   when port requirements or connectivity rules are violated. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Tracking of people via active badges is important for location-aware
   computing and for security applications. However, the human body has a
   major effect on the antenna gain pattern of the device that the person

   human body is experimentally measured and represented by a first-order
   directional gain pattern model. A method is presented to estimate the
   model parameters from multiple received signal strength (RSS)
   measurements. An alternating gain and position estimation (AGAPE)
   algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the orientation and the
   position of the badge using RSS measurements at known-position anchor
   nodes. Lower bounds on mean squared error (MSE) and experimental results
   are presented that both show that the accuracy of position estimates can
   be greatly improved by including orientation estimates in the
   localization system. Next, we propose a new tracking filter that accepts
   orientation estimates as input, which we call the orientation-enhanced
   extended Kalman filter (OE-EKF), which improves tracking accuracy in

Title = {{Experimental and finite element simulation study of the adiabatic shear
   band phenomenon in cold heading process}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the outcomes of a comprehensive experimental,
   metallurgical and finite element (FE) simulation study to characterize
   the developrnent of adiabatic shear band (ASB) phenomenon in steel cold
   heading (CH) process. The main objective of this work is to investigate
   the complex interplay of different process and material parameters on
   the ASB development stages inside the cold headed parts.
   In this work, the drop weight compression test (DWCT) was selected to
   simulate the CH process impact loads on specimens machined from 1038
   steel and 1018 steel. Series of DWCTs were performed under different
   impact loading conditions. The goal of these tests is to achieve
   different deformation levels and introduce ASBs at different stages.
   To reach a full understanding of this complex phenomenon, the FE
   simulation analysis was used to support the metallurgical examination of
   the DWCT specimens. The FE analysis provided important details about the
   changes of different material and process parameters at the critical
   zones inside the ASBs.
   This study confirmed that the ASB is mainly a thermo-mechanically
   controlled phenomenon. The ASBs develop in three stages: homogeneous
   plastic strain, inhomogeneous plastic strain, and strain localization.
   The ASB development stage depends mainly on the status of the
   competition between the work hardening and the thermal and geometrical
   softening mechanisms inside the bands. The domination of the softening
   mechanisms at advanced levels of deformation triggers a self-catalytic
   strain localization and material strength degradation process that leads
   to failure inside the band.
   In general, the metallurgical and finite element analysis investigation
   revealed that under impact loads, three ASBs can develop simultaneously
   inside the cold headed parts; lower, upper and central ASBs. As the
   deformation continues; the development of the lower and upper bands
   slows clown and contributes in the rapid development of the adjacent
   central ASB. This study confirmed that the ASB has a canonical structure
   which leads to an ASB that can experience different development stages
   along the same band simultaneously.
   This study proved that the shape and the type of ASBs in cold headed
   parts depend highly on material's properties. The metallurgical and
   finite element analysis revealed that the higher the strength of the
   tested steel, the easier to form a narrow ASB that reaches the
   localization stage at low deformation levels. In contrast, ductile
   steels experience wider ASBs when subjected to the same deformation
   levels. These bands require higher levels of deformation to reach the
   localization stage in comparison to higher strength steels. (C) 2012

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to provide a robot performance index to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the actuator torque and joint rates in producing a
   prescribed robot gesture during a machining operation. Most performance
   indices proposed in the literature are only posture-dependent; however,
   to properly evaluate the goodness of the force transmission when the
   robot performs a task, the index should be also task-dependent. The
   index proposed here, of the kinetostatic type, targets applications that
   call for optimizing the posture of a redundant robot. In this light,
   dynamic effects are not relevant to this study. The concept is
   formulated rigorously for the architecture most commonly found in
   industrial robots of the serial type, i.e., composed of six revolute
   joints. Furthermore, a simplified version of the same index is obtained
   for robots of the decoupled type, while neglecting the end-effector
   angular velocity and the torque applied by the cutting force. Finally,
   the simplified index is used to optimize the posture of a six-revolute
   robot while performing a five-axis machining task, thus ending up with a
   redundant robot for the given task. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{2055-2069}},

Abstract = {{Noise and vibration from underground railways is a major source of
   disturbance to inhabitants near subways. To help designers meet noise
   and vibration limits, numerical models are used to understand vibration
   propagation from these underground railways. However, the models
   commonly assume the ground is homogeneous and neglect to include local
   variability in the soil properties. Such simplifying assumptions add a
   level of uncertainty to the predictions which is not well understood.
   The goal of the current paper is to quantify the effect of soil
   inhomogeneity on surface vibration. The thin-layer method (TLM) is
   suggested as an efficient and accurate means of simulating vibration
   from underground railways in arbitrarily layered half-spaces. Stochastic
   variability of the soil's elastic modulus is introduced using a K-L
   expansion: the modulus is assumed to have a log-normal distribution and
   a modified exponential covariance kernel. The effect of horizontal soil
   variability is investigated by comparing the stochastic results for
   soils varied only in the vertical direction to soils with 2D
   variability. Results suggest that local soil inhomogeneity can
   significantly affect surface velocity predictions; 90 percent confidence
   intervals showing 8 dB averages and peak values up to 12 dB are
   computed. This is a significant source of uncertainty and should be
   considered when using predictions from models assuming homogeneous soil
   properties. Furthermore, the effect of horizontal variability of the
   elastic modulus on the confidence interval appears to be negligible.
   This suggests that only vertical variation needs to be taken into
   account when modelling ground vibration from underground railways. (C)

   frequency and grain size on internal friction}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Energy dissipation by internal friction is a property of fundamental
   interest for probing the effects of scale on mechanical behavior in
   nanocrystalline metallic films and for guiding the use of these
   materials in the design of high-Q micro/nanomechanical resonators. This
   paper describes an experimental study to measure the effects of
   frequency, annealing and grain size on internal friction at room
   temperature in sputter-deposited nanocrystalline aluminum films with
   thicknesses ranging from 60 to 120 nm. Internal friction was measured
   using a single-crystal silicon microcantilever platform that calibrates
   dissipation against the fundamental limits of thermoelastic damping.
   Internal friction was a weak function of frequency, reducing only by a
   factor of two over three decades of frequency (70 Hz to 44 kHz).
   Annealing led to significant grain growth and the average grain size of
   100 nm thick films increased from 90 to 390 nm after annealing for 1 h
   at 450 degrees C. This increase in grain size was accompanied by a
   decrease in internal friction from 0.05 to 0.02. Taken together, these
   results suggest that grain-boundary sliding, characterized by a spectrum
   of relaxation times, contributes to internal friction in these films.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) are one example of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs)
   with demonstrated toxic effects. Yet, little is known about the behavior
   of QDs in the natural environment. This study assessed the transport of
   two commercial carboxylated QDs (CdTe and CdSe) and carboxylated
   polystyrene latex (nPL) as a model nanoparticle using saturated
   laboratory-scale columns. The influence of solution ionic strength (IS)
   and cation type (K+ or Ca2+) on the transport potential of these ENPs
   was examined in two granular matrices - quartz sand and loamy sand. The
   retention of all three particles was generally low in the quartz sand
   columns within the range of studied IS (0.1-100 mM) for the monovalent
   salt (KCl). In contrast, the retention of the three ENPs in the quartz
   sand was significant in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+. Moreover, ENP
   attachment efficiencies (alpha) were enhanced by at least 1 order of
   magnitude in columns packed with loamy sand (for IS between 0.1-10 mM
   KCl). Although all three ENPs used here are carboxylated, they differ in
   the type of surface coating (e.g., choice of polymers or
   polyelectrolytes). Regardless of the surface coatings, the three ENPs
   exhibit comparable mobility in the quartz sand. However, the ENPs
   demonstrate variable transport potential in loamy sand suggesting that
   differences in the binding affinities of surface-modified ENPs for
   specific soil constituents can play a key role in the fate of ENPs in
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{Biological systems contain biochemical control networks that reside
   within a remarkable spatial structure. We present a theoretical study of
   a biological system in which two chemically coupled species, an
   activating species and an inhibiting species forming a negative
   feedback, are synthesized at unique sites and interact with each other
   through diffusion. The dynamical behaviors in these systems depend on
   the spatial locations of these synthetic sites. In a negative feedback
   system with two sites, we find two dynamical modes: fixed point and
   stable oscillations whose frequency can be tuned by varying the distance
   between the sites. When there are multiple synthetic sites, we find more
   diverse dynamics, including chaos, quasiperiodicity, and bistability.
   Based on this theoretical analysis, it should be possible to create in
   the laboratory synthetic circuits displaying these dynamics. This study
   illustrates the concept of ``spatial switching,{''} in which
   bifurcations in the dynamics occur as a function of the geometry of the
   system.}},

   electrochemically formed NAD-radical. The effect of nano-particle size,
   surface coverage, and the electrode potential on the percentage of
   1,4-NADH recovered from NAD(+) was investigated. It was demonstrated
   that up to a 100\% recovery of 1,4-NADH from NAD(+) was possible on the
   produced electrodes at relatively low electrode potentials, making them
   excellent candidates for regeneration of 1,4-NADH in industrial

Abstract = {{Transport and deposition of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-modified
   nanoparticles of zero-valent iron (NZVI) were investigated in
   laboratory-scale sand packed columns. Aggregation resulted in a change
   in the particle size distribution (PSD) with time, and the changes in
   average particle size were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis
   (NTA). The change in PSD over time was influenced by the CMC-NZVI
   concentration in suspension. A particle-particle attachment efficiency
   was evaluated by fitting an aggregation model with NTA data and
   subsequently used to predict changes in PSD over time. Changes in
   particle sizes over time led to corresponding changes in
   single-collector contact efficiencies, resulting in altered particle
   deposition rates over time. A coupled aggregation-colloid transport
   model was used to demonstrate how changes in PSD can reduce the
   transport of CMC-NZVI in column experiments. The effect; of particle
   concentrations in the range of 0.07 g L-1 to 0.725 g L-1 on the
   transport in porous media were evaluated by comparing the elution
   profiles of CMC-NZVI from packed sand columns. Changes in PSD over time
   could reasonably account for a gradual increase in effluent
   concentration between 1 and 5 pore volumes (PVs). Processes such as
   detachment of deposited particles also likely contributed to the gradual
   increase in effluent concentrations. The particle-collector attachment
   efficiency increased with CMC-NZVI particle concentration due to a rise
   in dissolved Na+ concentration with increased addition of Na-CMC. This
   inadvertent change in ionic strength led to decreased effluent
   concentrations at higher CMC-NZVI concentrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   combination with FISH showed that the number of ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB) cells present in the biofilm was statistically consistent
   during exposure to 4 degrees C. The RNA content of AOB cells remained
   sufficient for FISH enumeration. The number of nitrite-oxidizing

   the RNA content of the cells appeared to decrease with exposure to 4
   degrees C, thereby preventing their enumeration using FISH. Water

Abstract = {{Geometrically non-linear forced vibrations of a shallow circular
   cylindrical panel with a complex shape, clamped at the edges and
   subjected to a radial harmonic excitation in the spectral neighborhood
   of the fundamental mode, are investigated. Both Donnell and the
   Sanders-Koiter non-linear shell theories retaining in-plane inertia are
   used to calculate the elastic strain energy. The discrete model of the
   non-linear vibrations is build using the meshfree technique based on
   classic approximate functions and the R-function theory, which allows
   for constructing the sequences of admissible functions that satisfy
   given boundary conditions in domains with complex geometries; Chebyshev
   orthogonal polynomials are used to expand shell displacements. A
   two-step approach is implemented in order to solve the problem: first a
   linear analysis is conducted to identify natural frequencies and
   corresponding natural modes to be used in the second step as a basis for
   expanding the non-linear displacements. Lagrange approach is applied to
   obtain a system of ordinary differential equations on both steps.
   Different multimodal expansions, having from 15 up to 35 generalized
   coordinates associated with natural modes, are used to study the
   convergence of the solution. The pseudo-arclength continuation method
   and bifurcation analysis are applied to study non-linear equations of
   motion. Numerical responses are obtained in the spectral neighborhood of
   the lowest natural frequency; results are compared to those available in
   the literature. Internal resonances are also detected and discussed. (C)

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Films with thickness ranging from 10 to 100 mu m are increasingly being
   used as the structural components of microelectromechanical systems
   (MEMS). Measuring the mechanical properties of these thick films is
   essential for enabling the design of MEMS with high performance and
   sufficient reliability. In this paper, we present a simple and
   convenient method for measuring the elastic modulus of thick films by
   loading a clamped circular film using a spherical tip. The test is
   implemented using a commercial nanoindenter so that the load and
   displacement can be measured with resolution of micronewtons and
   nanometers, respectively. Robust protocols have been developed for
   implementing the test within the constraints imposed by the
   nanoindenter. A crucial component of these protocols is a method for
   selecting loads to ensure deformation in the elastic bending regime and
   to minimize the relative contribution of contact indentation. The
   accuracy and utility of the nanoindenter-based bending test are
   discussed using measurements on thick films of aluminum and a standard

Abstract = {{Design of tall telecommunication masts is usually governed by
   serviceability criteria under high wind conditions, typically combined
   with icing in cold climates. However, there is a need for seismic design
   checks for guyed masts constructed in zones with moderate to high
   seismicity, as is routinely prescribed for buildings in modern codes.
   There have been few efforts towards proposing a robust simplified method
   of general applicability for the seismic analysis of tall masts. These
   structures can be represented by the simple concept of a continuous
   beam-column (the lattice mast) on nonlinear elastic supports (the guy
   cable clusters at various stay levels). In this study, the guy cables
   are replaced by equivalent linear lumped parameters (stiffness, mass,
   and viscous damping) and the effects of their interaction with the mast
   stiffness and inertia on the structural characteristics are discussed.
   The approach was tested with nine case studies of real telecommunication
   masts subjected to five different seismic inputs and further validated
   with more analysis for two selected masts under the effects of 81
   recorded Californian earthquakes. DOI:

Abstract = {{Oscillatory mechanical stimulation at relatively high frequencies (
   0.1Hz) has been shown to inhibit adipogenic and promote osteogenic
   differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. However, for physiological
   interpretations and ease of implementation it is of interest to know
   whether different rates of mechanical stimulation can produce similar
   results. We hypothesized that relatively low frequency mechanical
   stimulation (0.01Hz) can in hibit adipogenic differentiation of
   C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells, even in a potent adipogenic
   differentiation medium. C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in adipogenic
   medium under control (non- mechanicallystimulated) conditions and under
   oscillatory surface stretch with 10\% amplitude and 0.01Hz frequency for
   6 h per day for upto 5 days. Cell population was assessed by counting
   and adipogenic differentiation was assessed by real- time quantitative
   PCR( qPCR) analysis of peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma
   ( PPAR gamma) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) after 3 and
   5days. Involvement of the ERK signaling pathway was assessed by Western
   blot. Low frequency mechanical stimulation significantly decreased
   expression of PPAR gamma after 3 days and FABP4 after 3 and 5days versus
   non-stimulated culture. ERK signaling was decreased in
   mechanically-stimulated culture, indicating a role in the inhibition of
   adipogenic differentiation. Application of this study: Low frequency
   mechanical stimulation may provide a technically simple means for
   control of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in cell-based
   therapies, particularly for inhibition of differentiation toward
   undesired adipogenic lineages. (C) 2012 International Society of

Title = {{The dynamics of a cantilevered pipe aspirating fluid studied by
   experimental, numerical and analytical methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{73-96}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the dynamics of a slender, flexible, aspirating
   cantilevered pipe, ingesting fluid at its free end and conveying it
   towards its clamped end. The problem is interesting not only from a
   fundamental perspective, but also because applications exist, notably in
   ocean mining. First, the need for the present work is demonstrated
   through a review of previous research into the topic - spanning many
   years and yielding often contradictory results - most recently
   suggesting that the system loses stability by flutter at relatively low
   flow velocities. In the present paper, that conclusion is refined and
   expanded upon by exploring the problem in three ways: experimentally,
   numerically and analytically. First, air-flow experiments were conducted
   using different elastomer pipes and intake shapes, in which the flow
   velocity of the fluid was varied and the frequency and amplitude of
   oscillation of the pipe were measured. Second, a fully coupled
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Structural
   Mechanics (CSM) model was developed in ANSYS (TM) in order to simulate
   experiments and corroborate experimental results. Finally, using a
   Newtonian analytical approach, a new linear equation of motion
   describing the system was derived, and then solved via the Galerkin
   method in order to determine its stability characteristics. Heavily
   influenced by the CFD analysis, the proposed analytical model is
   different from previous ones, most notably because of the inclusion of a
   two-part fluid depressurisation at the intake. In general, both the

Abstract = {{In sewer epidemiology, mass balances are used to back-extrapolate
   measurements of wastewater influent concentrations of appropriate drug
   residues to assess the parent illicit drug's level of use in upstream
   populations. This study focussed on developing and refining mass
   balances for the use of illicit methamphetamine, amphetamine and
   tetrahydrocannabinol. As a first step, a multi-criteria evaluation was
   used to select unchanged methamphetamine, unchanged amphetamine and
   11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol as the most appropriate drug
   residues to track a selected population's use of illicit
   methamphetamine, amphetamine and tetrahydrocannabinol, respectively. For
   each of these selected drug residues, mass balances were developed by
   utilizing all disposition data available for their release from all
   their respective sources, incorporating route-of-administration
   considerations where relevant, and accounting for variations in the
   metabolic capacity of users of the various relevant licit and illicit
   sources. Further, since the selected drug residues for the use of
   methamphetamine and amphetamine cannot only result from their use but
   numerous other licit and illicit sources, comprehensive general source
   models were developed for their enantiomeric-specific release to sewers.
   The relative importance of the sources identified in the general source
   model was evaluated by performing national substance flow analyses for a
   number of countries. Results suggested that licit sources of
   methamphetamine are expected to be only of significance in populations
   where its illicit use is minor. Similarly, in populations where the use
   of illicitly produced amphetamine is currently of relevance, licit
   contributions to the sewer loads of amphetamine are likely to be of
   negligible importance. Lastly, the study of tetrahydrocannabinol
   back-extrapolation mass balances suggested that further research is
   required to assess the importance of fecal elimination of
   11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent irradiance level improvements in light-emitting diode (LED)
   technology has allowed this equipment to compete as suitable
   replacements to traditional high-pressure sodium (UPS) lamps in
   hydroponics growth environments. The current study compares LED and H PS
   lighting technologies for supplemental lighting in a greenhouse at
   HydroSerre Mirabel (Mirabel, Quebec, Canada) for the growth of Boston
   lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. capitata). The light treatments were
   applied for 2 hours before sunset and 8.5 hours after sunset to extend
   the photoperiod to 18 hours. An average total light irradiance (natural
   and supplemental) of 71.3 mol.m(-2) for HPS and 35.8 mol.m(-2) for LED
   were recorded over the 4 weeks of each experimental run. Wet and dry
   biomass of the shoots was recorded. On average, HPS light treatments
   produced significantly similar shoot biomass compared with LED light
   treatment, although the LED lamps provided roughly half the amount of
   supplemental light compared with the UPS lamps during the 4 weeks of the
   experimental treatment. Analysis of the lettuce samples showed no
   significant difference in concentrations of beta-carotene, chlorophyll
   a, chlorophyll b, neoxanthin, lutein, and antheraxanthin among the light
   treatments; however, violaxanthin concentrations showed a statistical
   difference resulting from light treatment. When measured on an energy
   basis, the LED lamps provide an energy savings of at least 33.8\% and
   the minimal ``regular{''} HPS provided an energy savings of 77.8\% over

Abstract = {{Protective materials and structures found in natural organisms may
   inspire new armors with improved resistance to penetration, flexibility,
   light weight, and other interesting properties such as transparency and
   breathability. All these attributes can be found in teleost fish scales,
   which are the most common types of scales in modern fish species. In
   this work, we have studied the structure and mechanics of fish scales
   from striped bass (Morone saxatilis). This scale is about 200-300 mu m
   thick and consists of a hard outer bony layer supported by a softer
   cross-ply of collagen fibrils. Perforation tests with a sharp needle
   indicated that a single fish scale provides a high resistance to
   penetration which is superior to polystyrene and polycarbonate, two
   engineering polymers that are typically used for light transparent
   packaging or protective equipment. Under puncture, the scale undergoes a
   sequence of two distinct failure events: First, the outer bony layer
   cracks following a well defined cross-like pattern which generates four
   flaps of bony material. The deflection of the flaps by the needle is
   resisted by the collagen layer, which in biaxial tension acts as a
   retaining membrane. Remarkably this second stage of the penetration
   process is highly stable, so that an additional 50\% penetration force
   is required to eventually puncture the collagen layer. The combination
   of a hard layer that can fail in a controlled fashion with a soft and
   extensible backing layer is the key to the resistance to penetration of
   individual scales.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmaceuticals are organic compounds that are being widely considered
   as emerging contaminants. Among pharmaceuticals used exclusively for
   veterinary purposes, ionophore group of compounds form a prominent
   class. Based on the usage and detected environmental concentrations,
   ionophores are considered as high-risk compounds. This study was
   conducted to determine the removal efficiency of monensin, salinomycin
   and narasin in two free water surface constructed wetlands with
   different substrates: one with a sandy clay loam soil and another with a
   sandy soil. Three concentrations of each antibiotic in water were used.
   A significantly higher removal occurred with the sandy (vs sandy clay
   loam) soil. This enhanced removal was construed to be attained because
   water was able to infiltrate more in the sandy soil, providing greater
   solute-to-substrate interaction. The correlations obtained for removal
   with parameters like oxygen-reduction potential, temperature and pH
   indicated that sorption and degradation processes could be working
   together in both soils. Among the three compounds, monensin and narasin
   were found to be, respectively, the most and least mobile. Removal
   efficiencies were significantly affected by the antibiotic concentration
   in the influent. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a spurious-free switching buck converter with
   enhanced light-load efficiency for use in noise-sensitive portable
   electronics. The proposed switching buck converter achieves low output
   noise by using a delta-sigma-modulator (Delta Sigma) controller. Its
   light-load efficiency is enhanced by: 1) scaling the switching frequency
   of the buck converter (i. e., the sampling frequency of its Delta
   Sigma-modulator controller) with the load current; 2) switching its
   operation from continuous conduction mode (CCM) to discontinuous
   conduction mode (DCM) at light loads; and 3) using a new low-power
   current-sensing circuit. The Delta Sigma modulator is designed with an
   input-feedforward architecture, which enables the switching frequency of
   the controller to be scaled without disturbing the stability of the
   feedback loop of the buck converter, and also reduces the controller
   quiescent current. The proposed switching buck converter was fabricated
   in 0.13-mu m digital CMOS. Measurements results demonstrate that this
   buck converter achieves a spurious-free output with a noise floor below
   -60 dBm and voltage ripples below 70 mV over its full loading range (2
   mA to 800 mA). Furthermore, it achieves a power efficiency higher than
   70\% over this entire range, with a peak efficiency of 95.1\%.}},

   WASPALOY}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{113-122}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fusion welding of nickel-base superalloys is often associated with
   fusion zone solidification cracking and/or liquation induced heat
   affected zone (HAZ) cracking. As an alternative joining technology,
   linear friction welding (LFW) was used in the current study to join the
   nickel-base superalloy, WASPALOY. Under the experimental conditions used
   in the present investigation, the temperature data recorded by inserting
   thermocouples at different locations from the weld interface indicated
   that the temperature in the weld area reached up to 1280 degrees C,
   which is at least 50 degrees C below the melting point of the bulk
   alloy. However, this temperature is well above the liquation temperature
   of the low melting point components in the alloy (1245 degrees C). As a
   result, liquation may occur in linear friction welded (LFWed) WASPALOY.
   The occurrence of liquation and/or microcracking was investigated using
   optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) X-ray mapping. The high pressure
   applied during the oscillation and forge phases of the LFW process and
   the resulting gamma grain refinement contributed in preventing liquation
   and microcracking in the weldments. Furthermore, according to the SEM
   and X-ray mapping results, LFW altered the chemical composition,
   morphology and size of the gamma' precipitates at a location of 2 mm
   from the weld interface. It was determined that gamma' coalescence at 2
   mm from the weld interface played a role in decreasing the microhardness
   (by 30\%) relative to the base metal. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published

Title = {{Development of fragility functions as a damage classification/prediction

Abstract = {{Fragility functions are commonly used in performance-based earthquake
   engineering for predicting the damage state of a structure subjected to
   an earthquake. This process often involves estimating the structural
   damage as a function of structural response, such as the story drift
   ratio and the peak floor absolute acceleration. In this paper, a new
   framework is proposed to develop fragility functions to be used as a
   damage classification/prediction method for steel structures based on a
   wavelet-based damage sensitive feature (DSF). DSFs are often used in
   structural health monitoring as an indicator of the damage state of the
   structure, and they are easily estimated from recorded structural
   responses. The proposed framework for damage classification of steel
   structures subjected to earthquakes is demonstrated and validated with a
   set of numerically simulated data for a four-story steel
   moment-resisting frame designed based on current seismic provisions. It
   is shown that the damage state of the frame is predicted with less
   variance using the fragility functions derived from the wavelet-based
   DSF than it is with fragility functions derived from an alternate
   acceleration-based measure, the spectral acceleration at the first mode
   period of the structure. Therefore, the fragility functions derived from
   the wavelet-based DSF can be used as a probabilistic damage
   classification model in the field of structural health monitoring and an
   alternative damage prediction model in the field of performance-based
   earthquake engineering. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Biological vessels are characterized by their substantial compliance and
   low friction that present a major challenge for crawling robots for
   minimally invasive medical procedures. Quite a number of studies
   considered the design and construction of crawling robots; however, very
   few focused on the interaction between the robots and the flexible
   environment. In a previous study, we derived the analytical efficiency
   of worm locomotion as a function of the number of cells, friction
   coefficients, normal forces, and local (contact) tangential compliance.
   In this paper, we introduce the structural effects of environment
   compliance, generalize our previous analysis to include dynamic and
   static coefficients of friction, determine the conditions of locomotion
   as function of the external resisting forces, and experimentally
   validate our previous and newly obtained theoretical results. Our
   experimental setup consists of worm robot prototypes, flexible
   interfaces with known compliance and a Vicon motion capture system to
   measure the robot positioning. Separate experiments were conducted to
   measure the tangential compliance of the contact interface that is
   required for computing the analytical efficiency. The validation
   experiments were performed for both types of compliant conditions, local
   and structural, and the results are shown to be in clear match with the
   theoretical predictions. Specifically, the convergence of the tangential
   deflections to an arithmetic series and the partial and overall loss of
   locomotion verify the theoretical predictions.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{343-374}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A pattern-based simulation technique using wavelet analysis is proposed
   for the simulation (wavesim) of categorical and continuous variables.
   Patterns are extracted by scanning a training image with a template and
   then storing them in a pattern database. The dimension reduction of
   patterns in the pattern database is performed by wavelet decomposition
   at certain scale and the approximate sub-band is used for pattern
   database classification. The pattern database classification is
   performed by the k-means clustering algorithm and classes are
   represented by a class prototype. For the simulation of categorical
   variables, the conditional cumulative density function (ccdf) for each
   class is generated based on the frequency of the individual categories
   at the central node of the template. During the simulation process, the
   similarity of the conditioning data event with the class prototypes is
   measured using the L (2)-norm. When simulating categorical variables,
   the ccdf of the best matched class is used to draw a pattern from a
   class. When continuous variables are simulated, a random pattern is
   drawn from the best matched class. Several examples of conditional and
   unconditional simulation with two- and three- dimensional data sets show
   that the spatial continuity of geometric features and shapes is well
   reproduced. A comparative study with the filtersim algorithm shows that
   the wavesim performs better than filtersim in all examples. A full-field
   case study at the Olympic Dam base metals deposit, South Australia,
   simulates the lithological rock-type units as categorical variables.
   Results show that the proportions of various rock-type units in the hard
   data are well reproduced when similar to those in the training image;
   when rock-type proportions between the training image and hard data
   differ, the results show a compromise between the two.}},

Abstract = {{The melt experiences extremely high shear rates as it travels through

   combination of the high shear rates, extensive viscous heating, and the

   understood. In this study, the morphology of moldings in the gate region
   was observed using a polarized light microscope. Moreover, the specimens
   from different regions of micromoldings were analyzed using a
   differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Two materials were selected for
   the study: polyoxymethylene (POM) and high-density polyethylene. Three
   special morphological features were observed in the gate region for POM
   but not for polyethylene. The results obtained using the DSC were

Abstract = {{We investigate the effects of high shear rate and a melt-insensitive,
   organophosphate nucleating agent on shear-induced crystallization of
   four isotactic polypropylenes using a sliding plate rheometer under
   isothermal, low-supercooling conditions. We used a bifurcated optical
   fiber probe to measure light intensity and a shear stress transducer to
   monitor the simultaneous viscoelastic response to small-amplitude
   oscillatory shear. The two techniques complement each other; at early
   times of crystallization, large attenuation in the light intensity is
   observed, whereas during the later stages, a major change in the
   viscoelastic response occurs due to the growing volume fraction of
   spherulites. In contrast to quiescent crystallization, the nucleation
   pathway of nucleated polymers after a brief, strong shear is little
   influenced by the nucleating agent but strongly affected by molecular
   weight. The early kinetics of non-nucleated polymers is more strongly
   enhanced by shear than that of nucleated polymers. Increasing either
   shear rate or strain accelerates crystallization, and we found the
   product of shear rate and strain to be useful for correlating our data.

Abstract = {{Reinforcing biodegradable polymers with phosphate-based glass fibres
   (PGF) is of interest for bone repair and regeneration. In addition to
   increasing the mechanical properties, PGF can also release
   bioinorganics, as they are water soluble, a property that may be
   controllably translated into a fully degradable composite. Herein, the
   effect of Si and Fe on the solubility of calcium-containing
   phosphate-based glasses (PG) in the system (50P(2)O(5)-40CaO-(10 -
   x)SiO2-xFe(2)O(3), where x = 0, 5 and 10 mol.\%) were investigated. On
   replacing SiO2 with Fe2O3, there was an increase in the glass transition
   temperature and density of the PG, suggesting greater crosslinking of
   the phosphate chains. This significantly reduced the dissolution rates
   of degradation and ion release. Two PG formulations,
   50P(2)O(5)-40CaO-10Fe(2)O(3) (Fe10) and
   50P(2)O(5)-40CaO-5Fe(2)O(3)-5SiO(2) (Fe5Si5), were melt drawn into
   fibres and randomly incorporated into polycaprolactone (PCL). Initially,
   the flexural strength and modulus significantly increased with PGF
   incorporation. In deionized water, PCL-Fe5Si5 displayed a significantly
   greater weight loss and ion release compared with PCL-Fe10. In simulated
   body fluid, brushite was formed only on the surface of PCL-Fe5Si5.
   Dynamic mechanical analysis in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37
   degrees C revealed that the PCL-Fe10 storage modulus (E') was unchanged
   up to day 7, whereas the onset of PCL-Fe5Si5 E' decrease occurred at day
   4. At longer-term ageing in PBS, PCL-Fe5Si5 flexural strength and
   modulus decreased significantly. MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts seeded onto
   PCL-PGF grew up to day 7 in culture. PGF can be used to control the
   properties of biodegradable composites for potential application as bone
   fracture fixation devices. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{In the present study, the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process was
   used as a technique for manufacturing aluminium-alumina composites.
   Textural evolution during the ARB process of composites was evaluated
   using X-ray diffraction. After the first ARB cycle, copper \{112\}< 111
   > and brass \{011\}< 211 > were the major texture components. However,
   with the progress of deformation after 5 cycles, the components
   transformed completely, and the rotated cube \{001\}< 110 > component
   became dominant, which remained as the major component in higher cycles
   (ninth and thirteenth). This shear texture was developed due to the
   shear deformation induced by the high level of friction between the
   rolls and the strips. Generally, the intensity of all the texture
   components, except that of the rotated cube, was very weak. This result
   is attributed to the presence of second phase particles.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the effects of strain rate on the flow behaviour
   and microstructure evolution of AZ31 Mg alloy were studied by
   compression testing over a wide range of strain rates (0.01-100 s(-1))
   and temperatures (300-450 degrees C). In addition, the influence of
   different strain rates on the dynamic recrystallisation (DRX) mechanisms
   and texture evolution was investigated. The results showed that with
   increasing strain rate, the twin induced DRX fraction increased at a
   constant temperature, and the contribution of continuous DRX decreased.
   On increasing the strain rate, the formation of twins and subsequent
   twin induced DRX intensified the basal texture in the deformed sample.
   In addition, the recrystallised volume fraction increased significantly
   with strain rate. The flow behaviour was fitted to two types of
   constitutive equations: power law and hyperbolic sine. Average
   activation energies of about 162 and 135 kJ mol(-1) were obtained for

Abstract = {{DNA microarrays were rapidly scaled up from 256 to 6.5 million targets,
   and although antibody microarrays were proposed earlier, sensitive
   multiplex sandwich assays have only been scaled up to a few tens of
   targets. Cross-reactivity, arising because detection antibodies are
   mixed, is a known weakness of multiplex sandwich assays that is
   mitigated by lengthy optimization. Here, we introduce (1) vulnerability
   as a metric for assays. The vulnerability of multiplex sandwich assays
   to cross-reactivity increases quadratically with the number of targets,
   and together with experimental results, substantiates that scaling up of
   multiplex sandwich assays is unfeasible. We propose (2) a novel concept
   for multiplexing without mixing named antibody colocalization microarray
   (ACM). In ACMs, both capture and detection antibodies are physically
   colocalized by spotting to the same two-dimensional coordinate.
   Following spotting of the capture antibodies, the chip is removed from
   the arrayer, incubated with the sample, placed back onto the arrayer and
   then spotted with the detection antibodies. ACMs with up to 50 targets
   were produced, along with a binding curve for each protein. The ACM was
   validated by comparing it to ELISA and to a small-scale, conventional
   multiplex sandwich assay (MSA). Using ACMs, proteins in the serum of
   breast cancer patients and healthy controls were quantified, and six
   candidate biomarkers identified. Our results indicate that ACMs are
   sensitive, robust, and scalable. Molecular \& Cellular Proteomics 11:

Abstract = {{This paper investigates throughput and delay based on a traffic pattern,
   called convergecast, where each of the n nodes in the network acts as a
   destination with k randomly chosen sources corresponding to it. Adopting
   Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology, we devise two
   many-to-one cooperative schemes under convergecast for both static and
   mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), respectively. We call them Convergimo
   Schemes. In static networks, our Convergimo scheme highly utilizes
   hierarchical cooperation MIMO transmission. This feature overcomes the
   bottleneck which hinders convergecast traffic from yielding ideal
   performance in traditional ad hoc network, by turning the originally
   interfering signals into interference-resistant ones. It helps to
   achieve an aggregate throughput up to Omega(n(1-epsilon)) for any
   epsilon > 0. In the mobile ad hoc case, our Convergimo scheme
   characterizes on joint transmission from multiple nodes to multiple
   receivers. With optimal network division where the number of nodes per
   cell is constantly bounded, the achievable per-node throughput can reach
   Theta(1) with the corresponding delay reduced to Theta(k). The gain
   comes from the strong and intelligent cooperation between nodes in our
   scheme, along with the maximum number of concurrent active cells and the
   shortest waiting time before transmission for each node within a cell.
   This increases the chances for each destination to receive the data it
   needs with minimum overhead on extra transmission. Moreover, our
   converge-based analysis well unifies and generalizes previous work since
   the results derived from convergecast in our schemes can also cover
   other traffic patterns. Last but not the least, our schemes are of
   interest not only from a theoretical perspective but also provide useful
   theoretical guidelines to future design of MIMO schemes in wireless
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a detailed study was conducted to evaluate the
   microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of microalloyed
   steels processed by thermomechanical schedules incorporating cool
   deformation. Cool deformation was incorporated into a full scale
   simulation of hot rolling, and the effect of prior austenite
   conditioning on the cool deformability of microalloyed steels was
   investigated. As well, the effect of varying cooling rate, from the end
   of the finishing stage to the cool deformation temperature, 673 K (400 A
   degrees C), on mechanical properties and microstructural evolution was
   studied. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, in particular
   for Nb containing steels, was also conducted for the precipitation
   evaluation. Results show that cool deformation greatly improves the
   strength of microalloyed steels. Of the several mechanisms identified,
   such as work hardening, precipitation, grain refinement, and
   strain-induced transformation (SIT) of retained austenite, SIT was
   proposed, for the first time in microalloyed steels, to be a significant
   factor for strengthening due to the deformation in ferrite. Results also
   show that the effect of precipitation in ferrite for the Nb bearing
   steels is greatly overshadowed by SIT at room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of reliable forecasts for the spread of oceanic and atmospheric
   contamination hinders the effective protection of the ecosystem,
   society, and the economy from the fallouts of environmental disasters.
   The consequences can be dire, as evidenced by the Deepwater Horizon oil
   spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. We present a methodology to predict
   major short-term changes in environmental contamination patterns, such
   as oil spills in the ocean and ash clouds in the atmosphere. Our
   approach is based on new mathematical results on the objective
   (frame-independent) identification of key material surfaces that drive
   tracer mixing in unsteady, finite-time flow data. Some of these material
   surfaces, known as Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), turn out to
   admit highly attracting cores that lead to inevitable material
   instabilities even under future uncertainties or unexpected
   perturbations to the observed flow. These LCS cores have the potential
   to forecast imminent shape changes in the contamination pattern, even
   before the instability builds up and brings large masses of water or air
   into motion. Exploiting this potential, the LCS-core analysis developed
   here provides a model-independent forecasting scheme that relies only on
   already observed or validated flow velocities at the time the prediction
   is made. We use this methodology to obtain high-precision forecasts of
   two major instabilities that occurred in the shape of the Deepwater
   Horizon oil spill. This is achieved using simulated surface currents
   preceding the prediction times and assuming that the oil behaves as a
   passive tracer.}},

   compressible polymer solutions: Early stage analysis}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{18-31}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{A compressible Newtonian-Cahn-Hilliard fluid mixture in conjunction with
   the Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state is used to develop a
   one-dimensional linear model that describes acousto-spinodal
   decomposition by pressure-induced phase separation in compressible
   polymer solutions. The integrated model extends previous work (Rasouli
   and Rey, 2011) on inviscid acousto-spinodal decomposition of
   compressible polymer solution. Acousto-spinodal decomposition by
   pressure-induced phase separation couples density wave phenomena with
   mass transfer driven by spinodal decomposition process. For dissipative
   acousto-spinodal decomposition the relevant parameters are the ratio of
   diffusion speed to density wave speed Mach number (Ma) and the Reynolds
   number (Re). Under diffusion limitation (low Ma) polymer concentration
   gradients act as a sound source in a wave equation that feeds back into
   the polymer concentration balance equation, producing oscillatory
   spinodal decomposition. Phase diagrams in terms of Mach and Reynolds
   numbers show that under low viscosity, oscillatory growth is independent
   of viscous dissipation and only arises under low Ma number. On the other
   hand, under high viscosity effects, oscillatory spinodal decomposition
   may be generated by increasing Re or by decreasing Ma. The viscous
   attenuation of spinodal decomposition kinetics and the amplitude of
   density waves are characterized. Total structure factor calculations are
   qualitatively consistent with experiments at low wave vectors.
   Acousto-spinodal decomposition is a novel process that offers new
   processing and characterization routes for polymer solutions and melts.

   of discrete random sources}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{3, 2}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{The effect of spatially randomizing a system of pointlike sources on the
   propagation of reaction-diffusion fronts is investigated in
   multidimensions. The dynamics of the reactive front are modeled by
   superimposing the solutions for diffusion from a single point source. A
   nondimensional parameter is introduced to quantify the discreteness of
   the system, based on the characteristic reaction time of sources
   compared to the diffusion time between sources. The limits to
   propagation and the average velocity of propagation are expressed as
   probabilistic quantities to account for the influence of the randomly
   distributed sources. In random systems, two-and three-dimensional fronts
   are able to propagate beyond a limit previously found for systems with
   regularly distributed sources, while a propagation limit in one
   dimension that is independent of domain size cannot be defined. The
   dimensionality of the system is seen to have a strong influence on the
   front propagation velocity, with higher dimensional systems propagating
   faster than lower dimensional systems. In a three-dimensional system,
   both the limit to propagation and average front velocity revert to a
   solution that assumes a spatially continuous source function as the
   discreteness parameter is increased to the continuum limit. The results
   indicate that reactive systems are able to exploit local fluctuations in
   source concentration to extend propagation limits and increase the
   velocity in comparison to regularly spaced systems.}},

Abstract = {{The rather irregular shapes that glaze ice may grow into while accreting
   over the surface of an aircraft represent a major difficulty in the
   numerical simulation of long periods of in-flight icing. There is a
   constant need for remeshing: a wasteful procedure. In the framework of
   ALE formulations, a mesh movement scheme is presented, in which frame
   and elasticity analogies are loosely coupled. The resulting deformed
   mesh preserves the quality of elements, especially in the near-wall
   region, where accurate prediction of heat flux and shear stresses is
   required. The proposed scheme handles mesh deformation in a
   computationally efficient manner by localizing the mesh deformation. The
   2D problem of ice accretion over single and multi-element airfoils is
   considered here as a numerical experiment. Experimentally measured glaze
   ice shapes were used to evaluate the performance of the present
   approach. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Photolytic and photocatalytic removals of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol
   (EE2) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in pharmaceutical wastewater were
   investigated under UVC radiation. Wastewater collected from WYETH,
   St-Laurent, Canada contained high concentrations of EE2 and LNG in
   suspension and coloring agent tartrazine in solution. Aqueous phase
   removals of EE2 and LNG were studied as individual contaminants in water
   and in complex matrices including: co-contaminants in water, in
   simulated synthetic wastewater and in the wastewater. After 30 min of
   UVC photocatalysis of the individual contaminants, removal efficiencies
   of EE2 and LNG were 92\% and 97\%, respectively, while higher photolytic
   removal was observed for LNG (94\%) compared to EE2 (60\%). Hydroxyl
   radicals were shown to contribute significantly to the removal of both
   compounds in water. In contrast to EE2, photolytic removal of LNG was
   higher than its photocatalytic removal efficiencies in all complex
   matrices. Higher photolytic removal of LNG was attributed to the fact
   that it absorbs UVC radiation considerably more than EE2. Lower
   photocatalytic removals of LNG in complex matrices compared to its
   photocatalytic removal as an individual contaminant was due to the
   presence of EE2 at concentrations up to five times larger than LNG in
   water, thus leading to increased competition for hydroxyl radicals and
   retarding LNG removal. In the wastewater matrix photocatalytic removals
   for EE2 and LNG were similar at 48\%, whereas the photolytic removal of
   LNG (76\%) was higher than EE2 (29\%). The applicability of UVC
   processes for reduction of hormone content in similar wastewaters was
   demonstrated. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   gradually took place; the dominant grain refinement mechanism, however,
   depended on the strain. At strains up to epsilon = 0.1, mechanical
   twinning contributed notably to grain refinement and to the formation of
   high angle boundaries. At medium to high strains, continuous dynamic
   recrystallization took place. Kinking contributed to grain fragmentation
   at all strains. The latter two mechanisms also increased the fraction of
   low to medium angle boundaries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The growing use of nanosized titanium dioxide (nTiO(2)) and zinc oxide
   (nZnO) in a large number of commercial products raises concerns
   regarding their release and subsequent mobility in natural aquatic
   environments. Laboratory-scale sand-packed column experiments were
   conducted with bare and polymer-coated nTiO(2) and nZnO to improve our
   understanding of the mobility of these nanoparticles in natural or
   engineered water saturated granular systems. The nanoparticles are
   characterized over a range of environmentally relevant water chemistries
   using multiple complimentary techniques: dynamic light scattering,
   nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and
   scanning electron microscopy. Overall, bare (uncoated) nanoparticles
   exhibit high retention within the water saturated granular matrix at
   solution ionic strengths (IS) as low as 0.1 mM NaNO3 for bare nTiO(2)
   and 0.01 mM NaNO3 for bare nZnO. Bare nTiO(2) and nZnO also display
   dynamic (time-dependent) deposition behaviors under selected conditions.
   In contrast, the polymer-coated nanoparticles are much less likely to
   aggregate and exhibit significant transport potential at IS as high as
   100 mM NaNO3 or 3 mM CaCl2. These findings illustrate the importance of
   considering the extent and type of surface modification when evaluating
   metal oxide contamination potential in granular aquatic environments.

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles from commercially available colloids were deposited
   onto a hydrogen-terminated silicon substrate without the use of a
   polyelectrolyte linker by the addition of HF acid. The deposition
   density was shown to be controlled over three orders of magnitude by
   varying the colloid concentration, and finer control is achieved by
   varying the deposition time. In order to minimise agglomeration,
   however, we show that deposition times should be minimised since
   nanoparticle agglomeration increases rapidly over the first 2 min after
   the addition of HF. To increase nanoparticle density without increasing
   agglomeration, we show that successive depositions of short times
   linearly increase the deposition density without increasing the
   agglomeration of nanoparticles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   shell and InN core, respectively. The InN/InGaN core/shell nanoscale
   heterostructures exhibit a very high internal quantum efficiency of
   similar to 62\% at room temperature, which is attributed to the strong

Abstract = {{Disinfection of an advanced primary effluent using a continuous-flow
   combined peracetic acid/ultraviolet (PAA/UV) radiation system was
   evaluated. The purpose was to determine whether the maximum microbial
   content, established under Mexican standards for treated wastewaters
   meant for reuse-less than 240 most probable number fecal coliforms
   (FC)/100 mL-could be feasibly accomplished using either disinfectant
   individually, or the combined PAA/UV system. This meant achieving
   reduction of up to 5 logs, considering initial concentrations of
   6.4.10(+6) to 5.8.10(+7) colony forming units/100 mL. During the tests
   performed under these experiments, total coliforms (TC) were counted
   because FC, at the most, will be equal to TC. Peracetic acid
   disinfection achieved less than 1.5 logs TC reduction when the C-t.t
   product was less than 2.26 mg.minimum (min)/L; 3.8 logs for C-t.t 4.40
   mg.min/L; and 5.9 logs for C-t.t 24.2 mg.min/L. In continuous-flow UV
   irradiation tests, at a low-operating flow (21 L/min; conditions which
   produced an average UV fluence of 13.0 mJ/cm(2)), the highest TC
   reduction was close to 2.5 logs. The only condition that produced a
   disinfection efficiency of approximately 5 logs, when both disinfection
   agents were used together, was the combined process dosing 30 mg PAA/L
   at a pilot plant flow of 21 L/min and contact time of 10 minutes to
   attain an average C-t.t product of 24.2 mg.min/L and an average UV
   fluence of 13 mJ/cm(2). There was no conclusive evidence of a
   synergistic effect when both disinfectants were employed in combination
   as compared to the individual effects achieved when used separately, but
   this does not take into account the nonlinearity (tailing-off) of the
   dose-response curve. Water Environ. Res., 84, 247 (2012).}},

   proposed for single-feeder wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) passive
   optical networks (PONs). Allowing a certain amount of spectral overlap
   between the uplink and the downlink maximizes the spectrum usage of
   bandwidth-limited reflective semiconductor optical amplifier
   (RSOA)-based optical network units (ONUs), while reducing the effect of
   Rayleigh backscattering. In this paper, we report successful
   experimental demonstrations up to 2.5 Gb/s symmetrical bit rates over a
   similar to 20 km bidirectional PON, using a similar to 2 GHz bandwidth
   RSOA. Moreover, we mathematically address the major design issues and
   tradeoffs. Our simulation results show good agreement with the

Abstract = {{The potential effects of climate change on the hydrology and nitrogen
   pollution of an agricultural watershed are predicted using the
   DRAIN-WARMF model. This newly developed, physically based hydrological
   model is applied on the St. Esprit watershed in southwestern Quebec,
   Canada. Under the assumption of no changes in land cover and land
   management, the model is applied in order to simulate annual, seasonal,
   and monthly changes in surface and subsurface flows and NO3-N loads at
   the outlet of the watershed under current and future climate conditions.
   The climate scenario under consideration in this study for 1961 to 2100
   is based on projections from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM).
   The simulation results from the CRCM model suggest an increase in
   temperature and precipitation in the region being studied. These changes
   result in a significant increase in simulated mean annual and seasonal
   flow in the watershed. Moreover; water quality simulations under future
   climatic conditions show a significant increase in annual and seasonal

Abstract = {{An open pit mining operation consists of various stages, and the
   calculation of the production capacities of these stages depends upon
   the available supply of ore (mineralized material of economic value) and
   waste material. Cutoff grade is the criterion that specifies the amount
   of ore and waste. The material with grade equal to or higher than the
   cutoff grade is classified as ore. The material with grade less than the
   cutoff grade is considered waste. While this explains the link between
   cutoff grade theory and the calculation of production capacities, the
   majority of optimization models for finding production capacities riot
   only disregards this relationship but also ignores expected variations
   and uncertainty in metal content or the available supply of ore and
   waste material.
   An extension to an established theory of cutoff grade is proposed herein
   to determine the optimal production capacities based on a stochastic
   framework relying on multiple grade-tonnage curves derived from a set of
   simulated orebody realizations. The proposed model (i) maximizes the net
   present value of cash flows over the life of an operation; (ii) offsets
   the initial investment in developing the constituent stages of an
   operation: and (iii) explores the impact of creating a long-term
   stockpile on the designed operational capacities. Application on an
   actual copper deposit demonstrates the benefits of the proposed model.

Abstract = {{Cold spray is a complex process where many parameters have to be
   considered in order to achieve optimized material deposition and
   properties. In the cold spray process, deposition velocity influences
   the degree of material deformation and material adhesion. While most
   materials can be easily deposited at relatively low deposition velocity
   (<700 m/s), this is not the case for high yield strength materials like
   Ti and its alloys. In the present study, we evaluate the effects of
   deposition velocity, powder size, particle position in the gas jet, gas
   temperature, and substrate temperature on the adhesion strength of cold
   spayed Ti and Ti6Al4V splats. A micromechanical test technique was used
   to shear individual splats of Ti or Ti6Al4V and measure their adhesion
   strength. The splats were deposited onto Ti or Ti6Al4V substrates over a
   range of deposition conditions with either nitrogen or helium as the
   propelling gas. The splat adhesion testing coupled with microstructural
   characterization was used to define the strength, the type and the
   continuity of the bonded interface between splat and substrate material.
   The results demonstrated that optimization of spray conditions makes it
   possible to obtain splats with continuous bonding along the
   splat/substrate interface and measured adhesion strengths approaching
   the shear strength of bulk material. The parameters shown to improve the
   splat adhesion included the increase of the splat deposition velocity
   well above the critical deposition velocity of the tested material,
   increase in the temperature of both powder and the substrate material,
   decrease in the powder size, and optimization of the flow dynamics for
   the cold spray gun nozzle. Through comparisons to the literature, the
   adhesion strength of Ti splats measured with the splat adhesion
   technique correlated well with the cohesion strength of Ti coatings
   deposited under similar conditions and measured with tubular coating
   tensile (TCT) test.}},

Abstract = {{Thermo-mechanical vibrations of a simply supported spring-mass-beam
   system are investigated analytically in this paper. Taking into account
   the thermal effects, the nonlinear equations of motion and

   principle and constitutive relations. Under quasi-static assumptions,
   the equations governing the longitudinal motion are transformed into
   functions of transverse displacements, which results in three
   integro-partial differential equations with coupling terms. These are
   solved using the direct multiple-scale method, leading to closed-form
   solutions for the mode functions, nonlinear natural frequencies and
   frequency-response curves of the system. The influence of system
   parameters on the linear and nonlinear natural frequencies, mode
   functions, and frequency-response curves is studied through numerical
   parametric analysis. It is shown that the vibration characteristics

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on a method to solve the static configuration for a
   lumped mass cable system. The method demonstrated here is intended to be
   used prior to performing a dynamics simulation of the cable.
   Conventional static analysis approaches resort to dynamics relaxation
   methods or root-finding algorithms (such as the Newton-Raphson method)
   to find the equilibrium profile. The alternative method demonstrated
   here is general enough for most cable configurations (slack or taut) and
   ranges of cable elasticity. The forces acting on the cable are
   attributable to elasticity, weight, buoyancy, and hydrodynamics. For the
   three-dimensional problem, the initial cable profile is obtained by
   solving three equations, regardless of the cable discretization
   resolution. This analysis discusses regions and circumstances under
   which failures in the method are encountered. DOI:

Abstract = {{Using the recently developed variational theory of hyperbolic Lagrangian
   coherent structures (LCSs), we introduce a computational approach that

   Cauchy-Green strain tensor. This approach eliminates false positives and
   negatives in LCS detection by separating true exponential stretching
   from shear in a frame-independent fashion. Having an explicitly

   in-depth analysis and accurate advection as material lines. We

Abstract = {{Revision surgeries of total hip arthroplasty are often caused by a
   deficient structural compatibility of the implant. Two main culprits,
   among others, are bone-implant interface instability and bone
   resorption. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel
   type of implant, which, in contrast to current hip replacement implants
   made of either a fully solid or a foam material, consists of a lattice
   microstructure with nonhomogeneous distribution of material properties.
   A methodology based on multiscale mechanics and design optimization is
   introduced to synthesize a graded cellular implant that can minimize
   concurrently bone resorption and implant interface failure. The
   procedure is applied to the design of a 2D left implanted femur with
   optimized gradients of relative density. To assess the manufacturability
   of the graded cellular microstructure, a proof-of-concept is fabricated
   by using rapid prototyping. The results from the analysis are used to
   compare the optimized cellular implant with a fully dense titanium
   implant and a homogeneous foam implant with a relative density of 50\%.
   The bone resorption and the maximum value of interface stress of the
   cellular implant are found to be over 70\% and 50\% less than the
   titanium implant while being 53\% and 65\% less than the foam implant.

Abstract = {{A new percutaneous annuloplasty technique for mitral regurgitation is
   proposed here. In this technique, inter-related anchors are first
   inserted around the annulus via a trans-septal catheter. The tethered
   wire passed through the anchors is then pulled to shrink the annulus and
   stop regurgitation. The anchors should withstand large deformation,
   applied during the delivery process, and should recover their original
   shape after being released inside the tissue. The shape of the anchors
   is, thus, optimized in an iterative process, to avoid stress
   concentration by minimizing the weighted rms value of the curvature
   along the anchor. The weight coefficients in each iteration are defined
   based on the stress distribution of the anchor obtained in the previous
   iteration. The procedure finally results in a structurally optimum
   anchor with a minimum in the maximum von Mises stress. This anchor is
   fabricated from Nitinol and tested in a cadaveric swine heart. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{We have investigated for the first time the impact of electron overflow
   on the performance of nanowire light-emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in
   the entire visible spectral range, wherein intrinsic white light
   emission is achieved from self-organized InGaN quantum dots embedded in
   defect-free GaN nanowires on a single chip. Through detailed
   temperature:dependent electroluminescence and simulation studies, it is
   revealed that electron leakage out of the device active region is
   primarily responsible for efficiency degradation in such nanowire
   devices, which in conjunction with the presence of nonradiative surface
   recombination largely determines the unique emission characteristics of
   nanowire light-emitting diodes. We have further demonstrated that
   electron overflow in nanowire LEDs can be effectively prevented with the
   incorporation of a p-doped AlGaN electron blocking layer, leading to the
   achievement of phosphor-free white light-emitting diodes that can
   exhibit for the first time virtually zero efficiency droop for injection
   currents up to similar to 2200 A/cm(2). This study also provides
   unambiguous evidence that Auger recombination is not the primary
   mechanism responsible for efficiency droop in GaN-based nanowire
   light-emitting diodes.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{For over half a century, alternating electric fields have been used to
   induce particle transport, furnishing the zeta-potential of analytes
   with sizes ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometers.
   Concurrent advances in nanotechnology have provided new materials for
   catalysis, self-assembly, and biomedical applications, all of which
   benefit from a thorough understanding of particle surface charge.
   Therefore, the measurement of the zeta-potential via electrophoretic
   light scattering (ELS) has become essential for nanoparticle (NP)
   research. However, the interpretation of NP electrophoretic mobility,
   especially that of ligand-coated NPs, can be a complex undertaking.
   Despite the inherent intricacy of these data, key concepts from
   colloidal science can help to distill valuable information from ELS.
   In this Account, we adopt PEGylated Au NPs as an illustrative example to
   explore extensions of the classical theories of Smoluchowski, Huckel,
   and Henry to more contemporary theories for ligand-coated NP systems
   such as those from Ohshima, and Hill, Saville, and Russel. First, we
   review the basic experimental considerations necessary to understand NP
   electrophoretic mobility, identifying when O'Brien and White's numerical
   solution of the standard electrokinetic model should be adopted over
   Henry's closed-form analytical approximation. Next, we explore recent
   developments in the theory of ligand-coated particle electrophoresis,
   and how one can furnish accurate and meaningful relationships between
   measured NP mobility, zeta-potential, and surface charge. By identifying
   key ligand-coated NP parameters (e.g., coating thickness, permeability,
   molecular mass, and hydrodynamic segment size), we present a systematic
   method for quantitatively interpreting NP electrophoretic mobility.
   In addition to reviewing theoretical foundations, we describe our recent
   results that examine how the unique surface curvature of NPs alters and
   controls their properties. These data provide guidelines that can
   expedite the rational design of NPs for advanced uses, such as
   heterogeneous catalysis and in vivo drug delivery. As a practical
   demonstration of these concepts, we apply the ligand-coated theory to a
   recently developed noncovalent PEGylated Au NP drug-delivery system. Our
   analysis suggests that anion adsorption on the Au NP core may enhance
   the stability of these NP-drug conjugates in solution.
   In addition to providing useful nanochemistry insights, the information
   in this Account will be useful to biomedical and materials engineers,
   who use ELS and zeta-potentials for understanding NP dynamics.}},

Title = {{Oligodendrocyte-protection and remyelination post-spinal cord injuries:
   A review}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{96}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the past four decades, the main focus of investigators in the field
   of spinal cord regeneration has been to devise therapeutic measures that
   enhance neural regeneration. More recently, emphasis has been placed on
   enhancing remyelination and providing oligodendrocyte-protection after a
   spinal cord injury (SCI). Demyelination post-SCI is part of the
   cascading secondary injury that takes place immediately after the
   primary insult; therefore, therapeutic measures are needed to reduce
   oligodendrocyte death and/or enhance remyelination during the acute
   stage, preserving neurological functions that would be lost otherwise.
   In this review a thorough investigation of the
   oligodendrocyte-protective and remyelinative molecular therapies
   available to date is provided. The advent of new biomaterials shown to
   promote remyelination post-SCI is discussed mainly in the context of a
   combinatorial approach where the biomaterial also provides drug delivery
   capabilities. The aim of these molecular and biomaterial-based therapies
   is twofold: (1) oligodendrocyte-protective therapy, which involves
   protecting already existing oligodendrocytes from undergoing
   apoptosis/necrosis; and (2) inductive remyelination, which involves
   harnessing the remyelinative capabilities of endogenous oligodendrocyte
   precursor cells (OPCs) at the lesion site by providing a suitable
   environment for their migration, survival, proliferation and
   differentiation. From the evidence reported in the literature, we
   conclude that the use of a combinatorial approach including biomaterials
   and molecular therapies would provide advantages such as: (1) sustained
   release of the therapeutic molecule, (2) local delivery at the lesion
   site, and (3) an environment at the site of injury that promotes OPC
   migration, differentiation and remyelination. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Modern agricultural production uses phosphorus (P) extensively to meet
   the challenges of feeding rapidly growing population and changing
   lifestyles, making P a leading source of impairment for rivers and
   streams in Canada. Developing effective management strategies to reduce
   P losses from agro-ecosystems requires improved understanding of P
   transport pathways in the soil. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate vertical distribution and transport processes of phosphate
   (PO4) in reconstructed soil columns using HYDRUS-1D model. Results
   obtained from field experiments were used to calibrate and validate the
   HYDRUS-1D model. The results showed that 98\% of the total P applied was
   concentrated in the top 0.2 m of the columns, and decreased
   progressively with soil depth. The model over-predicted PO4 adsorption,
   leading to a weak correspondence between the simulated and the measured
   results for PO4. This is a suggestion that the HYDRUS-1D model could not
   account accurately for the different soil structures found in the
   undisturbed soil columns and the preferential flow that occurs in these
   columns. This may be due to the fact that Freundlich isotherm, which is
   part of the transport equations, could not adequately describe PO4
   adsorption onto the soil particles.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate all-optical clock recovery of input return-to-zero
   ON-OFF-keyed signals operating at 10 Gb/s using a fiber optical
   parametric oscillator (FOPO). We first characterize an actively
   mode-locked FOPO, which serves as the basis for all-optical clock
   recovery. 12.5-ps pulses with a timing jitter of around 450 fs are
   generated. Afterward, the characteristics of the recovered clock (timing
   jitter, pulsewidth, and time-bandwidth product) are investigated as a
   function of the duty cycle, average power, extinction ratio, and optical
   signal to noise ratio (OSNR) of the input signal. The wavelength
   tunability of the recovered clock is also investigated. The results show
   that the FOPO can recover a good quality clock over a large range of
   input signal characteristics, namely, duty cycle from 33\% to 60\%,
   average input power from -23 to 6 dBm, extinction ratio above 8.7 dB,
   and an OSNR larger than 27 dB. The wavelength of the recovered clock
   signal can be tunable over 8 nm.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach, together with a new family of soft magnetic composites
   (SMCs), has been developed and optimized for power alternating-current
   applications. The different technological and economic restrictions
   needed to maximize a composite's performance-to-cost ratio are
   presented. The experimental procedures to produce sintered lamellar SMCs
   are reported, together with magnetic results and the effects of
   different processing parameters on their performance. The present
   results are compared with corresponding data available for soft magnetic
   materials available on the market (laminations and composites). Data on
   the mechanical strength of these new SMC structures are also given. The
   new process results in magnetic and mechanical properties of different
   alloy systems that are better than those of any of the SMCs available.
   The present materials' energetic losses can be under 2 W/kg at 60 Hz, at
   1 T, whilst their permeability exceeds 2000, while maintaining maximum
   induction above 1.7 T. These properties are very close to the best
   results for standard laminations on the market. The present process has
   the potential to be very inexpensive, owing to its simplicity. Even
   though not fully isotropic, recent three-dimensional machine designs and
   process advantages conferred by powder metallurgy techniques can be
   applied to this new family of lamellar particle composites. Through
   theoretical calculations and modeling exercises, it is briefly shown
   that this new kind of material can result in an improvement to the
   transportation sector where weight and efficiency of newly emerging
   electrical and hybrid power-trains are of prime importance.}},

   Channels}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{688-705}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Using a framework that lies at the intersection of communications,
   estimation and control, this work considers feedback communication over
   noisy Gaussian feedforward as well as unconstrained feedback Time
   Dispersive Channels (TDCs), and presents a linear scheme that reduces
   transmission delay for a fixed encoder dimension. The approach is based
   on Liu and Elia's feedback scheme, that is generalized in this paper to
   accommodate a noisy TDC in the feedback link, showing the usefulness of
   the technique despite the noisy feedback. This technique also mitigates
   the inherent numerical instability problem in Liu and Elia's original
   system, and does not require the solution of a non-convex optimization
   problem to find the optimal encoder/decoder for a given pair of
   feedforward and feedback channels. These advantages are achieved at the
   expense of an increase in transmission power, that becomes small when
   the SNR increases. Computer simulation results show that the new scheme
   reduces significantly the transmission delay, while still providing
   rates at high SNR that are close to those achieved by an optimal linear
   encoder. These features make the new coding scheme attractive for
   practical applications.}},

Title = {{Distributed Interference Management in Two-Tier CDMA Femtocell Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes distributed joint power and admission control
   algorithms for the management of interference in two-tier femtocell
   networks, where the newly-deployed femtocell users (FUEs) share the same
   frequency band with the existing macrocell users (MUEs) using
   code-division multiple access (CDMA). As the owner of the licensed radio
   spectrum, the MUEs possess strictly higher access priority over the
   FUEs; thus, their quality-of-service (QoS) performance, expressed in
   terms of the prescribed minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR), must be maintained at all times. For the lower-tier FUEs, we
   explicitly consider two different design objectives, namely,
   throughput-power tradeoff optimization and soft QoS provisioning. With
   an effective dynamic pricing scheme combined with admission control to
   indirectly manage the cross-tier interference, the proposed schemes lend
   themselves to distributed algorithms that mainly require local
   information to offer maximized net utility of individual users. The
   approach employed in this work is particularly attractive, especially in
   view of practical implementation under the limited backhaul network
   capacity available for femtocells. It is shown that the proposed
   algorithms robustly support all the prioritized MUEs with guaranteed QoS
   requirements whenever feasible, while allowing the FUEs to optimally
   exploit the remaining network capacity. The convergence of the developed
   solutions is rigorously analyzed, and extensive numerical results are
   presented to illustrate their potential advantages.}},

Abstract = {{Many cellular and intracellular processes critically depend on membrane
   shape, but the shape generating mechanisms are still to be fully
   understood. In this study we evaluate how electrostatic/electrokinetic
   forces contribute to membrane curvature. Membrane bilayer had finite
   thickness and was either elastically anisotropic or anisotropic overall,
   but isotropic per sections (heads and tails). The physics of the
   situation was evaluated using a coupled system of elastic and
   electrostatic/electrokinetic (Poisson-Nernst-Planck) equations. The
   fixed charges present only on the upper membrane surface lead to the
   accumulation of counter-ions and depletion of co-ions that decay
   spatially very rapidly (Debye length < 1 nm), as does the potential and
   electric field. Spatially uneven electric field and the permittivity
   mismatch also induce charges at the membrane-solution interface, which
   are not fixed but influence the electrostatics nevertheless. Membrane
   bends due to - Coulomb force (caused by fixed membrane charges in the
   electric field) and the dielectric force (due to the non-uniform
   electric field and the permittivity mismatch between the membrane and
   the solution). Both act as membrane surface forces, and both depend
   supra-linearly on the fixed charge density. Regardless of sign of the
   fixed charges, the membrane bends toward the charged (upper) surface
   owing to the action of the Coulomb force, but this is opposed by the
   smaller dielectric force. The spontaneous membrane curvature becomes
   very pronounced at high fixed charge densities, leading to very small
   spontaneous radii (< 50 nm). In conclusion the
   electrostatic/electrokinetic forces contribute significantly to the
   membrane curvature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   equations. The Coulomb force (due to fixed charges in the electric
   field), and the dielectric force (due to uneven electric field and the
   solution-membrane permittivity mismatch) bend the membrane, but
   unevenly. Whereas the bottom monolayer extends vertically (towards
   charged surface), the top monolayer compresses. In contrast the top
   monolayer extends horizontally, but the bottom monolayer compresses. The
   horizontal normal stress is higher in the heads than in the tails
   sections, but is similar in two monolayers, whereas the vertical normal
   stress is small. The horizontal normal stress is associated with
   horizontal normal strain, and vertical with both vertical and horizontal
   strain. Surprisingly, the shear stress (an indicator where the membrane
   will deform), is greater in the tails sections. Finally, the elastic
   energy (which is clearly greater in the heads sections) is dominated by
   its horizontal component and peaks in the middle of the membrane. The
   shear component dominates in the tails sections, and is minimal in the
   membrane center. Even spatially uniform external force thus leads to
   complex membrane deformation and generates complex profiles of stress
   and elastic energy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   less cooling time was obtained where there were properly distributed
   vents on package walls with enough opening area. Experimental
   validations were performed considering produce centre temperature at 4
   positions inside 3 different ventilated packages. Good agreement between
   experimental and simulated temperatures was obtained with mean absolute
   error of 2.2 degrees C considering all the 3 vent configurations. The
   study showed that for a suitable package design, with respect to

Abstract = {{Simulation tools for Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) processes are a key
   to predict and solve manufacturing issues. Despite the fact that
   numerical process analyses are commonly used to predict mould filling,
   resin cure and exothermic temperatures, more comprehensive computational
   tools are still required. Resin additives such as low profile additives
   (LPA) show a significant impact on process performance and part quality.
   In this work, mould pre-heating experiments were compared to numerical
   predictions using commercial simulation software. Non-isothermal
   simulations were then carried out and the predicted flow and
   degree-of-cure evolution were compared to experiments. Finally, a volume
   change model, previously developed, was implemented in this work to
   calculate mould pressure increases in RIM of resins with four different
   LPA contents (0\%, 5\%, 10\% and 40\%). The predictions were compared to
   the results from the mould pressure transducers in the mould cavity.
   Simulation results matched closely with the experimental results.
   Pressure evolution of low profile resins was found to be very sensitive
   to the model parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Browning of the male flower of Eucommia ulmoides, which occurs easily
   and frequently after its collection from the living tree, has deterious
   effects on the quality of the flower tea since the functional
   constitutes are mostly impaired, which nowadays has become a bottleneck
   issue in the manufacture of Eucommia flower tea. Therefore the
   green-keeping procedure becomes one of the key steps in the production
   of the flower tea. The essence of green-keeping treatment is to protect
   functional constituents such as chlorophylls and phenols in the flower
   from degradation, in order to improve the sensory quality of the flower
   tea. In this study, different green-keeping treatments, including
   addition of salts (metal ions), ascorbic acid, citric acid, as well as
   steaming and quick boiling were compared to examine their effects on the
   functional constituents and sensory quality of the flower tea. The
   results showed that functional constituents were well maintained and the
   sensory quality was satisfactory after the flower was treated by
   steaming for 30-60 s, and spraying with 0.05\% zinc sulfate or 0.1\%
   citric acid. Processing procedures of making Eucommia flower tea were
   summarized systematically based on our previous study: the freshly
   picked flowers were air-dried, followed by green-keeping treatments that
   were selected from the current study, enzyme-deactivation, and microwave
   drying. This study would provide useful information for the tea industry
   in the aspect of maintaining the qualities of the flower tea both
   externally and internally. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A thin sheet clamped at opposite ends and stretched develops wrinkles
   parallel to the direction of the applied tensile strain due to the
   hindered Poisson lateral contraction at the clamps. To study this
   phenomenon, a variational model recently proposed by Puntel. Deseri and
   Fried is adopted. The relevant energy functional includes bending and
   membranal contributions and is minimized subject to a constraint on the
   area of the mid-surface of the sheet. A fourth order
   partial-differential equation is henceforth obtained and numerically
   implemented using B-splines. Predictions are obtained concerning the
   number of wrinkles, critical applied stretches, and scaling
   relationships for wrinkle amplitude and wavelength. Both a linearized
   version of the boundary-value problem based on the small-slope
   approximation and a fully nonlinear one are considered: their results
   are found to be in good agreement for the whole range of applied
   stretches taken into account. Comparisons with previous analytical
   results by Puntel, Deseri and Fried, who used different boundary
   conditions and an Ansatz on the deflection function are also provided.
   The numerical results substantially confirm the validity of the
   analytical predictions. The present work provides then an alternative
   numerical method for the study of wrinkling in thin sheets and supports
   the use of analytical and semi-analytical solutions as viable options
   for specific geometries. Though further investigation, particularly
   experimental, is still needed, extensive comparisons of the results with
   other studies available in the literature provide confirmation for the
   scaling laws and signal that predicted values of the critical stretches
   may only be accurate for higher length-to-width aspect ratios. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The use of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in commercial products has
   increased substantially over the last few years. Some research has been
   conducted in order to determine whether or not such materials are
   cytotoxic, but questions remain regarding the role that physiological
   media and sera constituents play in ENP aggregation or stabilization. In
   this study, several characterization methods were used to evaluate the
   particle size and surface potential of 6 ENPs suspended in a number of
   culture media and in the presence of different culture media
   constituents. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence
   correlation spectroscopy (FCS) were employed for size determinations.
   Results were interpreted on the basis of ENP surface potentials
   evaluated from particle electrophoretic mobilities (EPM). Measurements
   made after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C showed that the cell
   culture medium constituents had only moderate impact on the
   physicochemical properties of the ENP, although incubation in bovine
   serum albumin destabilized the colloidal system. In contrast, most of
   the serum proteins increased colloidal stabilization. Moreover, the type
   of ENP surface modification played a significant role in ENP behavior
   whereby the complexity of interactions between the ENPs and the medium
   components generally decreased with increasing complexity of the
   particle surface. This investigation emphasizes the importance of ENP
   characterization under conditions that are representative of cell
   culture media or physiological conditions for improved assessments of
   nanoparticle cytotoxicity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a clock distribution network that emphasizes flexibility and
   layout independence. It suits a variety of applications, clock domain
   shapes and sizes using a modular, standard cell-based design approach
   that mitigates the effect of intra-die temperature and process
   variances. We route the clock line serially, using an averaging
   technique to eliminate skew between clock regions in a domain. Routing
   clock lines serially allows optimal wire usage for clock networks by
   eliminating the redundant wires required to match path delays. Our clock
   network provides control over regional clock skews, can be used in
   beneficial skew applications and facilitates silicon-debug. Serial
   clocking permits the use of routing switches in the clock network and
   allows post-silicon resizing and reshaping of clock domains. Defective
   sections of the clock network can be bypassed, providing post silicon
   repair capability. The system uses a closed-loop synchronization phase
   to combine the clock skew reduction of an actively synchronized clock
   network with an open-loop operating phase that minimizes power
   consumption like passive clock networks. Our clock network provides
   significant flexibility for application-specific integrated circuit,
   system-on-chip, and field-programmable gate-array designs, exhibiting
   good operating characteristics everywhere in the design envelope. Our
   silicon implementation achieves a maximum edge-to-edge uncertainty of 80
   ps for regional clocks, which is roughly equal to the cycle-to-cycle
   jitter of the on-chip clock source.}},

Abstract = {{Chitosan (0.1-1\%, w/w), dissolved in 2\% acetic acid solution, was
   added into 1\% methylcellulose (MC)-based formulation containing 0.5\%
   vegetable oil, 0.25\% glycerol and 0.025\% Tween(A (R))80. Films were
   prepared by casting. Puncture strength (PS), puncture deformation (PD),
   viscoelasticity coefficient and water vapour permeability (WVP) of the
   films were measured. The PS value of 312 N/mm was observed for MC-based
   films containing 0.25\% chitosan. Values of PD, viscoelasticity
   coefficient and WVP of these films were 5.0 mm, 44.1\%, and 6.0 g
   mm/m(2) day kPa, respectively. The MC-based films containing 0.25\%
   chitosan were also exposed to gamma radiation (0.5-50 kGy). The PS of
   the treated films decreased significantly from 312 at 0 kGy to 201 N/mm
   when treated at a dose of 50 kGy. However, WVP values were not affected
   by increasing irradiation the dose used. The Fourier Transform Infrared
   spectroscopy supported the molecular interactions due to addition of
   chitosan in MC-based films. Thermo gravimetric analysis and differential
   scanning calorimetric experiments showed that thermal properties of the
   films were significantly improved by chitosan loading. Surface
   topography of the films was studied by scanning electron microscopy and
   found rougher due to chitosan addition.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the mean squared error (MSE) performance of widely linear
   (WL) and conventional subspace-based channel estimation for single-input
   multiple-output (SIMO) flat-fading channels employing binary
   phase-shift-keying (BPSK) modulation when the covariance matrix is
   estimated using a finite number of samples. The conventional estimator
   suffers from a phase ambiguity that reduces to a sign ambiguity for the
   WL estimator. We derive accurate closed-form expressions for the MSE of
   the two estimators under four ambiguity resolution scenarios. In the
   first three scenarios, the receiver resolves the ambiguity using some
   clairvoyant knowledge about the channel. The first scenario, used as a
   reference, is the ideal case of optimal resolution. The second scenario
   assumes that one of the channel coefficients is known and the third
   assumes knowledge of the coefficient with the largest magnitude. The
   fourth scenario considers the more realistic case where pilot symbols
   are employed for ambiguity resolution. Our work demonstrates that there
   is a strong relationship between the accuracy of ambiguity resolution
   and the relative performance of WL and conventional subspace-based
   estimators, showing that the WL estimator performs better when partial
   or inaccurate channel information is employed for ambiguity resolution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of opportunistic multicast scheduling
   in wireless time-division multiplexing systems with adaptive modulation
   and channel coding. The problem is first formulated and an effective
   scheduling scheme is proposed to maximize the multicast throughput while
   a desired packet error rate is guaranteed. The proposed scheme
   dynamically selects multicast rates by considering the configuration of
   the multicast group and instantaneous network states, and thus it can
   adapt well to network conditions. Extensive simulation results
   conclusively demonstrate that, compared to the worst-user multicast
   scheduling, the proposed approach can increase the wireless channel
   efficiency by large margins, especially when the channel is operating in
   a lower signal-to-noise ratio region and/or when the multicast group
   size increases. Besides, the simulations show that the proposed approach
   can work well in systems with imperfect channel estimation.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic method to define progress variables for chemistry
   tabulation is presented. The method is based on a Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) of species mass fractions in the composition space.
   Analogous to an eigenvalue analysis of the
   Intrinsic-Low-Dimensional-Manifold method, the present study provides a
   rigorous mathematical formulation for flamelet-based tabulation methods.
   In addition, the method yields the minimum number of linearly
   independent progress variables for a user-prescribed desirable accuracy.
   Hence, the flamelet-based tabulations created with the new approach is
   called Intrinsically Low-Dimensional, Flamelet Generated Manifolds
   (IL-FGM). This approach is used to define progress variables for sample
   mono-dimensional, and multi-dimensional flamelet libraries of CH4-air
   combustion. The results show that the flamelets are tabulated and
   retrieved with better accuracy using the new method than those tabulated
   using ad hoc progress variables. (C) 2011 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{Stable combustion in a heated tube, with a radius on the order of the
   flame thickness, is investigated experimentally and numerically. The
   downstream portion of the tube is heated by an external heat source
   resulting in a steady, axially varying temperature gradient along the
   tube wall. Strongly burning, axisymmetric methane/air flames are
   stabilized inside this wall temperature profile which are observed to be
   ``flat{''} for sufficiently small tube dimensions. The position of these
   flames is dictated by a competition between the energy required to
   preheat the reactants, that released by combustion, and the heat lost to
   the wall. To model such flames, an extension to the standard 1-D,
   volumetric flame formulation is proposed to solve for wall/gas heat
   transfer by employing a thermal boundary layer. The boundary layer
   utilizes a non-linear, radially-varying heat source to account for
   combustion and captures the effect of enhanced interfacial heat transfer
   inside the reaction zone. The proposed numerical model gives improved
   quantitative predictions for flame stabilization position than
   approaches which neglect the effect of heat release by modeling heat
   transfer with Newton's law of cooling and a local Nusselt number. (C)

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In all areas of engineering, modelers are constantly pushing for more
   accurate models and their goal is generally achieved with increasingly
   complex, data-mining-based black-box models. On the other hand, model
   users which include policy makers and systems operators tend to favor
   transparent, interpretable models not only for predictive
   decision-making but also for after-the-fact auditing and forensic
   purposes. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off between the
   accuracy and the transparency of data-mining-based models in the context
   of catastrophe predictors for power grid response-based remedial action
   schemes, at both the protective and operator levels. Wide area severity
   indices (WASI) are derived from PMU measurements and fed to the
   corresponding predictors based on data-mining models such as decision
   trees (DT), random forests (RF), neural networks (NNET), support vector
   machines (SVM), and fuzzy rule based models (Fuzzy\_DT and Fuzzy\_ID3).
   It is observed that while switching from black-box solutions such as
   NNET, SVM, and RF to transparent fuzzy rule-based predictors, the
   accuracy deteriorates sharply while transparency and interpretability
   are improved. Although transparent automation schemes are historically
   preferred in power system control and operations, we show that, with
   existing modeling tools, this philosophy fails to achieve the
   ``3-nines{''} accuracy figures expected from a modern power grid. The
   transparency and accuracy trade-offs between the developed catastrophe
   predictors is demonstrated thoroughly on a data base with more than 60
   000 instances from a test (10\%) and an actual (90\%) system combined.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstruction of signaling pathway structures is essential to decipher
   complex regulatory relationships in living cells. The existing
   computational approaches often rely on unrealistic biological
   assumptions and do not explicitly consider signal transduction
   mechanisms. Signal transduction events refer to linear cascades of
   reactions from the cell surface to the nucleus and characterize a
   signaling pathway. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Gene Set
   Gibbs Sampling (GSGS), to reverse engineer signaling pathway structures
   from gene sets related to the pathways. We hypothesize that signaling
   pathways are structurally an ensemble of overlapping linear signal
   transduction events which we encode as Information Flows (IFs). We infer
   signaling pathway structures from gene sets, referred to as Information
   Flow Gene Sets (IFGSs), corresponding to these events. Thus, an IFGS
   only reflects which genes appear in the underlying IF but not their
   ordering. GSGS offers a Gibbs sampling like procedure to reconstruct the
   underlying signaling pathway structure by sequentially inferring IFs
   from the overlapping IFGSs related to the pathway. In the
   proof-of-concept studies, our approach is shown to outperform the
   existing state-of-the-art network inference approaches using both
   continuous and discrete data generated from benchmark networks in the
   DREAM initiative. We perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to
   assess the robustness of our approach. Finally, we implement GSGS to
   reconstruct signaling mechanisms in breast cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{A large class of problems in mechanics leads to the minimization of an
   objective function under equality constraints. In fact, inequality
   constraints can always be transformed into equality constraints by means
   of slack variables. The classical approach to solve equality-constrained
   problems relies on Lagrange multipliers, whose first-order normality
   conditions (FONC) lead to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations.
   This system of equations involves as many equations as unknowns,
   composed of the design variables and Lagrange multipliers, and hence, is
   amenable to a host of solution methods. In this paper, two methods to
   eliminate the Lagrange multipliers are reported, by which a reduced
   system of normality conditions is obtained. Reduction is conducted here
   either symbolically or numerically using an isotropic orthogonal
   complement L of the Jacobian matrix of the equality constraints. The
   relations thus resulting are cast into what is termed the dual form of
   the FONC. When the problem allows for symbolic calculations, a
   semi-graphical approach is applied, which leads to the global optimum of
   the problem at hand. However, the main novelty of the paper lies in an
   algorithm that returns the stationary points of a constrained
   optimization problem without requiring the closed-form expressions of
   the dual form of the FONC. Moreover, numerically efficient and stable
   procedures are given for the intermediate computational steps. The
   application of this algorithm is demonstrated with three examples from
   mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Pulses contain carbohydrates, proteins, minerals and vitamins which are
   essential requirements in the human diet and which could also serve as
   growth nutrients for probiotic and yogurt starter cultures. In this
   study, milk supplementation with pulse ingredients is examined as a
   means to increase the nutritional properties of yogurt and probiotic
   type beverages. The acid production rate of two yogurt starters (A and
   B) and two probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus
   acidophilus) was followed in milk supplemented with the following soy
   and pulse ingredients: pea protein, chickpea flour, lentil flour, pea
   fibre, soy protein concentrate and soy flour. The pulse ingredients had
   no negative effect on the acidification trends of the fermented milks.
   On the contrary, with yogurt culture B, pea fibre, pea protein and
   lentil flour significantly enhanced the acidification rate. All
   ingredients used for supplementation improved the acidification rate of
   probiotic cultures, and the highest effects were obtained with lentil
   and soy flour. Lentil flour had the lowest pH after 12 h which was
   significantly lower than the product enriched with the same quantity of
   skim milk powder. The effect of ingredient supplementation on the
   microbial composition (ratio of cocci to bacilli) of the yoghurt
   products was also examined. The ratio of cocci to bacilli was between
   1.8 and 2.5 for all supplemented yogurt samples obtained with culture A,
   and these variations were not judged to be statistically significant (p
   < 0.05). With yogurt products obtained from culture B, however, there
   was a higher proportional level of lactobacilli in all supplemented
   samples, as compared to the milk control; the enhanced growth of the
   lactobacilli was particularly noted when lentil flour was added to milk.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a procedure for adaptive polynomial refinement in
   the context of the lifting collocation penalty (LCP) formulation. The
   LCP scheme is a high-order unstructured discretization method unifying
   the discontinuous Galerkin, spectral volume, and spectral difference
   schemes in single differential formulation. Due to the differential
   nature of the scheme, the treatment of inter-cell fluxes for spatially
   varying polynomial approximations is not straightforward. Specially
   designed elements are proposed to tackle non-conforming polynomial
   approximations. These elements are constructed such that a conforming
   interface between polynomial approximations of different degrees is
   recovered. The stability and conservation properties of the scheme are
   analyzed and various inviscid compressible flow calculations are
   performed to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. (C)

Abstract = {{Cool deformation is a process in which a small amount of plastic
   deformation is applied at temperatures well below the transformation
   finish temperature, i.e. An. In this investigation, the effect of change
   in cool deformation temperature on the mechanical properties of four
   types of microalloyed steels were studied with the aim of obtaining an
   optimum temperature that maximizes the flow stress. Microalloyed steels
   with 0.04\% C, and three different additions of Nb, Mo, and Cu were
   examined. As well, the effect of cooling rate (1 degrees C/s and 25
   degrees C/s) prior to the cool deformation in defining the optimum
   temperature was explored. Results show that under high cooling rate
   condition, cool deformation at 350 degrees C gives the highest yield
   strength and the flow stress as well. For most of the steels, this
   temperature increases to 400 degrees C under low cooling rate condition.
   It was also found that the work hardening rate drops substantially for
   the cool deformation executed below 500 degrees C. Additionally, it was
   seen that at very low temperature of cool deformation, e.g. 300 degrees
   C, the amount of work hardening is negligible. It is then argued that
   the variations in the amount of retained austenite as well as its
   stability at different temperatures define the effectiveness of strain
   induced transformation due to the cool deformation. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   and XPS analyses demonstrate that the Ti-Si-C coatings mainly consist of
   nanocrystalline (nc-) TiC embedded in amorphous (a-) SiC: H and a-C: H
   matrices. Ti-Si-C coatings with a high Si concentration possess enhanced
   mechanical properties (high hardness), while those with additional C
   exhibit superior tribological behaviors. The increase of Si and/or C
   concentrations leads to a grain size refinement of the TiC nanocrystals
   and to an expansion of the amorphous phase. This in turn substantially
   enhances their corrosion resistance. Ti-Si-C coatings with the highest
   Si or C contents exhibit the best corrosion performance among the tested
   samples by improving the corrosion resistance of the SS410 substrate by
   a factor of similar to 400. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{On the cost efficiency of mixing optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{692}},
Pages = {{112-136}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{In this study we discuss the cost efficiency of the optimization of a
   new prototypical mixing flow, the Fourier sine flow, an extension of the
   sine flow. The Fourier sine flow stirs a mixture on a two-dimensional
   torus by blinking, at prescribed switching times, two orthogonal
   velocity fields with profiles represented by a Fourier sine series. We
   derive a family of mixers of increasing complexity by truncating the
   series to one, two, three and four modes. We consider the optimization
   of the velocity profiles and the optimization of the stirring protocol.
   We implement the former by computing, at each iteration, the amplitudes
   and phase shifts of the Fourier modes synthesizing the velocity profiles
   that minimize the mix-norm, our cost function, i.e. maximize the quality
   of mixing. We implement the latter by selecting, at each iteration, the
   best performing of the two orthogonal stirring velocity fields, i.e. the
   velocity field that minimizes the mix-norm. To obtain a physically
   meaningful optimization problem, we constrain the kinetic energy of the
   flow to be the same among all mixers and use the viscous dissipation as
   an estimate of the power input needed to operate the mixers. We
   characterize the performance of the mixers using three cost functions:
   the homogenization time, the computational cost of optimization and the
   total energy consumption. We test the mixers on a range of admissible
   power inputs using two representative switching times. We report some
   surprising results. Mixers equipped with the velocity profile
   optimization and a periodic stirring protocol cannot be optimal, i.e.
   their performance depends on the switching time chosen, independently of
   the number of Fourier modes used in the optimization. Apparently,
   optimal mixers can be obtained only by coupling velocity profile and
   stirring protocol optimizations. The computational cost of the
   optimization depends only on the number of Fourier modes used and grows
   by about an order of magnitude for each Fourier mode added to the
   optimization. At low power inputs, the coupled optimizations allow us to
   obtain an attractive reduction of the homogenization time in combination
   with a reduction of the total energy required to produce it. However,
   increasing the power input does not guarantee a reduction of the
   homogenization time. Counter-intuitively, there are ranges of power
   inputs for which both the homogenization time and the total energy
   increase when increasing the power input. Finally, for large enough
   power inputs, optimizations with two, three and four Fourier modes
   perform similarly, making the former optimization the most
   cost-efficient.}},

Abstract = {{beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) has been used as an ``anti-blinking{''}
   reagent with quantum dots (QDs), but its exact effects on the
   luminescence behavior of different QD materials have not been
   quantified. In this study, the luminescence lifetime decays of aqueous
   solutions of CdTe QDs solubilized with mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) are
   measured by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) in the
   presence of varying concentrations of BME. The decays are fit to a model
   of radiative recombination and trapping that yields the respective time
   constants as well as the coefficient of intermittency (blinking). It is
   found that low concentrations of BME in its thiol form (neutral pH) lead
   to average lifetime but increased or constant quantum yields, indicating
   a higher fraction of radiative QDs than without BME. Correspondingly,
   the blinking coefficients are greatly reduced in the presence of BME at
   neutral pH. Higher concentrations of BME reduce emission by creating
   hole traps, a process that requires several hours after BME addition to
   manifest. Lifetimes are also reduced by the thiolate form of BME (basic
   pH) but to a lesser degree than at neutral pH. Strikingly, the blinking
   coefficients are almost entirely unchanged with BME addition at basic
   pH. In deoxygenated solutions, quantum yields are decreased rather than
   increased with BME, confirming that the enhancement results from BME's
   antioxidant effects. These results provide a quantitative approach to
   studying blinking and trapping dynamics using time-resolved decays.

Title = {{Formation of a disordered solid via a shock-induced transition in a

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{2, 1}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Shock wave propagation in multiphase media is typically dominated by the
   relative compressibility of the two components of the mixture. The
   difference in the compressibility of the components results in a
   shock-induced variation in the effective volume fraction of the
   suspension tending toward the random-close-packing limit for the system,
   and a disordered solid can take form within the suspension. The present
   study uses a Hugoniot-based model to demonstrate this variation in the
   volume fraction of the solid phase as well as a simple hard-sphere model
   to investigate the formation of disordered structures within uniaxially
   compressed model suspensions. Both models are discussed in terms of
   available experimental plate impact data in dense suspensions. Through
   coordination number statistics of the mesoscopic hard-sphere model,
   comparisons are made with the trends of the experimental pressure-volume
   fraction relationship to illustrate the role of these disordered
   structures in the bulk properties of the suspensions. A criterion for
   the dynamic stiffening of suspensions under high-rate dynamic loading is
   suggested as an analog to quasi-static jamming based on the results of
   the simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure and texture evolution during hot rolling (350 degrees
   C) and subsequent annealing are compared in Mg-2.9Y and Mg-2.9Zn (in
   wt\%) solid solution alloys. It is shown that Y in solid solution,
   unlike Zn, suppresses dynamic recrystallization. Nevertheless, the two
   alloys exhibit similar, strong basal textures. Upon isothermal annealing
   of the rolled material at 400 degrees C, the texture is weakened only in
   the Mg-2.9Y alloy. The texture weakening is attributed to static
   recrystallization in basal parent grains. During rolling of Mg-2.9Y,
   basal parent grains store a high amount of basal dislocations that are
   organized in a very fine substructure. Such a highly energetic
   configuration gives rise to fine recrystallized grains with a wide
   orientation spread during annealing. On the other hand, off-basal parent
   grains with c-axes close to the RD-TD plane develop coarser substructure
   accommodating prismatic slip during rolling. The energy stored in these
   grains is significantly lower than that in basal ones (similar to 20
   times smaller). Static recrystallization at off-basal parent grains
   leads to coarse new grains and involves rotations about c-axis. The
   texture weakening induced by static recrystallization in Mg-2.9Y was
   found to result in higher ductility and lower anisotropy when compared
   to Mg-2.9Zn. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite much experience that low-rise wood buildings are vulnerable to
   damage by extreme wind events, few such structures have been tested in
   fullsize to understand how they respond to wind loads as a whole system.
   This paper presents a study that measured internal force flows
   throughout the framing of a typical North American single-story
   structure with platform construction. Applied forces were concentrated
   horizontal loads normal to walls and patches of gravity loads on the
   sloped roof. Two series of load cells were embedded into the system,
   between the roof trusses and supporting walls and between the floor
   platform and the foundation. It was observed that even localized
   external forces have effects that propagate through the entire system.
   For instance, horizontal loads applied near eave level or to the roof
   were reacted at the top of the foundation around the entire wall
   perimeter of the building footprint, both parallel and transverse to the
   applied loading. For vertical loads, measurements showed that systemic
   effects dominate the response. Observed three-dimensional behavior stems
   from the relatively stiff interconnection of roof, wall, and floor
   platform substructures. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943541X.0000439. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and its metabolites
   are considered ubiquitous contaminants, which have a range of
   implications on the environment and human health. This work considered
   several alternative compounds with structural features similar to DEHP.
   This added to the understanding of why DEHP is so poorly biodegraded
   once it enters the environment. These alternative compounds were based
   on 2-ethylhexyl diesters of maleic acid (cis-isomer), fumaric acid
   (trans-isomer) and succinic acid (saturated analogue). The rates of
   biodegradation by the common soil bacterium Rhodococcus rhodocrous were
   shown to be dependent on the structure of the central unit derived from
   the diacid used to make the ester. The diacid components of DEHP and the
   maleate both had a cis orientation and they were the two that were slow
   to biodegrade. Plasticizing properties were also compared and, because
   the ester of the saturated succinic acid was degraded quickly and also
   had good plasticizing properties, it was concluded that the succinic
   esters of straight chain alcohols would make the best green
   plasticizers. The maleate ester had excellent plasticizing properties
   but this is mitigated by a significant resistance to biodegradation. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study cool deformation was incorporated in the overall
   thermo-mechanical processing of a Nb-microalloyed steel. Included in
   this was the effect of cooling rate subsequent to hot rolling on
   precipitate formation in the ferrite phase. The results show that
   increasing the cooling rate prevents precipitate formation in the
   ferrite phase at the cool deformation temperature. As well, the amount
   of retained austenite under the low cooling condition in the temperature
   range of cool deformation, 700-300 degrees C, was measured by neutron
   diffraction. It is then shown that strain-induced transformation of
   retained austenite to martensite is the main factor in increasing the
   strength of cool deformed Nb microalloyed steel. Combining accelerated
   cooling, strain-induced transformation of austenite to martensite during
   cool deformation and a subsequent heat treatment stage to increase
   precipitation maximizes the flow stress of the steel. Finally, it is
   shown that this process also lowers the yield strength/ultimate strength
   ratio. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A slope-limiting algorithm for second-order monotone upstream-centered
   schemes for conservation laws is introduced to reduce the dissipation of
   vortices in flow simulations. The algorithm is based on the
   reconstruction of velocity components along the principle axes of the
   vortex and the augmentation of the central gradients' weight for the
   interpolation of velocity components on the swirl plane of the vortex.
   The performance of the scheme in different vortical flow problems is
   investigated. The proposed limiting algorithm has been able to
   considerably reduce the dissipation of vortices provided that the
   spatial and temporal discretization of the problem have been fine enough
   to resolve the length and time scales of the corresponding vortical
   motion. In particular, the scheme has significantly outperformed the
   conventional van Albada limiter to resolve the second peak in the lift
   coefficient spectra in the case of a NACA0021 airfoil at a poststall

Abstract = {{The presence of the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)
   in waters at low levels is a concern due to its ability to act as an
   endocrine disruptor. Ozone (O-3) is commonly used in water treatment and
   reacts with EE2 to form by-products having characteristics that are
   mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the by-products of
   E2 and EE2 ozonation and determine their estrogenicity and toxicity
   relative to the parent compound. Ozonation by-products were identified
   via LC-MS analysis. The estrogenicity was measured using the YES assay,
   and toxicity was determined by monitoring effects on histology of fetal
   rat testes and testosterone secretion by these tissues. Two EE2
   by-products were identified with open phenolic ring structures (masses
   302 and 344 u). The Yeast Estrogen Screening (YES) assay showed a
   decreased but incomplete removal of estrogenicity after ozonation of
   EE2. Histological analysis of fetal testes revealed that neither E2 nor
   EE2, with or without ozonation, had any effect on seminiferous cord
   formation; however, a remarkable negative effect on testosterone
   secretion was observed, with EE2 by-products after ozonation showing the
   most rapid and extensive inhibition. These results show that the removal
   of EE2 via reaction with O-3 resulted in the formation of by-products
   that are less estrogenic (as demonstrated by the YES assay), but have a
   greater negative impact on testosterone secretion. Thus, the
   disappearance of the parent compound is not a sufficient endpoint, as
   the by-products created may be more toxic. Care should be taken when
   implementing oxidation applications such as ozone during waste water
   treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flavonoids are major bioactive compounds known to be beneficial against

   as a food additive will help in retaining the required health-beneficial
   amount of flavonoids in the diet, and extraction is an important step in
   the preparation of food additives. Microwave extraction is one of the
   most advanced extraction methods, which has the potential of playing a
   major role in flavonoid extraction and analytical quantification. The

Abstract = {{We present a blind recursive algorithm for tracking rapidly time-varying
   wireless channels in precoded multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.
   Subspace-based tracking is normally considered for slowly time-varying
   channels only. Due to the frequency correlation of the wireless
   channels, the proposed scheme can collect data not only from the time
   but from the frequency domain as well to speed up the update of the
   required second-order statistics. After each such update, the subspace
   information is recomputed using the orthogonal iteration, and then, a
   new channel estimate is obtained. We also investigate choices of
   precoder in terms of the tradeoff between the symbol recovery capability
   and the channel estimation performance and demonstrate the convergence
   properties of our approach. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a
   Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Spatial Channel Model
   suburban macro scenario, in which a mobile station is allowed to move in
   any direction with a speed up to 100 km/h, corresponding to a maximum
   Doppler shift of about 230 Hz in this case. Numerical experiments show
   that the normalized mean square error of the channel estimates converges
   to a level of -30 dB within less than five OFDM symbols when the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (per symbol) is >= 20 dB.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of barotropic tidal energy to internal wave energy over a
   shelf slope is investigated using a nonlinear non-hydrostatic numerical
   model for several different shelf slope profiles of various amplitudes
   and widths and for a range of Coriolis frequencies. These idealized
   simulations use a linear stratification for which the buoyancy frequency
   is constant. Both subcritical and supercritical slopes are considered.
   The results are compared to two linear theories, one which is valid for
   small amplitude shelves while the second is valid for large amplitude
   shelves. Both theories are valid for subcritical slopes. We find that
   the small amplitude theory, which yields analytic expressions for the
   energy flux, overestimates the energy flux onto the shelf and
   underestimates the energy flux to deep water and that its accuracy
   deteriorates as the shelf width increases. The large amplitude theory,
   while more complex and requiring a numerical solution, yields results
   that are in good agreement with the simulations using subcritical
   slopes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One standard brand of dahi (Indian yogurt) drink available in the market
   was used for the sensory evaluation of the three samples of dahi drinks
   prepared, using freeze-dried dahi powder (20 g), guar gum (0.11 g),
   locust bean gum (0.11 g), vanilla essence (three drops) and water (200
   mL), where sample 1 (S1) was made from dahi powder and water; sample 2
   (S2) was made from dahi powder, guar gum, locust bean gum and water; and
   sample 3 (S3) was prepared from dahi powder, guar gum, locust bean gum,
   vanilla essence and water. The main objective of the study was to
   analyze the sensory scores of the various samples of the dahi drinks and
   rank the different samples according to their sensory qualities, using
   fuzzy analysis. The general sensory attributes color, flavor,
   homogeneity and taste were also ranked according to their importance in
   the overall acceptability of the dahi drinks. Dahi was prepared in
   laboratory using a standard procedure, which was freeze dried, and used
   for further analysis. A panel of 11 judges was formed for the sensory
   evaluation of the drink samples and it was found that the market drink
   (S4) is the most acceptable and was ranked very good, whereas the S2 and
   S3 were also designated good followed by the S1 designated as
   satisfactory. So the ranking of the drinks was S4 > S3 > S2 > S1,
   showing the increasing acceptability of the dahi powder-based drinks
   with the addition of stabilizers and flavor compounds. The quality
   attributes were ranked as Taste > Flavor > Homogeneity > Color, showing
   the highest importance of taste and least importance of the color as a
   quality attribute in case of dahi drinks.}},

Abstract = {{Software power performance tuning handles the critical design
   constraints of software running on hardware platforms composed of large
   numbers of power-hungry components. The power dissipation of a Single
   Program/Instruction Multiple Data (SPMD/SIMD) computation such as finite
   element method (FEM) mesh refinement is highly dependent on the
   underlying algorithm and the power-consuming features of hardware
   Processing Elements (PE). This contribution presents a practical
   methodology for modeling and analyzing the power performance of parallel
   3-D FEM mesh refinement on CUDA/MPI architecture based on detailed
   software prototypes and power parameters in order to predict the power
   functionality and runtime behavior of the algorithm, optimize the
   program design and thus achieve the best power efficiency. In detail, we
   have proposed approaches for GPU parallelization, dynamic CPU frequency
   scaling and dynamic load scheduling among PEs. The performance
   improvement of our designs has been demonstrated and the results have

Abstract = {{In this work we present a new alternate way to formulate the finite
   element method (FEM) for parallel processing based on the solution of
   single mesh elements called FEM-SES. The key idea is to decouple the
   solution of a single element from that of the whole mesh, thus exposing
   parallelism at the element level. Individual element solutions are then
   superimposed node-wise using a weighted sum over concurrent nodes. A
   classic 2-D electrostatic problem is used to validate the proposed
   method obtaining accurate results. Results show that the number of
   iterations of the proposed FEM-SES method scale sublinearly with the
   number of unknowns. Two generations of CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs were
   used to implement the FEM-SES method and the execution times were
   compared to the classic FEM showing important performance benefits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a security-constrained forward market clearing
   algorithm within which the inherent characteristics of demand
   flexibility are acknowledged when the provision of reserve from the
   demand side is considered. In the proposed formulation, we co-optimize
   the cost of scheduling the appropriate resources to guarantee the
   security of the system and the expected cost of operating under any
   credible system state. In addition, we consider that consumers can offer
   to provide spinning reserve capacity deployable by voluntary load
   reductions in response to contingencies. Due to the load recovery effect
   (i.e., since energy usage is essentially postponed when demand-side
   reserve is deployed), in post-contingency states, any voluntary
   reduction in the load has to be accompanied by a subsequent increase in
   demand from the initial forecast. We demonstrate that the marginal value
   of the reserve provided by the demand can only be calculated taking into
   account the cost of supplying the recovery consumption. Flexible
   consumers can reduce their payments on average if energy is settled
   through real-time prices.}},

Abstract = {{Lime neutralization and coprecipitation of arsenate with iron is widely
   practiced for the removal and immobilization of arsenic from mineral
   processing effluents. However, the stability of the generated
   iron-arsenate coprecipitate is still of concern. In this work, we
   developed a two-step coprecipitation process involving the use of iron
   and aluminum and tested the stability of the resultant coprecipitates.
   The two-step Fe-As-Fe or Fe-As-Al coprecipitation process involved an
   initial Fe/As = 2 coprecipitation at pH4 to remove arsenic from water
   down to 0.25 mg/L, followed by introduction of iron or aluminum (Fe/As =
   2, Al/As = 1.5 or 2). The two-step coprecipitates showed higher
   stability than traditional Fe/As = 4 coprecipitate under both oxic and
   anoxic conditions. Leaching stability was enhanced when aluminum was
   applied in the second step. The use of aluminum in the second step also
   inhibited microbial mediated arsenate reduction and arsenic
   remobilization. The results suggest that the two-step coprecipitation
   process is superior to conventional coprecipitation methods with respect
   to the stability of the generated arsenic-bearing solid waste. The use
   of Al in the second step is better than Fe to enhance the stability.
   This work may have important implications to the development of new
   technologies for efficient arsenic removal from hydrometallurgical
   solutions and safe disposal in both oxic and anoxic environment. (C)

Title = {{Characterising texture formation in fibre lattices embedded in a nematic

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{155-180}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional computational study is performed on the texturing of
   fibre-filled nematic liquid crystals using the Landau-de Gennes model
   describing the spatio-temporal evolution of the second moment of the
   orientation distribution function or quadrupolar tensor order parameter.
   The investigation is performed on a consistent computational domain
   comprising a square array of four circular fibres embedded within a unit
   square containing a uniaxial low molar mass calamitic liquid crystal.
   Interest is focused on the role of temperature, boundary conditions and
   their effect on the nucleation and evolution of defect structures.
   Thermal effects are characterised below and above the temperature at
   which the nematic state is stable. Simulations in the stable nematic
   state serves as a scenario for investigating the effect of imposing
   different external boundary conditions, namely periodic and Dirichlet;
   the former describes a square lattice array of fibres embedded in a
   nematic liquid crystal, and the latterdescribes a four-fibre arrangement
   in an aligned nematic material. In each case, the influence of
   temperature is characterised, with defect structures forming and either
   remaining or splitting into lower strength defects. For fibre lattices,
   splitting transitions of defects at the centre of the domain occur at a
   critical temperature, but for the four-fibre arrangement, defect
   transitions occur continuously over a temperature range. The
   discontinuous defect splitting transition in fibre arrays occurs at
   lower temperatures than the continuous defect transformation in the
   four-fibre arrangement. At sufficiently low temperatures, the four-fibre
   arrangement and the fibre lattice give the same texture consisting of
   two disclination lines close to each fibre. The evolution of the texture
   with respect to temperature can be characterised as a change from
   single-fibre mode at low temperature to a collective mode with a
   centre-located heterogeneity at higher temperature. At higher
   temperatures, in the stable isotropic state, it is shown that
   surface-induced ordering arising from the fibre/liquid crystal
   interaction propagates into the bulk forming thin disclination lattices
   around the four-fibre configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte films made of the naturally derived

   well-studied system for the development of cell-responsive

   glycol-modified chitosan exhibit significantly improved MC3T3
   preosteoblast adhesion and viability compared to corresponding films
   consisting of unmodified CHI. These differences in cellular adhesion are
   likely due to differences in surface topography and roughness, as
   measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM), as well as in film chemistry
   and the water solubility of the cation, since both types of films
   exhibited similar: thickness, as measured via quartz crystal
   microbalance and AFM; wettability, as measured via contact angle; and
   serum protein adsorption, as measured via the bicinchoninic acid assay.

Abstract = {{Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/clay nanocomposites (PCNs) containing 1
   wt\% Cloisite 30B (C30B) were prepared via melt compounding. Modulated
   differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) for isothermally crystallized
   samples revealed that the third endotherm at the highest temperature may
   be attributed to the recrystalization and melting of crystals,
   reorganized during heating. The first and second endotherms may be
   associated with melting of the secondary and primary crystals,
   respectively. The overall isothermal crystallization rate in PCNs was
   faster than in the neat resin. Growth kinetics revealed that the work
   required for chain folding and the equilibrium melting temperature in
   PCNs were somewhat higher than for neat PET. During isothermal
   crystallization, the steric hurdles introduced by clay layers lead to a
   reduction in the transport of the PET chains into crystallites. The
   effective non-isothermal activation energy for the PCNs was higher than
   for PET, possibly leading to less perfect crystals in the PCNs. POLYM.

Abstract = {{Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanocomposite films were prepared by
   cast extrusion followed by uniaxial stretching, using chill rolls.
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and wide angle X-ray diffraction
   (WAXD) showed that the clay layers were aligned in the machine direction
   (MD) in the PET/clay nanocomposite (PCN) films. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) showed that PCN films have higher crystallinity than
   the neat PET films, possibly due to the nucleating role of the silicate
   layers. The PCN films became hazier as the clay content increased, but
   the film transparency remained in the acceptable range. Oxygen
   permeability of the PCN films decreased by 23\% compared to the neat PET
   film. This is comparable with predictions of models proposed in the
   literature. Silicate incorporation brought about 20\% increase in the
   tensile modulus, while the puncture and tear propagation resistance were
   reduced, due to brittleness of the PCN films. The measured modulus (1.7

Abstract = {{Introduction: Over the past several decades, liposomes have been used in
   a variety of applications, from delivery vehicles to cell membrane
   models. In terms of pharmaceutical use, they can offer control over the
   release of active agents encapsulated into their lipid bilayer or
   aqueous core, while providing protection from degradation in the body.
   In addition, liposomes are versatile carriers, because targeting
   moieties can be conjugated on the surface to enhance delivery
   efficiency. It is for these reasons that liposomes have been applied as
   carriers for a multitude of drugs and genetic material, and as contrast
   agents, aimed to treat and diagnose cardiovascular diseases.
   Areas covered: This review details advancements in liposome technology
   used in the field of cardiovascular medicine. In particular, the
   application of liposomes to cardiovascular disease treatment and
   diagnosis, with a focus on delivering drugs, genetic material and
   improving cardiovascular imaging, will be explored. Advances in
   targeting liposomes to the vasculature will also be detailed.
   Expert opinion: Liposomes may provide the means to deliver drugs and
   other pharmaceutical agents for cardiovascular applications; however,
   there is still a vast amount of research and clinical trials that must
   be performed before a formulation is brought to market. Advancements in
   targeting abilities within the body, as well as the introduction of
   theranostic liposomes, capable of both delivering treating and imaging
   cardiac diseases, may be expected in the future of this burgeoning
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: The purpose of this work was to apply nonlinear
   laser scanning microscopy (NLSM) for visualizing the morphology of
   extracellular matrix proteins within human vocal folds. This technique
   may potentially assist clinicians in making rapid diagnoses of vocal
   fold tissue disease or damage. Microstructural characterization based on
   NLSM provides valuable information for better understanding molecular
   mechanisms and tissue structure. Study Design: Experimental, ex vivo
   human vocal fold. Methods: A custom-built multimodal nonlinear laser
   scanning microscope was used to scan fibrillar proteins in three 4\%
   formaldehyde-fixed cadaveric samples. Collagen and elastin, key
   extracellular matrix proteins in the vocal fold lamina propria, were
   imaged by two nonlinear microscopy modalities: second harmonic
   generation (SHG) and two-photon fluorescence (TPF), respectively. An
   experimental protocol was introduced to characterize the geometrical
   properties of the imaged fibrous proteins. Results: NLSM revealed the
   biomorphology of the human vocal fold fibrous proteins. No
   photobleaching was observed for the incident laser power of similar to
   60 mW before the excitation objective. Types I and III fibrillar
   collagen were imaged without label in the tissue by intrinsic SHG.
   Imaging while rotating the incident laser light-polarization direction
   confirmed a helical shape for the collagen fibers. The amplitude,
   periodicity, and overall orientation were then computed for the
   helically distributed collagen network. The elastin network was
   simultaneously imaged via TPF and found to have a basket-like structure.
   In some regions, particularly close to the epithelium, colocalization of
   both extracellular matrix components were observed. Conclusions: A
   benchmark study is presented for quantitative real-time, ex vivo, NLSM
   imaging of the extracellular macromolecules in human vocal fold lamina
   propria. The results are promising for clinical applications.}},

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{831-843}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a graph clustering algorithm that aims to minimize
   the normalized cut criterion and has a model order selection procedure.
   The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to spectral
   approaches in terms of minimizing normalized cut. However unlike
   spectral approaches, the proposed algorithm scales to graphs with
   millions of nodes and edges. The algorithm consists of three components
   that are processed sequentially: a greedy agglomerative hierarchical
   clustering procedure, model order selection, and a local refinement.
   For a graph of n nodes and O(n) edges, the computational complexity of
   the algorithm is O(n log(2)n), a major improvement over the O(n(3))
   complexity of spectral methods. Experiments are performed on real and
   synthetic networks to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed
   approach, the effectiveness of the model order selection procedure, and
   the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of minimizing the
   normalized cut metric. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dynamics of cantilevered flexible plates subjected to
   axial flow is investigated theoretically and experimentally. A nonlinear
   equation of motion of the plate based on the inextensibility assumption,
   coupled with an unsteady lumped vortex model for the aerodynamic part is
   used to analyze the instability and post-critical dynamical behaviour of
   this fluid-structure system theoretically. Experiments have been
   conducted in a 3 ft x 2 ft (914 mm x 610 mm) cross-section wind tunnel,
   using polypropylene carbonate (PPC) films, thin brass plates,
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets, and type 304 stainless steel
   sheets, with maximum dimensions 224 mm x 168 mm. In the experiments,
   time traces, power spectral densities (PSDs), phase-plane plots,
   Poincare maps, probability density functions (PDFs) and autocorrelations
   are used to characterize the motions of the system.
   Periodic and chaotic oscillations have been observed in the experiments.
   It has also been observed that flutter arises via a subcritical
   bifurcation involving hysteresis for large aspect ratio plates: this
   hysteresis does not occur for low aspect ratio plates. The hysteresis
   phenomenon is considered to be due to spanwise deformation of the
   plates. The effect of aspect ratio on critical flow velocity is
   investigated. The experimental critical flow velocities for flutter
   onset are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted values. (C)

Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{274}},
Pages = {{149-161}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{The tribological properties of a Ti-MoS2 coating (9 at\% Ti) were
   studied at macroscopic length scales with an in situ tribometer and at
   microscopic length scales with a nanoindentation instrument equipped for
   microsliding experiments. Measurements were conducted in controlled
   environments at both low and high humidity (i.e. similar to 4\%RH and
   similar to 35\%RH). Reciprocating micro- and macro-sliding tests were
   performed with spherical diamond tip with a 50 mu m radius and a
   sapphire tip with a radius of 3.175 mm, respectively. For both scales,
   the range of Hertzian contact pressures was between 0.41 GPa and 1.2
   GPa. In situ video microscopy observations identified that the dominant
   velocity accommodation mode at macro-scale was interfacial sliding.
   However, an additional velocity accommodation mode, transfer film
   shearing, was also observed with higher humidity. Overall higher
   friction was observed with microtribology compared to macrotribology.
   The higher coefficient of friction was attributed to three different
   stages during the sliding process, which were identified with respect to
   different contact pressures, contact areas, tip shapes, and
   environmental conditions. The first two stages exhibited a solid
   lubrication behavior with some combination of interfacial sliding,
   transfer film shearing and microplowing. The transfer film thicknesses
   for these stages, normalized to the initial Hertzian contact radius,
   fell in a range of 0.001-0.1. For the third stage, the dominant VAM was
   plowing and the normalized transfer film thickness fell below this
   range. Comparisons between the two scales demonstrated that for dry
   sliding, microscopic contacts on Ti-MoS2 deviate slightly from
   macroscopic behavior, showing higher limiting friction and microplowing.
   For humid sliding, microscopic contacts deviate significantly from
   macroscopic behavior, showing plowing behavior and absence of transfer
   films. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultramafic ores are a potential major resource of nickel. For the
   Thompson area deposits of northern Manitoba, Canada, a processing
   challenge is the serpentine polymorph chrysotile, the dominant gangue
   mineral. Due to its fibrous nature chrysotile causes physical
   entanglement and increased pulp viscosity which reduces selectivity in
   flotation. The proposed approach involves disintegration of the fibers
   by a combination of chemical (H2SO4) and mechanical (grinding) treatment
   adapting technology explored for CO2 sequestration. The use of H2SO4
   also led to collectorless flotation traced to elemental sulphur
   formation, and release of magnesium increased solution ionic strength
   sufficient to eliminate the need for frother. Significant improvement in
   Ni grade-recovery with higher rejection of MgO-bearing gangue was
   achieved compared to untreated ore. Structural changes in the fibers
   were followed using spectroscopic techniques. A mechanism of fiber
   disintegration is suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Comparison of multiple linear and nonlinear regression, autoregressive

Abstract = {{Daily water demand forecasts are an important component of
   cost-effective and sustainable management and optimization of urban
   water supply systems. In this study, a method based on coupling discrete
   wavelet transforms (WA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for urban
   water demand forecasting applications is proposed and tested. Multiple
   linear regression (MLR), multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR),
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ANN and WA-ANN models
   for urban water demand forecasting at lead times of one day for the
   summer months (May to August) were developed, and their relative
   performance was compared using the coefficient of determination, root
   mean square error, relative root mean square error, and efficiency
   index. The key variables used to develop and validate the models were
   daily total precipitation, daily maximum temperature, and daily water
   demand data from 2001 to 2009 in the city of Montreal, Canada. The
   WA-ANN models were found to provide more accurate urban water demand
   forecasts than the MLR, MNLR, ARIMA, and ANN models. The results of this
   study indicate that coupled wavelet-neural network models are a
   potentially promising new method of urban water demand forecasting that
   merit further study.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale cubic InN nanocrystals were synthesized by a combined
   solution- and vapor-phase method under silica confinement. Nearly
   monodisperse cubic InN nanocrystals with uniform spherical shape were
   dispersed stably in various organic solvents after removal of the silica
   shells. The average size of InN nanocrystals is 5.7 +/- 0.6 nm. Powder
   X-ray diffraction results indicate that the InN nanocrystals are of high
   crystallinity with a cubic phase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirm that the nanocrystals are
   composed of In and N elements. The InN nanocrystals exhibit infrared
   photoluminescence at room temperature, with a peak energy of similar to
   0.62 eV, which is smaller than that of high-quality wurtzite InN
   (similar to 0.65-0.7 eV) and is in agreement with theoretical
   calculations. The small emission peak energy of InN nanocrystals, as
   compared to other low-cost solution or vapor methods, reveals the
   superior crystalline quality of our samples, with low or negligible
   defect density. This work will significantly promote InN-based
   applications in IR optoelectronic device and biology.}},

Abstract = {{The development of versatile biofunctional surfaces is a fundamental
   prerequisite in designing Lab on a Chip (LOC) devices for applications
   in biosensing interfaces and microbioreactors. The current paper
   presents a rapid combinatorial approach to create multiplex protein
   patterns in a single microfluidic channel. This approach consists of
   coupling microcontact printing with microfluidic patterning, where
   microcontact printing is employed for silanization using (3-Aminopropyl)
   triethoxysilane (APTES), followed by microfluidic patterning of multiple
   antibodies. As a result, the biomolecules of choice could be covalently
   attached to the microchannel surface, thus creating a durable and highly
   resistant functional interface. Moreover, the experimental procedure was
   designed to create a microfluidic platform that maintains functionality
   at high flow rates. The functionalized surfaces were characterized using
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and monitored with fluorescence
   microscopy at each step of functionalization. To illustrate the
   possibility of patterning multiple biomolecules along the cross section
   of a single microfluidic channel, microarrays of five different primary
   antibodies were patterned onto a single channel and their functionality
   was evaluated accordingly through a multiplex immunoassay using
   secondary antibodies specific to each patterned primary antibody. The
   resulting patterns remained stable at shear stresses of up to 50
   dyn/cm(2). The overall findings suggest that the developed multiplex
   functional interface on a single channel can successfully lead to highly
   resistant multiplex functional surfaces for high throughput biological
   assays.}},

Abstract = {{Large-amplitude (geometrically nonlinear) forced vibrations of a
   stainless-steel thin rectangular plate carrying different concentrated
   masses are experimentally studied. The experimental boundary conditions
   are close to those of a clamped plate. The plate is vertically and
   horizontally tested in order to investigate the gravity effect. Harmonic
   excitation is applied by using electrodynamic exciter and the plate
   vibration is measured by using a laser Doppler vibrometer with
   displacement decoder. The harmonic excitation is controlled in
   closed-loop in order to keep constant the desired force and is increased
   (or decreased) by very small discrete steps. Numerical simulations on
   reduced-order models, obtained by using Von Karman nonlinear plate
   theory and global discretization, are also carried out and compared to
   experiments in order to better understand the system. Results show that
   concentrated masses have no effect on the trend of nonlinearity of the
   vertical plate, while they play a role in case of horizontal plate due
   to the static flexural deflection caused by gravity, which reduces the
   hardening-type nonlinearity. Initial geometric imperfection (deviation
   from flat surface in vertical position) of the plate is measured and
   taken into account: it plays a significant role. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS). Conventional
   techniques for manufacturing metal sulfides are complex, environmentally
   harmful, and not suitable for producing complex-shape articles. To
   overcome these disadvantages, a new method for the preparation of the
   metal-sulfur precursor charge is proposed, which can be described as
   reactive casting. The first cermet samples produced with the SHS process
   were found to be very porous, brittle, and have low mechanical strength.
   The possible sources for the generation of porosity were identified and
   analyzed and the process for manufacturing the cermet was modified. By
   improving the manufacturing process, the porosity inside the produced
   cermets was reduced from 70\% to 12\%.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a problem where agents gossip on a d-dimensional state
   vector. The goal is to achieve a consensus on the average. However,
   instead of computing the average of the entire d-dimensional state, the
   goal is to have all agents reach a consensus on the largest k entries of
   the average initial state vector. For example, the value in each entry
   could correspond to the agents' opinions about a different item, in
   which case the goal is to determine which are the k most popular items,
   on average. A primary challenge is that the indices of the k largest
   entries are not known a priori, and so the agents must adaptively
   identify which entries are the largest while also computing their
   values. We consider an asynchronous gossip-style algorithm where pairs
   of agents interact, communicate, and update only those state entries
   which either agent currently believes to be one of the largest k. We
   show that, as long as the underlying communication graph is connected,
   the algorithm converges to a state where all agents reach a consensus on
   the indices and values of the largest k entries of the initial average.
   We study, via numerical simulation, the convergence rate of the
   algorithm in terms of the total number of scalar values transmitted to
   reach a desired level of accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a large population dynamic game involving nonlinear
   stochastic dynamical systems with agents of the following mixed types:
   (i) a major agent, and (ii) a large N population of minor agents. The
   major and minor agents are coupled via both: (i) their individual
   nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii) their individual finite time
   horizon nonlinear cost functions. We approach this problem by the
   so-called epsilon-Nash Mean Field Games (epsilon-NMFG) theory. In this
   problem even asymptotically (as the population size N approaches
   infinity) the noise process of the major agent causes random fluctuation
   of the mean field behaviour of the minor agents. To deal with this, the
   overall asymptotic (N -> infinity) mean field game problem is decomposed
   into: (i) two non-standard stochastic optimal control problems with
   random coefficient processes, and (ii) two stochastic (coefficient)
   McKean-Vlasov (SMV) equations which characterize the state of the major
   agent and the measure determining the mean field behaviour of the minor
   agents. (i) and (ii) are coupled by the (forward adapted) stochastic
   best response processes determined from the solution of (backward in
   time) stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (SHJB) equations for the
   nonstandard optimal control problems in (i) which involve the state of
   the major agent and the distribution measure corresponding to the mean
   field behaviour of the minor agents in (ii) where these in turn depend
   upon the best response control processes themselves. When the so-called
   stochastic Mean Field (SMF) system (SHJB and SMV equations) is soluble
   we say the resulting framework is one of epsilon-NMFG type.}},

Abstract = {{We model the power market as a dynamic large population game where
   suppliers and consumers submit their bids in real-time. The agents are
   coupled in their dynamics and cost functions through the price process.
   The control action computation complexity and information exchange
   requirements for each agent increase as the number of agents in the
   system increases, and this naturally leads to computational
   intractability. We apply the mean field methodology to study the limit
   behaviour of a large population of agents, and present a decentralized
   algorithm where agents submit their bids solely following the price
   signal and using statistical information that is measured from the
   entire population. We show that under some restrictions on the
   population parameter distributions the proposed algorithm gives rise to
   a situation where (i) all agent systems are L-2 stable, and (ii) the set
   of controls yields an is an element of-Nash equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{We model the continuous-time power market as an optimal control problem
   where the demand and supply processes are governed by stochastic
   differential equations controlled by the price. We first analyze the
   efficiency of an intermittent supplier which is characterized by cheap
   production with high supply volatility. We show that for a sufficiently
   high intermittent supply volatility, the intermittent supplier
   negatively impacts the social efficiency. Next, we introduce a novel
   market mechanism for power markets: we define one price process for
   supply subject to friction and another price for frictionless ancillary
   supply with a marginal cost of production higher than that of the
   regular supply. We show that (i) the negative efficiency impact of the
   intermittent supplier due to stochasticity and uncontrollability can be
   offset with the new double price market mechanism, and (ii) the
   volatility of the price can be decreased with the new double price
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the microstructure during friction stir welding of a

   relationship between grain structure, precipitate density and morphology
   behind the observed changes in mechanical properties during post weld
   artificial ageing. The ability of welds to recover hardness and strength
   during post weld heat treatment was linked to the limited formation of
   large scale precipitates which act as sinks for alloying elements. Welds
   obtained with high tool rotation speed (within parameters studied)
   showed ultimate tensile strength levels of about 93\% of the base metal,
   an elongation of 6\% at fracture, and hardness values ranging between
   120-140 HV in the stir zone, thermo-mechanically affected zone, and heat

Abstract = {{Electrospark deposition (ESD) is a rapid solidification processing
   technique capable of depositing a metal onto a conductive substrate. The
   short pulse duration and high pulse frequency, combined with the small
   amount of material transferred during each pulse, results in high
   cooling rates being realized, on the order of 10(5)-10(6) C/sec. This
   study investigates the ability to induce solute trapping behavior, for a
   new generation aluminum-lithium alloy, AA2199, using ESD.
   Time-of-Flight Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) and X-Ray
   Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to determine solute
   distribution. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Scanning Transmission
   Electron Microscopy analysis were performed to investigate the
   microstructure of the rapidly solidified Al-Li deposits.
   TOF-SIMS and XPS data displayed a homogeneous distribution of lithium
   throughout the deposits, while the microscopy analysis revealed the
   presence of copper rich cells. It was therefore possible to validate the
   solidification front velocity of the ESD process, through comparison
   with Mullins and Sekerka model for interface stability.}},

   done by deriving the relation between tail probability of l(2)-norms and
   satisfaction of RIP. The obtained relation is then used to compare our

   terms of RIP satisfaction. Finally, we present our numerical

Abstract = {{This paper presents a CSMA-based opportunistic spectrum access for
   secondary users (SUs) from a game-theoretic perspective. A key
   requirement for efficient design of CSMA-based access schemes for SUs is
   to address competition among SUs. Thus, to enable contention control in
   consideration of competition among SUs, an adaptive SU access approach
   based on a modified CSMA scheme is presented in which each SU accesses
   multiple idle frequency-slots of a licensed frequency band with
   different probabilities. The problem of finding optimal access
   probabilities of SUs is cast in a game-theoretic framework to highlight
   the issues of competition and cooperation among SUs. Subsequently, the
   existence, uniqueness and efficiency of Nash Equilibrium (NE) are
   investigated. To improve the efficiency of the unique NE in the
   competitive design, the game is transformed into a more cooperative
   framework exploiting a pricing mechanism. Finally, an algorithm based on
   the best response dynamics is developed in which each SU independently
   updates its access probabilities until convergence to the unique NE.}},

Abstract = {{To enhance the capacity of patients supported by wireless in-hospital
   monitoring systems, a bandwidth allocation scheme for the transmission
   of medical data in the wireless local area network (WLAN) is proposed.
   The problem of bandwidth allocation, subject to limited wireless
   bandwidth, quality of service (QoS) requirements of medical data
   transmission, as well as electromagnetic interference, is modeled as a
   non-polynomial (NP) optimization problem. To save the computation time
   of this NP problem, we propose an accelerated genetic algorithm by
   dynamically adjusting both the inheritance probability and the mutation
   probability, and then compare it with other off-the-shelf genetic
   algorithms. Our study shows that our proposed algorithm can save
   computation time and attain the same result of bandwidth allocation in
   comparison with other algorithms.}},

   independently adjusts its activity factors by learning other SUs'

Abstract = {{The effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) on operations of
   sensitive medical devices have been recognized as a critical concern
   related to safety in hospitals and healthcare institutions. This paper
   proposes an adaptive and distributed routing protocol that attempts to
   reduce the EMI introduced by a medical wireless sensor network (MWSN).
   The proposed algorithm, namely EMI-aware routing protocol (EMIR),
   assigns to each node a potential value which is dynamically calculated
   in such a way that network traffic tends to be deflected from nodes that
   are radiating high EMI and/or locating far away from gateways.
   Experiments in a real-life IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN implemented with the
   EMIR demonstrate that, compared to the shortest path routing, the
   proposed algorithm can significantly suppress the level of the EMI in
   the surrounding area where the WSN is deployed. Besides, the EMIR is
   scalable to the network size because it only requires one-hop neighbor
   information.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the maximization of the weighted sum-rate
   in the multicell MIMO multiple access channel (MAC). Considered is the
   multicell network operating on the same frequency channel with multiple
   mobile stations (MS) per cell. Assuming the interference coordination
   mode in the multicell network, each base-station (BS) only decodes the
   signals for the MSs within its cell. However, the uplink covariance
   matrices at the MSs are jointly designed between the BSs in order to
   optimize the network-wide weighted sum-rate. Since this optimization is
   shown to be a nonconvex problem, obtaining its globally optimal solution
   is very hard. By applying successive approximation technique, a
   distributed algorithm is then proposed to efficiently achieve a locally
   optimal solution. Nonetheless, simulations then show that the proposed
   algorithm can significantly improve the network-wide sum-rate, compared
   to the case with no interference coordination between the BSs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the achievable rate and ergodic capacity
   of a general non-symmetric half-duplex non-orthogonal
   amplify-and-forward (NAF) single-relay channel in Rayleigh fading
   environments, assuming that the channel state information is only
   available at the destination. The considered channel, which captures
   pathloss and shadowing effects over the transmission links, includes the
   symmetric one as a special case. At first, for a given power allocation
   scheme, simple and closed-form expressions of the upper and lower bounds
   on the achievable rate are derived. As shown by various numerical
   examples, the gap between the upper and lower bounds is small in the
   entire range of SNRs, which makes them useful in finding the optimal
   power allocation solution to achieve the capacity. Focusing on the two
   extreme cases of low and high SNRs, we then provide relatively tight
   approximations of the achievable rate. Using these approximations, it is
   then revealed that at both high and low SNR regimes, the ergodic
   capacity is achieved when the relay is inactive. Equivalently, NAF
   relaying does not yield any advantage over direct transmission at low
   and high SNRs. The results and observations in this paper therefore
   provide some further important insights on NAF relaying.}},

Abstract = {{Large-amplitude nonlinear forced vibrations of a circular cylindrical
   panel with a complex base, clamped at the edges are investigated. The
   Sanders-Koiter and the Donnell nonlinear shell theories are used to

   technique based on classic approximate functions and the R-function
   theory is used to build the discrete model of the nonlinear vibrations.
   This allows for constructing the sequences of admissible functions that
   satisfy given boundary conditions in domains with complex geometries.
   The problem is solved in two steps: a linear analysis is conducted to
   identify natural frequencies and corresponding natural modes to be used
   in the second step as a basis for nonlinear displacements. The system of
   ordinary differential equations is obtained by using the Lagrange
   approach on both steps. Numerical responses are obtained in the spectral
   neighborhood of the lowest natural frequency. The convergence of
   nonlinear responses is investigated.}},

   texture evolution is increased by increasing strain rate. The
   deformation mechanism was changed by increasing the strain rate for ND

   analysis of the heat treated alloys generally agreed with thermodynamic
   calculations. Hot compression tests were also conducted on solution
   treated alloys at 350 degrees C with a strain rate of 0.01s(-1) and

Abstract = {{Magnesium alloys are very popular in the automobile industry due to its
   high strength to weight ratio. However, the use of commercial magnesium
   alloys as sheet is limited by room temperature ductility. One way to
   improve the ductility may be to form precipitates during hot rolling.
   These may delay dynamic recrystallization. possibly leading to grain
   refinement, which is known to improve ductility. Equilibrium diagrams
   obtained from thermodynamic modeling software FactSage were used to
   design Mg-3Al-2Sn alloy, which should form Mg2Sn precipitates during hot
   rolling temperatures around 300 degrees C. To investigate this
   prediction, the alloy was cast in a copper mould and precipitates
   formation characteristics were studied by using optical microscope (OM),
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).}},

   analysis for structures designed with material and geometric symmetries
   may lead to unexpected coupling that stems from discretization error.
   Hence, decoupling of the Cartesian stiffness matrix becomes essential
   for design and analysis. This paper reports a numerical method for
   decoupling the Cartesian stiffness matrix, based on screw theory. With
   the aid of this method, the translational and rotational stiffness
   matrices can be analyzed independently. The mechanical properties of the
   decoupled stiffness submatrices are investigated via their associated
   eigenvalue analyses. The decoupling technique is applied to the design
   of two accelerometer layouts, uniaxial and biaxial, with what the
   authors term simplicial architectures. The decoupled stiffness matrices
   reveal acceptable compliance along the sensitive axes and high off-axis

Abstract = {{Chaotic vibrations of functionally graded doubly curved shells subjected
   to concentrated harmonic load are investigated. It is assumed that the
   shell is simply supported and the edges can move freely in in-plane

   governing partial differential equations are obtained in terms of
   shell's transverse displacement and Airy's stress function. By using
   Galerkin's technique, the equations of motion are reduced to a set of
   infinite nonlinear ordinary differential equations with cubic and
   quadratic nonlinearities. A bifurcation analysis is carried out and the
   discretized equations are integrated at (i) fixed excitation frequencies
   and variable excitation amplitudes and (ii) fixed excitation amplitudes
   and variable excitation frequencies. In particular, Gear's backward
   differentiation formula is used to obtain bifurcation diagrams, Poincare
   maps and time histories. Furthermore, maximum Lyapunov exponent and
   Lyapunov spectrum are obtained to classify the rich dynamics. It is
   revealed that the shell may exhibit complex behaviour including
   sub-harmonic, quasi-periodic and chaotic response when subjected to

   theories retaining in-plane inertia is used to calculate the strain

   on classic approximate functions and the R-function theory is used to
   build the discrete model of the nonlinear vibrations. This allowed for
   constructing the sequences of admissible functions that satisfy given
   boundary conditions in domains with complex geometries. Shell
   displacements are expanded by using Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials. A
   two-step approach is implemented to solve the problem: first a linear
   analysis is conducted to identify natural frequencies and corresponding
   natural modes to be used in the second step as a basis for nonlinear
   displacements. The system of ordinary differential equations is obtained
   by using Lagrange approach on both steps. The convergence of the
   solution is studied by using different multimodal expansions. The
   pseudoarclength continuation method and bifurcation analysis are used to
   study the nonlinear equations of motion. Numerical responses are
   obtained in the spectral neighbourhood of the lowest natural frequency.

Abstract = {{Lattice materials are characterized at the microscopic level by a
   regular pattern of voids confined by walls. Recent rapid prototyping
   techniques allow their manufacturing from a wide range of solid
   materials, ensuring high degrees of accuracy and limited costs.
   The microstructure of lattice material permits to obtain macroscopic
   properties and structural performance, such as very high stiffness to
   weight ratios, highly anisotropy, high specific energy dissipation
   capability and an extended elastic range, which cannot be attained by
   uniform materials. Among several applications, lattice materials are of
   special interest for the design of morphing structures, energy absorbing
   components and hard tissue scaffold for biomedical prostheses. Their
   macroscopic mechanical properties can be finely tuned by properly
   selecting the lattice topology and the material of the walls.
   Nevertheless, since the number of the design parameters involved is very
   high, and their correlation to the final macroscopic properties of the
   material is quite complex, reliable and robust multiscale mechanics
   analysis and design optimization tools are a necessary aid for their
   practical application.
   In this paper, the optimization of lattice materials parameters is
   illustrated with reference to the design of a bracket subjected to a
   point load. Given the geometric shape and the boundary conditions of the
   component, the parameters of four selected topologies have been
   optimized to concurrently maximize the component stiffness and minimize
   its mass.}},

Abstract = {{A multiscale design and multiobjective optimization procedure is
   developed to design a new type of graded cellular hip implant. We assume
   that the prosthesis design domain is occupied by a unit cell
   representing the building block of the implant. An optimization strategy
   seeks the best geometric parameters of the unit cell to minimize bone
   resorption and interface failure, two conflicting objective functions.
   Using the asymptotic homogenization method, the microstructure of the
   implant is replaced by a homogeneous medium with an effective
   constitutive tensor. This tensor is used to construct the stiffness
   matrix for the finite element modeling (FEM) solver that calculates the
   value of each objective function at each iteration.
   As an example, a 2D finite element model of a left implanted femur is
   developed. The relative density of the lattice material is the variable
   of the multiobjective optimization, which is solved through the
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The set of optimum
   relative density distributions is determined to minimize concurrently
   interface stress distribution and bone loss mass. The results show that
   the amount of bone resorption and the maximum value of interface stress
   can be reduced by over 70\% and 50\%, respectively, when compared to

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to improve the fatigue strength of 2D
   periodic cellular materials under a fully-reversed loading condition.
   For a given cell topology the shape of the unit cell is synthesized to
   minimize any stress concentration caused by discontinuities in the cell
   geometry We propose to reduce abrupt geometric changes emerging in the
   periodic microstructure through the synthesis of a cell shape defined by
   curved boundaries with continuous curvature, i.e. G(2)-continous curves.
   The bending moments caused by curved cell elements are reduced by
   minimizing the curvature of G(2)- continuous cell elements so as to make
   them as straight as possible. The asymptotic homogenization technique is
   used to obtain the homogenized stiffness matrix and the fatigue strength
   of the synthesized cellular material.
   The proposed methodology is applied to synthesize a unit cell topology
   described by smooth boundary curves. Numeric simulations are performed
   to compare the performance of the synthesized cellular solid with that
   of common two dimensional lattice materials having hexagonal, circular,
   square, and Kagome shape of the unit cell. The results show that the
   methodology enables to obtain a cellular material with improved fatigue
   strength. Finally, a parametric study is performed to examine the effect
   of different geometric parameters on the performance of the proposed
   cellular geometries.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effects of mechanical design parameters on the
   performance of force feedback haptic devices, a representative dynamic
   model of the system is required. In this paper, the experimental
   investigations conducted on a 2DoF haptic device revealed that
   flexibility associated with the joints reduced the stable domain of
   operation considerably. Therefore, dynamic model of the investigated
   mechanism including the joint flexibility and physical damping is
   considered. The stability boundaries achieved by using the proposed
   flexible joint model is in good agreement with experimental results. A
   simplified model of the system is then developed employing a
   decomposition proposed in {[}1]. It is shown that the stability limits
   obtained by this simplified model give a slightly conservative but close
   estimate to the stability boundaries of the higher DoF flexible joint
   model. Such a simplified and experimentally validated model can be used
   for impedance-type haptic devices. The developed model makes it possible
   to investigate the effect of different mechanical parameters on the
   performance of multibody haptic systems.}},

Title = {{Intrasplenic Transplantation of Bioencapsulated Mesenchymal Stem Cells
   Improves the Recovery Rates of 90\% Partial Hepatectomized Rats}},
Journal = {{STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow can secrete
   cytokines and growth factors and can transdifferentiate into liver
   cells. We transplanted polymeric membrane bioencapsulated MSCs into the
   spleens of 90\% partial hepatectomized rats. This resulted in 91.6\%
   recovery rates. This is compared to a recovery rate of 21.4\% in the
   90\% hepatectomized rats and 25\% in the 90\% hepatectomized rats
   receiving intrasplenic transplantation of free MSCs. After 14 days, the
   remnant livers in the bioencapsulated MSCs group are not significantly
   different in weight when compared to the sham control group. From day 1
   to day 3 after surgery, in the bioencapsulated MSCs group, the plasma
   HGF and IL-6 were significantly higher than those in the free MSCs group
   and control group (P < 0.01); plasma TNF-alpha was significantly lower
   (P < 0.001). We concluded that the intrasplenic transplantation of
   bioencapsulated MSCs significantly increases the recovery rates of 90\%
   hepatectomized rats. It is likely that the initial effect is from
   proliver regeneration factors followed later by the transdifferentiated
   hepatocyte-like cells. However, histopathological analysis and
   hepatocyte proliferation study will be needed to better understand the
   regenerative mechanisms of this result. This study has implications in
   improving the survival and recovery of patients with very severe liver
   failure due to hepatitis, trauma, or extensive surgical resection.}},

   magnetic torque rods cannot produce torque. A mathematical model of the
   system dynamics is derived first. A controller is then developed to
   stabilize the attitude angles of a satellite equipped with the
   above-mentioned set of actuators. The effect of failure of the fluid
   ring or a magnetic torque rod is examined as well. It is noted that the
   case of the failure of the magnetic torque rod whose torque is along the
   pitch axis is the most critical, since the coupling between the roll or
   yaw motion and the pitch motion is quite weak. The simulation results
   show that the control system proposed is quite fault tolerant.}},

Abstract = {{While well established economic theories related to dynamic games and
   tacit collusion exist in game theoretic and industrial organization
   literature, there have been relatively few analyses through the
   equilibrium modeling approach (as opposed to empirical or
   co-evolutionary approaches) to analyze collusive bidding behavior of
   generating companies (Gencos) in electricity markets. Moreover, existing
   techniques may be prone to several challenging computational issues.
   Therefore, this paper presents a computationally fast iterative scheme
   to find the equilibrium outcomes of an electricity market where the
   Gencos supply power in blocks of specified sizes at an offered price and
   can engage in tacit collusion. Several case studies demonstrate
   important features of such a market and the results are compared with
   the case when Gencos game without tacit collusion.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear discriminant analysis based approach to feature space
   dimensionality reduction in noise robust automatic speech recognition
   (ASR) is proposed. It utilizes a correlation based distance measure

   `correlation preserving discriminant analysis' (CPDA) procedure is
   motivated by evidence suggesting that correlation based cepstrum
   distance measures can be more robust than Euclidean based distances when
   speech is corrupted by noise. The performance of CPDA is evaluated in
   terms of the word error rate obtained by using CPDA derived features on
   a speech in noise task, and is compared to a number of Euclidean
   distance based approaches to feature space transformations, namely
   linear discriminant analysis (LDA), locality preserving projections

   that encode candidate occurrences of each invocabulary query. These
   lattices specifiy start and stop times of hypothesized term occurrences,
   providing a clear opportunity to return to the acoustics to incorporate
   novel confidence measures for verification. In this paper, we introduce
   a novel exemplar distance metric to the recently proposed discriminative
   point process modeling (DPPM) framework and use the resulting whole word
   models to generate STD confidence scores. In doing so, we introduce STD
   to a completely distinct acoustic modeling pipeline, trading Gaussian
   mixture models (GMM) for multi-layer perceptrons and replacing
   dictionary-derived hidden Markov models (HMM) with exemplar-based point
   process models. We find that whole word DPPM scores both perform
   comparably and are complementary to lattice posterior scores produced by
   a state-of-the-art speech recognition engine.}},

   signal or variations in the condition of the channel. This can be used
   in protection of Region of Interests (ROI) in image/video coding and can
   also be considered as some form of puncturing. Here, using time-domain

Abstract = {{Human aortas are subjected to large mechanical stresses and loads due to
   blood flow pressurization and through contact with the surrounding
   tissue and muscle. It is essential that the aorta does not lose
   stability for proper functioning. The present work investigates the
   buckling of human aorta relating it to dissection by means of an
   analytical model. A full bifurcation analysis is used employing a
   nonlinear model to investigate the nonlinear stability of the aorta
   conveying blood flow. The artery is modeled as a shell by means of
   Donnell's nonlinear shell theory retaining in-plane inertia, while the
   fluid is modelled by a Newtonian inviscid flow theory but taking into
   account viscous stresses via the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equation.
   The three shell displacements are expanded using trigonometric series
   that satisfy the boundary conditions exactly. A parametric study is
   undertaken to determine the effect of aorta length, thickness, Young's
   modulus, and transmural pressure on the nonlinear stability of the
   aorta. As a first attempt to study dissection, a quasi-steady approach
   is taken, in which the flow is not pulsatile but steady. The effect of
   increasing flow velocity is studied, particularly where the system loses
   stability, exhibiting static collapse. Regions of large mechanical
   stresses on the artery surface are identified for collapsed arteries
   indicating possible ways for dissection to be initiated.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of turbomachines, better engine performances are achieved
   by reducing possible parasitic leakage flows through the closure of the
   clearance distance between blade tips and surrounding casings.
   Accordingly, direct contact is now commonly accepted as part of aircraft
   engines everyday life. In order to avoid possibly catastrophic scenarii
   due to high contact forces between the rotating and static components,
   implementation of abradable coatings has been widely recognized as a
   robust solution offering several advantages: reducing potential damage
   to the incurring blade as well as adjusting operating clearances,
   in-situ, to accept physical contact events. In the present work,
   macroscopic behavior of the abradable coating is numerically
   approximated through a piecewise linear plastic constitutive law which
   allows for real time access to the current abradable layer profile.
   Contact simulations are carried out considering a three-dimensional
   industrial finite element model of a blade from a compressor stage and
   its surrounding casing, assumed perfectly rigid. Due to the large number
   of degrees of freedom, component mode synthesis methods are used.
   Simulations are repetitively carried-out over a wide rotational velocity
   range, and a large number of distinct values for two mechanical
   parameters of the abradable material are considered. Results show that
   the amplitude of vibration is highly sensitive to the Young modulus and
   the plastic modulus of the abradable and that a local maximum is
   detected. Also, a more realistic description of the contact forces
   allowing for a contribution in the tangential direction is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Several versions of the Daum-Huang (DH) filter have been introduced
   recently to address the task of discrete-time non-linear filtering. The
   filters propagate a particle set over time to track the system state,
   but, in contrast to conventional particle filters, there is no proposal
   density or importance sampling involved. Particles are smoothly migrated
   using a particle flow derived from a log-homotopy relating the prior and
   the posterior. Impressive performance has been demonstrated for a wide
   range of systems, but the implemented algorithms rely on an
   extended/unscented Kalman filter (EKF/UKF) that is executed in parallel.
   We illustrate through simulation that the performance of the exact flow
   DH filter can be compromised when the UKF and EKF fail. By introducing
   simple but important modifications to the exact flow DH filter
   implementation, the performance can be improved dramatically.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate modeling of the correlation between the sources plays a crucial
   role in the efficiency of distributed source coding (DSC) systems. This
   correlation is commonly modeled in the binary domain by using a single
   binary symmetric channel (BSC), both for binary and continuous-valued
   sources. We show that ``one{''} BSC cannot accurately capture the
   correlation between continuous-valued sources; a more accurate model
   requires ``multiple{''} BSCs, as many as the number of bits used to
   represent each sample. We incorporate this new model into the DSC system
   that uses low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for compression. The
   standard Slepian-Wolf LDPC decoder requires a slight modification so
   that the parameters of all BSCs are integrated in the log-likelihood
   ratios (LLRs). Further, using an interleaver the data belonging to
   different bit-planes are shuffled to introduce randomness in the binary
   domain. The new system has the same complexity and delay as the standard
   one. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed model
   and system.}},

   with air flow; the system developed small-amplitude first-mode
   vibrations at low flow velocities, which could be flutter, and at higher
   flows the oscillatory behaviour was succeeded by a static divergence. A
   simple, linear theoretical model is also developed, and the
   theoretically predicted behaviour is compared to the experimental one.
   The model captures the essentials of the observed behaviour, but
   requires improvement before quantitative prediction can be considered to
   be adequate.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{67-74}},
Abstract = {{Historically, research that has analyzed the effect of land use on
   travel demand has concentrated on a few key indicators, notably, mode
   choice, vehicle miles traveled, and number of trips. This literature has
   focused primarily on the effects of individual land use variables; for
   example, what is the effect of land use mix or population density on
   mode choice? It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that the
   isolated impact of particular measures of land use on individual and
   household transportation behavior is small, but when these measures are
   dealt with by using a clustered approach, their combined influence
   becomes less ambiguous in direction and greater in magnitude. This paper
   contributes to the transportation and land use literature by examining
   the effect of clusters of land use indicators on activity spaces, an
   emerging but traditionally ignored indicator of transportation behavior.
   Regression analysis results point to a significant relationship between
   large and dispersed activity spaces, low levels of population and
   employment density, and low levels of public transit accessibility and
   land use mix.}},

Abstract = {{Recent attempts at designing untethered devices for locomotion inside
   compliant biological vessels, highlighted the requirements for energy
   efficiency for prolonged duration inside living bodies. Quite a number
   of studies considered the design and construction of crawling robots but
   very few focused on the interaction between the robots and the flexible
   environment. In previous studies, we derived the efficiency, defined as
   the actual advance divided by the optimal advance, of worm locomotion.
   In this paper, we analyze the force, minimum energy and power
   requirements for worm locomotion over flexible surfaces. More
   importantly, we determine the optimum conditions of locomotion as a
   function of the number of cells, friction coefficients, stroke length,
   energy recovery factor, and tangential compliance. Optimality is defined
   with respect to energy and power requirements. The analytical results
   are obtained by integrating the force over the actuator motion and
   alternatively by summing up the overall energy losses due to friction
   and elastic losses with the surface and the efficient work performed by
   the robot. The theoretical predictions are compared to numerical
   simulations modeling worm robots crawling over flexible surfaces and are
   found in perfect match.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a multibody dynamics model of a wheeled mobile robot is
   developed to characterize the terrain reaction forces in terms of the
   physical and control parameters of the system. A common strategy for
   simulating the motion of mobile robots on soft soil is to compute the
   soil reaction forces using terramechanics models and to solve a forward
   dynamics problem by considering the soil reactions as a set of forces
   applied to the system. This intends to provide an accurate computation
   of the forces involved in the wheel-soil interaction; however, a series
   of factors such as the sensitivity of reaction forces to soil parameters
   limits the applicability of the existing terramechanics models in
   unstructured environments. We propose an alternative approach which does
   not rely on the soil properties, but at the same time does not intend to
   provide an exact computation of wheel-soil interaction forces. The main
   objective of this approach is to estimate the effect of changes in
   control and design parameters on the performance of the system, using
   the information provided by the dynamics model of the vehicle. To this
   end, the reaction forces for the wheel-terrain interaction in the ideal
   limit case of pure rolling and no penetration are obtained upon the
   specification of the motion at the contact points, via kinematic
   constraints. The validity of the analysis results obtained using the
   proposed paradigm is verified by simulation runs and experiments. The
   experimental results suggest that this approach is successful in
   predicting the variation of a set of important performance indicators in
   terms of the changes in the parameters of the system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on opportunistic spectrum access for
   secondary users (SUs) from a game-theoretic learning perspective. In
   consideration of the random return of primary users, it is assumed that
   a SU dynamically hops over multiple idle frequency-slots of a licensed
   frequency band, each with an adaptive activity factor. The problem of
   finding optimal activity factors of SUs is cast in a game-theoretic
   framework and is formulated as a potential game. Subsequently, the
   existence, feasibility and optimality of Nash Equilibrium (NE) are
   investigated analytically. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed in
   which each SU independently adjusts its activity factors based on the
   best response dynamics by learning other SUs' behavior from locally
   available information. Aiming to establish stability for the proposed
   algorithm, the convergence with probability 1 to an arbitrarily small
   neighborhood of the globally optimal solution is investigated with
   analysis and simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the critical problem of interference management in
   two-tier networks, where the newly-deployed femtocell users (FUEs)
   operate in the licensed spectrum owned by the existing macrocell. A
   Pareto-optimal power-control algorithm is devised that jointly maximizes
   the utilities of both macrocell and femtocell networks while robustly
   guaranteeing the macrocell's quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.
   After effectively enforcing the minimum
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) prescribed by the
   macrocell users (MUEs) with the use of a penalty function, the
   Pareto-optimal boundary of the strongly-coupling SINR feasible region is
   characterized. Based upon the specific network utility functions and
   also the target SINRs of the MUEs, a unique operating SINR point is
   determined, and transmit power adapted to achieve such a design
   objective. We prove that the developed algorithm converges to the global
   optimum, and more importantly, it can be distributively implemented at
   individual links. Effective mechanisms are also available to flexibly
   designate the access priority between macrocells and femtocells, as well
   as to fairly share the system resources among different users. The
   merits of the proposed approach are verified by numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the capacity and optimal power allocation
   (PA) scheme between the source and relay for a dual-hop
   amplify-and-forward (AF) system over non-symmetric Rayleigh fading
   channels with channel information available at the relay. At first, a
   closed-form expression of the mutual information (MI) between the input
   and output of the considered channel is obtained. Since only the
   exponential integral is involved, the derived expression is useful in
   finding the optimal PA to achieve the capacity. By further considering
   high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, we present tight yet
   simple approximations to this MI, which can be used to show the
   advantage of knowing channel information at the relay. Then, focusing on
   the problem of optimal PA, we first derive a closed-form derivative of
   the MI. A simple bisection method is then proposed to find the optimal
   PA scheme. While uniform PA is shown to achieve the capacity at any SNR
   over the symmetric channel, its optimality can only be observed at low
   SNRs over a non-symmetric channel. In other SNR regimes, numerical
   results reveal that uniform PA experiences a significant loss. A
   comparison between the dual-hop and direct transmission scheme is also
   made, where we show that the dual-hop scheme using the optimal PA can
   provide impressive rate increases in medium SNR ranges in various
   network configurations.}},

   However, the major inefficiency of AT is that it cannot handle the

   Transform (CAT), to perform range and precision analysis of fixed-point
   datapaths with comparator units. A custom branch-and-bound search is
   also introduced to provide more cutting branches and perform faster
   analyses of range and precision, by making use of safe and negligible

Abstract = {{This paper presents an ultra low power, low voltage, high gain squarer
   circuit for use in non-coherent impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB)
   receivers. The proposed squaring function is implemented based on the
   intrinsic CMOS transistor characteristics in the sub-threshold region,
   where the second-order derivative of the drain current is maximized.
   Additionally, a capacitor cross-coupling g(m) boosting technique is
   exploited to increase the conversion gain of the squarer. Utilizing the
   aforementioned schemes, a low power and high gain squarer is realized in
   a TSMC 90nm CMOS technology. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed squarer covers the UWB bandwidth and provides 16dB of RMS
   conversion gain at the input signal level of 100mV, while drawing only
   320 mu A from a 0.5V power supply.}},

Abstract = {{Associative memories are alternatives to indexed memories that when
   implemented in hardware can benefit many applications such as data
   mining. The classical neural network based methodology is impractical to
   implement since in order to increase the size of the memory, the number
   of information bits stored per memory bit (efficiency) approaches zero.
   In addition, the length of a message to be stored and retrieved needs to
   be the same size as the number of nodes in the network causing the total
   number of messages the network is capable of storing (diversity) to be
   limited. Recently, a novel algorithm based on sparse clustered neural
   networks has been proposed that achieves nearly optimal efficiency and
   large diversity. In this paper, a proof-of-concept hardware
   implementation of these networks is presented. The limitations and
   possible future research areas are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-sensor data fusion is an efficient method to provide both accurate
   and fault-tolerant sensor readouts. Furthermore, detection of faults in
   a reasonably short amount of time is crucial for applications dealing
   with high risks. In order to deliver high accuracies for the sensor
   measurements, it is required to perform a calibration for each sensor.
   This paper focuses on designing a fault-tolerant calibrated multi-sensor
   system. First, the least squares method is applied to calibrate each
   sensor using a linear curve fitting function. Next, an analytical
   technique is proposed to carry out a fault-tolerant multi-sensor data
   fusion, while minimizing the Mean-Square-Error (MSE) for the final
   sensor readout. While our data fusion approach is applicable to
   different multi-sensor systems, the experimental results are shown for
   16 temperature sensors, where an environmental thermal chamber was used
   as the reference model to calibrate the sensors and perform the
   measurements.}},

   Transplant Retention Resulting in Attenuation of Chronically Infarcted
   Rat Heart Fibrosis and Cardiac Dysfunction}},

Abstract = {{Stem cell transplantation has been widely acknowledged for their immense
   potential in regenerative medicine. In these procedures, the implanted
   cells need to maintain both their viability and functional properties
   for effective therapeutic outcomes. This has long been a subject of
   major concern and intensive studies. Microencapsulation of stem cells
   within polymeric microcapsules can be an efficient approach to achieve
   this goal, particularly for heart diseases. This study reports the use
   of biocompatible, fluorogenic genipin-cross-linked alginate chitosan
   (GCAC) microcapsules in delivery of human adipose stem cells (hASCs)
   with an aim to increase the implant retention in the infarcted
   myocardium for maximum clinical benefits. In vitro results show, under
   hypoxic conditions, the microencapsulated cells overexpressed
   significantly higher amount of biologically active vascular endothelial
   growth factor (VEGF). We investigated on the in vivo potential using
   immunocompetent female rats after induction of myocardial infarction.
   For this, animal groups (n = 8) received empty control microcapsules,
   1.5 x 10(6) free male hASCs, or 1.5 x 10(6) microencapsulated male
   hASCs. Results show significant retention (3.5 times higher) of
   microencapsulated hASCs compared to free hASCs after 10 weeks of
   transplantation. Microencapsulated hASCs showed significantly attenuated
   infarct size compared to free hASCs and empty microcapsule group (21.6\%
   +/- 1.1\% vs. 27.2\% +/- 3.1\% vs. 33.3\% +/- 3.2\%; p < 0.05), enhanced
   vasculogenesis, and improved cardiac function (fractional shortening:
   24.2\% +/- 2.1\% vs. 19.1\% +/- 0.5\% vs. 12.0\% +/- 4.0\%; p < 0.05).
   These data suggest that microencapsulated hASCs can contribute
   significantly to the improvement in cardiac functions. Their greater
   retentions exhibit reduced fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in
   experimental animals. However, further research is needed to fully
   comprehend the underlying biological and immunological effects of
   microencapsulated hASCs, which jointly play important roles in cardiac
   repair.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of efficient and lossless representation of a
   multiset of m words drawn with repetition from a set of size 2(n). One
   expects that encoding the (unordered) multiset should lead to
   significant savings in rate as compared to encoding an (ordered)
   sequence with the same words, since information about the order of words
   in the sequence corresponds to a permutation. We propose and analyze a
   practical multiset encoder/ decoder based on the trie data structure.
   The act of encoding requires O (m (n + log m)) operations, and decoding
   requires O (m n) operations. Of particular interest is the case where
   cardinality of the multiset scales as m - 1/c 2(n) for some c > 1, as n
   -> infinity. Under this scaling, and when the words in the multiset are
   drawn independently and uniformly, we show that the proposed encoding
   leads to an arbitrary improvement in rate over encoding an ordered
   sequence with the same words. Moreover, the expected length of the
   proposed codes in this setting is asymptotically within a constant
   factor of 5/3 of the lower bound.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique for Electroencephalogram (EEG) compression is proposed
   in this article. This technique makes use of the inter-channel
   redundancy present between different EEG channels of the same recording
   and the intra-channel redundancy between the different samples of a
   specific channel. It uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Set
   partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) in 2-D to code the EEG
   channels. Smoothness transforms are added in order to guarantee good
   performance of SPIHT in 2-D. Experimental results show that this
   technique is able to provide low distortion values for high compression
   ratios (CRs). In addition, performance results of this method do not
   vary a lot between different patients which proves the stability of the
   method when used with recordings of different characteristics.}},

   automatically estimates both the order of the linear system and the

Abstract = {{The gaze orientation system is a prime example of the CNS using multiple
   platforms to achieve its goal. To move the gaze in space, the eyes,
   head, and body cooperate to place the image of the target on the fovea.
   Understanding the underlying neural circuitry innervating this
   collaboration could also be a cue to understanding other movement
   related CNS tasks involving multiple platforms, i.e., posture and
   locomotion. Basically two major network topologies for modeling the gaze
   orientation system have been proposed: the independent controller model
   and the shared gaze feedback controller model. In the independent
   controller model, each platform (i.e., eyes, head or trunk) receives its
   own share of the retinal error (distance of the target from the current
   gaze position) independent from other platform(s) and its goal is to
   null its individual error, whereas, in the shared gaze feedback
   controller all platforms collaborate to null the shared global error,
   which is calculated on the fly using feedback from all platforms or
   reflexes. Each of the mentioned general topologies has its own
   supporters and the question is which does the CNS actually use. In this
   article, based on evidence from neurophysiology and behavior,
   complemented by simulation data, it will be shown why a shared feedback
   controller is the better candidate for this task. More specifically,
   simulations of an updated Prsa-Galiana model (the Shared Sensory-Motor
   Integration (SMI) model) will be discussed in more detail and, where
   applicable, compared with other popular models, including independent
   and shared controller models. It provides plausible explanations for
   observations on gaze shifts with various interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The typical approach for analysis of respiratory records consists of
   detection of respiratory pauses and elimination of segments corrupted by
   movement artifacts. This is motivated by established rules used for
   manual scoring of respiratory events, which focus on pause segmentation
   and do not define criteria to identify breathing segments. With this
   strategy, breathing segments can only be inferred indirectly from the
   absence of abnormalities, yielding an unclear and ambiguous definition.
   In this work we present novel detectors for synchronous and asynchronous
   breathing, and compare them with AUREA, a novel system for Automated
   Unsupervised Respiratory Event Analysis, which performs indirect
   classification of breathing. Results from analysis of real infant
   respiratory data show an improvement in the identification of
   synchronous and asynchronous breathing of 9\% and 27\% respectively,
   demonstrating that direct detection of breathing enhances the
   classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic joint stiffness defines the dynamic relationship between the
   position of a joint and the torque acting about it and can be separated
   into intrinsic and reflex components. Under stationary conditions, these
   can be identified using a nonlinear parallel-cascade algorithm that
   models intrinsic stiffness and reflex stiffness as parallel pathways.
   Experimental results demonstrate that both intrinsic and reflex
   stiffness depend strongly on the operating point defined by mean joint
   position and the activation level. Consequently, both intrinsic and
   reflex stiffness will appear to be time-varying (TV) whenever the
   operating point changes, as during movement. This paper describes and
   validates a new method for identification of TV ankle stiffness. The
   method is based on the TV nonlinear autorregresive, moving average
   exogenous (NARMAX) model class. Simulation results demonstrated that the
   algorithm can accurately estimate the TV parameters of the ankle
   stiffness. We conclude that the algorithm is potentially a powerful new
   tool for the study of joint stiffness during TV conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Flicker mitigation in variable-speed wind generators can be approached
   by reactive power control utilizing the power-electronic converter of
   the machine, a technique that is bound by several factors including the
   network X/R ratio, line current limits and the instantaneous output of
   the machine. The highest flicker level is observed as the machine
   approaches its rated output, under such conditions in sites with
   favorable wind resource, sole reactive power compensation would
   necessitate overrated operation for long periods and increased line
   currents or otherwise the reactive power margin narrows possibly
   resulting in impaired capability in reducing flicker to compatible
   levels. This paper proposes coordinated power curtailment and reactive
   power control and assesses the feasibility of its implementation in
   reducing variable-speed wind generators flicker emission under high wind
   speed conditions. The amount of active power to be curtailed is
   quantified based on the observed decrease in short-term flicker P-st

Abstract = {{In this paper, we establish in closed-form the capacity and characterize
   the optimal input covariance matrix at the source and the optimal power
   allocation scheme between source and relay for a half-duplex
   single-relay amplify-and-forward (AF) system with static channel gains.
   Different from multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the
   channel matrix of the AF system is a function of the parameters to be
   optimized and hence water filling over the square of the singular values
   of this matrix is no longer optimal. Furthermore, given that the mutual
   information of the AF system is not a convex function, conventional
   optimization methods cannot be applied to find the optimal input
   covariance, the power allocation, and the capacity. Instead, by
   analyzing all local maximizers, it is shown that the capacity of the AF
   system is achieved by either the direct transmission (DT) scheme, the
   orthogonal AF (OAF) protocol, or the non-orthogonal AF (NAF) protocol
   using a non-diagonal covariance matrix. The choice of protocol depends
   on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and network configuration. By further
   analyzing the asymptotic mutual information, it is shown that the DT
   scheme is dominant in low and high SNR regimes. The capacity of the AF
   system is also provided for comparison among several network models.
   Specifically, it is demonstrated that in a general linear network model,
   the NAF protocol can provide significant gains over the other schemes at
   medium SNRs.}},

Abstract = {{We design novel partial decode-forward (PDF) schemes for the Gaussian
   two-way relay channel with direct link. Different from pure
   decode-forward, each user divides its message into two parts and the
   relay decodes only one part of each. The relay then generates its
   codeword as a function of the two decoded parts and forwards to the two
   users. We propose PDF schemes for both the full-and half-duplex modes.
   In full duplex, the scheme is based on block Markov encoding and forward
   joint decoding over 2 consecutive blocks. In half duplex, the
   transmission is divided into 4 phases, in which one user transmits
   during the first phase, the other during the second phase, both users
   transmit during the third phase and the relay transmits during the last
   phase. The relay decodes a part of the messages from both users at the
   end of phase 3 and each user decodes only at the end of phase 4.
   Analysis and simulation show that if for one user, the direct link is
   stronger than the user-to-relay link, while for the other, the direct
   link is weaker, then PDF can achieve a rate region strictly larger than
   the timeshared region of pure decode-forward and direct transmission for
   both full-and half-duplex modes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of channel estimation in
   amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-relay transmissions over time-and
   frequency-selective (doubly selective) channels. To avoid two separate
   channel estimation processes of source-to-relay and relay-to-destination
   links, a cascaded doubly selective channel model is formulated to
   characterize the source-to-relay-to-destination (SRD) channel.
   Time-varying SRD channel gains are projected onto different basis
   expansion functions to attain dimension reduction in the formulated
   channel model. In estimating the cascaded SRD channel responses at the
   destination, the presence of multiple relays gives rise to the ambiguity
   problem due to the use of a single pilot signal transmitted from the
   source. To circumvent this problem, time-variant amplifying factors at
   relays are introduced to be used in maximum-likelihood-based cascaded
   multi-relay channel estimation. Simulation results show that basis
   expansion models (BEMs) and time-variant amplifying factors can
   efficiently facilitate a single estimation process of different cascaded
   doubly selective SRD channels in a multi-relay system. Furthermore, for
   a fixed pilot overhead, a relationship between space diversity gains
   (with multiple relays) and channel estimation accuracy is also
   numerically illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we rigorously analyze the optimal input distribution and
   capacity of an additive Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) impulsive noise (IN)
   channel in high and low input power regimes. First, we obtain an input
   distribution for which the channel output is Gaussian distributed. This
   distribution, if valid, shall result in the capacity of the channel. At
   an asymptotically high input power level, we then show that the derived
   input is always valid and in fact, it resembles a Gaussian distribution.
   As such, the Gaussian channel input is considered approximately optimal.
   Using the monotonicity property of the characteristic function (CF), we
   then develop a necessary condition for the existence of the derived
   optimal input for a finite level of input power. The condition indicates
   that a sufficiently high input power is usually required. Then focusing
   on the low power region, we first derive an upper bound on the channel
   capacity assuming full knowledge of noise state. A closed-form
   expression of the mutual information (MI) achieved by Gaussian inputs,
   which is considered as a lower bound on the channel capacity, is then
   developed. By comparing these two bounds, it is shown that a Gaussian
   input asymptotically results in the capacity. Interestingly, it is also
   demonstrated that such a capacity is the same as the capacity of an
   erasure channel in low power regimes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores chip-asynchronous CDMA transmission when single-user
   demodulation and decoding are used at the receiver. First, a chip-level
   channel model is presented to account for chip-asynchronous between
   different users. Using the model, the symmetric capacity of
   chip-asynchronous CDMA is investigated.
   Numerical results indicate that a sum rate of 2 bits per channel use is
   achievable when chip symbols \{-1, 1\} are utilized in appropriate
   non-equiprobable fashion. This represents over a 2.5 times capacity gain
   over traditional uniform chip signaling in chip-synchronous CDMA.
   Consequently, the symmetric sum capacity is further investigated when
   the zero chip symbol is also utilized for CDMA transmission. The
   obtained capacity results indicate that non-uniform signaling with
   \{-1,0,+1\} chip symbols can lead to an energy efficient CDMA
   transmission scheme which could achieve energy savings of up to 3 dB
   over the traditional CDMA with equiprobable \{-1, +1\} chip symbols.}},

   power amplification coefficients at the relay for the half-duplex

   assuming that the relay has full knowledge of the channel gains, optimal

   with Gaussian inputs at the source. The proposed solutions can be

   amplification methods provide a significant improvement over
   conventional schemes using either channel distribution information (CDI)

   finite constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).}},

Abstract = {{Sub-Nyquist maximum likelihood (ML)-based time of arrival (TOA)
   estimation methods for ultra-wideband (UWB) signals normally assume a
   priori knowledge of the UWB channel in the form of the average power
   delay profile (APDP). In practice however, and despite its importance,
   the APDP is not always available. To address this issue, we develop in
   this paper a joint estimator of TOA and APDP. Knowing that the APDP of a
   UWB channel usually consists of several clusters, each with specific
   exponential decay rate, a parametric APDP model of this type is
   employed. The parameters of this model are estimated via a least-squares
   fitting approach; then the estimated APDP is used to form a likelihood
   function and obtain a ML estimator of the TOA. Simulations show that the
   TOA estimated jointly in this way achieves a good accuracy in practical
   scenarios. The proposed APDP estimate can also help to boost the
   performance of previously reported TOA estimators that assume a priori
   APDP knowledge, although the proposed ML scheme generally offers
   superior performance.}},

   this moment is hard to detect. A new nondestructive method of

Abstract = {{This study presents an experimental stack-level thermal and hydrodynamic
   assessment of a model air-cooled PEM fuel cell. To mimic the heat
   generation inside the MEA, rubber heater films are used. Pressure drop
   along the stack channels and temperature distribution on the bipolar
   plate surface are measured for the channel Reynolds number range of
   200-500 and the stack input power range of 100-250 W. Tests are
   performed with and without gas diffusion layers (GDL) to investigate the
   effect of GDL and its surface characteristics on the pressure drop and
   heat transfer. Our results indicate that, with the existing length of
   bipolar plates, a major part of plate minichannel is filled with the
   developing region. This leads to a higher heat transfer rates, thus more
   uniform stack temperature can be obtained with the penalty of higher fan
   power. The minimum measured temperature difference is about 10 degrees C
   and the values become more pronounced when the Reynolds number
   decreases. The existence of the GDL is observed to have negligible
   effect on the pressure drop. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of energy-efficient resource and
   power allocation in the uplink of multi-user multi-channel Orthogonal
   Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based systems subject to
   constraints on user equipment (UE) transmit power. This problem is
   non-deterministic polynomial-time hard and an optimum solution for a
   system with U users and N resource units requires a complexity of at
   least O(NUN). Using an iterative solution approach, we propose two
   sub-optimal, yet efficient, scheduling algorithms that maximize the
   energy efficiency (EE) considering both UE circuit power (P-c) and
   rate-dependent transmit power with an upper limit of P-max. Simulation
   results show that the proposed algorithms provide near-optimal solutions
   with much lower computational burden of O(UN) and O(UN2/2). Further
   performance studies indicate that the proposed algorithms can offer an
   EE of more than 2 times with a throughput reduction of less than 13\% as
   compared to the spectral-efficient greedy algorithm. Our studies also
   reveal that the EE is quickly increased with P-max when P-max << P-c and
   then reach saturation as P-max approaches P-c.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the capacity limit of a single secondary
   user (SU) communication link in a cognitive radio system. An SU
   transmitter establishes the communication with its receiver by
   dynamically hopping in a frequency spectrum pool, and by sensing the
   spectrum to exploit the temporal communication opportunities. We
   characterize the performance of sensing by false-alarm and
   miss-detection probabilities. Firstly, focusing on a high channel input
   power region, we develop an upper bound on the SU capacity by assuming a
   Gaussian distributed output. A lower bound on the SU capacity is also
   derived using a Gaussian input. We then show that the lower bound
   closely approaches the upper bound at a high channel input power level.
   This means that the Gaussian input is nearly optimal in this case.
   Furthermore, we characterize the impact of primary user activities and
   sensing performance on the SU capacity by developing a closed-form tight
   approximation. Secondly, paying attention to a low channel input power
   region, we propose a genie-aided upper bound and a lower bound using the
   Gaussian input. By comparing these two bounds, a closed-form
   approximation to the capacity is developed and the near optimality of
   the Gaussian input is demonstrated. Finally, numerical results are
   provided to complement the theoretical discussion.}},

   native Spanish language speech recognition performance using an existing
   telephone speech corpus of English spoken by speakers of Spanish origin.
   Compensation for sources of acoustic variability between Spanish and

   multilingual ASR performance. We conclude with a discussion about the

Abstract = {{We consider the optimal design of a sensing system in which a sensor can
   choose how and when to communicate to an estimator. The optimal choice
   of transmission and estimation policies is made difficult by the fact
   that the sensor and the estimator may use their entire history of
   observations. Traditionally, Markov decision theory is used to analyze
   such multi-stage decision problems. But, Markov decision theory assumes
   a single decision maker-an assumption that is not satisfied in an active
   sensing system that has two decision makers with different information.
   In this paper, we use the approach of Nayyar et al (2011) to investigate
   the system as a dynamic team. Using a series of structural results, we
   show that the optimal policy is easy to implement. We also obtain a
   dynamic programming decomposition to find optimal sensing and estimation
   policies.}},

Abstract = {{This research aims at estimating a GHG emission inventory at the
   household level using completely disaggregate trip data and taking into
   account all emitting modes. The impact of urban form (UF) and transit
   accessibility (TA) characteristics on household level GHG emissions is
   then quantified and compared to the impact of the introduction of
   emerging green technologies. Using a large and representative sample of
   household diaries, trip-level GHG emissions are estimated by combining
   different sources of data (origin-destination (OD) survey data, vehicle
   fleet characteristics, transit ridership data, etc.) and by using
   modelling tools (traffic assignment and GHGs models). Moreover, UF and
   TA indicators are developed and combined to generate neighbourhood
   typologies. A simultaneous equation modelling framework is then
   implemented to investigate the link between UF, TA, socio-demographics,
   and travel GHGs, taking into account the well known ``self-selection{''}
   issue. The potential impact of land use and transit supply strategies
   with emerging green technological scenarios is then compared. Our
   findings are consistent with the literature, more specifically we have
   found that the built environment (BE) attributes are statistically
   significant (10\% increase in density, transit accessibility and
   land-use mix, results in 3.5\%, 5.8\% and 2.5\% reduction in GHG
   respectively), number of workers and retirees at the household level
   play an important role in the contribution to GHG emissions (102\%
   increase by adding one worker and 51\% decrease by adding a retiree to
   the household). Moreover, neighbourhood types represented by the
   combined effects of UF and TS have important effects on GHGs. Also it is
   found that by replacing transit fleet by electric trains and hybrid
   buses, the share of transit GHGs would decrease by 32\%. With respect to
   the private motor-vehicle fleet, if current trends persist, the constant
   improvement of car fuel consumption economy would reduce car GHGs by
   7\%. According to our results, the two most efficient strategies to
   reduce GHGs at the regional and household level seem to be the
   continuous fuel-efficiency improvement of the private motor-vehicle
   fleet and the increase of transit accessibility. (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a recently proposed networking
   architecture that can potentially lead to reduced bandwidth usage and
   better scalability and security as compared to the current IP-based
   architecture. In this paper, we conduct an energy consumption analysis
   of content-centric networking and IP-based networking for a video
   streaming scenario. We consider two types of energy consumption: the
   energy required to manufacture the network devices and the energy
   required for operation. We perform simulations of content-centric
   networking over a general-tree topology to assess the traffic rate
   reductions achieved by CCN's insertion of caches at routers. Although
   CCN network devices have a higher intrinsic energy consumption compared
   to the IP-based devices because of the presence of additional memory, by
   exploiting their caching capabilities it is possible to reduce the
   overall energy consumption of the network. We consider both the
   incorporation of an online rate adaptation mechanism as well as a static
   network provisioning approach and observe that these approaches can lead
   to an energy consumption reduction of 10-20 percent.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized data aggregation is a canonical task in wireless sensor
   networks (WSNs). Nodes are independently gathering measurements and the
   goal is to fuse this data into a unified aggregate. In this paper we
   compare the performance of the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) with that
   of two different gossip algorithms, pairwise randomized gossip and
   broadcast gossip. We measure performance in terms of the number of
   transmissions required to compute and disseminate the average to all
   nodes in the network (i.e., distributed averaging). CTP aggregates and
   disseminates information along a spanning tree; it thus is very
   efficient for aggregation, but establishing and maintaining the spanning
   tree in a decentralized manner involves non-negligible overhead. Gossip
   algorithms are fully decentralized and only use peer-to-peer
   communications (i.e., no routing); consequently, they involve little
   overhead for setup and maintenance, but the actual aggregate computation
   is slower to converge. Our simulations show that broadcast gossip
   requires significantly fewer transmissions than CTP in networks with
   more than 100 nodes when network connectivity is dynamic or unrealiable,
   and CTP and broadcast gossip offer comparable performance in smaller
   networks.}},

   a fully decentralized channel aware algorithm for decentralized
   detection which is based on gossip. In our method nodes try to reach
   consensus by communicating only with neighbouring nodes. First, we
   propose our method where the channels between the nodes are ideal (i.e.,
   no fading or noise) and show that it converges to the same solution as
   the centralized scheme, and hence it is globally optimum. Then, we
   modify it for the case of noisy channels with flat fading and show by
   simulation that our algorithm still converges to the optimum solution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the need for a non-volatile reconfigurable FPGA in
   order to allow for many current applications to transition away from
   costly ASIC development. It is assumed that an architecture has been
   selected and needs to be filled with blocks designed at the transistor
   level. These are to allow for non-volatility by means of magnetic tunnel
   junction devices (MTJs). Circuit level designs are presented, together
   with their successful simulations. The blocks are therefore assembled
   together and electrically sound simulations are presented for a fully
   functional FPGA of minimal size. Design and testing is carried out in
   Cadance Virtuoso and Spectre along with the IBM p13 toolkit. The typical
   parameters of a University of Tohoku MTJ are used in a SPICE model
   developed by University of Minnesota.}},

Abstract = {{The Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP) algorithm executed on Gaussian
   Markov Random Fields can take a large number of iterations to converge
   if the inverse covariance matrix of the underlying Gaussian distribution
   is ill-conditioned and weakly diagonally dominant. Such matrices can
   arise from many practical problem domains. In this study, we propose a
   relaxed GaBP algorithm that results in a significant reduction in the
   number of GaBP iterations (of up to 12.7 times). We also propose a
   second relaxed GaBP algorithm that avoids the need of determining the
   relaxation factor a priori which can also achieve comparable reductions
   in iterations by only setting two basic heuristic measures. We show that
   the new algorithms can be implemented without any significant increase,
   over the original GaBP, in both the computational complexity and the
   memory requirements. We also present detailed experimental results of
   the new algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness in achieving
   significant reductions in the iteration count.}},

   codes used for correcting errors that manifest themselves as swaps of

   Translocations represent a natural extension of the notion of adjacent
   transpositions and as such may be analyzed using related concepts in

   the asymptotic capacity of translocation rank codes, construction

   systematic frames for this class. This is encouraged by application of
   systematic DFT codes in distributed source coding using DFT codes, a new
   application for frames. Studying their extreme eigenvalues, we show
   that, unlike DFT frames, systematic DFT frames are not necessarily
   tight. Then, we come up with conditions for which these frames can be
   tight. In either case, the best and worst systematic frames are
   established from reconstruction error point of view. Eigenvalues of DFT
   frames, and their subframes, play a pivotal role in this work.}},

Abstract = {{The causal cognitive interference channel (CCIC) is a four-node channel,
   in which the second sender obtains information from the first sender
   causally and assists in the transmission of both. We propose a new
   coding scheme called Han-Kobayashi partial decode-forward binning
   (HK-PDF-binning), which combines the ideas of Han-Kobayashi coding,
   partial decode-forward relaying, conditional Gelfand-Pinsker binning and
   relaxed joint decoding. The second sender decodes a part of the message
   from the first sender, then uses Gelfand-Pinsker binning to bin against
   the decoded codeword. When applied to the Gaussian channel, this
   HK-PDF-binning essentializes to a correlation between the transmit
   signal and the state, which encompasses the traditional
   dirty-paper-coding binning as a special case when this correlation
   factor is zero. The proposed scheme encompasses the Han-Kobayashi rate
   region and achieves both partial decode-forward relaying rate for the
   first user and interference-free rate for the second user.}},

Abstract = {{We propose two coding schemes combining decode-forward (DF) and noisy
   network coding (NNC) with different flavors. The first is a combined
   DF-NNC scheme for the one-way relay channel which includes both DF and
   NNC as special cases by performing rate splitting, partial block Markov
   encoding and NNC. The second combines two different DF strategies and
   layered NNC for the two-way relay channel. One DF strategy performs
   coherent block Markov encoding at the source at the cost of power
   splitting at the relay, the other performs independent source and relay
   encoding but with full relay power, and layered NNC allows a different
   compression rate for each destination. Analysis and simulation show that
   both proposed schemes supersede each individual scheme and take full
   advantage of both DF and NNC.}},

   primarily on intra-hour variations. We model the time duration
   dependency and other conditional aspects of wind variability. We analyze
   variability both in the time and frequency domains and relate this
   analysis with empirical variability probability distributions using
   historical wind power from the Bonneville Power Authority. Distribution
   fitting of intra-hour variability was done, considering normal, Laplace
   and skew-Laplace distributions. We found that of the variability is
   skewed and peaky indicating that skew-Laplace distributions are superior
   to other probability density functions to describe wind variability in
   time intervals of less than an hour. The time domain interpretation of
   the power spectral density estimates of the wind power variability
   indicate that for time duration of 30 minutes to 1 hour wind fluctuation
   can be quite considerable. We discuss the results of our analysis in
   relation to its potential short-term power system operations
   implications with high wind power penetration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from testing a 135 kW inverter's
   anti-islanding capabilities on a real test distribution feeder. The
   tests that were conducted are supplemental to current standards of
   anti-islanding testing, as various experiments are performed that are
   not all included in IEEE Standard 1547.1. These tests provide
   interesting insights to the operation of the system with the DG, as well
   as the inverter control system. Such tests that were carried out
   included: islanding with zero power mismatch between DG and load while
   varying P (also the quality factor), capacitor switching, motor
   start-up, and islanding with a motor. They were all performed on a
   physical distribution test system, using real distribution equipment, so
   no modeling assumptions or simplifications were made. The results of the
   tests are recorded and analyzed, and a discussion of the results and
   importance of the tests are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has recently attracted research
   attention in medium-voltage applications, such as MV drives and
   back-to-back systems. In such applications, the harmonic content of
   MMC's output voltage and current is of particular importance and must be
   kept below permissible levels. This is typically done by increasing the
   switching frequency and/or by using an output filter stage. To lower the
   total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output voltage and current at the
   terminals, in this work, a new modulation scheme for MMC is presented.
   Using this modulation scheme, since the voltage and current harmonics
   are lowered at the converter terminals, the rating and hence the cost of
   the output filter required to achieve permissible THD level is reduced.
   Simulation results are provided to testify to the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.}},

   based on rotor-side VSCs de-rated at maximum slip of 0.3,
   auto-transformers are required for starting and operation in the

Abstract = {{In this paper we extend and analyze the distributed dual averaging
   algorithm {[}1] to handle communication delays and general stochastic
   consensus protocols. Assuming each network link experiences some fixed
   bounded delay, we show that distributed dual averaging converges and the
   error decays at a rate O(T-0.5) where T is the number of iterations.
   This bound is an improvement over {[}1] by a logarithmic factor in T for
   networks of fixed size. Finally, we extend the algorithm to the case of
   using general non-averaging consensus protocols. We prove that the bias
   introduced in the optimization can be removed by a simple correction
   that depends on the stationary distribution of the consensus matrix.}},

   several orders of magnitude faster than the reverse static
   transformation back into austenite. The retarding effect of alloying

Abstract = {{Effective grain refinement through equal channel angular pressing (ECAP)
   for magnesium (Mg) alloys has been demonstrated by many researchers.
   Although with the capability to achieve superplasticity, the batch mode
   nature of this method and the required repetitive processing to attain
   ultrafine grained structure have prohibited it from being widely used in
   large-scale industrial production. In this study, a well-established
   metal forming method - the continuous extrusion forming (CONFORM)
   process - was employed as a severe plastic deformation route to refine
   the microstructure of Mg alloys. Cast Mg-3\%Al-1\%Zn (AZ31) rods were
   used as the feedstock and the cast structure (grain size of similar to
   150 microns) was refined to similar to 1 micron after one pass CONFORM
   extrusion. Uniaxial tensile tests of the as-extruded samples were
   conducted at a temperature of 473K and an elongation of similar to 200\%
   was achieved under a strain rate of 1 x 10(-4) s(-1). The significant
   grain refinement effect was attributed to the severe shear deformation
   occurred during the CONFORM process, which is very similar to ECAP but
   with even higher effective strains. The most important advantage of
   CONFORM over ECAP is that the former is a continuous route, so it is
   able to produce long products. It was also shown that CONFORM could be
   an additional forming method for Mg alloys to conventional rolling,
   forging and extrusion.}},

   fed to the synthesis filters for output perfect reconstruction. In
   particular, we provide the theoretical sufficient conditions on OFB

   erasure recovery. Furthermore, we modify the proposed reconstruction
   method in the presence of quantization noise and suggest an approach

Abstract = {{Key phase diagram experiments for the CaO-CaF2 system were conducted
   using an equilibration and quenching technique and thermal analysis.
   Equilibration and quenching experiments using sealed Pt capsules
   followed by FE-SEM EDS compositional analysis and XRD phase analysis
   were performed to determine the CaC and CaF2 liquidii and the solubility
   of CaO in solid CaF2. Thermal analyses with DSC and TGA were used to
   determine the temperatures of the eutectic and the alpha- to beta-CaF2
   polymorphic transition. For the first time, noticeable solubility of CaO
   in alpha- and beta-CaF2 solids is observed above 1 000 degrees C. The
   maximum solubility of CaC in solid CaF2 is about 5 mol\% at the eutectic
   temperature (about 1 361 degrees C) while no solubility of CaF2 in solid
   CaO is detected. Based cn the thermodynamic optimization using the
   present CaO and CaF2 liquidii and the eutectic temperature measurements,
   it is concluded that the CaO-CaF2 binary is a simple eutectic system
   with the eutectic reaction L-(CaO = 15 mot\%) -> CaO(pure solid) +
   CaF2(solid solution with CaO = 5 mol\%) at 1 361 degrees C. The alpha-

Abstract = {{A mathematical model was developed using ANSYS 12.0 in order to simulate
   non-isothermal melt flows in a delta shaped four strand billet caster
   tundish. The fluid inside the tundish considered was water, so that the
   CFD model could later be validated against water model experiments. The
   buoyancy term was included in the momentum equation using Boussinesq's
   approximation. Experiments were performed for both the bare tundish, and
   the tundish fitted with an impact pad. For the bare tundish, step inputs
   of 5-15 degrees C hotter fluid resulted in significantly stronger
   natural convection currents towards the extremities of the tundish. On
   the other hand, for cases of a tundish fitted with an impact pad, the
   effect of buoyancy driven flows due to step inputs of hot water, was
   much less pronounced since the pad itself had a big effect on regulating
   the fluid flow patterns. Step-down conditions were also simulated, where
   10-15 degrees cooler fluid was introduced into a hotter liquid within
   the tundish. Detailed calculations were performed using the DPM, in
   order to evaluate the number of inclusions passing through the SENs
   under such transient conditions. While the step-up conditions
   facilitated the flotation of inclusions because of upward buoyancy
   driven flows, the step-down condition generated catastrophic results in
   terms of liquid metal quality. One third and full scale water model
   experiments were done to validate the numerical model and it was found
   that the mathematical predictions were in good agreement with the
   experimental results.}},

Title = {{Solute adsorption to surfaces of articular cartilage explants: apparent
   versus actual partition coefficients}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{11880-11888}},
Abstract = {{Solute transport is important to biological activities and contrast
   agent-based imaging of articular cartilage. Solute partitioning, which
   characterizes equilibrium concentration distributions within tissues, is
   typically measured assuming that solute is distributed within the tissue
   volume. However, solutes also adsorb to cartilage surfaces. Ignoring
   this adsorption results in measurements of apparent partition
   coefficients (K-a) significantly greater than actual ones (K). A
   theoretical model was developed to predict the resulting errors in
   partition coefficient measurements and to estimate K based on K-a data.
   These errors increase as explant surface/volume ratio (S/V) increases. A
   range of solutes including 3 or 4 kDa and 40 kDa dextrans, chondroitin
   sulfate, insulin and myoglobin conjugated to three different
   fluorophores (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), tetramethylrhodamine
   isothiocyanate (TRITC) and carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)) and
   fluorophores alone were studied. Experiments showed significant
   increases in K-a with S/V for FITC and TRITC and their conjugates. For
   TAMRA, while increased S/V increased K-a of dextrans, it did not affect
   K-a of chondroitin sulfate, insulin, myoglobin or TAMRA alone. S/V had
   the most significant effect on K-a for TRITC and its conjugates and
   smallest effects for TAMRA and its conjugates. Fluorescence microscopy
   confirmed solute accumulation at cartilage surfaces for all solutes,
   with strongest adsorption for TAMRA and weakest for FITC. Consistent
   with theory, under these extreme conditions K-a was less affected by
   adsorption; otherwise differences between K and K-a were significant.
   Differences in adsorption and transport properties of solutes labeled
   with different fluorophores highlighted the importance of
   molecular-level solute-matrix interactions on solute transport in
   cartilage.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing global energy demand and the application of more
   energy-consuming processes has forced food industries to investigate
   alternative processes. This article pertains to one such novel and
   promising alternative drying process called electrohydrodynamic (EHD)
   drying. EHD is a method of inducing electric wind that is generated by
   gaseous ions under the influence of a high-voltage electric field. This
   article evaluates the available literature and discusses the
   experimental investigations carried out to explain the effect of
   operating parameters on the drying rate and specific energy consumption
   (kJ/kg water) of the EHD process. Through the review it was established
   that the corona current increased linearly with an increase in applied
   voltage (kV) for both positive and negative polarities and a negative
   corona discharge produced a larger corona current compared to a positive
   corona discharge. It was also revealed that the specific energy
   consumption increased with an increase in applied voltage for both
   polarities but was lower compared to conventional drying processes such
   as fluidized bed drying; however, it was observed that the specific
   energy consumed by the EHD process was lower than that of latent heat of
   vaporization, indicating the removal of water from the surface of the
   sample by other means in addition to evaporation. Electrode
   configuration plays an important role in determining the efficiency of
   the EHD process; the multiple-needle electrode configurations had better
   efficiency than wire and single-electrode configurations. Recent and
   past studies on application of EHD both postharvest and in food
   processing were also reviewed and the benefit of using EHD for food and
   bioprocessing due to its unique properties supported the feasibility and
   applicability of EHD as a suitable alternative for processing thermally
   sensitive biological materials.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{2383-2393}},
Abstract = {{Even if home composting can eliminate municipal organic waste
   collection, handling and treatment costs, its compost quality requires
   investigation outside the laboratory. A study was thus conducted to
   evaluate the influence of the following management practices on the
   compost quality produced by five backyards home composters in Montreal
   West Island from June to October 2010: the type and backyard location of
   the home composter (HC), and the rate and type of organic waste (OW) fed
   into the home composter. The parameters monitored were compost
   temperature and final characteristics including trace elements and
   pathogens. For all HC compost, maximum but not necessarily thermophilic
   temperatures were highly probable within one week of adding more than 10
   kg of OW composed of equal volumes of food waste (FW) and yard trimmings
   (YT). Top and bottom HC perforations enhanced convective aeration but
   concentrated OW decomposition within the bottom layer. Fed an equal
   volume of FW and YT, the final HC compost had a dry and organic matter
   content exceeding 30\%, and 50\%, respectively, and a total nitrogen,
   phosphorous and potassium level of 2, 1 and 3 \% on a dry matter basis,
   representing a good quality soil amendment. Clean OW feeding resulted in
   compost respecting Canadian and European regulations for Escherichia
   coli and Salmonella, irrespective of the temperature regime. For trace
   elements, regulatory limits may be exceeded when the home composter is
   fed ashes and soil. Homeowners must also be careful when applying
   pesticides to their lawns and gardens and then feeding the residues to
   the home composter.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{12060-12065}},
Abstract = {{To advance our understanding of molecular packing in glassy
   nanocomposites, we adopt a macroscopic granular model-comprising
   spherical inclusions dispersed in ball-chain polymers-and ascertain from
   measurements of the bulk density the partial molar sphere volume at
   small but finite sphere volume fractions. By systematically varying the
   chain length, sphere size, and mixture composition, the ratio of the
   sphere radius to the chain loop size was found to be the primary
   dimensionless parameter that bridges solvent (small inclusion size) and
   continuum (large inclusion) scaling regimes. In the intermediate regime,
   where the inclusion and chain loop radius are comparable, the primary
   sphere-chain interaction increases free volume-up to twice the intrinsic
   inclusion volume per particle-and the primary sphere-sphere interaction
   decreases free volume. The results gleaned from these `granular
   nanocomposites' may help to understand how geometrical constraints
   influence packing in dense granular systems and glassy molecular
   nanocomposites.}},

Title = {{Efficient Rank-Adaptive Least-Square Estimation and Multiple-Parameter
   Linear Regression Using Novel Dyadically Recursive Hermitian Matrix
   Inversion}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Least-square estimation (LSE) and multiple-parameter linear regression
   (MLR) are the important estimation techniques for engineering and
   science, especially in the mobile communications and signal processing
   applications. The majority of computational complexity incurred in LSE
   and MLR arises from a Hermitian matrix inversion. In practice, the
   Yule-Walker equations are not valid, and hence the Levinson-Durbin
   algorithm cannot be employed for general LSE and MLR problems.
   Therefore, the most efficient Hermitian matrix inversion method is based
   on the Cholesky factorization. In this paper, we derive a new dyadic
   recursion algorithm for sequential rank-adaptive Hermitian matrix
   inversions. In addition, we provide the theoretical computational
   complexity analyses to compare our new dyadic recursion scheme and the
   conventional Cholesky factorization. We can design a variable
   model-order LSE (MLR) using this proposed dyadic recursion approach
   thereupon. Through our complexity analyses and the Monte Carlo
   simulations, we show that our new dyadic recursion algorithm is more
   efficient than the conventional Cholesky factorization for the
   sequential rank-adaptive LSE (MLR) and the associated variable
   model-order LSE (MLR) can seek the trade-off between the targeted
   estimation performance and the required computational complexity. Our
   proposed new scheme can benefit future portable and mobile signal
   processing or communications devices.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4363-4371}},
Abstract = {{Here we present a microfluidic platform to generate multiplex gradients
   of biomolecules within parallel microfluidic channels, in which a range
   of multiplex concentration gradients with different profile shapes are
   simultaneously produced. Nonlinear polynomial gradients were also
   generated using this device. The gradient generation principle is based
   on implementing parrallel channels with each providing a different
   hydrodynamic resistance. The generated biomolecule gradients were then
   covalently functionalized onto the microchannel surfaces. Surface
   gradients along the channel width were a result of covalent attachments
   of biomolecules to the surface, which remained functional under high
   shear stresses (50 dyn/cm(2)). An IgG antibody conjugated to three
   different fluorescence dyes (FITC, Cy5 and Cy3) was used to demonstrate
   the resulting multiplex concentration gradients of biomolecules. The
   device enabled generation of gradients with up to three different
   biomolecules in each channel with varying concentration profiles. We
   were also able to produce 2-dimensional gradients in which biomolecules
   were distributed along the length and width of the channel. To
   demonstrate the applicability of the developed design, three different
   multiplex concentration gradients of REDV and KRSR peptides were
   patterned along the width of three parallel channels and adhesion of
   primary human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) in each channel
   was subsequently investigated using a single chip.}},

Title = {{Theory and modeling of nematic disclination branching under capillary
   confinement}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{11135-11143}},
Abstract = {{Defects in nematic liquid crystals under controlled confinement serve as
   a useful tool to characterize material properties as well as to reveal
   texture stability and pattern formation mechanisms in anisotropic soft
   matter. In particular, nematics inside micro-capillaries can exhibit a
   large variety of textures with point defects, line defects and loop
   defects, whose stability is dictated by factors such as geometry and
   temperature. In this paper we present a theoretical model, scaling, and
   simulation of a texture transition between two commonly observed
   patterns (planar polar and radial), through the uniform translation of a
   shape-invariant disclination branch point in generic calamitic nematic
   liquid crystals under capillary confinement and strong radial anchoring.
   Using the ``nematic elastica'' model derived from the Q-tensor Landau-de
   Gennes and n-vector Frank-Oseen equations, the geometry, stability, and
   energetics of disclination branching of a straight high order +1
   disclination into a pair of curved +1/2 disclinations under capillary
   confinement are fully characterized, including the branch angle, the
   curvature and final separation of the +1/2 lines, and the scaling of
   these quantities with the capillary radius (R). It is found that the
   branching and disclination shapes adjust to the capillary confinement by
   regulating their tension-to-bending stiffness ratio in such a way that
   the resulting branch angle is close to pi/3, the branch curvature is 3/R
   and the final disclination distance is 2R/(4)root 5. These new findings
   based on the ``nematic elastica'' are also useful to predict other novel
   structures that arise in conical and toroidal geometries of current
   interest and can be used to assess the Frank elasticity of nematic
   liquid crystals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a noncoherent detection scheme for a fixed-gain
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network, in which the source is equipped
   with two transmit antennas, while the multiple relays and destination
   are equipped with a single antenna. An Alamouti space-time block code is
   employed together with M-ary frequency-shift-keying (FSK). Detection at
   the destination is performed in two steps. First, the destination
   estimates the overall channels based on the pilot symbol inherent in FSK
   transmission. Then it performs the maximal ratio combining (MRC) to make
   a final decision. An upper bound on the error performance is derived in
   a closed-form expression and it is shown that the investigated scheme
   achieves the full diversity order. Simulation results are also presented
   to confirm the analysis in a temporally-correlated fading environment.}},

Abstract = {{Texture evolution in rolled (400 degrees C) and annealed (450 degrees C)
   Mg-1\% Mn-based alloys containing different levels of Ce was examined.
   It was found that Ce refines the as-cast and rolled/annealed grain
   structure. The overall intensity of the basal texture decreases with Ce
   additions in both the rolled and subsequently annealed condition. A
   strong relationship was found between maximum intensity (M) of rolling
   and annealing textures and the as-cast effective grain size, d', i.e. M
   proportional to e(0.4d') (R-2 = 0.8), which was attributed to the role
   of plastic compatibility stresses which lead to grain boundary
   deformation altering the balance of deformation modes. Contributions
   from Ce solute effects and lattice parameter changes are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have two major hurdles to
   overcome before they may be commercially viable: cost and operating
   life. Platinum (Pt) catalyst represents the bulk of the PEMFC cost and
   is in finite supply, but functionalized carbon nanomaterials have been
   identified as potential replacements for Pt cathode catalyst. This
   work's objective is to produce graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) and dope them
   with nitrogen in pyridinic sites through a second treatment step. An
   inductively-coupled thermal plasma (ICP) is used to dissociate methane
   at very high temperatures, with GNF nucleation commencing shortly after
   by way of rapid quenching. In a post-treatment, nitrogen doping occurs
   by manipulating plasma conditions and nitrogen precursor selection.
   Nitrogen doping up to 33.4 at.\% has been demonstrated which, to our
   knowledge, more than doubles the largest reported amount.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of aluminium alloy castings, such as EL\%, YS
   and UTS, are controlled by the casting and heat treatment variables,
   alloy's composition, and melt treatment. Despite the abundance of
   literature data, the large number of the controlling parameters has made
   it difficult to predict and model the mechanical properties by the
   conventional techniques. Another obstacle encountered when making such a
   prediction is the complex kinetics and interactions that exist among the
   many variables. The goal of this study was to develop Artificial Neural
   Network (ANN) and Multiple Regression models to predict the mechanical
   properties of A356 alloy from the processing variables. Several standard
   nonlinear regression and multi-layer ANN models were developed and
   trained using data from the literature and experimental results. Due to
   the complexity of A356's solidification behaviour, the nonlinear
   regression produced results that were not as accurate as those produced
   by the ANN model. The results indicate that ANN is a suitable technique
   for predicting mechanical properties from alloy chemistry and processing
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the data gathering problem in the context of
   power grids by using a network of sensors, where the sensed data have
   inter-node redundancy. Specifically, we propose a new transmission
   method, called quantized network coding, which performs linear network
   coding in the infinite field of real numbers, and quantization to
   accommodate the finite capacity of edges. By using the concepts in
   compressed sensing literature, we propose to use l(1)-minimization to
   decode the quantized network coded packets, especially when the number
   of received packets at the decoder is less than the size of sensed data
   (i.e. number of nodes). We also propose an appropriate design for
   network coding coefficients, based on restricted isometry property,
   which results in robust l(1)-min decoding. Our numerical analysis show
   that the proposed quantized network coding scheme with l(1)-min decoding
   can achieve significant improvements, in terms of compression ratio and
   delivery delay, compared to conventional packet forwarding.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development, simulation and experimental testing
   of a non-linear Kalman filter for attitude estimation. This non-linear
   filter is able to conserve the invariants of the Kalman filter, i.e.,
   the expectations on state estimates and their covariances, by operating
   in the Lie algebra of SO(3) and along the trajectory of evolving angular
   momentum. The main feature of this novel discrete-time filter is that
   the linearization of the Gaussian uncertainty around these permanent
   trajectories leads to a locally optimal Kalman gain matrix. Results
   confirm that this Invariant Momentum-tracking Kalman Filter (IMKF)
   out-performs state-of-the-art approaches such as the Extended Kalman
   Filter (EKF), and Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF). At very-low
   sampling rates, EKFs suffer from divergence as the uncertainty
   propagation is corrupted by the underlying system approximations. The
   IMKF suffers no such problems according to the theoretical developments
   and results reported here.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a quasi-static step climbing behaviour for a minimal
   sensing wheel-legged quadruped robot called PAW. In the quasi-static
   climbing maneuver, the robot benefits from wheel traction and uses its
   legs to reconfigure itself with respect to the step during the climb.
   The control methodology with the corresponding controller parameters is
   determined and the state machine for the maneuver is developed. With
   this controller, PAW is able to climb steps higher than its body
   clearance. Furthermore, any step height up to this maximum achievable

Abstract = {{Although legged locomotion for robots has been studied for many years,
   the research of autonomous wheel-legged robotics is much more recent.
   Robots of this type, also described as hybrid, can take advantage of the
   energy efficiency of wheeled locomotion while adapting to more difficult
   terrain with legged locomotion when necessary. The Micro Hydraulic
   Toolkit (MHT), developed by engineers at Defence R\&D Canada - Suffield,
   is a good example of such a robot. Investigation into control and
   optimization techniques for MHT leads to a better understanding of
   hybrid vehicle control for terrestrial exploration and reconnaissance.
   Control of hybrid robots has been studied by several researchers during
   the last decade. The methodology applied in this work uses an inverse
   kinematics algorithm developed previously for a hybrid robot Hylos, and
   implements an optimization technique to minimize torques occurring at
   crucial actuators. As well, some added functionality is incorporated
   into the control method to implement stepping maneuvers. This paper will
   present the results obtained via co-simulation using Matlab's Simulink
   and a high-fidelity model of MHT in LMS Virtual Lab.}},

Abstract = {{We report kinetic and mechanistic studies of nitrogen elimination from
   1-pyrazoline and its deuterated derivatives. This study was carried out
   for the gas phase employing 6-311 + G(d,p) basis sets with B3LYP,
   MPW1PW91 and PBEPBE methods. This reaction may proceed through two
   different mechanisms, molecular and radical. The molecular mechanism
   advances via two different paths and corresponding intermediates. There
   are either a four-centred cyclic or a six-centred cyclic intermediate as
   transition states in the molecular mechanism. The calculated kinetic
   parameters and isotope effects for the molecular mechanism are
   consistent with experimental results for cyclopropane formation.
   However, from the kinetic isotope effects point of view, the fit is
   better for the radical mechanism for propene formation. Considering
   activation energies, theoretical calculations suggest that the radical
   mechanism is the less suitable. The B3LYP method results are in a better
   agreement with the experimental results when considering only

Abstract = {{This paper presents an asynchronous scheduling algorithm for
   high-throughput stochastic low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders.
   Stochastic computation provides ultra-low-complexity hardware and can be
   implemented using binary or multiple-valued logic gates. Using
   asynchronous control, it also eliminates a global clock signal and
   therefore eases the worst-case timing restrictions. A timing model of
   asynchronous-computation behaviours under a 90nm CMOS technology is used
   to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm with an optimized computation
   delay properly decodes a regular (1024, 512) LDPC code without the
   ``lock-up{''} problem that potentially stops decoding before convergence
   and hence causes loss in coding gain. Based on our models, the proposed
   scheme achieves up to 7.37x improvement in decoding throughput with
   comparable BER performance in comparison with performance results of a
   conventional synchronous stochastic decoder.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the accuracy of a

   support system is designed building on a diagnosis standard in medicine,
   and one decision made by this system depends on both the blood pressure
   data gathered by medical sensors and some contexts that are manually
   entered by clinicians. When analyzing the system accuracy, we take into
   account both the potential sensors' errors and the errors of entering
   context. In addition, we propose a novel method for the estimation of
   system accuracy; this method is motivated by the fact that the
   traditional method to estimate system accuracy would overestimate the
   system accuracy (the details would be presented in Section III.C.).
   Finally, we compare the system accuracy estimated by the proposed method
   and that estimated by the traditional method. Our study shows that our
   proposed method can well estimate the system accuracy.}},

   Maximum-Mismatch (MM) {[}1], or Mean-Square-Error (MSE) {[}14], w.r.t. a

   paper presents a novel approach to robustly analyze the fixed-point
   accuracy of an imprecise datapath, which may consist of a combination of
   polynomials and CORDIC units. The approach builds a global polynomial
   for the error of the whole datapath by converting the CORDIC units and
   their errors into the lowest possible order Taylor series. The previous
   work for almost accurate analysis of MM {[}1] and MSE {[}14, 15] in

Journal = {{BIOFOULING}},

Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{1063-1076}},
Abstract = {{Surface-associated swarming motility is implicated in enhanced bacterial
   spreading and virulence, hence it follows that anti-swarming effectors
   could have clinical benefits. When investigating potential applications
   of anti-swarming materials it is important to consider whether the lack
   of swarming corresponds with an enhanced sessile biofilm lifestyle and
   resistance to antibiotics. In this study, well-defined tannins present
   in multiple plant materials (tannic acid (TA) and epigallocathecin
   gallate (EGCG)) and undefined cranberry powder (CP) were found to block
   swarming motility and enhance biofilm formation and resistance to
   tobramycin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast, gallic acid (GA) did
   not completely block swarming motility and did not affect biofilm
   formation or tobramycin resistance. These data support the theory that
   nutritional conditions can elicit an inverse relationship between
   swarming motility and biofilm formation capacities. Although
   anti-swarmers exhibit the potential to yield clinical benefits, it is
   important to be aware of possible implications regarding biofilm
   formation and antibiotic resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Blast vibrations are considered among the primary factors in
   destabilising cemented rockfill (CRF) stopes in open stoping systems
   with delayed backfill. This destabilisation occurs when the backfill
   face is subjected to blasting of an adjacent stope. Inadequate
   cementation, backfilling practices and blasting of adjacent stopes can
   be the causes of CRF failure and hence ore dilution. Poor blasting
   practices can cause greater blast vibrations and therefore can initiate
   fill failure. The magnitude of blast vibrations can be controlled by the
   powder factor and blast design. This study presents the effects of blast
   vibrations on CRF backfilled stopes. The effect of different blast loads
   and profiles are examined. Blast loads corresponding to non-ideal

Abstract = {{Mechanical performance of nanocomposites is strongly dependent on the
   interaction properties between the matrix and the reinforcement.
   Therefore, the aim of this work is to investigate the carbon nanotube
   polymer interaction in nanocomposites. With the ever-increasing power of
   computers, and enormous advantage of parallel computing techniques,
   molecular dynamics is the favourite technique to simulate various atomic
   and molecular systems for this application. In order to simulate
   nanocomposites using molecular dynamics techniques, a stepwise approach
   was followed. First, a single-walled carbon nanotube was modelled as the
   reinforcing material. The validity of the model was examined by applying
   simple tension boundary conditions and comparing the results with the
   literature. Next, PMMA chains, with different geometries and molecular
   weights, were modelled employing the chemical potentials extracted from
   the literature. The last step included the modelling of the nanotubes
   surrounded by the matrix material and the investigation of the energy
   minimization for the system. Based on the results, the non-covalent
   interaction energy between a single-walled carbon nanotube and the PMMA
   matrix was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of the process parameters for osmotic dehydration of
   12.2-mm potato cubes was carried out using response surface methodology.
   The experiments were conducted using a central composite rotatable
   design (CCRD) with four factors, viz. sucrose concentration (27.5-42.5\%
   w/w), salt concentration (7.5-12.5\% w/w), total osmosis time
   (26.25-68.75 min), and microwave power density for the initial 4 min
   (0.375-1.125 W/g of total weight of solution and potato cubes) at two
   levels each to take into account the individual and interaction effects
   of the factors. A sample-to-solution ratio of 1: 10 and pressure of 0.16
   kPa for the initial 4 min were kept constant throughout all of the
   experiments. It was found that the linear effects of all factors on the
   water loss (WL) and solids gain (SG) were highly significant. The
   optimum condition was found at a sucrose concentration of 36.35\%, salt
   concentration of 12.50\%, osmosis time of 68.72 min, and microwave power
   density of 0.38 W/g for the initial 4 min, with a WL of 37.26\% initial
   weight and SG of 8.74\% initial weight. The drying of potato cubes was
   carried out using hot air, microwave-vacuum, and osmotic
   microwave-vacuum drying methods. It was found that potato cubes dried by
   combined osmotic microwave-vacuum had better sensory qualities.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{10-11, SI}},
Pages = {{826-848}},
Abstract = {{Design processes are characterised by uncertainty and iteration, making
   them difficult to plan and manage. These characteristics are
   incorporated into an original model in which information flow is
   simulated explicitly such that the dynamic complexity of design
   processes with interdependent tasks is captured. This is accomplished
   through the linkage of information exchange to the work done during each
   design task, the availability of resources, and the techniques used to
   manage the product development (PD) process. The model generates rework
   due to iteration and failure in design reviews according to the ability
   of tasks to reduce the uncertainty of design information. The model is
   applied to the investigation of coordination and its effects on process
   behaviour under various conditions. Coordination mechanisms are studied
   through the choice of input parameters that influence the degree of
   overlapping of tasks, the allocation of resources that process
   information, the delay of communication of information, and the interval
   of communication between tasks. Findings uncover the mechanisms that
   drive the pace of progress during engineering design processes and
   highlight strategies that reduce span time in complex PD.}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules are key components of the cytoskeleton and perform a
   variety of functions, including chromosome movement during cell
   division, intracellular transport of materials, movement of organelles
   and intracellular tracking. A combination of essential and up-to-date
   methods is needed for investigating the biology of microtubules and
   understanding the mechanisms of microtubule-drug interaction. Coupled
   cytosol-microtubule mechanical vibrations of microtubules are studied in
   this article. Such investigations provide helpful insights on the
   functional mechanisms of microtubules and their interactions with other
   proteins and drugs. The viscous cytosol and the microtubule are coupled
   through the continuity condition across the microtubule-cytosol
   interface. The stress field in the cytosol induced by vibrating
   microtubule is analytically determined and the coupled circumferential
   vibrations of the cytosol-microtubule system are investigated by
   developing a coupled polynomial eigenvalue problem. Finally, the
   variations of vibration frequencies of a coupled system with cytosol
   dynamic viscosity, and microtubule circumferential Young's modulus are
   examined. Furthermore, the validity of the present analysis is confirmed
   by comparing the results with those obtained from the literature.}},

   unmodified epoxy/Cloisite 30B nanocomposites, and cured toughened
   epoxy/Cloisite 30B nanocomposites. Mixing process was performed by
   mechanical stirring. Poly(etheramine) was used as the curing agent. The
   detailed TEM images revealed co-continuous and dispersed spherical
   rubber in the epoxy-rubber blend, suggesting a new proposed mechanism of
   phase separation. High-magnification TEM analysis showed good
   interactions between rubber and Cloisite 30B in the ternary system.
   Also, it was found that rubber particles could enhance the separation of
   silicates layers. Both XRD and TEM analyses confirmed that the
   intercalation of Cloisite 30B was achieved. No distinct exfoliated
   silicates were observed by TEM. Aggregates of layered silicates
   (tactoids) were observed by SEM and EDX, in addition to TEM at low
   magnification. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of organic and
   inorganic elements in the binary and ternary epoxy systems containing
   Cloisite 30B.}},

Abstract = {{Effective pathogen detection is an essential prerequisite for the
   prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Despite recent advances
   in biosensors, infectious diseases remain a major cause of illnesses and
   mortality throughout the world. For instance in developing countries,
   infectious diseases account for over half of the mortality rate.
   Pathogen detection platforms provide a fundamental tool in different
   fields including clinical diagnostics, pathology, drug discovery,
   clinical research, disease outbreaks, and food safety. Microfluidic
   lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices offer many advantages for pathogen detection
   such as miniaturization, small sample volume, portability, rapid
   detection time and point-of-care diagnosis. This review paper outlines
   recent microfluidic based devices and LOC design strategies for pathogen
   detection with the main focus on the integration of different techniques
   that led to the development of sample-to-result devices. Several
   examples of recently developed devices are presented along with
   respective advantages and limitations of each design. Progresses made in
   biomarkers, sample preparation, amplification and fluid handling
   techniques using microfluidic platforms are also covered and strategies
   for multiplexing and high-throughput analysis, as well as point-of-care
   diagnosis, are discussed.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2159-2168}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogeology is now taught in a broad spectrum of departments and
   institutions to students with diverse backgrounds. Successful
   instruction in hydrogeology thus requires a variety of pedagogical
   approaches depending on desired learning outcomes and the background of
   students. We review the pedagogical literature in hydrogeology to
   highlight recent advances and analyze a 2005 survey among 68
   hydrogeology instructors. The literature and survey results suggest
   there are only similar to 15 topics that are considered crucial by most
   hydrogeologists and > 100 other topics that are considered crucial by
   some hydrogeologists. The crucial topics focus on properties of aquifers
   and fundamentals of groundwater flow, and should likely be part of all
   undergraduate hydrogeology courses. Other topics can supplement and
   support these crucial topics, depending on desired learning outcomes.
   Classroom settings continue to provide a venue for emphasizing
   fundamental knowledge. However, recent pedagogical advances are biased
   towards field and laboratory instruction with a goal of bolstering
   experiential learning. Field methods build on the fundamentals taught in
   the classroom and emphasize the collection of data, data uncertainty,
   and the development of vocational skills. Laboratory and computer-based
   exercises similarly build on theory, and offer an opportunity for data
   analysis and integration. The literature suggests curricula at all
   levels should ideally balance field, laboratory, and classroom pedagogy
   into an iterative and integrative whole. An integrated, iterative and
   balanced approach leads to greater student motivation and advancement of
   theoretical and vocational knowledge.}},

Title = {{Record extension for short-gauged water quality parameters using a newly
   proposed robust version of the Line of Organic Correlation technique}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2253-2266}},
Abstract = {{In many situations the extension of hydrological or water quality time
   series at short-gauged stations is required. Ordinary least squares
   regression (OLS) of any hydrological or water quality variable is a
   traditional and commonly used record extension technique. However, OLS
   tends to underestimate the variance in the extended records, which leads
   to underestimation of high percentiles and overestimation of low
   percentiles, given that the data are normally distributed. The
   development of the line of organic correlation (LOC) technique is aimed
   at correcting this bias. On the other hand, the Kendall-Theil robust
   line (KTRL) method has been proposed as an analogue of OLS with the
   advantage of being robust in the presence of outliers. Given that water
   quality data are characterised by the presence of outliers, positive
   skewness and non-normal distribution of data, a robust record extension
   technique is more appropriate. In this paper, four record-extension
   techniques are described, and their properties are explored. These
   techniques are OLS, LOC, KTRL and a new technique proposed in this
   paper, the robust line of organic correlation technique (RLOC). RLOC
   includes the advantage of the LOC in reducing the bias in estimating the
   variance, but at the same time it is also robust in the presence of
   outliers. A Monte Carlo study and empirical experiment were conducted to
   examine the four techniques for the accuracy and precision of the
   estimate of statistical moments and over the full range of percentiles.
   Results of the Monte Carlo study showed that the OLS and KTRL techniques
   have serious deficiencies as record-extension techniques, while the LOC
   and RLOC techniques are nearly similar. However, RLOC outperforms OLS,
   KTRL and LOC when using real water quality records.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous-based electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of titania nanoparticles
   (Evonic's P25) was successfully applied to the fabrication of mesoporous
   electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Poor film adhesion and
   cracking arising from the electrolysis of water and interstitial water
   evaporation during drying were largely overcome via the selection of low
   EPD operating current density/DC voltage (0.1 mA cm(-2)/2.5-3.1 V) but
   more importantly the addition of zinc nitrate in a 5 vol.\%
   isopropanol-water suspension. As a result, a composite nanostructured
   TiO2-ZnO film was fabricated. Photoelectrochemical characterization
   indicates that in-situ formation of ZnO causes suppression of charge
   recombination at the electrode/electrolyte interface thus prolonging
   photoelectron lifetime. A 5.01\% conversion efficiency was obtained
   under 1 sun illumination (100 mW.cm(-2)) of a 13 mu m thick single
   transparent film. The efficiency was further improved to 6.19\% upon
   further optimization via multi-layer construction of the transparent
   anatase film (18 mu m thick) by repeated cycles of EPD. (C) 2012 The

Journal = {{RENDICONTI LINCEI-MATEMATICA E APPLICAZIONI}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-195}},
Abstract = {{The theory of ephemeral continua was proposed to model bodies for which
   the basic tenet of permanence of material elements fails. The goal of
   the proposal was, principally, to lessen the impact of critical
   arguments against the imposition of the principle of material
   frame-indifference in continuum mechanics. Those arguments were based on
   the remark that, in any case, any mathematical model of reality is
   necessarily observer dependent; however, as it happens, they were urged
   on by noticing that some corollaries in the kinetic theory of gases
   appear to contradict requirements of frame-indifference. The proposed
   theory cures that wound via a definition of peculiar velocities which
   assures their exact observer independence. Besides, that theory offers a
   wider base, allowing one to breed models for bodies where the processes
   are irremediably influenced by events at a lower scale, models based so
   far on a bottom up approach with partly uncertain steps up from the
   standard case. Here, we proceed via a top down approach, by introducing
   progressively stronger constraints. Largely, earlier results are
   confirmed, securer ground is given to some interpretations or
   alternatives offered. Briefly, the general requirements for any linear
   constraint to have physical content are stated and their immediate
   implications are derived. These requirements are applied to study
   certain special cases of the general constraint. Connections are
   provided between the consequent simplifications and results available by
   bottom-up approaches, so to speak-including, in particular, hypocontinua
   and Navier-Stokes-alpha beta continua. To show that the value of our
   general approach transcends the building of an all-encompassing
   framework, we conclude by deriving the reduced balance laws consistent
   with the most general version of the constraint. These laws open an easy
   approach to obtaining potentially useful special cases.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the corrosion mechanism of stopper refractories
   by liquid MnO-SiO2-FeO-MnS inclusion in high oxygen steels, the chemical
   reaction between the liquid MnO-SiO2-FeO-MnS slag and several
   refractories including Al2O3-C, Spinel-C, Al2O3-AlN-C and ZrO2-C were
   performed at 1 550 degrees C. It is found that the reduction of the
   liquid inclusion can occur by C in the refractories to produce Mn-Fe-Si
   metallic phase and the degree reduction is important factor influencing
   to the chemical composition and amount of liquid inclusion. From this
   experimental and thermodynamic study and in plant test, it is found that
   ZrO2-C(13\%) refractory has excellent corrosion resistance against high

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{1763-1772}},
Abstract = {{In-storage psychrophilic anaerobic digestion develops by microbial
   acclimation in covered swine-manure storage tanks, producing CH4 and
   stabilizing organic matter. To optimize the system's performance, the
   process kinetics must be understood. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate kinetic parameters describing the major stages in the digestion
   process, and to investigate the effect of temperature acclimation on
   these parameters. Specific activity tests were performed using manure
   inocula and five substrates at three incubation temperatures. Extant
   substrate activities were determined analytically for each case, and
   intrinsic kinetic parameters for glucose uptake were estimated by grid
   search fitting to the Monod model. The results demonstrate that this
   acclimated microbial community exhibits different kinetic parameters to
   those of the mesophilic communities currently modelled in the
   literature, with increased activity at low temperatures, varying with
   substrate and temperature. For glucose, the higher uptake is accompanied
   by lower microbial yield and half-saturation constant. Decomposing these
   values suggests that active psychrophilic and mesophilic microbial
   populations co-exist within the community. This work also confirms that
   a new method of assessing microbial substrate kinetics must be developed
   for manure microbial communities, separating microbial mass from other
   suspended organics.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{31}},
Pages = {{8094-8106}},
Abstract = {{We compute the polymer-skeleton displacement and solvent velocity in
   long, hydrogel-filled, thin-slit channels subjected to an oscillatory,
   longitudinal electric field. This work is motivated by recent attempts
   to advance electrical microrheology as a diagnostic tool for probing the
   zeta-potential of colloidal particles immobilized in hydrogels. Within
   the standard, linearized electrokinetic model for elastic porous
   networks, we obtain an exact analytical solution, furnishing the
   skeleton displacement and fluid velocity. This reveals intricate spatial
   and temporal dynamics, reflecting balances between electrical, elastic,
   inertial, and viscous forces. Formulas are evaluated using
   multi-precision complex arithmetic, which is necessary to accommodate
   large length-scale disparities. Here, we explore the dynamics in open
   channels, for a small, but experimentally representative, set of
   dimensional parameters. Upon traversing inertial-viscous,
   inertial-elastic, and visco-elastic characteristic frequencies, charged
   hydrogels transit from low-frequency dynamics, where the solvent can be
   considered to migrate in a stationary skeleton, to high-frequency
   dynamics, where the skeleton translates within a practically stationary
   fluid. At the inertial-elastic frequency, which presents a primary
   resonance peak, O(nm) displacements are achieved under accessible
   experimental conditions. Therefore, in back-focal-plane interferometry
   experiments, which can register Angstrom-level harmonic particle
   displacements in hydrogels, it will be prudent to account for the
   background spatial and temporal dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid crystals (LCs) are synthetic and biological viscoelastic
   anisotropic soft matter materials that have a combination of fluidity of
   liquids and anisotropy of solids and find use in optical devices,
   sensor/actuators, lubrication and super-fibres. Mesogens are frequently
   mixed with colloidal and nanoparticles (NPs), other mesogens, isotropic
   solvents, thermoplastic polymers, cross-linkable monomers, among others.
   This comprehensive review presents recent progress in meso-and
   macro-scale thermodynamic modelling, highlighting (i) the novelties in
   spinodal and binodal lines in various phase diagrams, (ii) the growth
   laws under phase transitions and phase separation, (iii) the ubiquitous
   role of metastability and its manifestation in complex droplet
   interfaces, (iv) the various spinodal decompositions due to composition
   and order fluctuations, (v) the formation of novel material
   architectures such as colloidal crystals, (vi) the particle-rich phase
   behaviour in LC nanocomposites, (vii) the use of topological defects to
   absorb and organise NPs and (viii) the ability of faceted NPs to link
   into strings and organise into lattices. Emphasis is given to highlight
   dominant mechanisms and driving forces, and to link them to specific
   terms in the free energies of these complex mixtures. The novelties of
   incorporating mesophases into blends, solutions, dispersions and
   mixtures are revealed by using theory, modelling, computation and

Abstract = {{In previous work, we demonstrate a simple approach to creating a
   plasmonic polymer. Reflecting upon the need for greater spot density
   while still maintaining the objective of low cost analysis, the next
   generation of device is described where density up to 24000 sensing
   spots is achievable. A localized surface plasmon micro-array is
   described formed by single or multiple deposition of a nanorod plasmonic
   polymer by micro-contact printing. The structure of the polymer can be
   made micro-porous and thickness can be controlled by a cyclical
   deposition and rapid heat cure protocol. The consistency of feature
   deposition is assessed. The resulting micro-structure provides a large
   surface area for immobilization of biomolecules for assay development.
   Dark-field analysis of the polymer demonstrates complex microstructure
   and intense Mie Scattering as expected from gold nanorods. Using
   fluorescence confocal analysis images of the polymer demonstrates two
   independent photo-luminescent emission spectra. The two independent
   emission spectra are linked to the positions of the localized surface
   plasmons of the nanorods, using a pump source of 543nm excites the
   transverse plasmon (peak at 550nm) and it's commensurate emission, but
   doesn't excite the longer emission around 700nm that is linked to the
   longitudinal Plasmon around 737nm. The different emissions are
   demonstrated in the illumination of different portions of the polymer
   matrix under each pump source excitation. The potential for multiple
   spectroscopic biosensor analysis is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The inverse problem related to eddy current testing (ECT) is
   often formulated as a shape optimization problem. The purpose of this
   paper is to propose a methodology for determining the optimal parameters
   of a sensor system for more accurate reconstruction of the crack shape.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an objective function is
   formulated using the shape sensitivity information computed from the ECT
   data. The design of a non-destructive testing (NDT) sensor is carried
   out through optimizing the sensor parameters under such a criterion.
   Findings - The methodology proposed results in modifications to the
   original sensor geometry which makes it more sensitive to the depth
   changes in a crack. A square wave form of excitation is used in order to
   provide more information on the size of the crack at different depths,
   essentially through the superposition of a range of excitation
   frequencies, each of which has a different depth of penetration. The
   newly designed ECT sensor system is suitable for dealing with the
   natural crack problem.
   Research limitations/implications - While the methodology is general and
   has been shown to work in a simulated environment, the result is not
   verified by the experiments because the newly designed device has not
   actually been fabricated.
   Originality/value - This paper has demonstrated the possibility of
   designing a sensor probe using computer aided design tools without
   extensive physical testing. The design process is novel and based on a
   sensitivity approach. This is shown to be very efficient and effective
   and the solution of the inverse problem demonstrates a very fast
   convergence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for the linear analysis of the stiffness
   and strength of open and closed cell lattices with arbitrary topology.
   The method hinges on a multiscale approach that separates the analysis
   of the lattice in two scales. At the macroscopic level, the lattice is
   considered as a uniform material: at the microscopic scale, on the other
   hand, the cell microstructure is modelled in detail by means of an
   in-house finite element solver. The method allows determine the
   macroscopic stiffness, the internal forces in the edges and walls of the
   lattice, as well as the global periodic buckling loads, along with their
   buckling modes. Four cube-based lattices and nine cell topologies
   derived by Archimedean polyhedra are studied. Several of them are
   characterized here for the first time with a particular attention on the
   role that the cell wall plays on the stiffness and strength properties.
   The method, automated in a computational routine, has been used to
   develop material property charts that help to gain insight into the
   performance of the lattices under investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
