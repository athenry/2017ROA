Abstract = {{Different powertrain topologies have various advantages and
   disadvantages when used in electric vehicles. In this paper, the
   efficiencies of two different powertrains are compared. Both designs use
   a 2 level inverter and a surface mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous
   Motor (PMSM). In the first design the inverter is directly powered by a
   high voltage battery and is operated using traditional pulse-width
   modulation (PWM). In the second design a bidirectional DC-DC is used to
   connect a lower voltage battery to the inverter and is operated using a
   variable DC link voltage strategy. These two systems are referred to as
   St and S2, respectively. The powertrains are designed to operate a class
   4 delivery truck, which is driven by one motor attached to each rear
   wheel assembly. The efficiency maps of these systems are examined in the
   context of different drive cycles for a delivery truck. Furthermore,
   standard and experimentally captured drive cycles are compared and the
   results demonstrate the conditions under which system S2 is most
   effective.}},

Abstract = {{Modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a promising topology for medium
   and high power applications. The MMC system consists a large number of
   sub-modules (SMs), which take long time to simulate. In a real-time
   simulator, the MMC model is optimized to have a fast simulation speed
   for real-time applications, such as hardware-in-the-loop (BM) tests. The
   methodology to evaluate model fidelity is important. In this paper, a
   methodology is proposed to validate an MMC model capable of real time
   simulation and implemented in central processing unit (CPU) and
   field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The model is validated in both
   open-loop and closed loop control in a simple MMC test system, and
   compared to a reference detailed model made with SimPowerSystems (SPS)
   blocks. The effect of the model sampling time on the accuracy is also
   studied. The results indicate the MMC model optimized for real time
   simulation with a time step of 25 mu s is as accurate as an SPS model
   with a time step of 0.2 mu s.}},

Abstract = {{The use of six-phase motors is an attractive option for electric and
   hybrid electric vehicles due to its modularity. Demand for high power
   density and lower costs for electric traction drives has led to the idea
   of integrating the battery charging function into the traction drive.
   When the main battery for dual motor type electric and hybrid electric
   vehicles is being charged, the equivalent power converter system is two
   converters that act as rectifiers and are connected in parallel. Feeding
   these converters from the AC grid with interleaved discontinuous PWM
   schemes can result in the appearance of a significant amount of
   circulating current flowing between the converters. Such circulating
   current increases converter component stresses and reduces
   battery-charging efficiency. In the paper, a PWM scheme based on
   discontinuous PWM methods is proposed to mitigate this circulating
   current. The proposed scheme does not require additional passive
   elements and maintains the benefits of discontinuous PWM. Simulation and
   experimental results are presented to validate the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{With the more substantial large-scale wind integration projects
   implemented in the province of Alberta, wind power has been growing
   steadily in the province to meet the increasing consumer demands.
   Meanwhile the transmission and distribution networks are being updated
   to satisfy the transmission capacity. Under the transmission line and
   substation construction with planned transmission line outages, it may
   expose the wind farm with radial connected with the main grid. The
   contingency plan usually has the anti-islanding protection scheme
   activated that will trip off wind farm and result in the loss of supply
   for the load in the island. This paper explores the method that the DFIG
   typed wind farm can survive with autonomous frequency control for
   islanding operation in a short term period without any energy storage
   devices. DFIGs synchronize to form a reliable wind farm frequency source
   which does not collapse when member DFIGs fail. The frequency enables
   frequency droop control to be implemented for load sharing and maximized
   the critical load online time in the island. The paper identifies that
   at the instant of islanding the excess wind power can accelerate the
   wind turbine-generators beyond their safe speed limit to be a critical
   problem. This problem can be solved when the designed turbine-pitch
   angles control method applied.}},

   showing that it can implement active filtering under asymmetrical

   Fliege notch filter; (U) dead-beat control of the VSC; (in) an
   innovative predictive estimation method which exploits periodicity of
   the distorted waveforms. Active filtering capability is on top of
   previously demonstrated capabilities to provide support against voltage

Abstract = {{A theoretical approach is presented to study nonlinear vibrations of
   thin infinitely long rectangular plates subjected to pulsatile axial
   inviscid flow. The case of plates in axial uniform flow under the action
   of constant transmural pressure is also addressed for different flow
   velocities. The equations of motion are obtained based on the von Karman
   nonlinear plate theory retaining in-plane inertia via Lagrangian
   approach. The fluid model is based on potential flow theory and the
   Galerkin method is applied to determine the expression of the flow
   perturbation potential. The effect of different system parameters such
   as flow velocity, pulsation amplitude, pulsation frequency, and channel
   pressurization on the stability of the plate and its geometrically
   nonlinear response to pulsating flow are fully discussed. In case of
   zero uniform transmural pressure numerical results show hardening type
   behavior for the entire flow velocity range when the pulsation frequency
   is spanned in the neighbourhood of the plate's fundamental frequency.
   Conversely, a softening type behavior is presented when a uniform
   transmural pressure is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse Superposition Codes are a class of capacity achieving codes for
   which decoding can be interpreted as a compressive sensing problem. The
   approximate message passing algorithm, proven to be effective in
   compressive sensing, has been proposed in different incarnations as a
   valid decoding approach. However, most literature focuses on infinite
   code length and asymptotic performance, while the strong reliance on
   matrix- and vector-wise operations suggests that a hardware-oriented
   approach might be more efficient. This work analyzes the performance of
   two decoding algorithms with finite code lengths and fixed point
   precision: 5-bit codeword symbol quantization is shown to cause
   performance degradation <= 0.15 dB. Inalgorithm quantization values are
   proposed, together with code construction and algorithm approximations
   that cause negligible performance degradation. After selecting a set of
   codes as a case study, a decoding complexity estimation is performed,
   demonstrating that a fully parallel architecture is unfeasible.
   Suggestions and improvements towards partially-parallel solutions are
   given.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of hydroponics with aquaculture is known as Aquaponic,
   is gaining increased attention as a bio-integrated food production
   system. The research presented highlights our ability to link hydroponic
   garlic culture with tilapia fish production system to increase food
   production. The experiment consisted of three treatments included garlic
   culture without fish (G), garlic culture with tilapia fish (GT) and
   tilapia fish culture without garlic (T).
   The fresh and dry mass of the plants was greater when cultured with the
   tilapia. The fresh mass of the bulbs and leaves were 1.7 and 1.5 times
   respectively greater, while the dry mass of bulbs and leaves were 1.4
   and 1.6 times, respectively greater with the tilapia than garlic alone.
   Total medicinal compound ajoene content in the garlic with tilapia was
   3.1 times greater than garlic alone. Total ajoene content in newly
   developed garlic bulbs and leaves were 2.6 and 2.2 times, respectively,
   greater with tilapia than alone. The growth rate of the tilapia in the
   combined culture was 1.3 times greater than alone. Young leaves as well
   as the bulbs of garlic are edible and palatable and good source of
   ajoene. This research shows that garlic plants and tilapia can be
   successfully co-cultured in an integrated system resulting in an
   increased production for both fish and plant.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an online, time-dependent clustering algorithm that employs
   a dynamic probabilistic topic model. The proposed algorithm can handle
   data that evolves over time and strives to capture the evolution of
   clusters in the dataset. It addresses the case where the entire dataset
   is not available at once (e.g., the case of data streams) but an
   up-to-date clustering of the data at any given time is required. One of
   the main challenges of the data stream setting is that the computational
   cost and memory overhead must stay bounded as the number of data points
   increases. Our proposed algorithm has a Dirichlet process-based
   generative component combined with a sequential Monte Carlo sampler for
   posterior inference. We also introduce a novel modification to the

Abstract = {{Multi-task learning (MTL) for deep neural network (DNN) multilingual
   acoustic models has been shown to be effective for learning parameters
   that are common or shared between multiple languages{[}1, 2]. In the MTL
   paradigm, the number of parameters in the output layer is large and
   scales with the number of languages used in training. This output layer
   becomes a computational bottleneck. For mono-lingual DNNs, low-rank
   matrix factorization (LRMF) of weight matrices have yielded large
   computational savings {[}3, 4]. The LRMF proposed in this work for MTL,
   is for the original language-specific block matrices to ``share{''} a
   common matrix, with resulting low-rank language specific block matrices.
   The impact of LRMF is presented in two scenarios, namely : (a) improving
   performance in a target language when auxiliary languages are included
   during multi-lingual training; and (b) cross-language transfer to an
   unseen language with only 1 hour of transcribed training data. A 44\%
   parameter reduction in the final layer, manifests itself in providing a
   lower memory footprint and faster training times. An experimental study
   shows that the LRMF multi-lingual DNN provides competitive performance
   compared to a full-rank multi-lingual DNN in both scenarios.}},

   with the objective of maximizing the mutual information. During each
   retransmission attempt, we choose the RE precoder matrix columns from
   the set of transmit array response vectors. For a given RE precoder, we
   show that the optimal baseband precoder is a function of the generalized
   eigen-matrix of the Gram matrices of the effective channel matrix and
   the RE precoding matrix. The optimal baseband precoder for each

Abstract = {{We study the stochastic user scheduling and power control problem for an

   randomly harvest renewable energies from the environment. For each user,
   the renewable energies and arriving data packets with a constant rate
   are stored in energy (battery) and data buffers, respectively. Users
   have statistical packet delay constraints in terms of maximum acceptable
   delay outage probabilities. We classify the users as prioritized and non
   prioritized users. Our goal is to maximize the arrival rate of the non
   prioritized user while supporting the minimum data rate requirements for
   the prioritized users. We reformulate the problem as an infinite horizon
   Markov decision process (MDP) using asymptotic delay analysis and study
   the optimal scheduling and power control policy. Since the optimal
   policy requires centralized processing with high computational
   complexity, we develop a reduced complexity distributed algorithm, which
   can be implemented at each individual user. Online algorithm is devised,
   which does not require the statistical knowledge of the channel fading

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive hybrid TDMA-CSMA MAC protocol to improve
   network performance and isolation among service providers (SPs) in a
   virtualized 802.11 network. Aiming to increase network efficiency,
   wireless virtualization provides the means to slice available resources
   among different SPs, with an urge to keep different slices isolated.
   Hybrid TDMA-CSMA can be a proper MAC candidate in such scenario
   benefiting from both the TDMA isolation power and the CSMA opportunistic
   nature. In this paper, we propose a dynamic MAC that schedules
   high-traffic users in the TDMA phase with variable size to be
   determined. Then, the rest of active users compete to access the channel
   through CSMA. The objective is to search for a scheduling that maximizes
   the expected sum throughput subject to SP reservations. In the absence
   of arrival traffic statistics, this scheduling is modeled as a
   multi-armed bandit (MAD) problem, in which each arm corresponds to a
   possible scheduling. Due to the dependency between the arms, existing
   policies are not directly applicable in this problem. Thus, we present
   an index-based policy where we update and decide based on learning
   indexes assigned to each user instead of each arm. To update the
   indexes, in addition to TDMA information, observations from CSMA phase
   are used, which adds a new exploration phase for the proposed MAD
   problem. Throughput and isolation performance of the proposed
   self-exploration-aided index-based policy (SIP) are evaluated by
   numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{Battery chargers for plugin electric vehicles can be costly and add to
   the weight and volume of the vehicle when designed to be on-board.
   Conversely, integrated battery chargers not only re-use the already
   available components on-board but also provide a higher charging power
   capability than their dedicated counterparts. Such chargers use the
   traction motor's windings as input filter when connected to the
   three-phase supply. Surface mounted permanent magnet motors have not
   been used for integrated battery chargers for the apparent risk of rotor
   movement while charging. This paper demonstrates the use of a surface
   mounted permanent magnet motor to charge the battery while identifying
   the limiting factors of its implementation. The maximum torque (70Nm)
   developed on the rotor while charging is calculated using an FEA model
   of the motor and is found to be within the limits that a vehicle can
   withstand. Efficiencies up to 97\% with an acceptable THD was achieved
   with a scaled down power version of the charger.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the estimation of the frictional torque of the
   synchromesh during the gear shifting operation in an electric vehicle
   equipped with a clutchless automated manual transmission (AMT). The
   clutchless drivetrain of the electric vehicle is discussed and the
   dynamical model of the powertrain from the electric traction motor to
   the synchromesh system of a two-speed AMT is developed. In order to
   estimate the frictional torque of the synchromesh, which is indeed an
   unknown input to the dynamical system, it is assumed to be generated by
   a fictitious autonomous system. Thereafter, the augmented state- space
   representation of the actual and fictitious state variables, which forms
   the basis for the observer design, is provided and the observability of
   this augmented system is discussed. A deterministic Luenberger observer
   and a stochastic Kalman-Bucy filter are designed in order to estimate
   the frictional torque of the synchromesh. The estimation is based on the
   measuring angular velocities of the electric motor and synchro ring
   together with the known electromagnetic torque of the traction motor.
   The performance of the observers is assessed experimentally by means of
   a test rig. The results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the
   stochastic observer when the system encounters process and measurement
   noise which are likely to happen in practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a multi-physics approach to the force control of an
   electromagnetic solenoid system utilized to perform the gear shifting in
   an electric vehicle equipped with an automated manual transmission.
   Considering different operating conditions of the electric vehicles, the
   operating temperature of the gear shifting system varies on the time
   scales of minutes, hours, days and seasons. Such a temperature variation
   affects the performance of the gear shifting process in electric
   vehicles which are equipped with automated manual transmissions and
   causes a considerable uncertainty in the dynamical behavior of the gear
   shifting system. The aim of the present study is to develop a control
   strategy to perform an efficient gear shifting in different operating
   temperatures. To this end, a coupled thermal-electromagnetic modeling
   approach is followed to identify the uncertainty model and to model the
   perturbed systems. The accuracy of the obtained uncertainty model is
   verified by a set of experiments. Knowing the perturbed systems, the.
   synthesis robust control technique is employed to design a robust
   closed-loop force control system which ensures a satisfactory gear
   shifting over the entire range of operating temperatures. The simulation
   results validate the robustness, performance, and stability criteria.}},

Abstract = {{A new unit of encapsulation called the concern is at the center of
   Concern-Orientation. Building on techniques for advanced Separation of
   Concerns, from Model-Driven Engineering, and from Software Product
   Lines, Concern-Orientation is a reuse paradigm that stipulates the use
   of three interfaces to enable broad, generic reuse: the variation,
   customization, and usage interfaces. Higher-level concerns reuse
   lower-level concerns, resulting in concern hierarchies where lower-level
   concern models are composed with higher-level concern models. As part of
   the variation interface, goal models are used to describe the impact of
   features of a concern on system qualities. Consequently, goal models of
   lower-level concerns must be combined with goal models of higher-level
   concerns to enable reasoning about system qualities in concern
   hierarchies. However, existing propagation-based reasoning mechanisms
   for goal models still assume a monolithic goal model, which is not
   appropriate for concern-oriented reuse. To address this issue, this
   paper presents novel modeling constructs to enable the reuse of
   lower-level goal models in the context of Concern-Orientation, extends
   existing propagation-based reasoning mechanisms of goal models for use
   in concern hierarchies, and reports on a proof-of-concept implementation
   of the novel modeling constructs and the extended reasoning mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Turbine disks in powder metallurgy (PM) superalloy have been widely used
   in advanced aeroengines. The production of PM superalloy turbine disks
   involves a series of heat treatment processes, which would inevitably
   create residual stresses. It has been proved that the low cycle fatigue
   (LCF) life of the turbine disk is affected by the residual stresses. The
   computational simulation of heat treatment is considered as an effective
   way to evaluate the residual stresses in a turbine disk. A fmite element
   software was used to simulate the heat treatment processes of a FGH95
   turbine disk to obtain the residual stress field.
   To investigate the relaxation of residual stress in FGH95, smooth bar
   specimens were measured by X-ray diffraction before and after being
   loaded. Modified by the residual stresses, SWT model is used to predict
   the low cycle fatigue life of the turbine disk modified by the residual
   stress field obtained from the simulation of heat treatment.
   By the comparison between the prediction modified by the residual stress
   and the prediction without modification, a considerable decrease in low
   cycle fatigue life is indicated.}},

Abstract = {{The friendship paradox is a sociological phenomenon stating that most
   people have fewer friends than their friends do. The generalized
   friendship paradox refers to the same observation for attributes other
   than degree, and it has been observed in Twitter and scientific
   collaboration networks. This paper takes an analytical approach to model
   this phenomenon. We consider a preferential attachment-like network
   growth mechanism governed by both node degrees and `qualities'. We
   introduce measures to quantify paradoxes, and contrast the results
   obtained in our model to those obtained for an uncorrelated network,
   where the degrees and qualities of adjacent nodes are uncorrelated. We
   shed light on the effect of the distribution of node qualities on the
   friendship paradox. We consider both the mean and the median to measure
   paradoxes, and compare the results obtained by using these two
   statistics.}},

   growth hitherto, where the number of links that each new incoming node
   establishes is the same across layers. This paper focuses on
   heterogeneous growth in a simple two-layer setting. We first analyze the
   case of two preferentially growing layers and find a closed-form
   expression for the inter-layer degree distribution, and demonstrate that
   non-trivial inter-layer degree correlations emerge in the steady state.
   Then we focus on the case of uniform growth. We observe that inter-layer
   correlations arise in the random case, too. Also, we observe that the
   expression for the average layer-2 degree of nodes whose layer-1 degree
   is k, is identical for the uniform and preferential schemes. Throughout,
   theoretical predictions are corroborated using Monte Carlo simulations.}},

   collapse, and interaction effects with the adjacent two solid spherical
   particles which are not necessarily of equal size. The model assumes
   that the flow surrounding the bubble and two particles is
   incompressible. A 2-D Finite Element method which is capable of tracking
   the ultra fast moving boundary of the bubble is developed and an
   associated computer program is written to solve the modeled equations
   and boundary conditions. In the absence of a similar study in the
   literature, the validation (although not shown here) of the numerical
   method is carried out by solving the expansion and collapse of a single
   bubble initially resting in an infinite extent of fluid for which
   theoretical results are well-known in the literature. A good agreement
   is obtained between the numerical and theoretical results {[}18].
   Numerical results for the temporal shapes of the bubble, its lifetimes
   for various parametric cases are provided and discussed. The variations
   of the pressure and the velocity fields in the liquid surrounding the
   bubble and two particles are also analyzed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This work deals with the numerical investigation of vortex shedding in a
   square cylinder. The simulation has been done for 2D turbulent flow.
   Reynolds number (Re) is considered 22000. In order to resolve the flow
   field, both Reynolds Average Navier-stokes (RANS) model and Large Eddy
   Simulation (LES) technique were used. Standard k-epsilon model is
   considered among different RANS model in order to resolve the mean
   velocity field and the LES is used to capture the flow separation in the
   flow field. Both average velocity and velocity fluctuation are
   determined and compared. Different turbulence properties such as
   turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent intensity, eddy viscosity and
   vorticity magnitude are determined and presented for different
   downstream location to describe the complex flow property in turbulent
   regime. First the mesh independence test is done by different mesh size.
   ANSYS Fluent is used for the simulation. A pressured based solver is
   used with SIMPLE solution scheme, in order to find different flow
   variables. The results are compared with available published data. There
   are significant agreements with the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental validation and calibration of numerical simulations of a
   closed-loop thermosyphon operating under steady-state conditions with
   slurries of a microencapsulated phase-change material (MCPCM) suspended
   in distilled water are presented. The slurries exhibited a
   non-Newtonian, shear thinning, power-law rheological behavior in the
   range of parameters considered; and the constants in the related model
   were calibrated using data from specially conducted experiments. The
   flows of these slurries in the problems of interest were laminar.
   Furthermore, the velocity and temperature differences between the
   dispersed and conveying phases of these slurries were negligibly small,
   so homogeneous models could be used for mathematical representations of
   the fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena. A hybrid numerical method
   was used in the simulations: detailed two-dimensional axisymmetric
   control-volume finite element (CVFEM) simulations of the heated and
   cooled sections of the thermosyphon were coupled with segmented
   quasi-one-dimensional finite volume (FVM) simulations of the other
   portions. The CVFEM and FVM used in this work are well-established.
   Thus, the verification of these methods is not addressed here. Rather,
   the details of the thermosyphon, effective properties of the MCPCM and
   slurries, overviews of the hybrid model and the aforementioned numerical
   methods, notes on the experimental calibration and validation, and some
   results are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The design, construction, and calibration of a wall-shear stress sensor
   (WSSS) made of a flush-mounted hot-wire over a shallow rectangular slot
   are described. The rectangular slot beneath the hot-wire reduces the
   heat loss to the substrate and enhances the frequency response of the
   WSSS. The WSSS was connected to a constant-temperature anemometer (CTA)
   and calibrated by making measurements in fully developed flows of air in
   a parallel-plate channel, at three different channel heights. Initially,
   the square of the time-averaged voltage supplied to the hot-wire by the
   CTA was plotted against the time-averaged wall-shear-stress. With this
   practice, however, for a fixed value of the overheat ratio, even
   relatively small fluctuations of the ambient air temperature produced a
   fair amount of scatter in the calibration data, and this adverse effect
   was compounded by minor drifts in the electrical resistance of the
   hot-wire (unheated value) over the course of the measurements. For
   overcoming this difficulty, an alternative practice for correlating the
   calibration data was proposed and successfully implemented. The details
   of this WSSS, the proposed novel calibration practice for the WSSS, and
   related results are presented and discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{A seamless two-speed transmission that incorporates a two-stage
   planetary gear set with common sun and common ring gears and two braking
   mechanisms to control the flow of power is introduced. For an electric
   vehicle equipped with such a transmission, a detailed dynamical model of
   the driveline including the half shaft stiffness and longitudinal
   vehicle dynamics is derived by exploiting the torque balance and virtual
   work principle. A deterministic Luenberger observer and a stochastic
   Kalman-Bucy filter are designed to estimate the unmeasured states. These
   observers estimate the speed of the sun and ring gears and the input and
   output torques of the transmission based on the measured speeds of the
   electric motor and the vehicle. Due to nonlinearities in the system such
   as the longitudinal vehicle dynamics, nonlinear observer methods
   generally apply for the observer design. However, the nonlinearities are
   only function of measurable states. Hence, using linear output injection
   to design an observer results in linear error dynamics. Therefore, the
   nonlinear observer design problem is transformed into the design of an
   observer for a linear system. The simulation and experimental results
   are presented to verify and compare the performance of the deterministic
   Luenberger estimator with stochastic Kalman-Bucy filter when the system
   encounters noise.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is the design of a biaxial MEMS accelerometer
   for navigation applications. First, a survey is conducted to outline the
   commercial landscape of navigation-grade and MEMS accelerometers. The
   survey shows a potential market for navigation-grade accelerometers at
   the MEMS scale. Based on the specifications for navigation applications,
   the design targets are derived for the proposed biaxial MEMS
   accelerometers, including the common concerns of natural frequency
   ratios and bandwidth, as well as the important parameters for MEMS
   devices, such as hinge width, proof-mass size and mobility range. In
   light of the design targets, the ideal frequency matrix of the biaxial
   accelerometer system is derived based on the concept of generalized
   spring, in connection with the design targets. The stiffness values
   required are estimated herein. For further structural optimization, the
   parametric entries of the frequency-ratio matrix act as the objectives
   to be maximized for the lowest off axis sensitivity of the proposed
   accelerometer. A suitable architecture for MEMS biaxial accelerometers
   is proposed thereafter This architecture not only provides high
   compliance and structural isotropy for the in plane translation, but
   also allows for direct measurement of the proof-mass motion. The
   proposed architecture is then optimized for the highest frequency ratio
   between the non-sensitive and sensitive axes, with regard to the design
   parameters and constraints. The optimization results of the proposed
   accelerometer demonstrate navigation-grade mechanical performance.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal ions released into various water environments have severe
   impact on both human beings and aqueous environments, and excess amount
   of lead and aluminum ions pose high risks to human health and could
   cause life-threatened diseases. The existence of metal ions in drinking
   water contributes most to the daily intake by humans, and thus it urges
   to develop a rapid, low-cost and sensitive method for detection of heavy
   metal ions. In this research, we develop a portable analytical system
   for metal ion detection in water by combining a powerful gold
   nanoparticle (AuNP) based colorimetric method with lab-on-a chip
   technology. We utilize single-step assays involving surface
   functionalized AuNPs for colorimetric detection of lead (Pb2+) and
   aluminum (AI(3+)) ions in water with low limit of detection (LOD) and
   high sensitivity. We demonstrate that this portable system provides LODs
   of 30 ppb for Pb2+ and 89 ppb for Al3+, both comparable to bench-top
   analytical spectrometers. The system permits metal ion detections in a
   more economical and convenient fashion, and is particularly useful for
   water quality monitoring in remote and/or resource-poor settings.}},

Abstract = {{The stiffness of plant tissue largely influences the overall mechanical
   response of plant organs, such as stems, branches and leaf petioles.
   This work examines the structural hierarchy of the plant tissue; in
   particular of the collenchyma tissue of the Rheum rhabarbaruin. The goal
   of the paper is to develop a multiscale model capturing features of two
   orders of its structural hierarchy: cell wall and tissue architecture.
   The former is considered as a fiber reinforced composite, where the
   cellulose microfibril (CMF) is the main load bearing component. The
   longitudinal stiffness of the middle (S2) layer of the secondary cell
   wall is affected by the microfibril angle (MFA) up to 45 degrees to a
   greater extent, which in turn plays a role in the overall wall
   stiffness. The latter, i.e. tissue architecture, influences the tissue
   stiffness through its random distribution of cells. Finite-edge
   Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (FECVT) is used to model the
   non-periodic microstructure of the rhubarb collenchyma, whose effective
   elastic properties are obtained through finite element analysis. The
   results from the FECVT model show that the effective stiffness in the
   longitudinal direction is 15 to 25\% higher than that in the transverse
   direction for relative density between 5 and 30\%. The variation
   reflects the stiffening effect of the shape and size of the cells in the
   collenchyma tissue, as well as its aperiodic cellular distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The current work is focused on numeric investigation of aerodynamic load
   developed on a wind turbine blade and its effects on aeroelastic
   characteristics of a wind turbine blade. In order to do that proper
   turbulent model along with appropriate assumptions need to be
   determined. Geometry is modeled with actual blade data for both twist
   and tapper. The blade tip is not considered during the modeling.
   Validation is done by NREL phase VI wind turbine blade data as well as
   other published data. Finally the aerodynamic load obtained from the CFD
   simulation is transferred to perform the structural analysis. It has
   been found that the load distribution along the blade span is not
   linear. It varies with the span length and it also varies along the
   chord of the blade airfoil. Due to this varying load the stresses
   developed in the blade are dissimilar which dictates the skin thickness
   of the blade and the shape of the spur inside the blade. It has also
   been observed that the aerodynamic characteristics such as lift
   coefficient (CO and pressure coefficient (Cp) changes with the
   deflection of the blade which affects the power output of the wind
   turbine. Finally a pre-bent blade model has been analyzed and the effect
   due to the bent on the performance of the wind turbine has been observed
   and presented. It has been found that the pre-bent blade has better Cp
   distribution than deflected blade and the deviation of Cp from the
   actual straight blade reduce significantly in pre-bent blade compare to
   deflected blade. The pressure distribution along the chord of the blade
   airfoil at different locations have been observed and presented.}},

Abstract = {{A critical plane approach in combination with principal component
   analysis (PCA) for determining dominant damage factors (DDFs) was
   developed for single crystal nickel superalloys at elevated temperature.
   Maximum resolved shear stress (RSS), maximum slip rate and other 2
   mesoscopic parameters on the critical plane, defined as the preferential
   slip plane, were selected as damage parameters. Correlation analysis
   results indicated that there were strong correlations (i.e.
   multicollinearity) among the selected parameters. To address this issue,
   PCA was performed to eliminate the effect of multicollinearity and the
   DDFs were determined as well. Based on the DDFs a life model was
   proposed and then validated by the fatigue experimental results. Most of
   the experimental lives are within the factor three of the predicted
   ones. The life model has a relatively simple form with reliable
   constants which facilitates the application in industry design.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented reality has the potential to aid surgeons with particular
   surgical tasks in image-guided surgery. In augmented reality (AR)
   visualization for neurosurgery, the live view of the surgical scene is
   merged with preoperative patient data, aiding the surgeon in mapping

   Furthermore, augmented reality visualization allows the surgeon to see
   beyond the visible surface of the head or brain at the anatomy that is
   relevant at different stages of surgery. In this paper, the particular
   surgical tasks that have benefited from AR visualization by the
   neurosurgeons that have used our system are described. These tasks
   include: tailoring a craniotomy, localizing the anatomy of interest,
   planning a resection corridor and determining a surgical strategy. We
   present each of these surgical tasks and provide examples of how AR was

Abstract = {{Constant and variable stiffness strategies have been developed to design
   a composite laminate. With the former, each layer is designed with
   straight fibers that have the highest stiffness and strength in the
   fiber direction. With the latter, on the other hand, the stiffness can
   change within each layer by placing the fibers along a curvilinear fiber
   path. A variable stiffness design results in improved structural
   performance, as well as opens up opportunities to search for trade-off
   among structural properties. During the manufacture of a variable
   stiffness design with Automated Fiber Placement, certain defects in the
   form of gaps and overlaps could appear within the laminate and affect
   the laminate performance. In this study, we use the first-order shear
   deformation theory to assess the effect of transverse shear stresses on
   the critical buckling load, free and forced vibration of a variable
   stiffness laminate with embedded defects, an issue so far rarely
   examined in literature. The governing differential equations for the
   static analysis are first derived. A semi-analytic solution is then
   obtained using the hybrid Fourier-Galerkin method and the numeric time
   integration technique. The eigenvalue analysis is also conducted to
   determine the fundamental frequency and critical buckling load of the
   plate. It is found that the behavior of a variable stiffness plate is
   much more affected by the shear stresses than a constant stiffness
   plate. Ignoring the effect of transverse shear stresses results in 34\%
   error in the predicted buckling load of a variable stiffness laminate
   with overlaps and a length-to thickness ratio of 10.}},

   efficiency based on thermodynamic and fluid flow analysis. Thermal
   management system is one of the main research fields in scramjet design.
   As it has no moving parts, the total thermal efficiency depends on inlet
   conditions, conditions of combustor exit and conditions of the engine
   exit. A combustor exit condition dictates the velocity and temperature
   after combustion. we concentrate our focus on this section. The first
   part of the paper, we tried to describe the fundamental exergy
   relationship for scramjet and we developed the relation of exergy
   distribution and exergy delivery rate. From an extensive literature
   review, we have found the relations between fluid velocity, pressure and
   temperature, which is described in the later part of the paper. Our main
   focus is to develop a combined relation of thermal efficiency in terms
   of engine exit velocity, temperature and air-fuel ratio. Different
   characteristic parameters such as overall efficiency, thermal
   efficiency, specific impulse have been determined at different inlet
   temperature ratio or the cycle static temperature ratio (T-3/T-0) and an
   optimum inlet temperature ratio is proposed for maximum overall

Abstract = {{This paper examines the time-harmonic eigenstrain behavior of a
   magnetoelastic sandwich cylinder with solid and cellular material
   layers. A sandwich panel subjected to an external magnetic field is
   assumed to endure an eigenstrain with a cubic polynomial radial
   distribution in the sandwich core. Using asymptotic homogenization, the
   effective material properties of the cellular material are determined as
   a function of relative density for. various cell topologies, that are
   used in the cellular layers of a cylinder under given magnetic field.
   Bessel, Struve, and Lommel functions are used to obtain semi analytic
   solutions for a sandwich cylinder with perfectly and imperfectly bonded
   interfaces. The results are first verified with those available in the
   literature of composite cylinders with solid material layers. Then the
   paper studies the role that cell topology, relative density, and bonding
   type at the layer interfaces play on the time-harmonic magnetoelastic
   responses. The numerical results reveal that the proper choice of
   relative density, cell topology, and cellular layer configuration can
   reduce the weight and stress regime, as well as improve the dynamic
   response of a sandwich cylinder subjected to a given magnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{Annually, influenza virus infects millions of people worldwide.
   Vaccination programs against seasonal influenza infections require the
   production of hundreds of million doses within a very short period of
   time. The influenza vaccine is currently produced using a technology
   developed in the 1940s that relies on replicating the virus in
   embryonated hens' eggs. The monovalent viral preparation is inactivated
   and purified before being formulated in trivalent or tetravalent
   influenza vaccines. The production process has depended on a continuous
   supply of eggs. In the case of pandemic outbreaks, this mode of
   production might be problematic because of a possible drastic reduction
   in the egg supply and the low flexibility of the manufacturing process
   resulting in a lack of supply of the required vaccine doses in a timely
   fashion. Novel production systems using mammalian or insect cell
   cultures have emerged to overcome the limitations of the egg-based
   production system. These industrially well-established production
   systems have been primarily selected for a faster and more flexible
   response to pandemic threats. Here, we review the most important cell
   culture manufacturing processes that have been developed in recent years
   for mass production of influenza vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{The reuse of goal models has received only limited attention in the goal
   modeling community and is mostly related to the use of goal catalogues,
   which may be imported into the goal model of an application under
   development. Two important factors need to be considered when reusing
   goal models. First, a key purpose of a goal model is its evaluation for
   trade-off analysis, which is often based on propagating the
   contributions of low-level tasks (representing considered solutions) to
   high-level goals as specified in the goal model. Second, goal models are
   rarely used in isolation, but are combined with other models that impose
   additional constraints on goal model elements, in particular on tasks.
   For example, workflow models describe causal relationships of tasks in
   goal models. Similarly, feature models describe further constraints on
   tasks, in terms of which tasks may be selected at the same time. This
   paper (i) argues that reusable goal models must be specified either with

Title = {{The autism puzzle: Diffuse but not pervasive neuroanatomical
   abnormalities in children with ASD}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{170-179}},
Abstract = {{Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a clinically diagnosed, heterogeneous,
   neurodevelopmental condition, whose underlying causes have yet to be
   fully determined. A variety of studies have investigated either
   cortical, subcortical, or cerebellar anatomy in ASD, but none have
   conducted a complete examination of all neuroanatomical parameters on a
   single, large cohort. The current study provides a comprehensive
   examination of brain development of children with ASD between the ages
   of 4 and 18 years who are carefully matched for age and sex with
   typically developing controls at a ratio of one-to-two. Two hundred and
   ten magnetic resonance images were examined from 138 Control (116 males
   and 22 females) and 72 participants with ASD (61 males and 11 females).
   Cortical segmentation into 78 brain-regions and 81,924 vertices was
   conducted with CIVET which facilitated a region-of-interest-(ROI-) and
   vertex-based analysis, respectively. Volumes for the cerebellum,
   hippocampus, striatum, pallidum, and thalamus and many associated
   subregions were derived using the MAGeT Brain algorithm. The study
   reveals cortical, subcortical and cerebellar differences between ASD and
   Control group participants. Diagnosis, diagnosis-by-age, and
   diagnosis-by-sex interaction effects were found to significantly impact
   total brain volume but not total surface area or mean cortical thickness
   of the ASD participants. Localized (vertex-based) analysis of cortical
   thickness revealed no significant group differences, even when age,
   age-range, and sex were used as covariates. Nonetheless, the
   region-based cortical thickness analysis did reveal regional changes in
   the left orbitofrontal cortex and left posterior cingulate gyrus, both
   of which showed reduced age-related cortical thinning in ASD. Our
   finding of region-based differences without significant vertex-based
   results likely indicates non-focal effects spanning the entirety of
   these regions. The hippocampi, thalamus, and globus pallidus, were
   smaller in volume relative to total cerebrumin the ASD participants.
   Various sub-structures showed an interaction of diagnosis-by-age,
   diagnosis-by-sex, and diagnosis-by-age-range, in the case where age was
   divided into childhood (age < 12) and adolescence (12 < age < 18). This
   is the most comprehensive imaging-based neuro-anatomical pediatric and
   adolescent ASD study to date. These data highlight the
   neurodevelopmental differences between typically developing children and
   those with ASD, and support aspects of the hypothesis of abnormal
   neuro-developmental trajectory of the brain in ASD. (C) 2015 The

   Clinicians wean infants off ETT-IMV as early as possible using their
   judgment and clinical information. However, assessment of extubation
   readiness is not accurate since 20 to 40\% of preterm infants fail
   extubation. We extended our work in automated prediction of extubation
   readiness by examining correlations of automated cardiorespiratory
   features to clinical parameters in successfully extubated infants. Only
   a few features, mainly those related to variability of breathing
   synchrony, had any consistent correlation with clinical parameters,
   namely gestational age, day of life at extubation, and bicarbonate. We
   conclude that the automated cardiorespiratory features likely provide
   different information additional to clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic joint stiffness defines the torque generated at the joint in
   response to position perturbations. Dynamic stiffness is modulated by
   the angular position and the muscle activation level, making it
   difficult to estimate during large movements and/or time-varying muscle
   contractions. This paper presents a new methodology for estimating
   dynamic joint stiffness during movement and muscle activation. For this,
   we formulate a novel, nonlinear, dynamic joint stiffness model and
   present a new algorithm to estimate its parameters. The algorithm
   assumes that the variability in the model parameters is a function of
   the mean joint position. Using this methodology we estimated the dynamic
   joint stiffness at the ankle throughout ramp and hold displacements
   during a constant muscle contraction. The estimated model accurately
   predicted the intrinsic and reflex torques produced at the ankle as a
   response to small position perturbations during large displacement with
   muscle activation. Preliminary results show that during muscle
   contraction, ankle intrinsic stiffness estimated during movement is
   significantly lower than that estimated during quasi-stationary
   experiments.}},

   (TV) contractions. A linear parameter varying (LPV) identification
   algorithm was used to estimate the Hammerstein system relating ankle
   position to the reflex EMG response. The estimated Hammerstein system
   comprised a time-invariant (TI) linear element and a TV static
   nonlinearity that resembled a half-wave rectifier with a threshold and
   linear gain. The results demonstrated a systematic change in the reflex
   nonlinearity with the activation level. The gain of TV nonlinearity
   increased with activation level reaching its peak at 20-30\% maximum
   voluntary contraction and then decreased. The threshold of the
   nonlinearity decreased with increasing activation level reaching it
   minimum at the same point where the gain was maximal. Using the
   LPV-Hammerstein method in this work, the underlying TV dynamics were
   extracted from small number of trials. Thus, this method can be used to
   study stretch reflexes in subjects with neuromuscular disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Neighbor-area network (NAN), also known as smart meter communication
   network, is one of the most important constitutive segments of smart
   grid communication network. Since almost all smart meters are deployed
   in hash outdoor environment, they could fail or wireless links between
   them could be fluctuating over time. These dynamics could hinder the
   network connectivity and degrade the reliability of data communications.
   However, the robustness of NANs in the case of network element failures
   has not received sufficient attention in existing work. This paper
   therefore proposes a cross-layer scheme that adaptively switches
   preferred parent nodes in order to help the routing protocol for
   low-power and lossy networks (RPL), the state-of-the-art implementation
   of self-organizing routing class, quickly deflect network traffic from
   points of failures in the NAN scenario. Operation and performance of the
   proposed scheme in IEEE 802.11-based wireless mesh NANs are studied by
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a 3-node buffer-aided relaying network with
   statistical delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraints imposed at the
   source and relay. To exploit the relay buffering capability and link
   fading diversity, an adaptive link selection relaying scheme is
   proposed. In a time slot, the relay (R) can adaptively select to receive
   from the source (S) or to transmit to the destination (D) based on the
   instantaneous conditions of the S-R and R-D links. The selection scheme
   aims to maximize the constant supportable arrival rate to the source,
   i.e., the effective capacity in consideration of the link fading
   distributions and the average signal-to-noise power ratios (SNRs) as
   well as the QoS constraints. We compare the capacities of the adaptive
   relaying and the fixed relaying where the relay employs fixed
   transmission and reception schedule, demonstrating the gain of the
   former, especially under loose QoS constraints. The capacities of the
   buffer-aided relaying and non-buffer relaying under similar end-to-end
   delay QoS constraint are also compared, showing the benefits of using
   buffer-aided relaying to support delay-sensitive applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the characterization of the optimal input for
   impulsive ambient noise channels under average power constraint. Our
   focus is on the two-term Gaussian mixture complex noise model, which has
   been widely used to model impulsive noise arising in various
   communication channels. We first demonstrate that there exists a unique
   input distribution that achieves the channel capacity and the
   capacity-achieving input distribution has a uniformly distributed phase.
   By examining the Kuhn-Tucker conditions (KTC), we further show that if
   the optimal amplitude input distribution contains an infinite number of
   mass points on a bounded interval, the channel output must be Gaussian
   distributed. However, by using Bernstein's theorem to examine the
   completely monotonic condition, it is shown that the assumption of a
   Gaussian distributed output is not valid. As a result, there is always a
   finite number of mass points on any bounded interval in the optimal
   amplitude distribution. In addition, by applying a novel bounding
   technique on the KTC and using the Envelop Theorem, we demonstrate that
   the optimal amplitude distribution cannot have an infinite number of
   mass points. That gives us a unique solution of the optimal input having
   discrete amplitude with a finite number of mass points. Given such
   interesting results, we also develop an efficient way to compute the
   discrete optimal input and the corresponding capacity.}},

   differences of convex functions (DC) using suitable matrix
   transformation techniques. Then an algorithmic solution with proven

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of digital self-interference (SI)
   cancellation in full-duplex systems. Under practical transmitter
   imperfections, the received SI is affected by transmitter nonlinearities
   and propagation channel, which need to be estimated in order to cancel
   the SI. The proposed estimation method is based on subspace
   decomposition. The major detriment of subspace technique is the need of
   oversampling or multisensor receiver to obtain a nondegerate noise
   subspace. We modify the traditional subspace techniques by exploiting
   the covariance and the pseudo-covariance of the received signal. This
   enables us to increase the dimension of the received signal without
   resulting to oversampling or multisensor receiver. The different
   parameters are estimated, up to an ambiguity term, without any knowledge
   of the intended signal. We develop a joint detection and ambiguity
   identification procedure that requires a considerably smaller number of
   pilots than standard training-based methods. Simulation results show
   that the proposed algorithm can properly estimate the SI channel
   coefficients and the nonlinear parameters without any pilot symbol from
   the intended transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a solution framework to jointly optimize the base
   station association strategy and linear beamforming design for downlink
   transmission in a multicell system. Assuming each mobile station can
   only be assigned to one base station, our design objective is to
   minimize the sum transmit power across the base stations with a set of
   target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios at the mobile stations.
   Since the original optimization problem involves binary variables for
   base station associations, finding its optimal solution is a challenging
   task. To circumvent this difficulty, the original problem is relaxed
   into a new optimization problem by expanding its constraint set.
   Interestingly, it is shown that the relaxed problem can be solved
   optimally and its solution is also optimal to the original problem. We
   then propose two solution approaches to tackle the relaxed problem: one
   via its Lagrangian dual problem and the other via its dual uplink
   problem. Simulation results show that the resulting jointly optimal base
   station association and beamforming design can significantly outperform
   fixed base station association schemes.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative technique, based on a generalization of the conjugate
   gradient (CG) method in Banach spaces, is first proposed to enhance the
   spatial resolution of microwave radiometer measurements. This approach
   allows reducing the over-smoothing effects and the oscillations that are
   often present in Hilbert reconstructions and it is very effective in
   terms of processing time. Experiments undertaken on actual SSM/I data
   confirm the soundness of the proposed approach and show that CG is able
   to provide reconstructions similar to the conventional Landweber ones
   but with a significantly reduced processing time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an account of the experimentations with a
   ground-based facility emulating interception scenarios with
   non-cooperative space debris using a robotic manipulator. A
   sampling-based motion-planning algorithm is used to autonomously solve
   the dynamic interception problem without collisions and under velocity,
   acceleration and jerk constraints. Invariant Kalman filter methodologies
   are employed to estimate and predict the motion of a neutrally-buoyant
   airship emulating a free-floating target. Discussions are presented on
   the mitigation of practical issues of system integration and the
   operation of a sensitive, but cost-effective, test-bed for aerial
   neutral-buoyancy experiments. An account of ground-based experiments is
   presented as well as results showing good success rates on the tested
   scenarios and methods that constitute the first reported set of
   experiments on the interception phase of active space debris removal.}},

Abstract = {{An operational-transconductance-amplifier (OTA) design for low-voltage
   low-power applications is proposed. The proposed OTA incorporates
   bulk-driven MOS transistors in the pseudo differential pair of the input
   stage to concurrently enable low voltage operation and rail-to-rail
   input range. Using a common-mode feedforward (CMFF) circuit in the first
   stage to bias the following stages of the OTA obviates the need for
   extra biasing circuitry and improves the performance of the OTA. To
   further enhance the bandwidth and allow the use of smaller compensation
   capacitors, a compensation network based on a damping factor control
   circuit is exploited. To verify the theoretical findings, the OTA was
   fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology. Measurements show that the OTA
   provides a lowfrequency gain of 46 dB at V-DD = 0.5 V, and a gain of 43
   dB at V-DD = 0.35 V. The power dissipation is 182 mu W at V-DD = 0.5 V,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the estimation of the
   noise power spectral density (PSD) matrix, as needed for
   multi-microphone speech enhancement in a general non-stationary noisy
   environment. First, we propose a recursive scheme for noise PSD
   estimation in which the current, previous and close subsequent noisy
   speech frames are properly weighted. The forgetting factor for the
   recursive updating of the smoothed PSD is obtained based on an overall
   measure of the SNR across all microphone signals. Since this SNR measure
   depends on the noise statistics, we choose to iteratively update it
   using the latest available estimate of the noise PSD matrix. Finally, to
   obtain better estimation accuracy in the proposed method, we further
   apply a direct extension of the minimum tracking approach to the
   estimated noise PSD matrix. Performance of the proposed algorithm is
   evaluated in terms of objective measures and its superiority is shown
   with respect to two recent noise PSD estimation methods in the context
   of speech enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of modern wind turbine generators (WTGs) to rapidly and
   independently control active and reactive power outputs makes them
   attractive for the purpose of oscillation damping in power systems
   through P and Q modulation auxiliary loops. However, the problem of
   coordination and interaction of P and Q control loops emerges. The paper
   proposes a methodology for coordinated design of active and reactive
   power modulation loops of wind turbine generators. The method is based
   on a nonlinear constrained optimization approach with a properly chosen
   modal performance index as an objective function. The coordinated design
   is validated on the two-area benchmark system with a wind farm (WF) of
   significant capacity. The advantage of the control loops coordination
   approach is demonstrated through separate and simultaneous tuning of
   both controllers. Results show substantial improvement in damping low
   frequency inter-area mode, as well as proper coordination achieved

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative DFIG which has autonomous frequency
   control for stand-alone operation. When the wind farm is islanded, such
   DFIGs synchronize to form a reliable wind farm frequency source which
   does not collapse when member DFIGs fail. The frequency enables
   frequency droop control to be implemented for load sharing. The wind
   farm can provide fast reserve, ready to support a weakened utility grid
   during system restoration. The paper identifies the instant of islanding
   when excess wind power can accelerate the wind turbine-generators beyond
   their safe speed limit to be a critical problem. This problem can be
   solved when the designed turbine-pitch angles control applied.}},

Abstract = {{The tiny nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has long been a popular
   model organism for genetic, developmental, and biochemical studies in
   which worm microinjection plays a critical role. This paper presents an
   automated robotic system for high-speed injection of C. elegans with an
   efficiency more than 10 times faster than that of a proficient injection
   technician. To facilitate the injection process, a multilayer,
   hydraulically-controlled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device
   is developed to rapidly load, immobilize, flush, sort and collect
   individual worms. In addition, a newly proposed contact detection
   algorithm is adopted to find the optimal injection position along the z
   axis within the microscope view field. The direction and location of the
   needle tip are identified online based on an effective image processing
   algorithm. According to continuous injection of 40 worms, our system is
   able to perform worm injection at a speed of 6.6 worms per minute with a
   pre-sorting success rate of 77.5\% (post sorting: 100\%). The superior
   performance provided by the system will significantly facilitate
   large-scale transgenic studies and biomolecule screening on C. elegans.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a locomotion interface for gait
   simulation and interaction with a virtual environment. The proposed
   mechanical interface is based on two planar two-degree-of-freedom
   belt-driven mechanisms which fully decouple the vertical and horizontal
   motion of two supporting footplates. Force sensors are mounted under the
   footplates in order to move the end effectors according to the user's
   intentions. The user's feet are rigidly attached to the footplates but a
   system of hinges allows an additional unactuated two-degree-of-freedom
   motion. A lag controller allows the user to move the end-effectors
   freely and a virtual floor based on a virtual spring and damper
   restrains the end-effectors' movements so that the user experiences an
   intuitive contact with the ground. Finally, preliminary experiments are
   reported in order to demonstrate the capability of the locomotion
   interface for gait simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present a method of systematically selecting regions of
   a haptic workspace to be used for navigation of large virtual
   environments. Existing navigational techniques require the partitioning
   of the workspace into a region of manipulation and a separate region for
   navigation tasks. These techniques, however, have neglected to describe
   an effective way to implement these concepts in a device specific
   manner. We propose a two step technique to define these regions based on
   the mechanical properties of pre-existing devices. In the first step,
   the kinematic properties of the device are analyzed across the entirety
   of the physical workspace. A well-behaved region that favours isotropic
   mapping from the joint actuators to the generalized forces at the end
   effector is selected. Having ensured high force fidelity within this
   region, we then perform a second step analyzing the device dynamic
   properties. We further subdivide the navigational space into a region
   with suitable inertial properties in which manipulation tasks may be
   performed. This procedure generates a haptic display with a highly
   transparent haptic manipulation region within which a user can interact
   with a virtual environment. This manipulation region is bounded by a
   well-behaved navigational region that ensures adequate force
   transmission. To demonstrate this technique, navigation and manipulation
   spaces are generated and described for the planar and spatial cases.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) is an emerging control technique which
   can include the multiple control objectives, nonlinearities and system
   constraints easily. The main drawback of MPC for modular multilevel
   converter (MMC) application is its large computation, since the high
   level MMC has huge combination of switching states. Choosing the
   weighting factors of the cost function for MMC is also very complex. In
   this paper, a new predictive nearest level control (PNLC) is proposed,
   which uses the predicted values of control objectives to directly
   calculate the optimal number of on-state sub-modules (SMs) in each arm,
   then determines the specific SMs to be switched on according to sorting
   strategy for capacitor voltage balancing and average switching frequency
   reduction. In this improved predictive control, no calculation of cost
   function under different combination of switching states is needed. It
   is suitable for low and high level MMC. The results are verified through
   simulation, which shows the proposed control technique has better
   performance than conventional MPC.}},

Title = {{Multiuser Admission Control and Beamforming Optimization Algorithms for
   MISO Heterogeneous Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{759-773}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of joint multiuser admission control
   and beamforming optimization for multiple input single-output
   heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Considered is a HetNet where multiple
   newly deployed femtocell base stations (FBSs) have the coverage
   overlapped with that of an existing macrocell base-station (MBS). The
   design objective is to serve as many femto users (FUEs) as possible at
   their quality-of-service (QoS) requirements while maintaining the QoS
   requirements at the macro user (MUE). This paper then proposes three
   algorithmic schemes to perform multiuser admission control and
   beamforming optimization based on the levels of coordination between the
   MBS and FBSs. In Scheme I with full MBS-FBS coordination, a joint
   optimization framework is presented, and two solution approaches are
   proposed to determine the admission control and beamforming design for
   the FUEs in a centralized manner. In Scheme II with limited MBS-FBS
   coordination, a distributed algorithm that allows each FBS to
   unilaterally determine its admission control and beamforming strategy is
   proposed. This algorithm requires a certain coordination from the MBS by
   setting a limit on the amount of cross-tier intercell interference (ICI)
   that can be generated by each FBS. The convergence of the proposed
   distributed algorithm to a fixed point, where the QoS at the MUEs and
   the admitted FUEs is guaranteed, is then proved. Finally, in Scheme III
   without any MBS-FBS coordination, a joint multiuser admission control
   and zero-forcing beamforming design is then proposed. In particular,
   each FBS distributively admits its own FUEs while suppressing its
   cross-tier ICI to the MUEs, which effectively maintains the QoS at these
   MUEs. The simulation results show comparable performances between the
   distributed algorithms and the centralized ones in terms of the number
   of FUEs served and the network power usage.}},

Title = {{Vector Perturbation Precoding for Multi-User CoMP Downlink Transmission}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1491-1502}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the design of vector perturbation (VP) precoding
   for coordinated multi-point (CoMP) multi-user downlink transmission.
   Precoding is performed by individual base stations (BSs) in a
   distributed manner using only the downlink channel coefficients and user
   data local to a BS. A cascade precoder structure with an outer precoder
   managing the inter-cell interference (ICI) and an inner precoder
   performing mean-squared-error (MSE) minimization-based VP to mitigate
   the intra-cell interference is proposed. Three different outer precoding
   techniques are considered. In the first technique, the outer precoder is
   designed to fully eliminate the ICI by trading off the degrees of
   freedom (DoFs) available through multiple antennas. While the proposed
   technique outperforms existing conventional-VP based designs, a large
   portion of DoF is consumed by the ICI elimination. To overcome this
   issue, in the second technique, interference alignment-based outer
   precoding that minimizes the total leakage interference is proposed. To
   further improve the system performance, in the third approach, precoding
   by joint minimization of total leakage interference plus MSE is
   performed. Numerical results show that the proposed cascade precoding
   structure is an efficient way to use the DoF of CoMP multi-user downlink
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing concerns of energy sustainability, greenhouse gas
   emissions, and climate change, there is an increasing interest in
   understanding vehicle ownership and utilization decisions better so that
   effective policies can be implemented to reduce the negative impacts of
   private automobile usage. Although there is a rich body of literature on
   the long-term decisions of vehicle ownership and the composition of
   vehicles, the short-term choices of which vehicle to use from the
   household's vehicle holdings and what distance will be traveled to
   access opportunities, as well as the interrelationship between the two,
   are less understood. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the
   literature on short-term vehicle utilization decisions with the use of
   data collected in 2009 from the National Household Travel Survey. A
   latent class segmentation model was estimated with alternate
   interrelationship structures as the latent classes. Within each latent
   class, the choices were modeled consistently with the interrelationship
   structure through the introduction of the first choice as an explanatory
   variable in the model of the second choice. Additionally, scale was
   introduced to account for differences in the choices and
   interrelationships across regions. Most of the model estimation results
   were behaviorally plausible and consistent with expectations. A
   significant finding was that interrelationships in both latent classes
   were insignificant. It was also found that the latent model, even with
   the insignificant interrelationships, outperformed the alternate model
   formulations in terms of model fit. This finding shows that the latent
   segments may capture unobserved heterogeneity beyond the
   interrelationships.}},

Abstract = {{3D-IC technology brings both the opportunities to continue the
   historical trend of integration-level scaling and the challenges to
   deliver power reliably and efficiently. Voltage stacking (V-S), a
   charge-recycled power delivery scheme that connects the different
   layers' supply/ground nets into a series stack, provides a scalable
   solution to the 3D-IC power delivery wall. While prior work has
   extensively discussed the implementations of V-S at circuit-level, a
   cross-layer study that examines its system-level implications is
   missing. In this paper, we start with a circuit implementation of a
   charge-recycled voltage regulator and build an architecture level model
   to study the costs and benefits of utilizing V-S in 3D-IC. Our study
   shows that by significantly improving the EM-lifetime of C4 and TSV
   array (e.g., up to 5x) while only marginally increasing the average-case
   voltage noise (e.g., 0.75\% Vdd IR drop), V-S provides a scalable
   solution for many-layer 3D-IC's power delivery challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a dynamic game with a population of N minor agents, where N is
   very large, and a major agent where the agents are coupled in their
   nonlinear dynamics and cost functions such that even asymptotically as
   the population size goes to infinity the major agent has a non-vanishing
   effect on the minor agents. Such games are referred to as mean field
   games with major-minor agents (MM-MFG) and for MM-MFG, it has been
   demonstrated the mean field term is stochastic and the best response
   control actions of the minor agents depend on the state of the major
   agent as well as this stochastic mean field. In practical applications
   one is led to consider the situation where the minor agents partially
   observe (PO) the state of the major agent. In this work, we consider a
   restricted case of this scenario and demonstrate that in the case the
   minor agents are coupled to the major agent only through their cost
   functions, one can obtain the epsilon-Nash equilibrium property for the
   PO-MM-MFG best response control actions as the population size N goes to
   infinity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we are interested in systems with multiple agents that
   wish to collaborate in order to accomplish a common task while a) agents
   have different information (decentralized information) and b) agents do
   not know the model of the system completely i.e., they may know the
   model partially or may not know it at all. The agents must learn the
   optimal strategies by interacting with their environment i.e., by
   decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL). The presence of multiple
   agents with different information makes decentralized reinforcement
   learning conceptually more difficult than centralized reinforcement
   learning. In this paper, we develop a decentralized reinforcement
   learning algorithm that learns epsilon-team-optimal solution for partial
   history sharing information structure, which encompasses a large class
   of decentralized control systems including delayed sharing, control
   sharing, mean field sharing, etc. Our approach consists of two main
   steps. In the first step, we convert the decentralized control system to
   an equivalent centralized POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision
   Process) using an existing approach called common information approach.
   However, the resultant POMDP requires the complete knowledge of system
   model. To circumvent this requirement, in the second step, we introduce
   a new concept called ``Incrementally Expanding Representation{''} using
   which we construct a finite-state RL algorithm whose approximation error
   converges to zero exponentially fast. We illustrate the proposed
   approach and verify it numerically by obtaining a decentralized
   Q-learning algorithm for two-user Multi Access Broadcast Channel (MABC)
   which is a benchmark example for decentralized control systems.}},

   energies of 54.5 and 59 eV. The first of these, previously assigned to
   ternary CuInSe2, increased with etching depth from the ingot surface but
   was little affected by the presence of Na. However, the second peak only
   appeared when Na or Na2Se had been added to the melt. The 59 eV peak
   also increased somewhat with contaminant oxygen content and was assigned

Abstract = {{This study examined the relationship between four individual-level
   travel choice processes of daily activity: spatial flexibility of the
   activity, temporal flexibility of the activity, vehicle choice for the
   activity, and primary driver (for auto users). Activity flexibility
   (spatial and temporal) has been suggested as a precursor to the travel
   pattern observed for an activity. This study examined the impact of
   activity flexibility through unique data drawn from Quebec City, Quebec,
   Canada from 2003 to 2006. In traditional literature on travel behavior,
   vehicle fleet decisions have been examined as a long-term choice with
   annual usage metrics. However, the long-term vehicle usage observed (as
   studied in the literature) is an aggregation of the household's yearly
   vehicle type and usage behavior. Only recently have researchers begun to
   consider decisions about vehicle usage (type and mileage) as a
   short-term decision in travel behavior models. By examining short-term
   vehicle usage, this study explored, at a disaggregate level, the
   interaction of activity behavior (defined as flexibility) and vehicle
   type choice. A panel mixed multinomial logit model was applied to
   analyze the four choices within the decision process to account for the
   intrinsic unobserved taste preferences across individuals. The analysis
   results revealed that several individual and household sociodemographic
   characteristics, residential location, and activity attributes, as well
   as contextual variables, influenced the packaged choice of temporal
   flexibility, spatial flexibility, vehicle type choice, and primary
   driver selection. The presence of common unobserved correlation across
   various alternatives was also incorporated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of connectivity assessment for an underwater
   random sensor network is investigated. The weighted vertex connectivity
   is introduced as a metric to evaluate the connectivity of the weighted
   expected graph of a random sensor network where the elements of the
   weight matrix represent the operational probability of their
   corresponding communication links. The proposed weighted vertex
   connectivity measure extends the notion of vertex connectivity to random
   graphs by taking into account the joint effects of the path reliability
   and the network robustness to node failure. The approximate weighted
   vertex connectivity measure is defined subsequently as a lower bound on
   the introduced connectivity metric which can be computed by applying a
   polynomialtime shortest path algorithm. The performance of the proposed
   algorithms is validated by simulation.}},

   schemes tend to require long simulation times on conventional computer

   Sphere Decoder (FCSD) for large scale MIMO uplink systems using the
   framework of GPGPU-Computed Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Using
   GPGPU, significant speedups were found for large MIMO systems and
   constellation sizes, over conventional CPU implementation, while
   providing the same Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. Hence the proposed
   approach shows great potential of GPGPU to accelerate computer

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a Bayesian short-time spectral amplitude

   the joint estimation of the short-term predictor (STP) parameters of the
   speech and noise signals, from the noisy speech observations. This
   approach is based on using trained codebooks of speech and noise linear
   predictive (LP) coefficients to model the a priori information needed by
   the MMSE estimation. Afterwards, the power spectra derived from the
   estimated STP are passed to the W beta-SA STSA estimator, where they are
   used to calculate the enhancement gains applied to the short-term
   Fourier transform (STFT) coefficients of the noisy speech. When compared
   to an existing benchmark approach from the literature, the proposed
   approach combining codebook-based STP estimation with the W beta-SA
   method gives rise to a notable improvement in the quality of the

Abstract = {{The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem has been an active area of research
   since the early 1930s. The majority of the literature restricts
   attention to i.i.d. or Markov reward processes. In this paper, the
   finite-parameter MAB problem with time-dependent reward processes is
   investigated. An upper confidence bound (UCB) based index policy, where
   the index is computed based on the maximum-likelihood estimate of the
   unknown parameter, is proposed. This policy locks on to the optimal arm
   in finite expected time but has a super-linear regret. As an example,
   the proposed index policy is used for minimizing prediction error when
   each arm is a auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) process.}},

Abstract = {{The constraint sufficient statistics distributed particle filter is a
   novel and effective solution for bearings-only single target tracking.
   The algorithm achieves a significant reduction in communication overhead
   by factorizing the likelihood function without suffering a major
   decrease in accuracy. However, the algorithm has some limitations which
   we discuss and explore in this paper. In particular, the algorithm has a
   bias induced via the approximate likelihood calculation, depending on
   the geometry of the sensors relative to the target.}},

Title = {{A new tactile array sensor for viscoelastic tissues with time-dependent
   behavior}},
Journal = {{SENSOR REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{374-381}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new tactile array
   sensor into the medical field to enhance current robotic minimally
   invasive surgery (RMIS) procedures that are still limited in scope and
   versatility. In this paper, a novel idea is proposed in which a tactile
   sensor array can measure rate of displacement in addition to force and
   displacement of any viscoelastic material during the course of a single
   touch. To verify this new array sensor, several experiments were
   conducted on a diversity of tissues from which it was concluded that
   this newly developed sensory offers definite and significant
   enhancements.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed array sensor is capable of
   extracting force, displacement and displacement rate in the course of a
   single touch on tissues. Several experiments have been conducted on
   different tissues and the array sensor to verify the concept and to
   verify the output of the sensor.
   Findings - It is shown that this new generation of sensors are required
   to distinguish the difference in hardness degrees of materials with
   viscoelastic behavior.
   Originality/value - In this paper, a new generation of tactile sensors
   is proposed that is capable of measuring indentation time in addition to
   force and displacement. This idea is completely unique and has not been
   submitted to any conference or journal.}},

Title = {{Copula-Based Joint Model of Injury Severity and Vehicle Damage in
   Two-Vehicle Crashes}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{158-166}},
Abstract = {{In the transportation safety field, in an effort to improve safety,
   statistical models are developed to identify factors that contribute to
   crashes as well as those that affect injury severity. This study
   contributes to the literature on severity analysis. Injury severity and
   vehicle damage are two important indicators of severity in crashes and
   are typically modeled independently. However, there are common observed
   and unobserved factors affecting the two crash indicators that lead to
   potential interrelationships. Failure to account for the
   interrelationships between the indicators may lead to biased coefficient
   estimates in crash severity prediction models. The focus of this study
   was to explore interrelationships between injury severity and vehicle
   damage and to also identify the nature. of these correlations across
   different types of crashes. A copula-based methodology that could
   simultaneously model injury severity and vehicle damage while also
   accounting for the interrelationships between the two indicators was
   employed. Furthermore, parameterization of the copula structure was used
   to represent the interrelationships between the crash indicators as a
   function of crash characteristics. In this study, six specifications of
   the copula model-Gaussian, Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern, Frank, Clayton,
   Joe, and Gumbel-were developed. On the basis of goodness-of-fit
   statistics, the Gaussian copula model was found to outperform the other
   copula-based model specifications. Results indicated that
   interrelationships between injury severity and vehicle damage varied
   with different crash characteristics including manner of collision and
   collision type.}},

Title = {{PARAMETERIZATION GUIDELINES AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR HYDROLOGIC MODELS}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1681-1703}},
Abstract = {{Imparting knowledge of the physical processes of a system to a model and
   determining a set of parameter values for a hydrologic or water quality
   model application (i.e., parameterization) are important and difficult
   tasks. An exponential increase in the literature has been devoted to the
   use and development of these models over the years. Few articles,
   however, have been devoted to developing general parameterization
   guidelines to assist in hydrologic model application, which is the main
   objective of this article along with discussing a few important
   parameters and extracting several case studies from the literature. The
   following guidelines were extracted from reviewing a special collection
   of 22 articles along with other relevant literature: (1) use
   site-specific measured or estimated parameter values where possible, (2)
   focus on the most uncertain and sensitive parameters, (3) minimize the
   number of optimized parameters, (4) constrain parameter values to within
   justified ranges, (5) use multiple criteria to help optimize parameter
   values, (6) use ``soft{''} data to optimize parameters, and (7) use a
   warm-up period to reduce model dependence on initial condition state
   variables. A few soil and hydrology related parameters common to many
   models are briefly described along with a discussion of measurement and
   estimation methods and parameter sensitivity (curve number, Manning's
   ``n{''}, soil bulk density and porosity, soil hydraulic conductivity,
   soil field capacity and wilting point, and leaf area index). Weather and
   management inputs are also discussed, as they are critical hydrologic
   system information that must be imparted to the model. Several case
   studies from previously reported research illustrate implementation of
   the parameterization guidelines. This research will help improve model
   parameterization, resulting in more consistency, better representation
   of the field or watershed, and a reduced range of parameter value sets
   resulting in acceptable model simulations.}},

Title = {{The Monteregie Connection: linking landscapes, biodiversity, and
   ecosystem services to improve decision making}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{To maximize specific ecosystem services (ES) such as food production,
   people alter landscape structure, i.e., the types of ecosystems present,
   their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement across
   landscapes. This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects
   on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use
   activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect
   biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these
   effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used
   the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east
   of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic
   landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the
   importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES
   provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within
   single land-use types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our
   historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as
   relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time.
   We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure
   models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region:
   Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green
   Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on
   ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social
   and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES
   provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By
   integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have
   achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing
   understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and
   ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making
   to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for
   a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular and coronary artery disease risk are correlated with
   cholesterol levels and are significant health concerns. Current
   cholesterol-lowering approaches includes lifestyle and diet
   modifications, as well as statins which presents numerous shortcomings.
   The probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus fermentum NCIMB 5221 and NCIMB
   2797, have demonstrated cholesterol-lowering potential in animal
   studies. However, there is a lack in understanding the mechanism(s)
   behind these observed effects. The goal of this work is to investigate,
   in vitro, the cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of these two strains. To
   determine the cholesterol-lowering mechanisms, probiotic cholesterol
   assimilation, colon epithelial adhesion and inhibition of cholesterol
   uptake by colon epithelial (Caco-2) cells were investigated. L.
   fermentum NCIMB 2797 (P=0.012) and NCIMB 5221 (P=0.003) assimilated
   cholesterol and their cell surface hydrophobicity was 70.30 +/- 8.85\%
   and 55.60 +/- 2.59\%, respectively. Both L. fermentum strains showed no
   significant impact (P>0.05) on Caco-2 cell viability. Of most interest,
   Caco-2 pre-exposure to L. fermentum NCIMB 5221 significantly decreased
   (P=0.015) cholesterol uptake, with 85.98 +/- 2.07\% uptake compared to
   the untreated cells. Similarly, L. fermentum NCIMB 2797 probiotic cells
   significantly decreased (P=0.019) cholesterol uptake by Caco-2 cells,
   with 86.45 +/- 1.71\% uptake observed compared to the control cells. The
   results demonstrate that L. fermentum NCIMB 5221 and L. fermentum NCIMB
   2797 have the potential via various modes of action to lower
   cholesterol. Additional studies are required to understand the
   mechanism(s) of action behind probiotic cholesterol assimilation and
   behind the cholesterol uptake inhibition by colon epithelial cells.}},

Title = {{Effect of MW-assisted roasting on nutritional and chemical properties of
   hazelnuts}},
Journal = {{FOOD \& NUTRITION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Abstract = {{In order to enhance the flavor, texture, color, and appearance of
   hazelnuts, they are roasted during postharvest processing. In this
   study, raw hazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.) were roasted using microwave
   (MW) and MW-assisted hot air methods under various roasting conditions.
   The hazelnuts roasted were then examined to determine the percent DPPH
   radical scavenging activity, antioxidant capacity, total phenolic
   content, resistant starch, non-resistant starch, total starch, and
   protein concentration. The roasting experiments were done using a
   completely randomized factorial arrangement of two roasting types by
   three roasting times (9, 15, and 21 min) by three roasting temperatures
   (70, 90, and 110 degrees C) using three replications within each
   experiment. These roasting methods were found to yield significant
   differences in antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content, resistant
   starch, non-resistant starch, and protein concentration between MW and
   MW-assisted hot air roasting processes, while no difference was found in
   percent DPPH radical scavenging activity and total starch. The results
   obtained may be of great importance to the food research community and
   industrial hazelnut roasting technologies.}},

Pages = {{181-189}},
Abstract = {{Simulations of turbulent interfaces produced by positive and negative
   buoyancy are conducted by moving blocks of vorticity and buoyancy in the
   direction of the flow. The second moment of the blocks increases at a
   rate proportional to the diffusivity. The block simulation has been
   shown to be relatively free of numerical oscillations. Unlike most
   classical methods, the error associated with Lagrangian block simulation
   (LBS) is not cumulative. Artificial diffusion error is negligible. This
   relatively non-diffusive LBS method is employed to simulate buoyancy at
   turbulence interfaces that are under the stabilizing and destabilizing
   influences by the force of buoyancy. In one series of simulation, the
   turbulence is initiated by shear and subjected to the stabilizing
   influence of the buoyancy force. In the other series, turbulence is
   produced by the destabilizing influence of the buoyancy force. The two
   series of simulations are evaluated to compare performance between (i)
   the large eddy simulation (LES) method and (ii) the K-epsilon modeling
   of turbulent flow.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesive bonding of composite structural elements are intensively
   employed in the aerospace industry to assemble sub-structures. However,
   this structural feature is prone to degradation of the adhesive over
   time or disbonding when submitted to fatigue, or extreme loads. These
   types of damage can significantly jeopardize the performance and safety
   of a structure with little advanced warning. The objective of this
   research is to evaluate the integrity of a composite skin-stringer joint
   using Lamb wave propagation. The structure of interest is made of two
   carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates bonded together with an
   adhesive film as a skin-stringer assembly panel. The two plates are 8
   plies of woven out-of-autoclave material with a quasi-isotropic lay-up.
   A rectangular piezoceramic is used to generate plane guided waves and
   non-contact measurement is performed using a 3-D Laser Doppler
   Vibrometer (LDV) to extract the required information for evaluation of
   the bonded joint. Plane wave generation by the thin slender rectangular
   transducer allows for directional generation of the Lamb waves and
   avoids geometrical spread, minimizing attenuation levels. The robustness
   of the set-up is validated for a simple composite plate and dispersion
   curves are extracted using spatial Fourier Transform. An
   across-the-bond-line strategy is then used to extract the reflection and
   transmission of energy through the bonded joint. The results include
   dispersion curves as well as reflection and transmission coefficients
   using a transfer function in the frequency domain. It was found that the
   adhesive bonded joint affects wave behaviour at low frequencies (below
   100 kHz). Moreover, the transmission level of symmetric mode through the
   joint is larger than for the anti-symmetric level below 100 kHz, while
   it is almost zero at higher frequencies (above 400 kHz). The results
   verify that guided wave propagation is very effective method for
   structural health monitoring of composite skin-stringer bonded joints.}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave propagation and interaction with defects in aerospace
   structures is addressed in the literature only for specific and limited
   number of simple components and types of defects. The knowledge-gap
   based project between industrial and academic researchers presented in
   this paper aims at providing the industry with an extended knowledge
   base for a variety of generic structures that define a set of standards
   for guided wave propagation and interaction with damage or geometrical
   features. The knowledge base will contain metrics on guided waves
   propagation (in terms of velocity dispersion curves and attenuation) and
   their interaction with geometrical or damage features (spatial patterns,
   reflection and transmission coefficients). This paper presents the first
   step in this project, where structural features and design parameters
   (geometry, material, assembly configuration, surface finish, sealant,.)
   have been identified, extracted and filtered for their relevance from an
   extensive list of aerospace structures of interest. This list was
   created with the industrial partners, combining military and civil
   aircraft structures. Moreover, a list of in-service damage parameters
   (extent, depth, location, orientation, type.) has been identified, based
   on maintenance and in-service manuals, damage tolerance analysis
   reports, and following the analysis of part drawings. These structures
   of interest have then been rated by academic partners to extract the
   most relevant structures for experimental and numerical parametric
   studies. Based on this reduced list of structures, a set of simplified
   test articles has been proposed. This paper presents the detailed
   systematic process for selecting and designing the simplified test
   articles, together with the geometrical parameters to be varied in the
   study of guided wave propagation and interaction with both geometrical
   features and in-service damage.}},

Abstract = {{In order to prevent the lack of appropriate respiratory ventilation
   which causes brain damage and critical problems, it is required to
   continuously monitor the breathing signal of a patient. There are
   different conventional methods for capturing respiration signal, such as
   polysomnography and spirometer. In spite of their accuracy, these
   methods are expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor
   network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based respiration
   monitoring platform which allows the patient to continue treatment and
   diagnosis from different places such as home. These remote services are
   designed for patients who suffer from breathing problems or sleep
   disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor,
   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database. Based on the high
   correlation between spirometer and accelerometer signals, the Detrended
   Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has been applied on respiration signals. The
   obtained results show that DFA can be used as an efficient feature while
   classifying the healthy people from patients suffering from breath
   abnormalities.}},

   0.4 applied at 1 s(-1). The deformations were imposed isothermally at
   910 degrees C and 930 degrees C for the C-Mn and the Nb microalloyed
   steel, respectively. The flow curve levels decreased from pass to pass
   as a result of softening by both dynamic transformation (DT) and dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX). The application of double differentiation to
   the stress-strain curves led to average critical strains for the
   initiation of DT and DRX of about 0.06 and 0.11, respectively. Optical
   microscopy revealed that the volume fraction of DT ferrite increased
   continuously right up to the last pass. The fraction of DT ferrite
   formed and retained was significantly higher when short interpass times
   were used. Comparison of the behaviors of the C-Mn and Nb steels
   indicates that Nb addition retards both the forward as well as the

Abstract = {{The pore structure of TEMPO-mediated oxidized CNF hydrogels, chemically
   cross-linked with water-soluble diamines, is studied. A solute exclusion
   method and pulsed-field-gradient NMR are used to estimate the mesh size
   distribution in the gel network in its hydrated state. Dextran fractions
   with the nominal molecular weights in the range of 10-2000 kDa are used
   as probes. The results show a nonuniform network structure, consisting
   of a group of large openings that contain similar to 50\% of water, and
   regions with a more compact structure and smaller mesh units that
   restrict the diffusivity of the dextran molecules. A biexponential model
   is proposed for the NMR echo amplitude decay due to the probe diffusion
   into the gel network. A typical single exponential model does not fit
   the experimental data when the probe molecular size is comparable to the
   network mesh size. The results obtained with NMR, using the proposed
   biexponential model, are in very good agreement with those determined
   with solute exclusion. Precise mesh size estimation with solute
   exclusion using pore models is subject to restrictions, and vary with
   the assumed pore geometry. The average mesh size obtained using a
   spherical pore model, similar to 35 nm, in the compact regions of the
   hydrogel, is in good agreement with the theoretical value in a network
   of rodlike particles. Neglecting the wall effects leads to
   underestimation of the mesh size with both techniques.}},

Abstract = {{X-rays from synchrotron radiation enable incisive spectroscopic
   techniques which speed up the discovery of new materials for
   photovoltaics and photoelectrochemistry. A particularly useful method is
   X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), which probes empty electronic
   states. XAS is element-and bond-specific, with the additional capability
   of determining the bond orientation. Close feedback from density
   functional calculations makes it possible to discover and exploit
   systematic trends in the electronic properties. Case studies are
   presented, such as solar cells that combine an absorber with an electron
   donor and an acceptor in one molecular complex and nanowire arrays
   serving as photoanodes for water splitting. In addition to the energy
   levels the lifetimes of the charge carriers play an essential role in
   device performance. A new generation of laser-like X-ray sources will
   make it possible to follow the fate of excited charge carriers traveling
   across a molecular complex or through a device structure in real time.}},

Abstract = {{Benefiting from information-theoretic studies in cooperative relaying
   communications, relaying strategies have recently received considerable
   attention in the context of physical-layer security over wireless
   networks. In this paper, we investigate the secrecy rate of a relay
   wire-tap Rayleigh fading channel in which a source wishes to communicate
   securely to a destination in the presence of an eavesdropper and under
   the aid of an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. Due to the presence of
   fading, it is a very challenging task to obtain the secrecy rate in
   closed-form. To overcome this issue, we first propose a novel method to
   calculate the expectation of an exponentially distributed random
   variable using the exponential integral function. By exploiting this
   calculation, we then establish the average secrecy rate of the
   considered AF relay channel in closed-form. Numerical results show that
   the proposed formula provides an accurate and effective way to obtain
   the secrecy rate without the need of time-consuming Monte Carlo
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Downscaling of climate projections is the most adopted method to assess
   the impacts of climate change at regional and local scale. In the last
   decade, downscaling techniques which provide reasonable improvement to
   resolution of General Circulation Models' (GCMs) output are developed in
   notable manner. Most of these techniques are limited to spatial
   downscaling of GCMs' output and still there is a high demand to develop
   temporal downscaling approaches. As the main objective of this study,
   combined approach of spatial and temporal downscaling is developed to
   improve the resolution of rainfall predicted by GCMs. Canberra airport
   region is subjected to this study and the applicability of proposed
   downscaling approach is evaluated for Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
   Adelaide, Perth and Darwin regions. Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM)
   is used to spatial downscaling and numerical model based on scaling
   invariant concept is used to temporal downscaling of rainfalls. National
   Centre of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data is used in SDSM model
   calibration and validation. Regression based bias correction function is
   used to improve the accuracy of downscaled annual maximum rainfalls
   using HadCM3-A2. By analysing the non-central moments of observed
   rainfalls, single time regime (from 30 min to 24 h) is identified which
   exist scaling behaviour and it is used to estimate the sub daily extreme
   rainfall depths from daily downscaled rainfalls. Finally, as the major
   output of this study, Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) relations are
   developed for the future periods of 2020s, 2050s and 2080s in the
   context of climate change.}},

Pages = {{924-932}},
Abstract = {{Particularly in dry regions, the scarcity of high-quality fresh water
   has heightened the importance of urban runoff water re-use, leading as
   well to the improvement of water use efficiency through the surface drip
   irrigation method. Given the limited research on wetting front migration
   under a surface drip irrigation emitter, soil water movement under a
   double-point-source irrigation emitter was investigated. An experimental
   soil bin was designed and filled with silt loam soil, and time domain
   reflectometry and tensiometers were used to measure soil moisture
   contents and soil water potential, respectively. The results show that
   under the conditions of 6 hours of irrigation with two drippers each
   delivering 1.05 L hr(-1) and spaced at 45 cm, the soil moisture content
   of the 0-30 cm layer increased rapidly and reached 0.29 cm(3) cm(-3),
   and was greater than that in the 30-60 cm layer as irrigation proceeded.
   After 6 hours the irrigation was stopped, such that in the
   redistribution phase, soil moisture of the top layer gradually
   decreased, while that of the sublayer gradually increased. The results
   indicate that 6 hours of irrigation under given emitter flow conditions
   produced adequate soil moisture down to 30 cm for most shallow-rooted
   crops.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{16647-16657}},
Abstract = {{Crystalline nanoparticles of cellulose exhibit attractive properties as
   nanoscale carriers for bioactive molecules in nanobiotechnology and
   nanomedicine. For applications in imaging and drug delivery, surface
   charge is one of the most important factors affecting the performance of
   nanocarriers. However, current methods of preparation offer little
   flexibility for controlling the surface charge of cellulose
   nanocrystals, leading to compromised colloidal stability under
   physiological conditions. We report a synthesis method that results in
   nanocrystals with remarkably high carboxyl content (6.6 mmol g(-1)) and
   offers continuous control over surface charge without any adjustment to
   the reaction conditions. Six fractions of nanocrystals with various
   surface carboxyl contents were synthesized from a single sample of
   softwood pulp with carboxyl contents varying from 6.6 to 1.7 mmol g(-1)
   and were fully characterized. The proposed method resulted in highly
   stable colloidal nanocrystals that did not aggregate when exposed to
   high salt concentrations or serum-containing media. Interactions of
   these fractions with four different tissue cell lines were investigated
   over a wide range of concentrations (50-300 mu g mL(-1)). Darkfield
   hyperspectral imaging and confocal microscopy confirmed the uptake of
   nanocrystals by selected cell lines without any evidence of membrane
   damage or change in cell density; however a charge-dependent decrease in
   mitochondrial activity was observed for charge contents higher than 3.9
   mmol g(-1). A high surface carboxyl content allowed for facile
   conjugation of fluorophores to the nanocrystals without compromising
   colloidal stability. The cellular uptake of fluoresceinamine-conjugated
   nanocrystals exhibited a time-dose dependent relationship and increased
   significantly with doubling of the surface charge.}},

Abstract = {{In this work the potential of employing electrophoretic deposition (EPD)
   for fabricating Li-ion battery electrodes without using binders and in
   particular eliminating volatile and toxic organic solvents such as
   n-methyl 2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is demonstrated. The paper in particular
   describes the successful application of the EPD method to fabrication of
   thick (>20 mu m) nano-TiO2/carbon Li-ion intercalation anodes. The EPD
   system involves deposition of commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles and
   carbon black on aluminum foil from an isopropanol bath without making
   use of charging agents or other additives. Hetero-coagulation of TiO2
   and C particles in the isopropanol medium enabled their 80 V DC cathodic
   deposition into a well-adhered film with effective intermixing of active
   and conductive components. Electrochemical testing of the newly
   binder-free EPD-built electrodes revealed comparable film conductivity,
   polarization and charge storage capacity properties with the standard
   binder-based PVDF/NMP electrodes. Most importantly, the charge storage,
   cycling, and rate properties of the EPD-built electrodes were greatly
   enhanced by post-EPD sintering of the film at 450 degrees C. The
   combined EPD-sintering route resulted in a superior conductive
   percolating network by promoting nanoscale film composition uniformity,
   inter-particle necking, and favorable porous structure for enhanced
   interfacing with the liquid electrolyte. The sintered EPD-built
   electrode exhibited almost 50\% higher capacity retention than that of
   the standard binder-based electrode upon cycling. EPD with its inherent
   self-assembling functionality and its overall operational simplicity
   provides an advantageous and green Li-ion electrode fabrication
   alternative. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained adhesion between a film and its substrate is critical for
   electronic device and coating applications. Interfacial development
   between electrophoretically deposited graphene oxide films on Al 1100
   and Al 5052 alloys were investigated using FT-IR and XPS depth profiling
   techniques. The results suggest metal ion permeation from the substrates
   into deposited graphene oxide films. The interface between the films and
   the substrates were primarily composed of Al-O-C bonds from
   oxygen-containing defects on graphene oxide plane rather than the
   expected formation of Al-C bonds. Films were heat treated at 150 degrees
   C and underwent a partial removal of oxygen-bearing groups. Peak shifts
   in Al 2p XPS spectra and change in Al ion distribution through out the
   film suggested change in chemical bond between Al and O upon heat and
   indicated that Al-O bond is the major influence in forming adhesive bond
   between the graphene oxide films and the Al alloy substrates. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Infections caused by foodborne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes
   pose a threat to public health while timely detection is challenging due
   to pathogen low numbers. The development of robust and efficient sample
   preparation techniques is crucial to improve detection sensitivity and
   workflow. Immunomagnetic separation using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)
   is attractive, as it can efficiently capture target cells. For food
   safety applications, a platform is needed to rapidly process large
   sample volumes, allowing capture and release of target bacteria
   conjugated to immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs). Herein, we
   demonstrate a method for magnetic capture and release of bacteria-IMNPs
   complex based on a 3D magnetic trap integrated on a polymeric
   microfluidic device. The 3D magnetic capture region consist of a dense
   array of high-aspect ratio (3 : 1) cylindrical pillars embossed in
   thermoplastic polymer and coated with soft ferromagnetic nickel by an
   electroless deposition technique. This allows the generation of strong
   and switchable magnetic capture regions due to the very low remanence of
   the nickel shell. We propose and validate an optimized configuration of
   capture regions for efficient localized capture and rapid release of
   MNPs and IMNPs conjugated to L. monocytogenes. A maximum recovery rate
   for MNPs corresponded to 91\% while a maximum capture efficiency of 30\%
   was obtained for live bacteria, with a minimum detectable sample
   concentration of similar to 10 cfu ml(-1) in 1 ml volume using
   plate-culture method. We believe that the flexible design and low-cost
   fabrication process of the proposed system will allow rapid sample
   preparation for applications beyond food and water safety, including
   point-of-care diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{The design of open-cathode polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC) stacks
   with forced-convection requires a careful consideration on the
   geometrical and operating conditions as well as the characteristic of
   PEFC stacks and fan used. The operating point should be located at the
   intersection point between the fan and the stack characteristic curve.
   This paper evaluates the effect of key parameters and operating
   conditions on the system characteristic and stack performance of forced
   convection PEFC by utilizing computational fluid dynamic approach and
   Taguchi statistical method. A validated three dimensional open-cathode
   PEFC stack model with fan and immediate ambient were employed together
   with an L27 orthogonal array (OA) of Taguchi matrix of six factors and
   three level designs to determine the optimum combination of parameters
   as well as their interactions. The result indicates that fuel cell
   length plays important role on determining the fuel cell performance in
   term of current density and net power. Optimum combination of design and
   operating parameters were obtained with the objective function of
   maximizing net power generated by stack by taking into account the
   parasitic loads. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Deep underground mining is highly energy intensive due to the need to
   overcome high pressure rise required by ventilation fans, high cooling
   load in summer due to rise in rock temperature and the auto-compression
   effect, and heating requirement in winter. Rising energy costs have led
   the mining industry to look for alternatives in energy-efficient systems
   to reduce the operating costs as well as to reduce the carbon footprint.
   This paper addresses the challenge by utilizing naturally available
   renewable energy source from seasonal cycle for heating and cooling of
   underground mines: heat in the summer is stored in the rock-pit to be
   used for heating in winter, and the ``cold{''} energy in winter is
   captured and is stored in the rock-pit for cooling during summer. A
   three-dimensional unsteady local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model is
   developed to evaluate thermal storage and heat transfer between
   ventilation air and rock-pit (large broken rock mass). The results
   suggest that the seasonal thermal energy storage (Se-TES) of rock-pit is
   able to assist thermal management in underground mine and to reduce
   energy consumption for winter heating and summer cooling. The
   ventilation air temperature is about 15 to 20 degrees C higher/lower as
   compared to ambient temperature in winter/summer, respectively. Clearly,
   this shows potential application of large scale Se-TES in mining
   industry. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In heat exchanger application, working fluid inside the tubes is
   subjected to considerable temperature changes. In order to improve heat
   transfer performance, various strategies are proposed and evaluated; one
   of them is the application of coiled tubes. Coiled tubes have been used
   widely in heat exchanger application mainly due to the presence of
   secondary flow which enhances heat transfer considerably. This study
   addresses heat transfer performance of three configurations of coiled
   tubes with square cross-section, i.e. in-plane, helical and conical
   coiled tubes, subjected to large temperature difference. Their heat
   transfer performance is numerically evaluated and compared with that of
   a straight tube with identical cross-section and length. A concept of
   Figure of Merit (FoM) is introduced and utilized to fairly asses the
   heat transfer performance of the coiled tube configurations. The results
   indicate that FoM increase as the wall temperature increase. In
   addition, combination of temperature-induced buoyancy flow and
   curvature-induced secondary flow considerably affect the flow behavior
   and heat transfer performance inside the tubes. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{How traffic-related air pollution generation and exposure is distributed
   among different population groups is an important environmental justice
   concern. From a social equity perspective, many questions arise at the
   metropolitan scale. Do socially disadvantaged communities have higher
   exposure levels to traffic-related air pollution? Do discrepancies exist
   wherein neighborhoods are not exposed to levels of pollution similar to
   those they themselves generate? And, is there a relationship between
   this discrepancy and social disadvantage? These questions are examined
   for the Montreal Metropolitan Region through the development of an
   integrated transport and emissions model. Two measures of
   traffic-related air pollution are estimated at the traffic analysis zone
   level: (1) generation (average emissions per household), and (2)
   exposure (average residential zone concentration). A social disadvantage
   index is also calculated that incorporates elements of social and
   material deprivation. Three levels of inequity exist regarding
   emissions, exposure, and socioeconomics. Social disadvantage was found
   to have a positive relationship with exposure, meaning that the most
   socially disadvantaged communities tend to experience the highest levels
   of traffic-related air pollution. Spatial discrepancies in emission
   generation versus emission exposure are also present for most of the
   metropolitan region. Furthermore, the communities that face a double
   burden of greater disadvantage and higher exposure also tend to create
   the lowest quantities of pollution.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term in vitro culture and differentiation of human pancreatic
   islets is still hindered by the inability to emulate a suitable
   microenvironment mimicking physiological extracellular matrix (ECM)
   support and nutrient/oxygen perfusion. This is further amplified by the
   current lack of a non-invasive and rapid monitoring system to readily
   evaluate cellular processes. In this study, we realized a viable method
   for non-invasively monitoring isolated human pancreatic islets in vitro.
   Islets are induced to dedifferentiate into proliferative duct-like
   structures (DLS) in preparation for potential and subsequent
   re-differentiation into functional islet-like structures (ILS) in a
   process reminiscent of islet regeneration strategies. This long-term in
   vitro process is conducted within a three-dimensional microenvironment
   involving islets embedded in an optimized ECM gel supported by
   microfabricated three-dimensional scaffolds. The islet-scaffold is then
   housed and continuously perfused within chambers of a bioreactor
   platform. The process in its entirety is monitored through dielectric
   spectroscopy measurements, yielding an accurate representation of
   cellular morphology, functionality, and volume fraction. This
   non-invasive and real-time monitoring tool can be further manipulated to
   elucidate important information about the optimized cellular
   microenvironment required for maintaining long-term culture and achieve
   efficient differentiation for islet regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of a
   numerical method for the solution to shallow-water equations on a
   staggered grid, in simulations for shear instabilities at two convective
   Froude numbers.
   Design/methodology/approach - The simulations start from a small
   perturbation to a base flow with a hyperbolic-tangent velocity profile.
   The subsequent development of the shear instabilities is studied from
   the simulations using a number of flux-limiting schemes, including the
   second-order MINMOD, the third-order ULTRA-QUICK and the fifth-order
   WENO schemes for the spatial interpolation of the nonlinear fluxes. The
   fourth-order Runge-Kutta method advances the simulation in time.
   Findings - The simulations determine two parameters: the fractional
   growth rate of the linear instabilities; and the vorticity thickness of
   the first nonlinear peak. Grid refinement using 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512
   nodes over one wave length determines the exact values by extrapolation
   and the computational error for the parameters. It also determines the
   overall order of convergence for each of the flux-limiting schemes used
   in the numerical simulations.
   Originality/value - The four-digit accuracy of the numerical simulations
   presented in this paper are comparable to analytical solutions. The
   development of this reliable numerical simulation method has paved the
   way for further study of the instabilities in shear flows that radiate
   waves.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to first present the key features
   of hybrid numerical methods that enable cost-effective simulations of
   complex thermofluid systems, and then demonstrate the formulation and
   application of such a method.
   Design/methodology/approach - A hybrid numerical method is formulated
   for simulations of a closed-loop thermosyphon operating with slurries of
   a micro-encapsulated phase-change material suspended in distilled water.
   The slurries are modeled as homogeneous mixtures, with inputs of
   effective properties and overall heat-loss coefficients. Combinations of
   an axisymmetric two-dimensional (2D) control-volume finite-element
   method and a segmented-quasi-one-dimensional (1D) model are used to
   achieve cost-effective simulations. Proper matching of the solutions at
   the interfaces between adjacent axisymmetric 2D and quasi-1D zones is
   ensured by incorporating and heuristically determining suitable lengths
   of pre- and post-heating (and also pre- and post-cooling) sections.
   Findings - In the demonstration problem, which would strictly require
   full three-dimensional simulations of the fluid flow and heat transfer
   phenomena, the proposed hybrid 1D/2D numerical method produces results
   that are in very good agreement with those obtained in a complementary
   experimental investigation.
   Originality/value - The hybrid numerical methods discussed in this paper
   allow cost-effective computer simulations of complex thermofluid
   systems. These methods can therefore serve as very useful tools for the
   design, parametric studies, and optimization of such systems.}},

Abstract = {{Li-rich layered cathode materials have already drawn considerable
   attention owing to their high capacity performance for Li-ion batteries
   (LIBs). In this work, layered Li-rich Li{[}Li0.2Ni0.17Co0.07Mn0.56]O-2
   nanoparticles are surface-modified with AlF3 through a facile chemical
   deposition method. The AlF3 surface layers have little impact on the
   structure of the material and act as buffers to prevent the direct
   contact of the electrode with the electrolyte; thus, they enhance the
   electrochemical performance significantly. The 3 wt\% AlF3-coated
   Li-rich electrode exhibits the best cycling capability and has a
   considerably enhanced capacity retention of 83.1\% after 50 cycles.
   Moreover, the rate performance and thermal stability of the 3 wt\%
   AlF3-coated electrode are also clearly improved. Surface analysis
   indicates that the AlF3 coating layer can largely suppress the
   undesirable growth of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and,
   therefore, stabilizes the structure upon cycling.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Abstract = {{Localized interactions are predicted to favour the evolution of
   cooperation amongst individuals within a population. One important
   factor that can localize interactions is habitat patchiness. We
   hypothesize that habitats with greater patchiness (greater edge-to-area
   ratio) can facilitate the maintenance of cooperation. This outcome is
   believed to be particularly relevant in pathogenic microbes that can
   inhabit patchy habitats such as the human respiratory tract. To test
   this hypothesis in a simple but spatially controlled setting, we
   designed a transparent microhabitat chip (MHC) with multiple patchiness
   treatments at the 100 micron scale. The MHC is a closed system that
   sustains bacterial replication and survival for up to 18 hours, and
   allows spatial patterns and eco-evolutionary dynamics to be observed
   undisturbed. Using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we
   tracked the growth of wild-type cooperators, which produce the public
   good pyoverdin, in competition with mutant defectors or cheaters that
   use, but do not produce, pyoverdin. We found that while defectors on
   average outperformed cooperators in all habitats, habitat patchiness
   significantly alleviated the ecological pressure against cooperation due
   to defection, leading to coexistence. Our results confirmed that
   habitat-level spatial heterogeneity can be important for cooperation.
   The MHC enables novel experiments, allows multiple parameters to be
   precisely varied and studied simultaneously, and will help uncover
   dynamical features of spatial ecology and the evolution of pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{We designed a fabrication technique able to replicate microstructures in
   soft silicone materials (E < 1 kPa). Sugar-based `hard candy' recipes
   from the confectionery industry were modified to be compatible with
   silicone processing conditions, and used as templates for replica
   molding. Microstructures fabricated in soft silicones can then be easily
   released by dissolving the template in water. We anticipate that this
   technique will be of particular importance in replicating
   physiologically soft, microstructured environments for cell culture, and
   demonstrate a first application in which intrinsically soft
   microstructures are used to measure forces generated by fibroblast-laden
   contractile tissues.}},

   multiphysics approach that takes into account thermo-poroelasticity of
   the intact geological formation and the presence of a system of sessile
   but hydraulically interacting fractures (fracture zones). The modelling
   considers coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical effects in both the intact
   rock and the fracture zones due to contact normal stresses and fluid
   pressure at the base of the advancing glacier. Computational modelling
   provides an assessment of the role of fractures in modifying the pore
   pressure generation within the entire rock mass.}},

Title = {{The Time-Varying Characteristics of Overhead Electric Transmission Lines
   Considering the Induced-Ice-Shedding Effect}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{More ice deposits accreted on conductors or ground wires may be shed off
   when an overhead electric transmission line is responding to shocks
   initiated by natural ice shedding. Ice shedding causes the global mass,
   stiffness, and damping of the tower-line system to vary with time, and
   the successive shedding effect beyond a trigger event has not been taken
   into account in previous studies due to the lack of an adequate ice
   detachment model. In this paper, the ice shedding effect induced by
   initial shocks was considered in finite element (FE) analysis. An ice
   detachment criterion, in the way of user-defined element rupture
   subroutine, was implemented into the main commercial nonlinear FE
   program ADINA, making it possible to consider the induced-ice-shedding
   effect numerically. The incremental FE form of the system's governing
   equations of motion is presented where the variations in the mass and
   stiffness matrices of the system are taken into consideration. Taking a
   transmission line section following natural ice shedding as a case
   study, the results indicate that neglecting successive ice shedding
   underestimates the adverse influence of natural ice shedding. The
   proposed method can help to improve the design and evaluation of
   transmission lines in cold regions and to ensure their mechanical
   security.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of toxicity of doxorubicin (Dox) and gold
   nanoparticle-conjugated doxorubicin (Au-Dox) were investigated in
   cultured B16 melanoma cells and cardiomyocytes using real-time
   cell-growth imaging. Both bolus exposure and continuous exposure were
   used. Modeling of the growth curve dynamics suggested patterns of uptake
   and/or expulsion of the drug that were different for the different cell
   lines and exposures. Dox alone in B16 cells fit to a model of slow drug
   buildup, whereas Au-Dox fit to a pattern of initial high drug efficacy
   followed by a decrease. In cardiomyocytes, the best fit was to a model
   of increasing drug concentration which then began to decrease,
   consistent with breakdown of the doxorubicin in solution. Cardiomyocytes
   were more sensitive than B16 cells to Dox alone (IC50 123 +/- 2 nM vs.
   270 +/- 2 nM with continuous exposure), but were dramatically less
   sensitive to Au-Dox (IC50 1 +/- 0.1 mu M vs. 58 +/- 5 nM with continuous
   exposure). Bolus exposure for 40 min led to significant cell death in
   B16 cells but not in cardiomyocytes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging
   (FLIM) showed different patterns of uptake of Au-Dox in the two cell
   types that explained the differential toxicity. While Au-Dox
   concentrated in the nuclei of B16 cells, it remained endosomal in
   cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that stable conjugates of
   nanoparticles to doxorubicin may be useful for treating resistant
   cancers while sparing healthy tissue.}},

   Comprehensive Review}},
Journal = {{DRYING TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1397-1462}},
Abstract = {{Inspired by the functional behavior of the biological nervous system of
   the human brain, the artificial neural network (ANN) has found many
   applications as a superior tool to model complex, dynamic, highly
   nonlinear, and ill-defined scientific and engineering problems. For this
   reason, ANNs are employed extensively in drying applications because of
   their favorable characteristics, such as efficiency, generalization, and
   simplicity. This article presents a comprehensive review of numerous
   significant applications of the ANN technique to solve problems of
   nonlinear function approximation, pattern detection, data
   interpretation, optimization, simulation, diagnosis, control, data
   sorting, clustering, and noise reduction in drying technology. We
   summarize the use of the ANN approach in modeling various dehydration
   methods; e.g., batch convective thin-layer drying, fluidized bed drying,
   osmotic dehydration, osmotic-convective drying, infrared, microwave,
   infrared- and microwave-assisted drying processes, spray drying, freeze
   drying, rotary drying, renewable drying, deep bed drying, spout bed
   drying, industrial drying, and several miscellaneous applications.
   Generally, ANNs have been used in drying technology for modeling,
   predicting, and optimization of heat and mass transfer, thermodynamic
   performance parameters, and quality indicators as well as physiochemical
   properties of dried products. Moreover, a limited number of researchers
   have focused on control of drying systems to achieve desired product
   quality by online manipulating of the drying conditions using previously
   trained ANNs. Opportunities and limitations of the ANN technique for
   drying process simulation, optimization, and control are outlined to
   guide future R\&D in this area.}},

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{491-500}},
Abstract = {{The oxidation of ibuprofen (IBP) in water was evaluated using oxidative
   treatments: ozonation, sonication, hydrogen peroxide addition and
   combinations of these processes. After 20 minutes of treatment, ozone
   coupled with hydrogen peroxide at pH 7, 15 degrees C, an ozone dose of
   16 mg/L and a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 7.1 mg/L was found to
   have the highest IBP (95\%) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (41\%)
   removals. A synergistic effect was observed for the combined
   ozonation/sonication process, which might be explained by an improved
   mass transfer of ozone in the solution due to the presence of ultrasonic
   pressure waves. Transformation products were detected in the treated
   solutions. The nature of five of these products was confirmed by liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), including
   4-isobutylacetophenone (4-IBAP), oxo-IBP, 4-acetylbenzoic acid,
   4-ethybenzaldehyde and oxalic acid. In addition, COD analyses for each
   experiment showed that the ratio of \%COD removal to \%IBP removal was
   highest with sonication; suggesting that this oxidative process offers
   other mechanisms of removal which may lead to further degradation of
   products formed. This study presents the first data on removal of IBP by
   sonication coupled to ozonation and provides some insight into the
   potential of this combined treatment approach for the removal of
   contaminants of emerging concern.}},

Title = {{A Stable Carbon Nanotube Nanofluid for Latent Heat-Driven Volumetric
   Absorption Solar Heating Applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Recently, direct solar collection through the use of broadly absorbing
   nanoparticle suspensions (known as nanofluids) has been shown as a
   promising method to improve efficiencies in solar thermal devices. By
   utilizing a volatile base fluid, this concept could also be applied to
   the development of a direct absorption heat pipe for an evacuated tube
   solar collector. However, for this to happen or for any other
   light-induced vapor production applications, the nanofluid must remain
   stable over extended periods of time at high temperatures and throughout
   repetitive evaporation/condensation cycles. In this work, we report for
   the first time a nanofluid consisting of plasma-functionalized
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) suspended in denatured alcohol,
   which achieves this required stability. In addition, optical
   characterization of the nanofluid demonstrates that close to 100\% of
   solar irradiation can be absorbed over a relatively small nanofluid
   thickness.}},

Title = {{A large-scale simulation model to assess karstic groundwater recharge
   over Europe and the Mediterranean}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{1729-1746}},
Abstract = {{Karst develops through the dissolution of carbonate rock and is a major
   source of groundwater contributing up to half of the total drinking
   water supply in some European countries. Previous approaches to model
   future water availability in Europe are either too-small scale or do not
   incorporate karst processes, i.e. preferential flow paths. This study
   presents the first simulations of groundwater recharge in all karst
   regions in Europe with a parsimonious karst hydrology model. A novel
   parameter confinement strategy combines a priori information with
   recharge-related observations (actual evapotranspiration and soil
   moisture) at locations across Europe while explicitly identifying
   uncertainty in the model parameters. Europe's karst regions are divided
   into four typical karst landscapes (humid, mountain, Mediterranean and
   desert) by cluster analysis and recharge is simulated from 2002 to 2012
   for each karst landscape. Mean annual recharge ranges from negligible in
   deserts to > 1 m a(-1) in humid regions. The majority of recharge rates
   range from 20 to 50\% of precipitation and are sensitive to subannual
   climate variability. Simulation results are consistent with independent
   observations of mean annual recharge and significantly better than other
   global hydrology models that do not consider karst processes
   (PCR-GLOBWB, WaterGAP). Global hydrology models systematically
   under-estimate karst recharge implying that they over-estimate actual
   evapotranspiration and surface runoff. Karst water budgets and thus
   information to support management decisions regarding drinking water
   supply and flood risk are significantly improved by our model.}},

Title = {{Entropy generation and second law analysis of pulsed impinging jet}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1089-1106}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine entropy generation
   rate in the flow and temperature field due pulsed impinging jet on to a
   flat plate. Heat transfer of pulsed impinging jets has been investigated
   by many researchers. Entropy generation is one of the parameters related
   to the second law of thermodynamics which must be analyzed in processes
   with heat transfer and fluid flow in order to design efficient systems.
   Effect of velocity profile parameters and various nozzle to plate
   distances on viscous and thermal entropy generation are investigated.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the flow and temperature
   field of a pulsed turbulent impinging jet are simulated numerically by
   the finite volume method with appropriate boundary conditions. Then,
   flow and temperature results are used to calculate the rate of entropy
   generation due to heat transfer and viscous dissipation.
   Findings - Results show that maximum viscous and thermal entropy
   generation occurs in the lowest nozzle to plate distance and entropy
   generation decreases as the nozzle to plate distance increases. Entropy
   generation in the two early phase of a period in the most frequencies is
   more than steady state whereas a completely opposite behavior happens in
   the two latter phase. Increase in the pulsation frequency and amplitude
   leads to enhancement in entropy generation because of larger temperature
   and velocity gradients. This phenomenon appears second and even third
   peaks in entropy generation plots in higher pulsation frequency and
   amplitude.
   Research limitations/implications - The predictions may be extended to
   include various pulsation signal shape, multiple jet configuration, the
   radiation effect and phase difference between jets.
   Practical implications - The results of this paper are a valuable source
   of information for active control of transport phenomena in impinging
   jet configurations which is used in different industrial applications
   such as cooling, heating and drying processes.
   Originality/value - In this paper the entropy generation of pulsed
   impinging jet was studied for the first time and a comprehensive
   discussion on numerical results is provided.}},

Abstract = {{To design a biodegradable hydrogel as cell support, one should know its
   in vivo degradation rate. A technique commonly used to track gel
   degradation is fluorescence spectroscopy. However, the fluorescence from
   conventional fluorophores quickly decays, and the fluorophores are often
   moderately cytotoxic. Most importantly, they require ultraviolet or
   visible (UV-Vis) light as the excitation source, which cannot penetrate
   deeply through biological tissues. Lanthanide-doped upconverting
   nanoparticles (UCNPs) are exciting alternatives to conventional
   fluorophores because they can convert near-infrared (NIR) to UV-Vis-NIR
   light via a sequential multiphoton absorption process referred to as
   upconversion. NIR light can penetrate up to few cm inside tissues, thus
   making these UCNPs much better probes than conventional fluorophores for
   in vivo monitoring. Also, UCNPs have narrow emission bands, high
   photoluminescence (PL) signal-to-noise ratio, low cytotoxicity and good
   physical and chemical stability. Here, we show a nanocomposite system
   consisting of a biodegradable, in situ thermogelling injectable hydrogel
   made of chitosan and hyaluronic acid encapsulating silica-coated
   LiYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCNPs. We use these UCNPs as photoluminescent tags to
   monitor the gel degradation inside live, cultured intervertebral discs
   (IVDs) over a period of 3 weeks. PL spectroscopy and NIR imaging show
   that NIR-to-NIR upconversion of LiYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@SiO2 UCNPs allows for
   tracking of the gel degradation in living tissues. Both in vitro and ex
   vivo release of UCNPs follow a similar trend during the first 5 days;
   after this time, ex vivo release becomes faster than in vitro,
   indicating a faster gel degradation ex vivo. Also, the amount of
   released UCNPs in vitro increases continuously up to 3 weeks, while it
   plateaus after 15 days inside the IVDs showing a homogenous distribution
   of UCNPs throughout the IVD tissue. This non-invasive optical method for
   real time, live tissue imaging holds great potential for tissue
   analysis, biomapping and bioimaging applications.}},

Title = {{Disclination elastica model of loop collision and growth in confined
   nematic liquid crystals}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{5455-5464}},
Abstract = {{Theory and modeling are used to characterize disclination loop-loop
   interactions in nematic liquid crystals under capillary confinement with
   strong homeotropic anchoring. This defect process arises when a mesogen
   in the isotropic phase is quenched into the stable nematic state. The
   texture evolution starts with +1/2 disclination loops that merge into a
   single loop through a process that involves collision, pinching and
   relaxation. The process is characterized with a combined Rouse-Frank
   model that incorporates the tension and bending elasticity of
   disclinations and the rotational viscosity of nematics. The Frank model
   of disclinations follows the Euler elastica model, whose non-periodic
   solution, known as Poleni's curve, is shown to locally describe the
   loop-loop collision and to shed light on why loop-loop merging results
   in a disclination intersection angle of approximately 60 degrees.
   Additional Poleni invariants demonstrate how tension and bending pinch
   the two loops into a single +1/2 disclination ring. The Rouse model of
   disclination relaxation yields a Cahn-Hilliard equation whose time
   constant combines the confinement, tension/bending stiffness ratio and
   disclination diffusivity. Based on predictions made using this three
   stage process, a practical procedure is proposed to find viscoelastic
   parameters from defect geometry and defect dynamics. These findings
   contribute to the evolving understanding of textural transformations in
   nematic liquid crystals under confinement using the disclination
   elastica methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The recycling of Carbon Fibers Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) wastes is
   becoming increasingly important in the aerospace industry. For most of
   the technologies, the recycled CF (rCF) are discontinuous, misaligned
   and unsized. Compared to thermal treatments, the orientation, the length
   and the brittleness of the rCF are better preserved with the
   SuperCritical Water Solvolysis (SCWS). The effect of the sizing removal
   on the recycled CFRP behavior is studied by conducting static
   characterizations. Realigned virgin CF were used to manufacture sample
   plates which underwent short beam shear tests. An environmental
   assessment was carried out on the CFRP end-of-life with a focus on SCWS.

Title = {{Characterising cement carbonation curing using non-contact electrical
   resistivity measurement}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CEMENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{214-224}},
Abstract = {{Carbonation curing of cement paste and concrete promotes early strength
   gain, improves durability and recycles carbon dioxide in a beneficial
   manner. To examine the carbonation curing mechanism, fresh cement pastes
   and concretes subject to carbonation are characterised using a
   non-contact electrical resistivity measurement method. Resistivity
   measurements reveal that characteristic features of the hydration
   accelerated by carbonation are different from conventional hydration.
   The typical induction period is absent in the carbonation curing owing
   to the rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate. The resistivity
   measurement method produces a superimposed result of early hardening and
   multiple instances of progressive hardening by carbonation curing. The
   electrical resistivity is 3-6 times higher in the carbonated cement
   paste and about 8-16 times higher in the carbonated concretes in
   comparison with the hydration references. The carbonated lightweight
   concrete shows lower bulk resistivity than the carbonated normal-weight
   concrete, possibly owing to the release of internal water from the
   lightweight aggregates during carbonation. This is evidence of internal
   curing by lightweight aggregates.}},

Title = {{Influence of palm oil, canola oil and blends on characteristics of fried
   plantain crisps}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1793-1807}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of crude
   palm oil (PO), canola oil (CO) and their blends on characteristics of
   fried plantain crisps at two different stages of ripening.
   Design/methodology/approach - Plantain (Musa paradisiaca L.) samples
   were peeled, sliced into 3 mm slices, blanched at 70 degrees C for 3 min
   and dried. The slices were deep fried at 180 degrees C for different
   times.
   Findings - There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the
   moisture loss rate and the crispiness of the crisps produced using PO
   and CO. Significant differences (p < 0.05) existed in the fat uptake and
   color properties of the crisps fried in the two oils. PO fried crisps
   absorbed 15 percent less oil in the unripe crisps samples and 21 percent
   less oil in the fully ripened crisps than CO. The browning index showed
   that the PO crisps had greater color changes than the crisps fried using
   CO. The difference between the crisps from 50:50 blends of PO: CO and CO
   was not statistically significant, while 70:30 blends improved the
   qualities of the crisps better than CO alone. Analysis of kinetics data
   showed that moisture loss, oil uptake and browning index followed a
   first-order kinetics model.
   Originality/value - Understanding the interactions between ripening and
   processing methods is enhanced and use of crude PO for industrial
   deep-fat frying is encouraged.}},

   microspheres as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. This
   hierarchical structure is fabricated via a simple template-free

   Menstrual Cycle}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we follow a healthy patient volunteer with daily breast
   scans using our time-domain microwave radar monitoring system. Over the
   course of a 28-day period, which corresponds to the time frame of the
   menstrual cycle, we perform a total of 54 scans per breast. Our breast
   monitoring system uses a time-domain, multistatic radar approach with 16
   wideband sensors. We first directly compare the recorded signals for
   each scan, then examine reconstructed images for each breast, and
   compare how they vary day by day. Images are compared using the
   structural similarity index, and based on their pixel intensities. We
   further estimate the daily average tissue permittivity for each breast.
   The results demonstrate that our system is able to detect variations in
   the breast tissues over the monthly period; however, we estimate that
   the quality of these changes differs from those that would appear due to
   a malignant growth. The tissue changes seen in this trial are not likely
   to affect the outcome of long-term monitoring for the purpose of
   abnormality detection; however, measurements on a larger population are
   required before wider conclusions can be made.}},

   SERS nanoprobes}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{9990-9997}},
Abstract = {{We report a facile method to synthesize highly branched gold nanostars
   wrapped with nano graphene oxide (nGO) sheets with or without the
   addition of Raman dyes, as nanoprobes with high SERS activity. Both
   cysteamine and nGO are added to gold nanostars; the positively charged
   amino groups help self-assembly of nGO flakes around the nanostars. This
   increases the Raman signal of nGO by 5.3 folds compared to samples in
   which nGO is in contact with the nanostars but does not wrap them. We
   also prepare dye-based SERS nanoprobes by sandwiching a typical Raman
   reporter such as Rhodamine B (RhB), Crystal Violet (CV) and Rhodamine 6G
   (R6G) between the nanostars and the nGO coating. The Raman signals of
   RhB are 5.2 times larger when sandwiched between nGO and nanostars than
   if the molecules are just adsorbed on the nanostar surface, and similar
   enhancements are observed for the other dyes. In addition to improving
   SERS efficiency, the wrapping greatly improves the stability of the
   dye-based nanoprobes, showing a reproducible Raman signal of RhB for
   over a week in simulated body fluids at 37 degrees C. High SERS signal,
   facile fabrication method and excellent stability make these nanoprobes
   highly promising for SERS-based biosensing and bioimaging applications.}},

   Studies: A Systematic Review Using Modified ARRIVE and CONSORT
   Guidelines}},
Journal = {{STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objective. Dental stem cell-based tissue engineered
   constructs are emerging as a promising alternative to autologous bone
   transfer for treating bone defects. The purpose of this review is to
   systematically assess the preclinical in vivo and in vitro studies which
   have evaluated the efficacy of dental stem cells on bone regeneration.
   Methods. A literature search was conducted in Ovid Medline, Embase,
   PubMed, and Web of Science up to October 2014. Implantation of dental
   stem cells in animal models for evaluating bone regeneration and/or in
   vitro studies demonstrating osteogenic potential of dental stem cells
   were included. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and
   meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to ensure the quality of the
   search. Modified ARRIVE (Animal research: reporting in invivo
   experiments) and CONSORT (Consolidated reporting of trials) were used to
   critically analyze the selected studies. Results. From 1914 citations,
   207 full-text articles were screened and 137 studies were included in
   this review. Because of the heterogeneity observed in the studies
   selected, meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusion. Both in vivo and
   in vitro studies indicate the potential use of dental stem cells in bone
   regeneration. However well-designed randomized animal trials are needed
   before moving into clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Water retting is a traditional retting method that enables the low-cost
   production of bast fibers. This study investigated the retting of flax
   straws by distilled water for three different durations at room
   temperature in laboratory condition. The retting quality was evaluated
   in terms of the weight loss and degumming rate together with the fiber
   properties, which included color, linear density, and tensile
   properties. The degumming rate was defined as the percentage change in
   pectin content of phloem regions from the raw flax to water-retted flax.
   It was found that the dissolution of pectin and other contaminating
   materials during the beginning retting stage must have played an
   important role in pectin (content) and weight loss besides pectin
   degradation, and water retting gradually improved both the apparel
   properties, such as whiteness and fineness, and the mechanical
   properties of the fibers. Given the results, a water retting duration of
   six days should be sufficient to provide sound retting efficiency and
   reasonable fiber properties.}},

Abstract = {{Date fruit is a good source of bioactive compounds and natural sugar. It
   has the potential to be utilized as a substitute for added sugar.
   Although several forms of datessuch as fresh dates, date paste, and date
   syrupare available in the market and used for different applications,
   free-flow date powder would be highly beneficial in improving
   shelf-life, ease of handling, and blendability with various foods
   prepared domestically and in industry. The objective of this study was
   to produce date powder in a pilot-scale spray dryer and determine its
   physicochemical qualities. Date powder was produced at eight processing
   conditions (2 carrier agents (maltodextrin (MD) and gum arabic (GA)x2
   inlet air temperature (150 degrees C and 170 degrees C)x2 feedstock flow
   rates (25ml/min and 40ml/min)). To the carrier agent was added at 0.4kg
   per 1.0kg of date fruits (dry weight basis), and the feedstock to the
   spray dryer was prepared at 20\% concentration. Date powder was obtained
   in all eight treatments. Color (L{*}a{*}b{*} values), moisture content,
   bulk density, wettability, solubility index, hygroscopicity,
   microstructure analysis (using scanning electron microscope (SEM)), and
   total phenolic compounds were determined for the spray-dried date
   powder. The physicochemical characteristics of date powder varied
   significantly with respect to the processing conditions. Although
   physical properties of date powder were significantly affected by the
   carrier agent, there was no difference in total phenolic compounds
   between date powders produced with MD and GA. An SEM study revealed that
   date powder produced with MD had smooth, regular-shaped spherical
   particles but with severe agglomeration. Date powder with GA had
   relatively smaller particles of irregular sphere with dented surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The plasticity of Mg is restricted at low temperatures because: (a) only
   a small number of deformation mechanisms can be activated, and (b) a
   preferred crystallographic orientation (texture) develops in wrought
   alloys, especially in flat-rolled sheets. This causes problems in thin
   sheet processing as well as component manufacturing from the sheet. In
   this study, different rolling speeds from 15 to 1000 m/min were employed
   to warm-roll AZ31B magnesium alloy to different reductions. The results
   show that AZ31B sheets rolled at 15 m/min and 100 degrees C has
   fractured for reductions of more than 30\% per pass. However, by
   increasing the rolling speed to 1000 m/min the rollability was improved
   significantly and the material can be rolled to reductions of more than
   70\% per pass. The results show that with increasing strain rate at 100
   degrees C, the splitting of basal poles was observed, indicating the
   activation of more contraction twins and secondary twins.}},

Abstract = {{Protein microarrays are used various research areas including drug
   discovery, diagnosis, and analysis of protein-ligand interactions. Their
   efficacy depends on a well-defined pattern of immobilized proteins that
   also have retained their bioactivity. Protein microarrays are
   classically fabricated using the robotic spotting drop method ({''}pin
   printing{''}), which can lead to spots with uneven protein concentration
   within the spotted area, leading to difficult to quantify readings.
   Among the alternative techniques, microcontact printing (mu CP) with a
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamp appears to deliver more defined
   protein patterns on surfaces, while maintaining bioactivity for a wide
   range of proteins.
   Here we have quantitatively compared the distribution of fluorescently
   labeled proteins deposited using direct pipetting, pin printing and mu
   CP printing with flat stamps onto various functionalized glass surfaces
   of different contact angles through fluorescent microscopy. The
   uniformity of the deposited protein spots across deposition techniques
   was also qualitatively analyzed. It was found that with the use of
   either the direct pipetting or pin printing techniques that protein
   concentration on surfaces varied largely across surfaces with different
   contact angles, whereas adsorption did not vary significantly when using
   the mu CP printing Furthermore, when mu CP printing was performed with
   flat relief structures the spot inhomogeneity was lower than when
   classical methods were used, and even less so when a pyramid relief
   structure was used. This suggests that mu CP printing with pyramid
   relief structures could produce protein patterns on various surfaces and
   with increased spot uniformity to enable more reliable protein
   microarrays.}},

Abstract = {{The pH stability of lectin from black turtle bean was characterized by a
   variety of biophysical techniques over the pH range from 2.0 to 10.0.
   The zero-order and second-derivative UV spectra at different pH values
   indicated that the tertiary structure of the protein does not change
   significantly with changes in pH. The maxima emission fluorescence of
   the lectin upon excitation at 280 nm and 295 nm were found to be blue
   shifted 1.2 nm at pH 2.0, and with a red-shift of 1.0 nm at pH 10.0. The
   chemical denaturation results obtained by monitoring the intrinsic
   fluorescence of the lectin indicated that unfolding of the protein
   induced by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) could be described using a
   three-state model. Complete unfolding of the protein was observed at pH
   7.2 in the presence of 6.5 M GdnHCl after 2 weeks, which suggested that
   the lectin was stable at various pHs. Irreversible thermal denaturation
   of lectin was also investigated at various pHs by differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). The first-order two-state kinetic model was applied
   to explain the scan-rate dependent DSC transitions. Both the higher
   activation energy (Ea) computed from the irreversible thermal
   denaturation and the three-state chemical denaturation process suggested
   that the lectin structure remained significantly unchanged from pH 2.0
   to 10.0, which indicated that the structure of the lectin was stable
   over a wide pH range.}},

Abstract = {{We report progress towards combining radiation therapy (RT) and
   photodynamic therapy (PDT) using scintillating nanoparticle
   (NP)-photosensitizer conjugates. In this approach, scintillating NPs are
   excited by clinically relevant ionizing radiation sources and
   subsequently transfer energy to conjugated photosensitizers via FRET,
   acting as an energy mediator between ionizing radiation and
   photosensitizer molecules. The excited photosensitizers generate
   reactive oxygen species that can induce local damage and immune
   response. Advantages of the scheme include:
   1) Compared with traditional radiation therapy, a possible decrease of
   the total radiation dose needed to eliminate the lesion;
   2) Compared with traditional PDT, the ability to target deeper and more
   highly pigmented lesions;
   3) The possibility of additional photosensitizing effects due to the
   scintillation of the nanoparticles.
   In this work, the photosensitizer molecule chlorin e6 was covalently
   bound to the surface of LaF3:Ce NPs. After conjugation, the
   photoluminescence intensity of NPs decreased, and fluorescence lifetime
   of conjugated chlorin e6 became sensitive to excitation wavelength,
   suggesting rapid FRET. In addition, scintillation spectra of
   nanoparticles were measured. Preliminary calculations suggest that the
   observed scintillation efficiencies are sufficient to enhance RT. In
   vitro cancer cell studies suggest conjugates are taken up by cells.
   Survival curves with radiation exposure suggest that the particles alone
   cause radiosensitization comparable to that seen with gold
   nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The goals of this work were to determine whether conjugation of any of
   four selected peptides to Au nanoparticles improved their delivery to
   B16 melanoma in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro cytotoxicity assays,
   peptides and conjugates were endocytosed but did not escape from
   endosomes. None of the peptides showed any cytotoxicity, with or without
   conjugation to the nanoparticles. The combination of peptides and
   doxorubicin did not improve upon the cytotoxicity of gold-doxorubicin
   alone. We then tested targeting in vivo using inductively coupled plasma
   mass spectrometry to quantify the concentration of Au in the organs of
   B16 tumor-bearing mice 4, 24, and 72 h after intravenous Au nanoparticle
   injection. These experiments showed that in some cases, peptide
   conjugation improved upon the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
   effect. A peptide based upon the myxoma virus and the cyclic RGD peptide
   were both effective at tumor targeting; myxoma was more effective with
   un-PEGylated particles, and cRGD with PEGylated particles. The FREG and

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet (UV) lasers are of paramount importance for applications in
   water purification, diagnosis and bio-agent detection. Here we report
   that, with the use of dislocation-free AlGaN nanowires formed directly
   on Si substrate, electrically injected UV emission in the wavelength
   range from 319 nm to 335 nm can be readily achieved, which is the
   shortest wavelength range ever reported for electrically injected
   semiconductor lasers. In this work, catalyst-free AlGaN nanowire arrays
   are grown directly on Si substrate by radio frequency plasma-assisted
   molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Our detailed calculation shows that such
   vertically aligned randomly distributed sub-wavelength scale nanowire
   array can sustain random lasing action. Various lasing peaks from 319 nm
   to 335 nm can be measured from such AlGaN nanowire samples under
   electrical injection. The threshold is measured to be in the range of
   tens of A/cm(2) at cryogenic temperature, which is significantly smaller
   than the commonly reported GaN-based quantum well lasers. The measured
   linewidth is as narrow as 0.2 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-nanoparticle (NP) composites have shown potential in
   applications ranging from batteries to, more recently, tissue
   engineering. Graphene and NPs should be integrated into uniform
   free-standing structures for best results. However, to date, this has
   been achieved only in few examples; in most cases, graphene/NP powders
   lacking three-dimensional (3D) structure were produced. Here we report a
   facile and universal method that can be used to synthesize such
   structures based on colloidal chemistry. We start from aqueous
   suspensions of both graphene oxide nanosheets and citrate-stabilized
   hydroxyapatite (HA) NPs. Hydrothermal treatment of the mixtures of both
   suspensions reduces graphene oxide to graphene, and entraps colloidal HA
   NPs into the 3D graphene network thanks to a self-assembled
   graphite-like shell formed around it. Dialysis through this shell causes
   uniform NP deposition onto the graphene walls. The resulting graphene-HA
   gels are highly porous, strong, electrically conductive and
   biocompatible, making them promising scaffolds for bone tissue
   engineering. This method can be applied to produce a variety of
   free-standing 3D graphene-based nanocomposites with unprecedented

Abstract = {{The performance of conventional Al(Ga)N planar devices decays
   drastically with increasing Al content, leading to low internal quantum
   efficiencies (IQEs) and high device operation voltages. In this paper,
   we show that these challenges can be addressed by utilizing epitaxially
   grown nitrogen polar (N-polar) Al(Ga)N nanowires. With a careful control
   of the growth conditions, a strong AlN band edge emission at 210 nm can
   be observed at room temperature, and an IQE of 80\% was derived.
   Furthermore, the Mg incorporation can be drastically enhanced by
   controlling the growth rate. The hole concentrations of AlN: Mg
   nanowires were estimated to be on the order of 10(16) cm(-3), or higher
   at room temperature. 210 nm emitting AlN nanowire LEDs were achieved,
   which exhibit excellent electrical performance (at a forward current of
   20 mA, the forward bias is about 8 V for a standard 300x300 mu m(2)
   device.). This can be ascribed to both efficient Mg doping and
   N-polarity induced internal electrical field that enhances hole
   injection. In the end, high performance AlGaN nanowire LEDs were
   demonstrated. This work provides a practical path for high efficiency
   DUV light sources with nanotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique to fabricate metallic nanocrescents is presented.
   Their optical response is simulated using the finite difference time
   domain (FDTD) method and validated via experimental investigation and
   surface characterization. Nanocrescents support multiresonance
   extinction spectra, making them good candidates for sensing
   applications. In this work, silver nanocrescents are arrayed on a glass
   substrate. A silicon mold was used to imprint an array of polymer
   nanopillars that were coated using obliquely evaporated silver in order
   to introduce a wedge angle to the wall thickness around the pillars. The
   thin part of the silver wall and the inner pillars were then removed
   under a vertical hydrogen plasma shower and nanocrescents were formed.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the surface
   morphology, and the optical properties have been investigated by using
   spectroscopy. We then performed a FDTD analysis of the nanocrescent
   structures to investigate their plasmonic properties emphasizing the
   multiresonance behavior. A comparison between the measured and simulated
   extinction spectra for two different polarizations of the incident plane
   wave showed a slight redshift in the case of the simulated spectra in
   both polarization states. This slight discrepancy is attributed to the
   roughness of the fabricated nanostructures. The existence of multiple
   resonances was clearly seen in the case of measured spectra.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, several drying experiments were carried out to
   investigate the drying behavior and the feasibility of using the
   intermittent drying method. Iranian rough rice with the initial moisture
   content (MC) of 17.65\% (dry basis) was dried by a laboratory-scale
   dryer with an intermediate tempering stage at drying air temperatures of
   40 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 60 degrees C and air velocities of 2.2
   and 3.2m/s. According to the experimental results, tempering stage
   greatly affected the drying performance. Besides, the drying rate was
   increased with drying temperature; however, the effect of the air
   velocity was negligible. Various thin-layer drying models were
   separately examined based on the statistical analysis in order to define
   the behavior of each drying stages namely pre-tempering and
   post-tempering. The results indicated that the Midilli and two-term
   models are the most appropriate models for the first and second drying
   stages, respectively. The constants and coefficients of these two models
   can be expressed as a polynomial function of the temperature and
   velocity of drying air. The parameter estimation procedure was employed
   in order to evaluate the effective moisture diffusivity.}},

Abstract = {{A critical evaluation and optimization of all reliable experimental
   thermodynamic properties and phase diagram data of the Dy-Nd-Fe-B system
   has been performed to obtain the best set of model parameters to
   describe the Gibbs energy of all phases in the system. Thermodynamic
   models with optimized model parameters can be used to predict unexplored
   phase diagrams and complex thermodynamic equilibria. The thermodynamic
   database of the Mg-Dy-Nd-Fe-B system was prepared by integrating the
   present model parameters to the FactSage light alloy database (FTlite)
   and was applied to perform comprehensive thermodynamic analyses of the
   selective extraction and purification process of Nd and Dy from the
   NdFeB permanent magnet scrap using molten Mg. Essential process
   parameters such as temperature, magnet to solvent ratio, vacuum
   pressure, heat requirement, etc. are determined in order to maximize the
   selective extraction of the RE metal from the magnet scrap and produce
   an RE alloy with low impurity content.}},

Abstract = {{Protein molecular motors, which convert chemical energy into kinetic
   energy, are prime candidates for use in nanodevice in which active
   transport is required. To be able to design these devices it is
   essential that the properties of the cytoskeletal filaments propelled by
   the molecular motors are well established. Here we used micro-contact
   printed BSA to limit the amount of HMM that can adsorb creating a
   tightly confined pathway for the filaments to travel. Both the image and
   statistical analysis of the movement of the filaments through these
   structures have been used to new insights into the motility behaviour of
   actomyosin on topographically homogenous, but motor-heterogeneous planar
   systems. It will be shown that it is possible to determine the
   persistence length of the filaments and that it is related to the amount
   of locally adsorbed HMM. This provides a basis that can be used to
   optimize the design of future nanodevices incorporating the actomyosin
   system for the active transport.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of steel fibres on early-age
   shrinkage cracking behaviour of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC)
   slabs. For this, four large UHPC slabs, 2600 mm long and 80 mm deep, are
   fabricated. Two different UHPC mixtures with and without steel fibres
   (V-f = 0\% and 2\%) are considered. Test results show that all UHPC
   slabs without steel fibres exhibit shrinkage cracks at a very early age
   (before 1 d), whereas no shrinkage cracks are found in the UHPC slabs
   with steel fibres. The two principal reasons for these observations are
   the higher shrinkage strain and lower tensile strength of UHPC without
   steel fibres compared with its counterpart with steel fibres incl.
   Restrained shrinkage strain is found to be much lower (approximately
   75\% or more) than the free shrinkage strain, and exhibits a completely
   different behaviour to that of strain under free conditions.}},

Title = {{Internet of Vehicles for E-Health Applications in View of EMI on Medical
   Sensors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Wireless technologies are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare
   applications. However, RF transmission in wireless technologies can lead
   to electromagnetic interference (EMI) on medical sensors under a
   healthcare scenario, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical
   malfunction of medical sensors. In view of EMI to medical sensors, we
   propose a joint power and rate control algorithm under game theoretic
   framework to schedule data transmission at each of wireless sensors. The
   objective of such a game is to maximize the utility of each wireless
   user subject to the EMI constraints for medical sensors. We show that
   the proposed game has a unique Nash equilibrium and our joint power and
   rate control algorithm would converge to the Nash equilibrium. Numerical
   results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve robust
   performance against the variations of mobile hospital environments.}},

   cavity on estimation of permeability}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{126-134}},
Abstract = {{When performing transient hydraulic pulse tests on porous materials in
   the laboratory it is implicitly assumed that the accessible pore space
   of a porous medium and the pressurised fluid-filled cavity are
   completely saturated with the permeating fluid. In certain instances the
   pressurised fluid cavity in a hydraulic pulse test can contain an air
   fraction introduced through either the experimental procedure or
   released from the unsaturated regions of the porous medium. The purpose
   of this paper is to examine the influence of an air fraction within the
   pressurised region, on the estimation of permeability derived from
   transient hydraulic pulse tests. A series of hydraulic pulse tests
   conducted on Stanstead Granite was used to estimate the permeability of
   the rock. It is shown that if the effect of the cavity air fraction is
   omitted from the analysis of the hydraulic pulse test, the permeability
   can be underestimated. The paper also presents a discussion of the
   potential role the air fraction can contribute to discrepancies in the
   permeabilities estimated from steady-state tests and hydraulic pulse
   tests.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{647-654}},
Abstract = {{Strip rolling simulations were carried out on a 0.06\%C-0.3\%Mn-0.01\%Si
   and a 0.11\%C-1.0\%Mn-0.11\%Si-0.03\%Al-0.034\%Nb steel over the
   temperature range 1000 degrees C to 883 degrees C. Pass strains of 0.4
   were applied at a strain rate of 1 s(-1) with interpass times of 0.5 s,
   1 s, 1.5 s, 3 s and 5 s. Two different temperature schedules were
   employed, namely i) continuous cooling at 6 degrees C/s and ii)
   isothermal holding. The mean flow stresses (MFS's) applicable to strip
   rolling were determined by integration. The flow stress levels and MFS's
   decrease when the interpass times are short. When they are long, the
   flow stress increases with decreasing temperature. These observations
   indicate that the austenite is transforming dynamically into ferrite and
   statically into austenite. The nucleation and growth of the ferrite
   reduce the rolling load and modify the microstructure. The addition of
   Nb in solid solution delays the occurrence of dynamic transformation
   (and the retransformation of ferrite back into austenite). The forward
   nucleation of ferrite occurs displacively while the retransformation
   back into austenite takes place by a diffusional mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence associates a lifetime history of major depression
   (LMD) with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have
   shown that major depression (MD) is strongly linked to
   pathophysiological markers of AD, such as cortical amyloid-beta (A beta)
   burden. However, no imaging studies have shown in vivo whether an LMD is
   linked to increased A beta accumulation in patients with mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) in four cortical regions that have been highly
   associated with increased A beta deposition in previous literature:
   frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal. Drawing from the ADNI
   database, we found that patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and an LMD (n
   = 39) had significantly higher F-18-Florbetapir standardized uptake
   value ratios, a surrogate measure of A beta deposition, mainly in the
   bilateral frontal cortex, compared to patients with aMCI without an LMD
   (n = 39) (p = 0.02). This difference was not explained by current
   depressive symptoms, vascular risk factors, or the use of different PET
   scanners. The results were reliable employing two independent methods
   for analysis: region-of-interest and voxel-based analyses. Increased A
   beta in the bilateral frontal lobes may be a biomarker of depressive
   symptomology in aMCI patients. Further studies should test whether
   higher A beta predicts future conversion into AD in this population.}},

Journal = {{ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Megawatt-scale datacenters have emerged to meet the increasing demand
   for IT applications and services. The hunger for power brings large
   electricity bills to datacenter operators and causes significant impacts
   to the environment. To reduce costs and environmental impacts, modern
   datacenters, such as those of Google and Apple, are beginning to
   integrate renewable or green energy sources into their power supply.
   This article investigates the green-energy-aware power management
   problem for these datacenters and surveys and classifies works that
   explicitly consider renewable energy and/or carbon emission. Our aim is
   to give a full view of this problem. Hence, we first provide some basic
   knowledge on datacenters (including datacenter components, power
   infrastructure, power load estimation, and energy sources' operations),
   the electrical grid (including dynamic pricing, power outages, and
   emission factor), and the carbon market (including cap-and trade and
   carbon tax). Then, we categorize existing research works according to
   their basic approaches used, including workload scheduling,
   virtualmachine management, and energy capacity planning. Each category's
   discussion includes the description of the shared core idea, qualitative
   analysis, and quantitative analysis among works of this category.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{1609-1618}},
Abstract = {{Despite recent advances in the miniaturization and automation of
   biosensors, technologies for on-site monitoring of environmental water
   are still at an early stage of development. Prevention of outbreaks
   caused by pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila would be facilitated
   by the development of sensitive and specific bioanalytical assays that
   can be easily integrated in miniaturized fluidic handling systems. In
   this work, we report on the integration of an amplification-free assay
   in digital microfluidics (DMF) for the detection of Legionella bacteria
   based on targeting 16s rRNA. We first review the design of the developed
   DMF devices, which provide the capability to store up to one hundred
   nL-size droplets simultaneously, and discuss the challenges involved
   with on-chip integration of the RNA-based assay. By optimizing the
   various steps of the assay, including magnetic capture, hybridization
   duration, washing steps, and assay temperature, a limit of detection as
   low as 1.8 attomoles of synthetic 16s rRNA was obtained, which compares
   advantageously to other amplification-free detection systems. Finally,
   we demonstrate the specificity of the developed assay by performing
   multiplex detection of 16s rRNAs from a pathogenic and a non-pathogenic
   species of Legionella. We believe the developed DMF devices combined
   with the proposed detection system offers new prospects for the
   deployment of rapid and cost-effective technologies for on-site
   monitoring of pathogenic bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Biosand filter (BSF) users are instructed to operate their filters with
   residence times of 1-48 hours. However, studies to date have only tested
   residence periods of 6-36 hours, with no studies extending to 48 hours,

   goal of this study was to compare Escherichia coli removal in filters
   operated with one-, two-, and three-day residence periods. Nine
   laboratory-scale column filters were operated in parallel, with three
   replicates for each of the three residence periods, over 84 days.
   Filters were fed with lake water supplemented with E. coli. Influent,
   effluent, and control samples were tested for a range of parameters
   including E. coli colony forming units; turbidity; pH; electrical
   conductivity; dissolved oxygen (DO); and nitrogen as ammonia, nitrate,
   and nitrite. Hydraulic conductivity and DO of pore water were measured
   for different sand depths within the filters every six days. The study
   found no significant difference in E. coli removal by extending the
   residence period to three days. However, water treated in filters with
   increased residence periods had lower DO concentrations and increased

Abstract = {{In this article, ultracompact unidirectional patch antennas are used in
   different two-antenna systems for biomedical applications at 5.2 GHz.
   Multilayer mushroom type electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures are
   designed as slow-wave medium to reduce the size of the individual patch
   antennas to 0.1 lambda(0) by 0.18 lambda(0). Various techniques are
   investigated herein to improve antenna isolation for an enhanced
   Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) performance. First, the coupling
   between 0.3 lambda(0)-spaced antennas is verified to occur dominantly
   through radiation and near-field coupling between the patches rather
   than through substrate-bound modes. Second, various configurations are
   proposed to suppress antenna coupling. These approaches include
   reorientation of the antennas and employment of parasitic radiators
   between the patches. A novel design is presented in which a
   unidirectional parasitic slot radiator on an EBG reflector is inserted
   between the antennas to decouple them. Measurement results confirm
   efficacy of these approaches in mitigating antenna coupling by more than
   11 dB in the operating bandwidth of the antennas. The compact patch
   antennas maintain efficiency values of higher than 70\%. (C) 2014 Wiley

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{390-408}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nonequilibrium and nonlinear sorption of the contaminants in the
   fractured porous media could significantly influence the shape of the
   breakthrough curve (BTC). For the fracture-matrix system, there are very
   few studies which consider these processes. In this study, the
   nonequilibrium fracture-matrix model with two different nonlinear
   sorption isotherms, namely nonlinear Freundlich and Langmuir sorption
   isotherms were developed. The effect of sorption nonlinearity and
   nonequilibrium conditions on the shape of the BTC was studied using the
   temporal moments. The developed models along with the linear
   equilibrium, linear nonequilibrium fracture matrix models, and the
   multirate mass transfer model were used to simulate the BTC, which were
   compared with the experimental data available in the literature. Both
   sorption nonequilibrium and nonlinearity were found to significantly
   influence the shape of the BTC. Presence of sorption nonlinearity
   reduces the solute spreading, whereas presence of nonequilibrium
   conditions increases the solute spreading. Considering the sorption
   nonequilibrium along with the sorption nonlinearity leads to an improved
   simulation of the BTC. The nonequilibrium nonlinear sorption models
   could simulate the extended BTC tailing resulting from sorption
   nonlinearity and rate-limited interaction in the fracture-matrix system.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional spheroid cultures have become increasingly popular as
   drug screening platforms, especially with the advent of different high
   throughput spheroid forming technologies. However, comparing drug
   efficacy across different cell types in spheroid culture can be
   difficult due to variations in spheroid morphologies and transport
   characteristics. Improving the reproducibility of compact, circular
   spheroids contributes to standardizing and increasing the fidelity of
   the desired gradient profiles in these drug screening three-dimensional
   tissue cultures. In this study we discuss the role that circularity and
   compaction has on spheroids, and demonstrate the impact methylcellulose
   (MethoCel) and collagen additives in the culture media can contribute to
   more compact and circular spheroid morphology. We demonstrate that
   improved spheroid formation is not a simple function of increased
   viscosity of the different macromolecule additives, suggesting that
   other macromolecular characteristics contribute to improved spheroid
   formation. Of the various macromolecular additives tested for hanging
   drop culture, MethoCel provided the most desirable spheroid formation.
   Additionally, the higher viscosity of MethoCel-containing media improved
   the ease of imaging of cellular spheroids within hanging drop cultures
   by reducing motion-induced image blur.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the batch adsorption of benzoic acid from aqueous
   solution onto modified vermiculite was both experimentally and
   theoretically investigated. Mechanical modification of raw vermiculite
   was carried out by means of a laboratory vibratory disk mill. In
   addition, an organic modification was performed by
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. A set of experiments were conducted in
   order to optimize the adsorbent dosage, initial pH value and contact
   time and to evaluate the batch kinetics and the equilibrium isotherm.
   The Freundlich and the Toth isotherms best fitted our experimental data.
   A mathematical model was developed for the investigation of the
   adsorptive dynamic characteristics, thereby estimating the pore
   diffusivity based on the experimental results. The model showed a good
   agreement with the experiments and the effective diffusivity, the model
   adjustment parameter, was estimated as 0.33 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1). (C)

Title = {{Production of PFOS from aerobic soil biotransformation of two

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{The continuous production and use in certain parts of the world of
   perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide derivatives that can degrade to
   perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) has called for better understanding
   of the environmental fate of these PFOS precursors. Aerobic soil
   biotransformation of N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (EtFOSA, also
   known as Sulfluramid) was quantitatively investigated in semi-closed
   soil microcosms over 182 d for the first time. The apparent soil
   half-life of EtFOSA was 13.9 +/- 2.1 d and the yield to PFOS by the end
   of incubation was 4.0 mol\%. A positive identification of a previously
   suspected degradation product, EtFOSA alcohol, provided strong evidence
   to determine degradation pathways. The lower mass balance in sterile
   soil than live soil suggested likely strong irreversible sorption of
   EtFOSA to the test soil. The aerobic soil biotransformation of a
   technical grade N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanol (EtFOSE) was
   semi-quantitatively examined, and the degradation pathways largely
   followed those in activated sludge and marine sediments. Aside from
   PFOS, major degradation products included N-Ethyl perfluorooctane
   sulfonamidoacetic acid (EtFOSAA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and
   perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetic acid (FOSAA). This study confirms
   that aerobic soil biotransformation of EtFOSE and EtFOSA contributes
   significantly to the PFOS observed in soil environment, as well as to
   several highly persistent sulfonamide derivatives frequently detected in
   biosolid-amended soils and landfill leachates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We report a new strategy for generating a continuum of response profiles
   from a single luminescence-based sensor element by using phase-resolved
   detection. This strategy yields reliable responses that depend in a
   predictable manner on changes in the luminescent reporter lifetime in
   the presence of the target analyte, the excitation modulation frequency,
   and the detector (lock-in amplifier) phase angle. In the traditional
   steady-state mode, the sensor that we evaluate exhibits a linear,
   positive going response to changes in the target analyte concentration.
   Under phase-resolved conditions the analyte-dependent response profiles:
   (i) can become highly non-linear; (ii) yield negative going responses;
   (iii) can be biphasic; and (iv) can exhibit super sensitivity (e.g.,
   sensitivities up to 300 fold greater in comparison to steady-state
   conditions).}},

Journal = {{DRYING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{429-433}},
Abstract = {{Applying coagulant such as polyaluminum chloride (PACl) or chitosan can
   improve harvesting efficiency of microalgae from broth. However, the
   coagulant molecules have affinity to lutein molecules, so coagulation
   reduces the lutein yield. This work proposed the addition of NaOCl with
   coagulant for enhancing lutein recovery from Chlorella sp. ESP-6 cells.
   Adding PACl or chitosan largely enhanced membrane filtration flux but
   had no effects on residual solid contents of filter cake. NaOCl released
   insoluble substances from the biomass matrix and deteriorated soluble
   lutein in water. When both NaOCl and coagulant were presented, the NaOCl
   helped to release the lutein out of the biomass, while the PACl and
   chitosan molecules assisted in capturing the OCl- ions. A practical
   harvest scheme including applying both PACl and NaOCl to optimize
   coagulation and maximum yield from Chlorella sp. ESP-6 biomass was
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the results of an investigation on the impact of
   the continuous neutralization circuit and solution parameters on the
   stability of Fe(III)-As(V) coprecipitates produced from acidic sulfate
   solutions by lime neutralization. The work was undertaken to better
   understand the link between the process of arsenic removal via
   continuous circuit coprecipitation as practiced in industrial effluent
   treatment and the stability of arsenic in the resulting coprecipitates.
   In particular the work sought to establish the effects of circuit
   staging (1-3 stages, with and without recycling) and the presence of
   Ni2+ and Al3+ co-ions on coprecipitate stability. The latter was
   monitored during long-term laboratory aging (300-400 days and in some
   cases for similar to 1500 days) at various temperatures (4, 22, 40 and
   70 degrees C) under fixed (pH 8) or drift pH oxic environment. Of the
   different circuit configurations the two-stage
   neutralization/coprecipitation circuit operating at pH = 4 (stage 1) and
   pH = 8 (stage 2) yielded the most stable coprecipitate in terms of
   arsenic retention. Recycling had no apparent effect on stability. It is
   proposed that stage-wise neutralization promotes the formation of ferric
   arsenate in addition to arsenate-bearing ferrihydrite resulting in
   enhanced arsenic retention. Furthermore arsenic retention was found to
   improve under pH drift aging conditions, where coprecipitates rapidly
   attained equilibrium values (<0.2 mg/L As and pH similar to 7.2 at 22
   degrees C). Coprecipitates aged under drift pH condition exhibited
   resistance to arsenic release upon pH elevation. Finally, arsenic
   release was found to be further suppressed in the case of coprecipitates
   produced in the presence of Ni2+ and Al3+. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{133-144}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear dynamical behaviour of a geometrically imperfect
   microplate is examined based on the modified couple stress theory. The
   microplate is modelled by means of the von Karman plate theory and
   Kirchhoff's hypotheses retaining all in-plane and out-of-plane
   displacements and inertia. An initial imperfection in the out-of-plane
   direction is taken into account and the equations of motion for the
   in-plane and out-of-plane motions are obtained by means of an energy
   method based on the Lagrange equations. This operation gives three sets
   of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations with coupled
   terms for two in-plane motions and one out-of-plane motion. These sets
   are transformed into double-dimensional sets of first-order nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically through use
   of a continuation technique. Apart from the nonlinear analysis, an
   eigenvalue analysis is also conducted to obtain the linear natural
   frequencies of the system with different amplitudes of the geometric
   imperfection. The effect of the amplitude of the geometric imperfection
   and thickness of the microplate as well as the forcing frequency on the
   response of the system is highlighted. Finally, a comparison is made
   between the responses of the system based on the modified couple stress
   and classical continuum mechanics theories so as to highlight the
   importance of taking into account small-size effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper we apply an energy method to examine the axisymmetric
   contact problem for a flexible circular plate in smooth contact an
   incompressible elastic halfspace, where the linear elastic shear modulus
   varies exponentially with depth. The approach adopted approximates the
   deflected shape of the plate by a power series expansion which satisfies
   the kinematics of deformation of the plate and the Kirchhoff boundary
   condition at the edge of the plate. The coefficients in the series are
   evaluated by making use of the principle of minimum potential energy.
   Results are obtained for the maximum deflection, the relative deflection
   and the maximum flexural moment in the circular plate. The results
   derived from the proposed procedure are compared with equivalent results
   derived from a computational procedure. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We present an automatic mutual information (MI) registration method for
   mobile LiDAR and panoramas collected from a driving vehicle. The
   suitability of MI for registration of aerial LiDAR and aerial oblique
   images has been demonstrated under an assumption that minimization of
   joint entropy (JE) is a sufficient approximation of maximization of MI.
   We show that this assumption is invalid for the ground-level data. The
   entropy of a LiDAR image cannot be regarded as approximately constant
   for small perturbations. Instead of minimizing the JE, we directly
   maximize MI to estimate corrections of camera poses. Our method
   automatically registers mobile LiDAR with spherical panoramas over an
   approximate 4-km drive, and is the first example we are aware of that
   tests MI registration in a large-scale context. (C) The Authors.

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{1127-1139}},
Abstract = {{We present theoretical scaling and computational analysis of
   nanostructured free surfaces formed in chiral liquid crystals (LC) and
   plant-based twisted plywoods. A nemato-capillary model is used to derive
   a generalized equation that governs the shape of cholesteric free
   surfaces. It is shown that the shape equation includes three distinct
   contributions to the capillary pressure: area dilation, area rotation,
   and director curvature. To analyse the origin of periodic reliefs in
   plywood surfaces, these three pressure contributions and corresponding
   surface energies are systematically investigated. It is found that for
   weak homeotropic surface anchoring, the nano-wrinkling is driven by the
   director curvature pressure mechanism. Consequently, the model predicts
   that for a planar surface with a uniform tangential helix vector, no
   surface nano-scale wrinkling can be observed because the director
   curvature pressure is zero. Scaling is used to derive the explicit
   relation between the wrinkling's amplitude to the wavelength ratio as a
   function of the anisotropic surface tension, which is then validated
   with experimental values. These new findings can be used to characterize
   plant-based twisted plywoods, as well as to inspire the design of
   biomimetic chiro-optical devices.}},

Title = {{Juggling multiple dimensions in a complex socio-ecosystem: The issue of
   targeting in payments for ecosystem services}},
Journal = {{GEOFORUM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Proponents of payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes advocate
   targeting payments to geographical areas that can: (a) maintain or
   enhance ecosystem services, (b) permit economically efficient
   arrangements and (c) address poverty objectives. The location of these
   efficient, effective and equitable (or triple-win) solutions is viewed
   as the `holy grail' of PES and is often sought in isolation to broader
   socio-economic pressures, political relationships, or local cultural
   conditions. While the plethora of PES design perspectives often follow
   the concepts of efficiency and effectiveness, they seldom relate to
   pluralistic value systems and may disparage local self-determination for
   influencing the form and terms of negotiation. This paper critically
   analyses the assumptions underpinning the design of PES schemes which
   seek to optimise or target efficient, effective and poverty objectives.
   Using a case study for a proposed PES initiative in the Kathmandu Valley
   of Nepal, we employ spatial analysis to geographically visualise the
   discrepancy between the location for a typology of targeted objectives
   and actual preferences which support local perceptions of natural
   resource use and conservation. The case study highlights the inequity
   inherent in targeting payments under a neoliberal framing. Instead,
   spatially differentiating incentives according to socially determined
   priorities and collective management is suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Compression tests were carried out at a strain rate of 1 s(-1) on a
   0.06\%C-0.3\%Mn-0.01\%Si steel over two temperature ranges: i) 920
   degrees C to 980 degrees C, and ii) 500 to 750 degrees C. Optical and
   scanning electron microscopy images indicated that significant volume
   fractions of Widmanstatten ferrite were formed dynamically above the
   Ae(3) temperature. The ferrite plates coalesced into polygonal grains
   during straining. The double differentiation method was applied to the
   stress-strain curves, providing average values for the dynamic
   transformation (DT) and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) critical strains
   of 0.12 and 0.20, respectively. These results are interpreted in terms
   of the flow softening-based transformation model by calculating both the
   driving forces promoting the transformation as well as the energy
   barriers that oppose it. The model predicts the temperature range over
   which DT can occur as well as the observed critical strains.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical characterization of an azobenzene dye-containing polymer
   (p4VP(DY7)(0.50)) by nanoindentation shows a significant photo-softening
   effect under visible irradiation at 532 nm. Both strong rate-dependent
   plastic softening, as well as a rate-independent elastic modulus
   decrease are observed. Indentation at elevated, sub-glass transition
   temperatures results in only a rate-in dependent decrease in hardness
   however. These findings indicate, from a mechanics standpoint, for the
   first time a distinct mechanism for the photomechanical softening in
   azo-materials that is different from a simple thermal effect. The main
   hallmark of the photosoftening effect was significant viscoplastic flow
   with strong rate dependence. The presence of the viscoplastic softening
   in azo-polymers was accounted for in analysis of nanoindentation data to
   obtain an accurate elastic modulus unaffected by the presence of creep
   in the unloading curves. These results provide considerable insight into

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the wind-induced vibration of the CAARC standard
   tall building model, via unsteady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and
   a structural modal analysis. In this numerical procedure, the natural
   unsteady wind in the atmospheric boundary layer is modeled with an
   artificial inflow turbulence generation method. Then, the turbulent flow
   is simulated by the second mode of a Zonal Detached-Eddy Simulation, and
   a conservative quadrature-projection scheme is adopted to transfer
   unsteady loads from fluid to structural nodes. The aerodynamic damping
   that represents the fluid-structure interaction mechanism is determined
   by empirical functions extracted from wind tunnel experiments.
   Eventually, the flow solutions and the structural responses in terms of
   mean and root mean square quantities are compared with experimental
   measurements, over a wide range of reduced velocities. The significance
   of turbulent inflow conditions and aeroelastic effects is highlighted.
   The current methodology provides predictions of good accuracy and can be
   considered as a preliminary design tool to evaluate the unsteady wind
   effects on tall buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Detonation waves propagating steadily in a rectangular tube were
   destroyed upon transmission through a perforated plate placed
   perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Subsequent re-initiation
   of the detonation waves downstream are investigated. Two explosive
   mixtures of C2H2 + 2.5O(2) + 70\% Ar (stable detonation with regular
   cellular pattern) and H-2 + N2O (unstable detonation with irregular
   cellular structure) are studied to illustrate the difference in the
   re-initiation processes. Simultaneous schlieren photography and smoked
   foil record permit the different features of the onset of detonation in
   the stable and unstable mixtures to be observed and analyzed in detail.
   It is found that two types of re-initiation processes are present. In
   the stable mixture, the onset of detonation is via multiple localized
   explosions distributed in the reaction zone, which gradually couple the
   reaction zones with the precursor shock to develop the original cellular
   structures. Whereas in the unstable mixtures, local perturbations
   usually at the boundary layer region near the wall lead to one or two
   strong local explosions forming overdriven detonation wave that decay to
   C-J detonation subsequently. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

   for the generation of local explosion centers. In stable mixtures,
   typically with high argon dilution and where the detonation is
   characterized by very regular cells, the failure is driven by the
   excessive global front curvature above which a detonation cannot
   propagate. To discern these two failure mechanisms, porous walled tubes
   are used to attenuate the transverse instability before the detonation
   emerges into the unconfined space. Porous sections with length L/D from
   0 to 3.0 are used with two confined tube diameters D = 12.7 and 15.5 mm.
   The present results show that when porous walled tubes are used, the
   critical pressure for unstable C2H2 + 2.5O(2) and C2H2 + 5N(2)O mixtures
   increases significantly. In contrast, for stable argon diluted C2H2 +
   2.5O(2) + 70\% mixtures, the results with porous wall tubes exhibit
   little variation up to L/D = 2.5. For L/D > 2.5 a noticeable increase in
   critical pressure for argon diluted mixtures is also observed. This is
   dominantly caused by the slow mass divergence through the porous
   material inducing a curvature on the detonation front even before it
   emerges into the open area. The present experiment again demonstrates
   the importance of the transverse wave instability for typical
   hydrocarbon mixtures in critical situations such as the critical tube
   diameter experiment. For special cases such as highly argon diluted
   mixtures, the instability does not play a significant role in the
   failure and the propagation is controlled dominantly by the global
   curvature effect and the shock-ignition mechanism. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The present paper reports the results of a study of detonation limits in
   rough tubes. Detonation velocity is measured by photodiodes and
   ionization probes spaced at 10 cm intervals along the length of the
   tube. Short lengths of smoked foils inserted into the core of the rough
   tube is used to register the structure of the detonation wave. Pressure
   transducers are also used to obtain the pressure profile. The results
   indicate that in rough tubes, the detonation velocity is generally much
   lower than the corresponding values for smooth tubes. The velocity
   decreases slowly at first and then more rapidly as the limit is
   approached. The velocity variation is generally continuous and at the
   limits, the failure velocity is of the order of about 0.4 V-CJ for all
   cases. The detonation limits in rough tubes are found to be wider than
   for a smooth tube. This indicates that the turbulence generated by the
   wall roughness facilitates the propagation of the detonation and extends
   the limits. Smoked foil records show that in the core of the rough tube
   the detonation front has a cellular structure corresponding to the usual
   cellular structure due to instability of the detonation. Thus the
   intrinsic unstable cellular structure is quite robust and retains its
   global characteristics in spite of the large perturbations generated by
   the rough wall. The detonation in the core of the rough tube goes from
   multi-headed to single headed as the limit is approached. Past the
   single headed spin, the low velocity detonation has no cellular
   structure but consists of interacting weak transverse waves from the
   rough wall. The averaged pressure of the low velocity detonation front
   corresponds to about the constant volume explosion pressure, in accord
   with the velocity of the low velocity detonation. (C) 2014 The

Title = {{Effect of spatial heterogeneity on near-limit propagation of a
   pressure-dependent detonation}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{2025-2032}},
Abstract = {{The effect of introducing a spatial heterogeneity into an explosive
   medium is studied computationally by examining the detonation velocity
   near the limit to propagation in a thin explosive layer. The explosive
   system studied is an ideal gas with a single exothermic reaction
   governed by a pressure-dependent reaction rate (p(n)) with a pressure
   exponent of n = 3. A pressure-dependent reaction rate, rather than the
   usual exponential dependence of reaction on temperature of Arrhenius
   kinetics, is used so that the detonation wave is not affected by the
   extreme temperature sensitivity associated with Arrhenius kinetics and
   can be modelled with simple, analytical techniques, and thus the effect
   of introducing heterogeneity can be clearly identified. The
   two-dimensional slab of explosive is bounded by a layer of inert gas
   with the same thermodynamic properties as the explosive. The
   heterogeneity is introduced into the explosive via a large-amplitude,
   two-dimensional sinusoidal ripple in density in the initialization of
   the simulation, while maintaining a constant pressure. The computational
   simulations are initialized with a ZND solution for the ideal CJ
   detonation, and the detonation is allowed to propagate into the
   explosive layer. The simulations show that the detonation in the
   heterogeneous medium exhibits a cellular-like structure of complex shock
   interactions. The detonation is able to propagate into a significantly
   thinner layer of explosive and can exhibit a greater velocity than the
   corresponding homogeneous case. A parametric study of varying the
   wavelength of the sinusoid shows the existence of an optimal size of
   heterogeneity at which the effect is the greatest corresponding to a
   wavelength that is approximately 10 to 50 times the half reaction zone
   length of the ideal CJ detonation. As the wavelength is decreased to the
   size of the reaction zone length, the behavior reverts back to the
   homogeneous case. Wavelengths of heterogeneity significantly larger than
   the optimal case are deleterious to the propagation of the detonation
   wave. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Large-scale experiments examining spherical-flame propagation of
   propane-air flames up to a diameter of 1.2 m were performed. Throughout
   these experiments, the growth of the Darrieus-Landau instability was
   directly observed and detailed measurements show that the increase of
   flame velocity follows a pattern of self-similar oscillatory growth that
   has not been previously reported. These oscillations are found to be the
   result of periodic growth and saturation of a narrow range of length
   scales that follows each generation of cell formation. Based on these
   observations, a new method to estimate the fractal-acceleration exponent
   is proposed based on the amplitude and frequency of these oscillations.
   Comparisons between the fractal exponents derived by this method and a
   direct power law fit show reasonable agreement with one another, as well

Abstract = {{Flame structures and particle combustion regimes are studied in hybrid
   fuel mixtures of methane and iron using a modified Bunsen burner with
   two different oxidizing environments. The first is a stoichiometric
   methane-air mixture, in which the iron reacts with the hot gaseous
   combustion products in a kinetically-controlled regime; the second is a
   lean methane-oxygen-nitrogen mixture, allowing iron to react with the
   excess oxygen in a diffusion-controlled regime. The particle seeding
   concentration is monitored using laser attenuation and varies from 0 to
   350 g/m(3). Burning velocities are obtained from flame photographs and
   condensed phase temperatures are determined from particle emission
   spectra via polychromatic fitting of the spectra to Planck's law of
   blackbody radiation. High-speed imaging is also used to qualitatively
   characterize the different flame structures. Results are also compared
   to a methane flame seeded with inert silicon carbide particles instead
   of iron. It is shown that, independent of the combustion regime, a
   critical concentration of iron powder is required to form a coupled
   flame front in the combustion products of the methane flame.
   Furthermore, after the metal-powder flame formation, a double front
   structure separated by a dark zone is observed in the kinetic regime,
   whereas the two flames overlap and form a single Bunsen cone in the case
   of the diffusion regime. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{Quenching distances for laminar flames in hybrid methane-aluminum fuel
   mixtures (16.3\% O-2/8.1\% CH4/75.6\% N-2/Al) were experimentally
   measured at different concentrations of aluminum suspensions with the
   aluminum particles having an average size of about d(32) = 5.6 mu m.
   Experiments were performed with freely propagating flames in a
   48-mm-inner-diameter Pyrex glass tube. A set of parallel equidistant
   metal plates was installed at about 50 cm from the open tube end,
   forming parallel channels. The flame was initiated at the upper open
   tube end and propagated downwards. Benchmark experiments performed with
   an inert silicon carbide (SiC) powder suspension in the same gaseous
   mixture have demonstrated a steady increase of the quenching distance
   from about 3.5 mm for an unseeded methane flame to about 9.5 mm for a
   flame seeded with 270 g/m(3) of SiC. At higher SiC concentrations, the
   flame failed to propagate down the tube. Coupled aluminum-methane flame
   fronts only appeared above a threshold aluminum concentration around 300
   g/m(3). Below this concentration, the appearance and quenching behaviors
   of the methane flame seeded with reactive aluminum and inert SiC dusts
   were similar. The coupled aluminum-methane flame demonstrated two
   quenching modes. At concentrations below 400 g/m(3), the aluminum flame
   decoupled from the methane flame and quenched while the methane flame
   still propagated. The quenching of a decoupled methane flame in a narrow
   channel resembles the quenching behavior of the inert powder-seeded
   flame. At concentrations above 400 g/m(3), only a coupled
   aluminum-methane flame could be observed to propagate, or be
   extinguished, as a whole and exhibited a weaker dependence of the
   quenching distance on aluminum concentration. These results were
   interpreted in terms of models for binary fuel mixtures wherein the
   second fuel to react is completely decoupled, separated by a fixed
   distance, or merged with the initial flame front. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{We consider a cognitive radio (CR) network consisting of a secondary
   transmitter (ST), a secondary destination (SD) and multiple secondary
   relays (SRs) in the presence of an eavesdropper, where the ST transmits
   to the SD with the assistance of SRs, while the eavesdropper attempts to
   intercept the secondary transmission. We rely on careful relay selection
   for protecting the ST-SD transmission against the eavesdropper with the
   aid of both single-relay and multi-relay selection. To be specific, only
   the ``best{''} SR is chosen in the single-relay selection for assisting
   the secondary transmission, whereas the multi-relay selection invokes
   multiple SRs for simultaneously forwarding the ST's transmission to the
   SD. We analyze both the intercept probability and outage probability of
   the proposed single-relay and multi-relay selection schemes for the
   secondary transmission relying on realistic spectrum sensing. We also
   evaluate the performance of classic direct transmission and artificial
   noise based methods for the purpose of comparison with the proposed
   relay selection schemes. It is shown that as the intercept probability
   requirement is relaxed, the outage performance of the direct
   transmission, the artificial noise based and the relay selection schemes
   improves, and vice versa. This implies a trade-off between the security
   and reliability of the secondary transmission in the presence of
   eavesdropping attacks, which is referred to as the security-reliability
   trade-off (SRT). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SRTs of the
   single-relay and multi-relay selection schemes are generally better than
   that of classic direct transmission, explicitly demonstrating the
   advantage of the proposed relay selection in terms of protecting the
   secondary transmissions against eavesdropping attacks. Moreover, as the
   number of SRs increases, the SRTs of the proposed single-relay and
   multi-relay selection approaches significantly improve. Finally, our
   numerical results show that as expected, the multi-relay selection
   scheme achieves a better SRT performance than the single-relay
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{The terahertz (THz) radiation from InGaN/GaN dot-in-a-wire
   nanostructures has been investigated. A submicrowatt THz signal is
   generated with just ten vertically stacked InGaN quantum dots (QDs) in
   each GaN nanowire. Based on the experimental results and analysis, a
   single quantum wire is expected to generate an output power as high as
   10 pW, corresponding to 1 pW per dot. These structures are among the
   most efficient three-dimensional quantum-confined nanostructures for the
   THz emission. By applying a reverse bias along the wires in a
   light-emitting device (LED) consisting of such nanostructures, the THz
   output power is increased more than fourfold. Based on THz and
   photoluminescence (PL) experiments, the mechanism for the THz emission
   is attributed to dipole radiation induced by internal electric fields
   and enhanced by external fields.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium is an attractive biodegradable material for medical
   applications due to its non-toxicity, low density and good mechanical
   properties. The fast degradation rate of magnesium can be tailored using
   alloy design. The combined addition of Sr and Ca results in a good
   combination of mechanical and corrosion properties; the alloy
   compositions with the best performance are Mg-0.55r and Mg-0.3Sr-03Ca.
   In this study, we investigated an important effect, namely thermal
   treatment (at 400 degrees C), on alloy properties. The bin-corrosion of
   the alloys was analyzed via in vitro corrosion tests in simulated body
   fluid (SBF); the mechanical properties were studied through tensile,
   compression and three-point bending tests in two alloy conditions,
   as-cast and heat-treated. We showed that 8 h of heat treatment increases
   the corrosion rate of Mg-0.5Sr very rapidly and decreases its mechanical
   strength. The same treatment does not significantly change the
   properties of Mg-0.3Sr-0.3Ca. An in-depth microstructural investigation
   via transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   electron probe micro-analysis and X-ray diffraction elucidated the
   effects of the thermal exposure. Microstructural characterization
   revealed that Mg-03Sr-03Ca has a new intermetallic phase that is stable
   after 8 h of thermal treatment. Longer thermal exposure (24 h) leads to
   the dissolution of this phase and to its gradual transformation to the
   equilibrium phase Mg17Sr2, as well as to a loss of mechanical and
   corrosion properties. The ternary alloy shows better thermal stability
   than the binary alloy, but the manufacturing processes should aim to not
   exceed exposure to high temperatures (400 degrees C) for prolonged
   periods (over 24 h). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influenza virus continuously undergoes antigenic evolution requiring
   manufacturing, validation and release of new seasonal vaccine lots to
   match new circulating strains. Although current production processes are
   well established for manufacturing seasonal inactivated influenza
   vaccines, significant limitations have been underlined in the case of
   pandemic outbreaks. The World Health Organization called for a global
   pandemic influenza vaccine action plan including the development of new
   technologies. A rapid and reliable method for the quantification of
   influenza total particles is crucially needed to support the
   development, improvement and validation of novel influenza vaccine
   manufacturing platforms. This work presents the development of an ion
   exchange-high performance liquid chromatography method for the
   quantification of influenza virus particles. The method was developed
   using sucrose cushion purified influenza viruses A and B produced in HEK
   293 suspension cell cultures. The virus was eluted in 1.5 M NaCl salt
   with 20 mM Tris-HCI and 0.01\% Zwittergent at pH 8.0. It was detected by
   native fluorescence and the total analysis time was 13.5 min. A linear
   response range was established between 1 x 10(9) and 1 x 10(11) virus
   particle per ml (VP/ml) with a correlation coefficient greater than
   0.99. The limit of detection was between 2.07 x 10(8) and 4.35 x 10(9)
   whereas the limit of quantification was between 6.90 x 10(8) and 1.45 x
   10(10) VP/ml, respectively. The coefficient of variation of the intra-
   and inter-day precision of the method was less than 5\% and 10\%. HPLC
   data compared well with results obtained by electron microscopy, HA
   assay and with a virus counter, and was used to monitor virus
   concentrations in the supernatant obtained directly from the cell
   culture production vessels. The HPLC influenza virus analytical method
   can potentially be suitable as an in-process monitoring tool to
   accelerate the development of processes for the manufacturing of
   influenza vaccines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated CO2 curing is a promising carbon capture and storage
   technology that can provide durable, pre-cast concrete products. A
   mathematical framework for predicting CO2 uptake and distribution during
   carbonation curing is presented, incorporating equations describing CO2
   gas transport, dissolution in concrete pore water and reaction with
   cement compounds. The numerical simulations show that carbonation
   reaction of tricalcium silicate, the most abundant and reactive compound
   in cement, was the rate-controlling process for CO2 uptake. The specific
   surface area of compounds available for reaction determines the rate and
   extent of uptake. The 30-minute carbonation efficiency increased from
   16.5\% to 23\% with a two-fold increase in the total specific surface
   area. The rate of CO2 uptake by cement doubled with a two-fold increase
   in CO2 gas partial pressure, but the extent of carbonation did not
   change significantly due to the formation of solid carbonation products
   on reactive surfaces and in the pore space. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper examines the class of problems related to the interaction
   between a finitely deformed incompressible elastic halfspace and
   contacting elements that include smooth, flat rigid indenters with
   elliptical and circular shapes and a thick plate of infinite extent. The
   contact between the finitely deformed elastic halfspace and the
   contacting elements is assumed to be bilateral. The interaction between
   both the rigid circular indenter and the finitely deformed halfspace is
   induced by a Mindlin force that acts at the interior of the halfspace
   regions and by exterior loads. Similar considerations apply for the
   contact between the flexible plate of infinite extent and the finitely
   deformed elastic halfspace. The theory of small deformations superposed
   on large deformations proposed by Green et al. (Proc R Soc Ser A
   211:128-155, 1952) is used as the basis for the formulation of the
   problem, and results of potential theory and integral transform
   techniques are used to develop the analytical results. In particular,
   explicit results are presented for the displacement of the rigid
   elliptical indenter and the maximum deflection of the flexible plate
   induced by the Mindlin forces, when the finitely deformed halfspace
   region has a strain energy function of the Mooney-Rivlin form.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Direct in situ injection of palladium-doped nanosized zero valent iron
   (Pd-NZVI) particles can contribute to remediation of various
   environmental contaminants. A major challenge encountered is rapid
   aggregation of Pd-NZVI and hence very limited mobility. To reduce
   aggregation and concurrently improve particle mobility, the surface of
   bare Pd-NZVI can be modified with stabilizing surface modifiers.
   Selected surface-modified Pd-NZVI has shown dramatically improved
   stability and transport. However, little is known regarding the effects
   of aquifer grain geochemical heterogeneity on the transport and
   deposition behavior of surface-modified Pd-NZVI. Herein, the mobility of
   surface stabilized Pd-NZVI in two granular matrices representative of
   model ground water environments (quartz sand and loamy sand) was
   assessed over a wide range of environmentally relevant ionic strengths
   (IS). Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), soybean flour and rhamnolipid
   biosurfactant were used as Pd-NZVI surface modifiers. Our results show
   that, both in quartz sand and loamy sand, an increase in solution IS
   results in reduced Pd-NZVI transport. Moreover, at a given water
   chemistry, Pd-NZVI transport is notably attenuated in loamy sand
   implying that geochemical heterogeneity associated with loamy sand is a
   key factor influencing Pd-NZVI transport potential. Experiments
   conducted at a higher Pd-NZVI particle concentration, to be more
   representative of field conditions, show that rhamnolipid and CMC are
   effective stabilizing agents even when 1 g/L Pd-NZVI is injected into
   quartz sand. Overall, this study emphasizes the extent to which
   variation in groundwater chemistry, coupled with changes in aquifer
   geochemistry, could dramatically alter the transport potential of
   Pd-NZVI in the subsurface environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The finite-element time-domain (FETD) solution of the vector wave
   equation (VWE) is directly extended to doubly dispersive media using the
   bilinear transform approach. The proposed formulation is quite general
   and flexible in the sense of material dispersion model in contrast to
   limitations of existing convolutional-based approaches. In addition, it
   can be implemented in a very straightforward and efficient manner. A
   stability analysis is performed that demonstrates the unconditional
   stability of the original formulation is preserved in the dispersive
   case. However, in order to avoid the well-known late-time instabilities
   that arise in this formulation, an alternative formulation is considered
   and extended to the dispersive case with the same approach. Several
   numerical examples are simulated to verify the validity and accuracy of
   the proposed formulations. The late-time stability of the alternative
   formulation is tested through a numerical example with 20 million time
   steps. The solution is completely free from late-time growth.}},

Abstract = {{Porous bioactive glass-ceramics based on the 45S5 Bioglass((R))
   composition were fabricated by an acid-catalyzed sol-gel method. The
   effects of aging time and temperature on the structure and in vitro
   bioactivity were investigated. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR) was carried out on the samples to understand the structure and to
   monitor the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) after immersion in
   simulated body fluid (SBF). The bioactivity of gel-derived 45S5
   glass-ceramic and amorphous 45S5 Bioglass((R)) was compared. The results
   showed that an increase in both aging time and temperature can enhance
   crystallization, whereas bioactivity is reduced with increasing aging
   time but not significantly influenced by aging temperature. Compared
   with amorphous 45S5 Bioglass((R)), gel-derived glass-ceramic aged for 3d
   at 60 degrees C exhibited a more rapid rate of HA formation after
   immersion for less than 7d. Amorphous 45S5 Bioglass((R)) showed higher
   HA formation rate after immersion in SBF for more than 7d, whereas the
   quantity of formed HA on gel-derived 45S5 glass-ceramic was still
   comparable to that of amorphous 45S5 Bioglass((R)) after immersion for
   14d. It is suggested that the lower bioactivity of 45S5 glass-ceramics
   could be outweighed by the higher surface area and higher content of
   Si-NBO groups in gel-derived glass-ceramics. The results thus confirm
   that gel-derived 45S5 glass-ceramic exhibiting bioactivity comparable to
   that of amorphous 45S5 Bioglass((R)) can be fabricated by sol-gel method

Abstract = {{Early carbonation curing was developed for hollow-core concrete slab
   production to partially replace heat curing and recycle carbon dioxide
   recovered from the cement kiln. The cavities in hollow core slab were
   utilized as a CO2 gas chamber to facilitate a carbonation curing at a
   low gas pressure. Concrete performance was evaluated by carbon dioxide
   uptake, compressive strength, pH values and resistance to air
   permeation. The microstructure was examined by X-ray diffraction
   patterns, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscope.
   It was found that early carbonation curing could reduce the conventional
   heat curing duration and produce concrete with higher strength and lower
   permeability due to the precipitation of calcium carbonates on surface.
   The pH value of the carbonated concrete at the reinforcement could be
   kept above the corrosion threshold through a subsequent hydration and
   the delayed ettringite formation owing to heat curing was totally
   eliminated by early carbonation. The process offers economical,
   technical and environmental benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Strengthening in age-hardenable alloys is mainly achieved through
   nano-scale precipitates whose formation paths from the atomic-scale,

   leading to three successive variants of face-centered cubic (fcc)
   clusters, followed by the formation of non-fcc GP-zones. The clusters,
   which originally assume a spherical morphology (Cl), evolve into
   elongated clusters and orient themselves on \{111\}(Al), (C2) and
   subsequently on \{100\}(Al) planes and < 100 >(Al) directions (C3). We
   also analyze the association of quenched-in dislocations with clustering
   phenomena. The results of this work can open a new frontier in advancing
   alloy-process-property design for commercially important age-hardenable

Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the vocal fold tissue consists
   primarily of fibrous and interstitial proteins. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate the effects of selective enzymatic digestion of
   two ECM proteins, namely elastin and versican, on the elasticity of
   rabbit vocal fold tissue. Quasi-static, sinusoidal, uniaxial tensile
   tests were performed. The data were analyzed within the framework of a
   model of the ECM as a two-phase composite material consisting of
   collagen fibrils as the reinforcing fibers and noncollagenous ECM
   proteins as the matrix. To validate the two-phase model, the regression
   parameters for the fibers' volume fraction and shear modulus in a
   different animal model were compared with corresponding published data.
   The proposed model was then used to analyze rabbit vocal fold tissues.
   The mean value and the standard deviation of the fiber volume fraction
   were found to be 8.49 3.75 \% for the control samples ( = 4), 0.59 1.13
   \% after elastin removal ( = 4), and 8.22 1.06 \% after versican removal

Title = {{Effect of slip-weakening distance on selected seismic source parameters
   of mining-induced fault-slip}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{115-122}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fault-slip caused by mining activities in underground mines could cause
   severe damage to nearby mine openings due to seismic waves arising from
   the fault-slip. A better understanding of seismic source parameters,
   such as seismically radiated energy and the maximum slip rate, is of
   pivotal importance in estimating the damage induced by the fault-slip.
   It is widely recognized that dynamic behaviour of faultslip is largely
   affected by slip-weakening behaviour. In the present study, the effect
   of the slip-weakening behaviour on selected seismic source parameters of
   fault-slip is investigated using a mine-wide numerical model
   encompassing a fault running parallel to an orebody. A linear
   slip-weakening law is employed in a parametrical study with respect to
   characteristic slip-weakening distance, do, assuming two types of
   fault-slip: (a) zonal fault-slip taking place across the fault; (b)
   local fault-slip taking place within limited areas of the fault, i.e.,
   it is assumed that fault-slip is arrested by surrounding rockmasses.
   Results obtained from the dynamic analysis indicate that seismically
   radiated energy and slip rates are significantly affected by do for both
   types of fault-slip. On the other hand, the seismic moment is
   susceptible to do only for zonal fault-slip, given that do is smaller
   than the maximum shear displacement increment during the fault-slip.
   These results imply that considering slip-weakening distance is critical
   in estimating seismically radiated energy and slip rates, whereas
   slip-weakening behaviour might not have a large influence on seismic
   moment of local fault-slip. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Title = {{Nuclear uptake of ultrasmall gold-doxorubicin conjugates imaged by
   fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and electron microscopy}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{240-251}},
Abstract = {{Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has been used to image
   free and encapsulated doxorubicin (Dox) uptake into cells, since
   interaction of Dox with DNA leads to a characteristic lifetime change.
   However, none of the reported Dox conjugates were able to enter cell
   nuclei. In this work, we use FLIM to show nuclear uptake of 2.7 nm mean
   diameter Au nanoparticles conjugated to Dox. The pattern of labelling
   differed substantially from what was seen with free Dox, with slower
   nuclear entry and stronger cytoplasmic labelling at all time points. As
   the cells died, the pattern of labelling changed further as
   intracellular structures disintegrated, consistent with association of
   Au-Dox to membranes. The patterns of Au distribution and intracellular
   structure changes were confirmed using electron microscopy, and indicate
   different mechanisms of cytotoxicity with stable Au-Dox conjugates
   compared to Dox alone. Such conjugates are promising tools for
   overcoming resistance in Dox-resistant cancers.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, aerospace Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have
   shown a desire to incorporate Out-of-Autoclave (OoA) composite materials
   into the design of their aircraft structural components. Currently, a
   large portion of OoA processing techniques rely on convection ovens for
   heating. Ovens generally feature relatively low convective heat transfer
   coefficients, which induce thermal lag, limit ramp rates, and thereby
   hinder production. This study examines the use of an integrally heated
   tool-plate consisting of a fiat aluminum plate and a novel TCX (TM)
   resistive element for OoA processing The TCX (TM) heated tool is
   compared to a standard lab scale convection oven in terms of laminate
   quality and energy consumption. For a standard cure cycle, the oven and
   heated tool are found to produce equivalent quality laminates. When an
   aggressive ramp rate is imposed using the heated tool, laminate quality
   decreased, although high process variability may be the root cause of
   these results. In terms of energy consumption, two distinct comparisons
   indicate energy savings of 66 \% and 92 \% for a standard cure at the
   lab scale when using the TCX (TM) heated tool. High ramp rate cures are
   found to require more available power, but result in similar total
   energy use.}},

   temperatures of 573 K and 673 K (300 A degrees C and 400 A degrees C)
   and two ram speeds of 4 and 8 mm/s were used at constant extrusion ratio
   of 7. M1 exhibited strong basal texture after extrusion at 673 K (400 A
   degrees C) at higher speed. At 573 K (300 A degrees C),
   recrystallization in all alloys takes place completely or partially by
   continuous dynamic recrystallization mechanism, while particle
   stimulated nucleation (PSN) occurs in all M1-Sr alloys at both extrusion
   temperatures and speeds. At 673 K (400 A degrees C), grain boundary
   bulging is the only recrystallization mechanism in alloy M1, while it
   occurs in combination with PSN in M1-Sr alloys. The effect of texture
   weakening by PSN is more significant in M1-Sr alloys extruded at 573 K
   (400 A degrees C). The plant extrusion trials were carried out on Mg-1
   pctMn, Mg-1 pctMn-0.3 pctSr, and Mg-1 pctMn-2.1 pctSr at 623 K (350 A

Abstract = {{Due to its very low hardness and atomic number, pure lithium cannot be
   prepared by conventional methods prior to scanning electron microscopy
   analysis. Here, we report on the characterization of pure lithium
   metallic sheets used as base electrodes in the lithium-ion battery
   technology using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray
   microanalysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) after the sheet
   surface was polished by broad argon ion milling (IM). No grinding and
   polishing were necessary to achieve the sufficiently damage free
   necessary for surface analysis. Based on EDS results the impurities
   could be characterized and EBSD revealed the microsctructure and
   microtexture of this material with accuracy. The beam damage and
   oxidation/hydration resulting from the intensive use of IM and the
   transfer of the sample into the microscope chamber was estimated to be
   <50 nm. Despite the fact that the IM process generates an increase of
   temperature at the specimen surface, it was assumed that the milling
   parameters were sufficient to minimize the heating effect on the surface
   temperature. However, a cryo-stage should be used if available during
   milling to guaranty a heating artefact free surface after the milling

Abstract = {{Distraction osteogenesis (DO) technique is used worldwide to treat many
   orthopedic conditions. Although successful, one limitation of this
   technique is the extended period of fixators until the bone is
   consolidated. The application of growth factors (GFs) is one promising
   approach to accelerate bone regeneration during DO. Despite promising in
   vivo results, its use is still limited in the clinic. This is secondary
   to inherent limitations of these GFs. Therefore, a development of
   delivery systems that allow sustained sequential release is necessary.
   Nanoparticles and nanocomposites have prevailing properties that can
   overcome the limitations of the current delivery systems. In addition,
   their use can overcome the current challenges associated with the
   insufficient mechanical properties of scaffolds and suboptimal
   osteogenic differentiation of transplanted cells in the distraction gap.
   We discuss the clinical implications, and potential early applications
   of the nanoparticles and nanocomposites for developing new treatments to
   accelerate bone regeneration in DO.

Abstract = {{Self-assembly produces materials with highly organized microstructures
   and attractive properties for a variety of applications. Self-assembly
   is a process which typically involves molecules or nano-scale objects,
   with only a few reports of successful self-assembly of objects with
   larger dimensions (greater than 1 mu m). Self-assembly at this length
   scale is however important, and may find different technological
   applications because of the possibility to incorporate different
   functionalities to the building blocks by for example lithographic and
   microfabrication techniques. Meso-scale self-assembly is also
   particularly promising to duplicate the structure of natural materials
   such as nacre (mother of pearl). Here, we fabricated 10 mu m sized
   hexagonal tablets of silicon which self-assembled into a well-packed
   periodically arranged structure at a water-air interface. The
   microstructure was secured in a PDMS thin film, which made it stable and
   more organized compared to the similar large scale assemblies reported

   equivalents with modular fibrillar densities}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{183-193}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Technological improvements in collagen gel fabrication are highly
   desirable as they may enable significant advances in the formation of
   tissue-equivalent biomaterials for regenerative medicine,
   three-dimensional (3D) in vitro tissue models, and injectable scaffolds
   for cell and drug delivery applications. Thus, strategies to modulate
   collagen gel fibrillar density and organization in the mesostructure
   have been pursued to fabricate collagenous matrices with extracellular
   matrix-like features. Herein, we introduce a robust and simple method,
   namely gel aspiration-ejection (GAE), to engineer 3D, anisotropic, cell
   seeded, injectable dense collagen (I-DC) gels with controllable
   fibrillar densities, without the use of crosslinking. GAE allows for the
   hybridization of collagen gels with bioactive agents for increased
   functionality and supports highly aligned homogenous cell seeding, thus
   providing I-DC gels with distinct properties when compared to isotropic
   DC gels of random fibrillar orientation. The hybridization of I-DC with
   anionic fibroin derived polypeptides resulted in the nucleation of
   carbonated hydroxyapatite within the aligned nanofibrillar network upon
   exposure to simulated body fluid, yielding a 3D, anisotropic,
   mineralized collagen matrix. In addition, I-DC gels accelerated the
   osteoblastic differentiation of seeded murine mesenchymal stem cells
   (m-MSCs) when exposed to osteogenic supplements, which resulted in the
   cell-mediated, bulk mineralization of the osteoid-like gels. In
   addition, and upon exposure to neuronal transdifferentiation medium,
   I-DC gels supported and accelerated the differentiation of m-MSCs toward
   neuronal cells. In conclusion, collagen GAE presents interesting
   opportunities in a number of fields spanning tissue engineering and
   regenerative medicine to drug and cell delivery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that intrafibrillar, homogenous collagen
   biomineralization can be achieved by controlling self-assembly under
   mildly alkaline conditions. Using dense collagen (DC) gels as an osteoid
   model, we modulated their fibrillogenesis environment to evaluate the
   effects of fibrillogenesis pH on the protein charge distribution and
   ultimately on biomineralization. Cationic and anionic dye staining and
   electron cryomicroscopy analyses established that fibrillogenesis under
   mildly alkaline conditions promotes the formation of electronegative
   charges within the protein (anionic DC gels). These charges are stable
   upon titration of the gel pH to physiological values. Subsequent
   exposure of anionic DC gels to simulated body fluid induced the
   intrafibrillar biomineralization of the gels, promoting a rapid,
   extensive formation of carbonated hydroxyapatite, and strongly impacting
   gel mechanical properties. The generality and significance of this
   approach has been addressed by implanting freshly made anionic DC gels
   in vivo, in a rat subcutaneous model. Subcutaneous implants showed an
   extensive, homogenous biomineralization as early as at day 7, indicating
   that anionic collagen gels rapidly self-mineralize upon contact with
   body fluids in a non-osseous implantation site. The control of collagen
   fibrillogenesis pH provides not only new interpretations to what has
   been called the collagen mineralization enigma by demonstrating that
   neat collagen can intrafibrilarly self-mineralize, but it will also set
   a new starting point for the use of DC gels in bone regenerative
   medicine, in addition as potential applications as mineralized tissue
   model or as slow-release delivery carriers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Genipin-crosslinked catechol-chitosan mucoadhesive hydrogels for buccal
   drug delivery}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{395-404}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Drug administration via buccal mucosa is an attractive drug delivery
   strategy due to good patient compliance, prolonged localized drug
   effect, and avoidance of gastrointestinal drug metabolism and first-pass
   elimination. Buccal drug delivery systems need to maintain an intimate
   contact with the mucosa lining in the wet conditions of the oral cavity
   for long enough to allow drug release and absorption. For decades,
   mucoadhesive polymers such as chitosan (CS) and its derivatives have
   been explored to achieve this. In this study, inspired by the excellent
   wet adhesion of marine mussel adhesive protein, we developed a buccal
   drug delivery system using a novel catechol-functionalized CS (Cat-CS)
   hydrogel. We covalently bonded catechol functional groups to the
   backbone of CS, and crosslinked the polymer with a non-toxic crosslinker
   genipin (GP). We achieved two degrees of catechol conjugation (9\% and
   19\%), forming Cat9-CS/GP and Cat19-CS/GP hydrogels, respectively. We
   confirmed covalent bond formation during the catechol functionalization
   and GP crosslinking during the gel formation. The gelation time and the
   mechanical properties of Cat-CS hydrogels are similar to those of CS
   only hydrogels. Catechol groups significantly enhanced mucoadhesion in
   vitro (7 out of the 10 Cat19-CS hydrogels were still in contact with
   porcine mucosal membrane after 6 h, whereas all of the CS hydrogels lost
   contact after 1.5 h). The new hydrogel systems sustained the release of
   lidocaine for about 3 h. In-vivo, we compared buccal patches made of
   Cat19-CS/GP and CS/GP adhered to rabbit buccal mucosa. We were able to
   detect lidocaine in the rabbit's serum at concentration about 1 ng/ml
   only from the Cat19-CS patch, most likely due to the intimate contact
   provided by mucoadhesive Cat19-CS/GP systems. No inflammation was
   observed on the buccal tissue in contact with any of the patches tested.
   These results show that the proposed catechol-modified CS hydrogel is a
   promising mucoadhesive and biocompatible hydrogel system for buccal drug
   delivery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of alternative micromechanical models
   on the macroscopic behavior of a functionally graded plate based on
   classical and shear-deformation plate theories. Several micromechanical
   models are tested to obtain the effective material properties of a
   two-phase particle composite as a function of the volume fraction of
   particles which continuously varies through the thickness of a
   functionally graded plate. The static, buckling, and free- and
   forced-vibration analyses are conducted for a simply-supported
   functionally graded plate resting on a Pasternak-type elastic
   foundation. The volume fraction of particles are assumed to change
   according to the power-law, Sigmoid, and exponential functions. The
   governing partial differential equations are solved in the spatial
   coordinate by Navier solution, while a numerical time integration
   technique is employed to treat the problem in the time domain. Finally,
   the numerical results are provided to reveal the effect of explicit
   micromechanical models such as Voigt, Reuss, Hashin-Shtrikman bounds,
   and LRVE as well as the semi-explicit model of self-consistent on the
   static and dynamic displacement and stress fields, critical buckling

Abstract = {{In this paper, the nonlinear dynamics of a microplate is investigated
   based on the modified couple stress theory. The von Karman plate theory
   is employed to model the system by retaining in-plane displacements and
   inertia. The equations of motion are derived via an energy method based
   on the Lagrange equations, yielding a set of second-order nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations with coupled terms. These equations are
   recast into a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential
   equations and the resulting equations are solved by means of the
   pseudo-arclength continuation technique. The nonlinear dynamics is
   examined through plotting the frequency-response and force-response
   curves of the system. The influence of system parameters on the resonant
   responses is highlighted. The differences in the response amplitude of
   the system modelled based on the modified couple stress theory and the
   classical one are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{3560-3566}},
Abstract = {{Experimental studies reveal that softwoods exhibit different swelling
   patterns at the cellular scale depending on the position of the tracheid
   cells within the growth ring. Thin-walled earlywood cells show
   anisotropic swelling behavior while the swelling of thick-walled bulky
   latewood cells is generally isotropic. A poromechanical model is
   developed to explore the anisotropic swelling behavior of softwoods at
   the cellular scale. The general description for the macroscopically
   observable free swelling strain of cellular tissues is derived by
   upscaling the constitutive equations of a double porosity medium which
   is found to be dependent on stiffness, Biot coefficient, Biot modulus
   and the geometry of the cells. The effective poroelastic constants of
   earlywood and latewood cells are computed from a periodic honeycomb unit
   cell by means of an efficient finite-element-based computational
   upscaling scheme. The estimated swelling coefficients compare well with
   experimental measurements. It is found that the anisotropy in swelling
   behavior of wood cells can be related to the anisotropy of elastic
   properties at the cell wall level and the geometry of the cells. The
   proposed poromechanical model provides a physically relevant description
   of swelling behavior which originates from the coupled interaction of
   water and solid phases within the porous cell walls of softwoods.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical reduction of CO2 in an aqueous electrolyte (Briton
   Robinson buffer, pH=5.82) was investigated using an Ir/Ru-oxide coating
   deposited on a titanium substrate, as a function of electrode potential
   and temperature. The results demonstrated that the Ir/Ru-oxide electrode
   can efficiently be used for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into
   different valuable organic molecules at high faradaic efficiency, 85\%
   and 96\% at 295K and 277K, respectively. Ethanol was found to be the
   major electrochemical reduction product remained in the liquid phase,
   with a minor contribution of methanol, acetone and acetaldehyde. The
   amount of formed products and the corresponding faradaic efficiency were
   found to be strongly dependent on electrode potential. A maximum in both
   was obtained at -1.7V (vs. MSE). At this potential, lowering the
   reaction temperature from 295K to 277K was found to increase the CO2

Abstract = {{A parametric study for post-buckling analysis of an axially moving beam
   is conducted considering four different axial speeds in the
   supercritical regime. At critical speed, the trivial equilibrium
   configuration of this conservative system becomes unstable and the
   system diverges to a new non-trivial equilibrium configuration via a
   pitchfork bifurcation. Post-buckling analysis is conducted considering
   the system undergoing a transverse harmonic excitation. In order to
   obtain the equations of motion about the buckled state, first the
   equation of motion about the trivial equilibrium position is obtained
   and then transformed to the new coordinate, i.e. post-buckling
   configuration. The equations are then discretized using the Galerkin
   scheme, resulting in a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations.
   Using direct time integration, the global dynamics of the system is
   obtained and shown by means of bifurcation diagrams of Poincare maps.
   Other plots such as time traces, phase-plane diagrams, and Poincare
   sections are also presented to analyze the dynamics more precisely.}},

Abstract = {{Dark-Field (DF) images were acquired in the scanning electron microscope
   with an offline procedure based on electron backscatter diffraction
   (EBSD) patterns (EBSPs). These EBSD-DF images were generated by
   selecting a particular reflection on the electron backscatter
   diffraction pattern and by reporting the intensity of one or several
   pixels around this point at each pixel of the EBSD-DF image. Unlike
   previous studies, the diffraction information of the sample is the basis
   of the final image contrast with a pixel scale resolution at the EBSP
   providing DF imaging in the scanning electron microscope. The offline
   facility of this technique permits the selection of any diffraction
   condition available in the diffraction pattern and displaying the
   corresponding image. The high number of diffraction-based images
   available allows a better monitoring of deformation structures compared
   to electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) which is generally
   limited to a few images of the same area This technique was applied to
   steel and iron specimens and showed its high capability in describing
   more rigorously the deformation structures around micro-hardness
   indents. Due to the offline relation between the reference EBSP and the
   EBSD-DF images, this new technique will undoubtedly greatly improve our
   knowledge of deformation mechanism and help to improve our understanding
   of the ECU contrast mechanisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Reliable spectrum sensing is required to enable the effective use of
   Cognitive Radio (CR) networks. In practice, CRs not only have to cope
   with impulsive noises but also need to consider noise uncertainties.
   Small uncertainties of noise parameters are inevitable in any practical
   detector and the impact of these must be considered. This paper
   considers the energy detector based spectrum sensing under Middleton
   Class A noise with parameter uncertainties. Firstly, we show how
   analytical expressions of the probabilities of detection and false alarm
   can be derived. Secondly, we show that the mismatch of impulsive
   parameters A and Gamma have little impact on performance and can thus
   generally be ignored but the uncertainty of noise power sigma(2)(Z) can
   induce SNR Walls to the detector, which means that, no matter how many
   observations are obtained, the detector cannot robustly detect the
   primary signal. These results have implications for designing an
   enhanced energy detector for robust spectrum sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Agile UAVs is a special class of fixed-wing aircraft characterized by
   high thrust-to-weight ratios (around 2 to 3) and big control surfaces
   (around 40 to 50\% chord) with deflections as large as 50 degrees; and
   hence capable of extreme maneuvers and aerobatics. The intent of this
   paper is to model the aerodynamics of agile UAVs for real-time
   applications such as pilot-in-loop aircraft simulation, accounting for
   the unique geometry of the aerodynamic/control surfaces, high angles of
   attack encountered during maneuvers and aerobatics, and also unforeseen
   changes in the aerodynamics in the event of a crash/accident.
   Conventional modeling techniques, such as the stability derivatives
   approach, are not suitable due to the highly nonlinear nature of the
   aerodynamics and in particular because of the strong coupling of the
   aircraft states. Hence in the present work, a component breakdown
   approach is utilized to model agile UAV aerodynamics for the complete
   angle of attack range. Simplifications have made in the model to retain
   realtime functionality without losing much accuracy. For the purpose of
   validation, wind-tunnel testing is done for different angle of attack
   conditions including completely reversed flow. A good agreement between
   the simulation and experiments establishes the validity of the proposed
   approach and the aerodynamics model, with max. rms errors of similar to
   0.15 N and 0.05 N. m in aerodynamic forces and moments.}},

   problem under uncertainty}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY \& RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{334+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a decision-making tool
   on where to send mining parcels extracted in such a way as to minimize
   losses arising from mis-classification. The problem is complicated
   because actual values of mining parcels cannot be known and the decision
   is made on the basis of the estimation/simulations of the parcels
   generated from sparse data.
   Design/methodology/approach - The loss minimization associated with
   mis-classification is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem
   and solved by successive mixed integer programming. By assigning
   reasonable values to some variables making problem non-linear, the
   problem is converted to a mixed integer programming (MIP) and is solved
   by a standard MIP optimization engine.
   Findings - A case study was conducted to see the performance of the
   proposed approach on a deposit with gold and silver variables. The
   proposed approach was also compared with conventional grade control
   approaches. The results showed that the approach proposed could be used
   for solving grade quality control problem.
   Practical implications - Grade quality control problem is well-known
   problem and there is no effective solution approach. This paper proposes
   to solve the problem through standard operation research software. As
   such, mine planner and engineers have a means to deal with grade quality
   problem in mining operations.
   Originality/value - The paper formulates multi-variable grade quality
   control problem as an optimization problem on the contrary to previous
   one-shot approaches. This can increase profit and operation efficiency.
   The research also use target grades rather than cut-off grade posing
   problems in mining operations.}},

Abstract = {{The City of Montreal initiated a First Strategic Plan for Sustainable
   Development in 2005 followed by a Community and Corporate Sustainable
   Development Plan in 2010-2015. This study proposes a sustainable urban
   development indicator (SUDI) for each Montreal Urban Community (MUC) to
   evaluate the achievements of sustainable development plans. This study
   identifies thirty-two variables as the attributes of sustainable urban
   development. The multivariate technique and Exploratory Spatial Data
   Analysis are applied to determine the spatial pattern of SUDI for each
   MUC. The spatial pattern of SUDI identifies that Ville Marie, Verdun,
   Sud-Ouest, Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Plateau Mont-Royal have
   strong sustainable development. The findings of this study help the City
   of Montreal to understand the improvement of the sustainable development
   plans for Montreal city and to distribute the municipal budget for the
   community benefits accordingly.}},

Title = {{A paper-based microfluidic biosensor integrating zinc oxide nanowires
   for electrochemical glucose detection}},
Journal = {{MICROSYSTEMS \& NANOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports an electrochemical microfluidic paper-based
   analytical device (E mu PAD) for glucose detection, featuring a highly
   sensitive working electrode (WE) decorated with zinc oxide nanowires
   (ZnO NWs). In addition to the common features of mu PADs, such as their
   low costs, high portability/disposability, and ease of operation, the
   reported E mu PAD has three further advantages. (i) It provides higher
   sensitivity and a lower limit of detection (LOD) than previously
   reported mu PADs because of the high surface-to-volume ratio and high
   enzyme-capturing efficiency of the ZnO NWs. (ii) It does not need any
   light-sensitive electron mediator (as is usually required in enzymatic
   glucose sensing), which leads to enhanced biosensing stability. (iii)
   The ZnO NWs are directly synthesized on the paper substrate via
   low-temperature hydrothermal growth, representing a simple, low-cost,
   consistent, and mass-producible process. To achieve superior analytical
   performance, the on-chip stored enzyme (glucose oxidase) dose and the
   assay incubation time are tuned. More importantly, the critical design
   parameters of the E mu PAD, including the WE area and the ZnO-NW growth
   level, are adjusted to yield tunable ranges for the assay sensitivity
   and LOD. The highest sensitivity that we have achieved is 8.24 mu A
   center dot mM(-1)center dot cm(-2), with a corresponding LOD of 59.5 mu
   M. By choosing the right combination of design parameters, we
   constructed E mu PADs that cover the range of clinically relevant
   glucose concentrations (0-15 mM) and fully calibrated these devices
   using spiked phosphate-buffered saline and human serum. We believe that
   the reported approach for integrating ZnO NWs on E mu PADs could be well
   utilized in many other designs of E mu PADs and provides a facile and
   inexpensive paradigm for further enhancing the device performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the finite element method is used for choosing the best
   position of nearby collocated pairs of actuator-sensor couples, an
   experimental investigation of active vibration control validates the
   theory; the application regards a rectangular sandwich laminated plate
   (carbon-epoxy outer skins and Nomex paper honeycomb core) with free
   boundary conditions. The piezoelectric unidirectional patches are used
   as strain sensors and strain actuators, respectively. The collocation of
   the patches is led by the results of a finite element modal analysis and
   allows the design of a modal control strategy, the efficiency of which
   is targeted to single vibration modes. The control configurations
   presented in this paper is a MIMO configuration in linear field. The
   identification activity and the extraction of stabilised transfer
   functions are performed by means of a dedicated Matlab algorithm. The
   stability and the robustness of the algorithm are briefly studied. A
   substantial reduction of the vibration amplitude is obtained both at
   specific frequencies and in a broadband random excitation-disturbance.
   It is also possible to control disturbances that would otherwise trigger
   geometrically nonlinear vibrations. The modal character of the resulting
   control is guaranteed by means of the MAC. An experimental setup has
   been developed, two to four Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) actuators and
   two MFC sensors are used in conjunction with a DSPACE controller system.
   The control appears robust and efficient in reducing vibration levels in
   linear and nonlinear field, even though the structure under
   investigation exhibits a high modal density, four resonances in a range
   of about 100Hz, and allows controlling each resonance separately or
   together.}},

Abstract = {{Rigid-body pose estimation is a recurrent problem that arises in many
   application areas, such as robotics, rehabilitation and assembly. As
   such, the problem has been the subject of intensive research, and it
   still is. The motivation behind the procedure reported here is the
   calibration of a spherical parallel manipulator, the Agile Wrist,
   intended to be used as the pitch-roll-yaw joystick of a haptic device.
   The procedure is based on redundant measurements, to filter measurement
   noise, and polar-decomposition filtering, to extract the orthogonal
   factor of a still-noisy estimate. The measurement system is a binocular
   camera. The reported results show an acceptable performance of both the
   data-acquisition system and the computational procedure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an efficient heuristic solution approach is applied and
   tested to the stochastic mine production scheduling of a relatively
   large gold deposit containing about 120 thousand blocks and considering
   a set of 15 geological scenarios generated stochastically. The case
   study addresses multiple processing streams and a `grade' stockpile,
   which adds flexibility to the specific operation by advancing the
   processing of highly valuable material. The solution approach first
   generates an initial feasible solution by sequentially solving the
   stochastic open-pit mine production scheduling (OPMPS) period by period,
   and then a network-flow algorithm is used to sequentially search for
   improvements. In this network graph, the nodes identify candidate blocks
   that might have their extraction postponed or advanced, aiming for new
   schedules with higher value and lower risks. The results show that
   production schedules with low deviations from production expectations
   can be generated in a reasonable time for an actual mining environment.}},

Abstract = {{Downscaling methods have been proposed for establishing the linkages
   between the large-scale climate variables given by GCMs and the observed
   characteristics of hydrologic variables at a local site. These
   downscaling methods, however, are not suitable for dealing with cases
   where the hydrologic data at the location of interest are limited (a
   partially-gauged site) or not available (an ungauged site). The
   downscaling of a hydrologic process such as the daily precipitation for
   such cases remains still a crucial challenge for water resources
   planning and management in practice. The present study proposes
   therefore a statistical downscaling (SD) approach to establishing
   accurately the linkages between the climate variables given by GCM
   outputs and the ``estimated{''} daily precipitation characteristics at a
   location of interest where the precipitation data are limited or
   unavailable. More specifically, the suggested SD procedure is based on a
   combination of two components: (i) a regional stochastic method for
   reconstructing the unmeasured daily precipitation series at the ungauged
   site; and (ii) a SD model for describing the linkage between the
   constructed daily precipitation series and the climatic predictors given
   by GCM outputs. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed SD
   procedure was assessed based on the NCEP re-analysis and observed daily
   precipitation data available from a network of 62 raingages in South
   Korea. Results of this assessment have indicated that the proposed
   procedure could provide comparable results as those given by the
   downscaling using real observed precipitation data at the same local
   site.}},

Abstract = {{It is well accepted that the state of dispersion of carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) considerably influences the performance of epoxy nanocomposites.
   Previous studies suggest that CNTs might reagglomerate during the
   processing of epoxy nanocomposites. Shear forces, resin viscosity,
   thermal excitation, curing reaction, and CNTs concentration are among
   the main factors suggested to influence the dispersion stability. The
   present work focuses on understanding the important role of each
   parameter on the dispersion stability and explaining the mechanisms by
   which the dispersion evolves during processing. In this regard, an
   in-situ dispersion monitoring technique was utilized to acquire
   dispersion micrographs from the sample of interest during a given
   heating profile. The results were supported by the rheological and
   contact angle measurements. It was found out that the increased mobility
   of CNTs in conjunction with the ineffective interfacial interaction
   between the nanotubes and resin was the main reason for the degradation
   of dispersion during the curing process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Iron particle impurities of HiPCO (R) single-walled carbon nanotubes
   (SWCNTs) are treated as undesirable moieties and considerable times and
   efforts is allocated towards research and development to reduce their
   amount in HiPCO (R) SWCNTs. Taking advantage of this impurity, 3D
   nanostructured scaffolds are built via layer by layer (LBL) deposition
   of HiPCO (R) SWCNTs and magnetic nanoparticles which are retained via
   magnetic interaction with the iron particle impurities during the
   scaffold formation. The resulting scaffold has an inhomogeneous
   structure with large vacancies that can further be reinforced by
   electro-generation of a functional polymer film to enable the
   immobilization of bioreceptor units for biosensing. Magnetic
   nanoparticles of different sizes are used to adjust the pore sizes
   within the scaffolds in order to determine the optimal particle size for
   their application as highly sensitive immunosensors. Scaffolds made of
   the magnetic nanoparticles with in average 500 nm sizes led to a
   sensitivity of 88 mu A mu g(-1) mL cm(-2) equivalent to a detection
   limit of 10 ng mL(-1) for cholera antitoxin. This is by far the highest
   sensitivity for anti-CT immunosensors compared to amperometric

Abstract = {{N-(3-Methoxypropyl) acrylamide (MPAM) was polymerized by controlled
   radical polymerization (CRP) methods such as nitroxide-mediated
   polymerization (NMP) and reversible addition-fragmentation
   chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT). CRP was expected to yield
   well-defined polymers with sharp lower critical solution temperature
   (LCST) transitions. NMP with the BlocBuilder
   (2-({[}tert-butyl{[}1-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-2,2-dimethylpropyl]amino]oxy)
   -2-methylpropanoic acid) and SG1
   ({[}tert-butyl{[}1-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-2,2-dimethylpropyl]amino]
   oxidanyl) initiating system revealed low yields and lack of control
   (high dispersity, D approximate to 1.5-1.6, and inhibition of chain
   growth). However, RAFT was far more effective, with linear number
   average molecular weight, (Mn-n)over-bar, versus conversion, X, plots,
   low D approximate to 1.2-1.4 and the ability to form block copolymers
   using N,N-diethylacrylamide (DEAAM) as the second monomer. Poly(MPAM)
   (with (Mn-n)over-bar=13.7-25.3 kg mol(-1)) thermoresponsive behavior in
   aqueous media revealed cloud point temperatures (CPT)s between 73 and 92
   degrees C depending on solution concentration (ranging from 1 to 3 wt
   \%). The (Mn-n)over-bar and the molecular weight distribution were the
   key factors determining the CPT and the sharpness of the response,
   respectively. Poly(MPAM)-b-poly(DEAAM) block copolymer ((Mn-n)over-bar =
   22.3 kg mol(-1), D=1.41, molar composition F-DEAAM=0.38) revealed dual
   LCSTs with both segments revealing distinctive CPTs (at 75 and 37
   degrees C for poly(MPAM) and poly(DEAAM) blocks, respectively) by both
   UV-Vis and dynamic light scattering. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Volume = {{473}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In-plane gas permeability measurements were performed on electrospun
   polyacrilonitrile fibrous mats. Samples were cast onto a drum rotating
   at various speeds in order to create materials with different degrees of
   fiber alignment. Permeability measurements were made in both parallel
   and perpendicular directions and large increases were seen for flow in
   the fiber direction as expected. Because these measurements were
   performed in-plane it was necessary to mechanically compress the samples
   during measurement. Tests were performed at several compressed
   thicknesses, but it was found that the samples did not compress
   uniformly so it was not possible to determine a unique Carman-Kozeny
   constant for the material. A methodology was developed by which the
   Carman-Kozeny constant was determined for each compression that produced
   a linear trend against compressed porosity It was proposed that the true
   Carman-Kozeny constant for the material can be determined by
   extrapolating this trend to the value of the uncompressed porosity, and
   good agreement with the literature values was obtained. (C) 2014

Title = {{A novel concept for analysis and performance evaluation of wheeled
   rovers}},
Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{137-151}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The analysis, design, and operation planning of rovers are often based
   on predictive dynamic simulation, where the multibody model of the
   vehicle is combined with terramechanics relations for the representation
   of the wheel-ground interaction. There are, however, limitations in
   terramechanics models that prevent their use in parametric analysis and
   simulation studies. Increasing mobility is generally a primary objective
   for the design and operation of rovers. The models and assumptions used
   in the analysis phase should target this objective. In this paper we put
   forward a new concept for the analysis of wheeled rovers, particularly
   for applications in off-road environments on soft soil. We propose a
   novel view of the problem based on the development of models that are
   primarily intended to represent how parameter changes in the robot
   design can influence performance. These models allow for the definition
   of indicators, which gives information about the behavior of the system.
   We term such models observative. In the reported work, a set of
   indicators for rover performance is formulated using such models. The
   ability of these indicators to characterize the behavior of a rover is
   assessed with a series of simulation tests and experiments. The
   indicators defined using observative models succeeded to capture the
   changes in rover performance due to variations in the system parameters.
   Results show that the proposed models can provide a useful tool for the
   design and operation of planetary exploration rovers. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Finite element simulation of soil failure patterns under soil bin and

Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{157-170}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Finite element modeling (FEM) of soil physical behavior can provide
   information which is difficult or impossible to obtain experimentally.
   This method has been applied by many researchers to study soil
   compaction, acting forces on tools, stress distribution in soils and
   soil failure patterns. The great majority of studies that have
   investigated soil failure patterns have been limited to in-laboratory
   soil bins, with few tests being done under field conditions. However, it
   is difficult to simulate actual soil conditions in a soil bin. This
   study used FEM for the simulation of the soil failure patterns as linked
   to consistency limits and sticky point of soil, comparing the simulation
   results with soil failure patterns observed in the soil bin and in the
   field. Results showed that FEM is a useful tool to simulate soil failure
   patterns; however, simulation models correlated better with soil bin
   than with field test results. The results also showed the presence of a
   direct relationship between soil failure patterns and the consistency
   limits of the soil, both in the soil bin and in the field. However, soil
   bin results were not satisfactorily verified in the field, in particular
   as the failure patterns were also found to be affected by the roots of
   the stubbles in the field. It is concluded that FEM can provide accurate
   simulation of soil failure patterns under soil bin test conditions, but
   that soil bin results did not satisfactorily represent results from the
   field. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{153-161}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Lattice Boltzmann method was used to perform numerical simulations
   of the sound and turbulent flow inside a standing wave tube terminated
   by a circular orifice in presence of a forced mean flow. The
   computational domain comprised a standard virtual impedance tube
   apparatus in which sound waves were produced by periodic pressure
   oscillations imposed at one end. An orifice plate was located between
   the driver and the tube termination. All waves transmitted through the
   orifice were effectively dissipated by a passively non-reflecting (i.e.
   anechoic) boundary at the tube termination. A turbulent jet was formed
   at the discharge of the orifice by the forced mean flow inside the tube.
   The acoustic impedance and sound absorption coefficient of the orifice
   plate were calculated from a wave decomposition of the sound field
   upstream of the orifice. Simulations were carried out for different
   excitation frequencies, and orifice Mach numbers. Results and trends
   were in good quantitative agreement with available analytical solutions
   and experimental data. The Lattice Boltzmann method was found to be an
   efficient numerical scheme for prediction of sound absorption by
   realistic three dimensional orifice configurations. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Biomass combustion produces renewable energy, but generates hazardous
   ash that must be disposed. High-volume of fine ash from the biomass
   combustion could be a harmful pollutant which causes lung cancer.
   Recycling the ash in cement is an environmentally-friendly solution
   especially for the cement industry. The objectives of this paper were to
   (1) characterize the ash from switchgrass combustion in a lab-designed
   furnace and (2) evaluate the material properties of cement containing
   switchgrass combustion ash. Cement-ash blends tested in this study
   contained 10\% and 20\% of ground ash (by weight) and chemical
   accelerators (5\% Na2SO4 or 5\% CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O). Switchgrass
   combusted at 411 degrees C generated 5\% ash by weight. After grinding
   for 30 s, ground ash had a porous structure with 65.0 mu m of mean
   particle size and 41.2 m(2)/g of BET surface area. Ground ash consisted
   of 67.2\% of SiO2 and its structure contained 72.2\% of amorphous
   crystal. This ash was a good pozzolan in blended cement, and its
   pozzolanic activity was improved by adding chemical accelerators (5\%
   Na2SO4 and 5\% CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O were equally effective). Blended
   cement with 10\% ash and either 5\% Na2SO4 or 5\% CaCl2 center dot
   2H(2)O had similar material properties (strength and expansion
   resistance) as conventional Portland cement. Hence, recycling the
   switchgrass ash in the cement proved to be technically applicable. (C)

Title = {{Preferred orientations of laterally grown silicon films over amorphous

Abstract = {{A novel method has been optimized so that adhesion layers are no longer
   needed to reliably deposit patterned gold structures on amorphous
   substrates. Using this technique allows for the fabrication of amorphous
   oxide templates known as micro-crucibles, which confine a
   vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) catalyst of nominally pure gold to a specific
   geometry. Within these confined templates of amorphous materials,
   faceted silicon crystals have been grown laterally. The novel deposition
   technique, which enables the nominally pure gold catalyst, involves the
   undercutting of an initial chromium adhesion layer. Using electron
   backscatter diffraction it was found that silicon nucleated in these
   micro-crucibles were 30\% single crystals, 45\% potentially twinned
   crystals and 25\% polycrystals for the experimental conditions used.
   Single, potentially twinned, and polycrystals all had an aversion to
   growth with the \{1 0 0\} surface parallel to the amorphous substrate.
   Closer analysis of grain boundaries of potentially twinned and
   polycrystalline samples revealed that the overwhelming majority of them
   were of the 60 degrees Sigma 3 coherent twin boundary type. The large
   amount of coherent twin boundaries present in the grown, two-dimensional
   silicon crystals suggest that lateral VLS growth occurs very close to
   thermodynamic equilibrium. It is suggested that free energy fluctuations
   during growth or cooling, and impurities were the causes for this
   twinning. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic activity of LaNiO3 toward H2O2 reduction reaction (HPRR),
   with a potential application in the cathode side of fuel cells, is
   studied in alkaline, neutral and acidic solutions by rotating disk
   electrode. The LaNiO3 particles synthesised by citrate-based sol gel
   method have sizes between 30 and 70 nm with an active specific surface
   area of 1.26 +/- 0.05 m(2) g(-1). LaNiO3 shows high catalytic activity
   toward HPRR in 0.1 M KOH solution with an exchange current density based
   on the active surface area (j(OA)) of (7.4 +/- 1) x 10(-6) A cm(-2)
   which is noticeably higher than the j(OA) of N-doped graphene. The
   analysis of kinetic parameters suggests that the direct reduction of
   H2O2, H2O2 decomposition, O-2 reduction and O-2 desorption occur through
   HPRR on this catalyst. In order to control and minimize oxygen evolution
   from the electrode surface, the effects of catalyst loading, bulk
   concentration of H2O2, and using a mixture of LaNiO3 and N-doped
   graphene are studied. Although the mechanism of HPRR is independent of
   the aforementioned operating conditions, gas evolution decreases by
   increasing the catalyst loading, decreasing the bulk concentration of
   H2O2, and addition of N-doped graphene to LaNiO3. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{272}},

Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{It is widely believed that Li2S2 is one of the intermediate products of
   lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. However, contradicting proposals
   regarding the role and even the existence of Li2S2 in Li-S batteries
   persist. To address this, we have carried out first principles
   calculations of the energetic and electronic properties of Li2S2 based
   on the most promising structures found through an evolutionary
   algorithmic study. Our proposed Li2S2 structure(s) give a discharge
   voltage of 2.11 V for 2Li(+) + 2e(-) + Li2S2 -> 2Li(2)S, which matches
   the lower plateau of the experimental discharge profile of Li-S cells.
   Our results also show that Li2S2 is subject to spontaneous
   disproportionation. Together these results indicate that Li2S2 plays a
   key intermediate non-equilibrium role in the discharge of Li-S
   batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new type of paper-based piezoelectric touch pad
   integrating zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs), which can serve as user
   interfaces in paper-based electronics. The sensing functionality of
   these touch pads is enabled by the piezoelectric property of ZnO NWs
   grown on paper using a simple, cost-efficient hydrothermal method. A
   piece of ZnO-NW paper with two screen-printed silver electrodes forms a
   touch button, and touch-induced electric charges from the button are
   converted into a voltage output using a charge amplifier circuit. A
   touch pad consisting of an array of buttons can be readily integrated
   into paper-based electronic devices, allowing user input of information
   for various purposes such as programming, identification checking, and
   gaming. This novel design features ease of fabrication, low cost,
   ultrathin structure, and good compatibility with techniques in printed
   electronics, and further enriches the available technologies of

Title = {{Detection of abnormal resting-state networks in individual patients
   suffering from focal epilepsy: an initial step toward individual
   connectivity assessment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{The spatial coherence of spontaneous slow fluctuations in the
   blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal at rest is routinely used to
   characterize the underlying resting-state networks (RSNs). Studies have
   demonstrated that these patterns are organized in space and highly
   reproducible from subject to subject. Moreover, RSNs reorganizations
   have been suggested in pathological conditions. Comparisons of RSNs
   organization have been performed between groups of subjects but have
   rarely been applied at the individual level, a step required for
   clinical application. Defining the notion of modularity as the
   organization of brain activity in stable networks, we propose Detection
   of Abnormal Networks in Individuals (DANI) to identify modularity
   changes at the individual level. The stability of each RSN was estimated
   using a spatial clustering method: Bootstrap Analysis of Stable Clusters
   (BASC) (Bellect et al., 2010). Our contributions consisted in (i)
   providing functional maps of the most stable cores of each networks and
   (ii) in detecting ``abnormal{''} individual changes in networks
   organization when compared to a population of healthy controls. DANI was
   first evaluated using realistic simulated data, showing that focussing
   on a conservative core size (50\% most stable regions) improved the
   sensitivity to detect modularity changes. DANI was then applied to
   resting state fMRI data of six patients with focal epilepsy who
   underwent multimodal assessment using simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition
   followed by surgery. Only patient with a seizure free outcome were
   selected and the resected area was identified using a post-operative
   MRI. DANI automatically detected abnormal changes in 5 out of 6
   patients, with excellent sensitivity, showing for each of them at least
   one ``abnormal{''} lateralized network closely related to the epileptic
   focus. For each patient, we also detected some distant networks as
   abnormal, suggesting some remote reorganization in the epileptic brain.}},

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Nacre, bone and spider silk are staggered composites where inclusions of
   high aspect ratio reinforce a softer matrix. Such staggered composites
   have emerged through natural selection as the best configuration to
   produce stiffness, strength and toughness simultaneously. As a result,
   these remarkable materials are increasingly serving as model for
   synthetic composites with unusual and attractive performance. While
   several models have been developed to predict basic properties for
   biological and bio-inspired staggered composites, the designer is still
   left to struggle with finding optimum parameters. Unresolved issues
   include choosing optimum properties for inclusions and matrix, and
   resolving the contradictory effects of certain design variables. Here we
   overcome these difficulties with a multi-objective optimization for
   simultaneous high stiffness, strength and energy absorption in staggered
   composites. Our optimization scheme includes material properties for
   inclusions and matrix as design variables. This process reveals new
   guidelines, for example the staggered microstructure is only
   advantageous if the tablets are at least five times stronger than the
   interfaces, and only if high volume concentrations of tablets are used.
   We finally compile the results into a step-by-step optimization
   procedure which can be applied for the design of any type of
   high-performance staggered composite and at any length scale. The
   procedure produces optimum designs which are consistent with the
   materials and microstructure of natural nacre, confirming that this
   natural material is indeed optimized for mechanical performance. (C)

   reported SC bandwidth in As2Se3 microwires by a factor of 3.5. The
   microwire geometry and pumping conditions are the key parameters in
   generating the 3.3 mu m bandwidth while using a low pump pulse energy of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have investigated the effect of rolled-up nanotubes on
   the light extraction efficiency of GaN-based LEDs using two-dimensional
   finite element method simulation. The light extraction involves two
   successive steps, including the coupling from the light source to the
   tube and the subsequent emission from the tube to the air. Significantly
   enhanced light extraction efficiency is observed for both TE and TM
   waves by optimizing the nanotube geometry and dimension as well as the
   separation between the nanotube and light source. We have further shown
   that densely packed nanotube arrays can be integrated with GaN-based
   LEDs to achieve unequivocal improvement of light extraction efficiency
   over a large surface area. With recent advances in rolled-up micro- and
   nanotubes, it is expected that this study can offer a potentially
   flexible, low cost approach to enhance the light extraction of various

   Modeling results show that macrocell corrosion controls the
   localized/pitting corrosion process. Highly localized corrosion pattern
   may occur due to extremely large cathode/anode ratio. As corrosion front
   advances around reinforcement, macrocell corrosion may reduce
   drastically and pitting factor also decreases. Parametric study
   indicates that chloride diffusion significantly influences pitting
   factor while longitudinal cathode/anode ratio controls localized
   macrocell corrosion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of inlet flow
   pulsation on the mixing and reaction performance of a heterogeneous
   gaseous T-junction microreactor numerically. The idea is to have a novel
   modular microreactor design comprised of two microreactors (A and B),
   arranged in parallel, and a valve to control the flow direction. Flow
   pulsation can then be implemented to alternately supply reactant to
   microreactor A and microreactor B. Hence, by feeding the same amount of
   reactant and thus same pumping power/parasitic loads, the new design is
   able to run two microreactors and could achieve almost the same level of
   performance as that of a steady flow microreactor with an expense of one
   microreactor. The study was carried out for a case of mixing and
   heterogeneous catalytic reaction of methane (gaseous fuel) oxidation at
   the microreactor surface coated with a platinum catalyst. A detailed
   parametric study was performed to include the effect of frequency,
   amplitude, phase difference, and different waveforms on the conversion
   rate of gaseous fuel and pressure drop across the microreactor. The
   results suggest that the flow pulsation marginally affects the reaction
   performance, in which, the whole novel modular system produces almost
   double yields and energy (temperature) than that of conventional steady
   flow single microreactor design under the same amount of inlet
   reactants. This highlights the potential of this novel design in saving
   energy, enhancing reactants utilization, and increasing yield production
   for several applications.}},

   in women: a cross-over study}},
Journal = {{PARTICLE AND FIBRE TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Traffic-related air pollution may contribute to
   cardiovascular morbidity. In urban areas, exposures during physical
   activity are of interest owing to increased breathing rates and close
   proximity to vehicle emissions.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-over study among 53 healthy non-smoking
   women in Montreal, Canada during the summer of 2013. Women were exposed
   to traffic pollutants for 2-hours on three separate occasions during
   cycling on high and low-traffic routes as well as indoors. Personal air
   pollution exposures (PM2.5, ultrafine particles (UFP), black carbon,
   NO2, and O-3) were evaluated along each route and linear mixed-effects
   models with random subject intercepts were used to estimate the impact
   of air pollutants on acute changes in blood pressure, heart rate
   variability, and micro-vascular function in the hours immediately
   following exposure. Single and multi-pollutant models were examined and
   potential effect modification by mean regional air pollution
   concentrations (PM2.5, NO2, and O-3) was explored for the 24-hour and
   5-day periods preceding exposure.
   Results: In total, 143 exposure routes were completed. Each
   interquartile increase (10,850/cm(3)) in UFP exposure was associated
   with a 4.91\% (95\% CI: -9.31, -0.512) decrease in reactive hyperemia
   index (a measure of micro-vascular function) and each 24 ppb increase in
   O-3 exposure corresponded to a 2.49\% (95\% CI: 0.141, 4.84) increase in
   systolic blood pressure and a 3.26\% (95\% CI: 0.0117, 6.51) increase in
   diastolic blood pressure 3-hours after exposure. Personal exposure to
   PM2.5 was associated with decreases in HRV measures reflecting
   parasympathetic modulation of the heart and regional PM2.5
   concentrations modified these relationships (p < 0.05). In particular,
   stronger inverse associations were observed when regional PM2.5 was
   higher on the days prior to the study period. Regional PM2.5 also
   modified the impact of personal O-3 on the standard deviation of normal
   to normal intervals (SDNN) (p < 0.05): a significant inverse
   relationship was observed when regional PM2.5 was low prior to study
   periods and a significant positive relationship was observed when
   regional PM2.5 was high.
   Conclusion: Exposure to traffic pollution may contribute to acute
   changes in blood pressure, autonomic and micro-vascular function in
   women. Regional air pollution concentrations may modify the impact of
   these exposures on autonomic function.}},

Abstract = {{A generalization of the Euler-Plateau problem to account for the energy
   contribution due to twisting of the bounding loop is proposed.
   Euler-Lagrange equations are derived in a parametrized setting and a
   buckling analysis is performed. A pair of dimensionless parameters
   govern buckling from a flat, circular ground state. While one of these
   is familiar from the Euler-Plateau problem, the other encompasses
   information about the ratio of the torsional rigidity to the bending
   rigidity, the twist density and the size of the loop. For sufficiently
   small values of the latter parameter, two separate groups of buckling
   modes are identified. However, for values of that parameter exceeding
   the critical twist density arising in Michell's study of the stability
   of a twisted elastic ring, only one group of buckling modes exists.
   Buckling diagrams indicate that a loop with greater torsional rigidity
   shows more resistance to transverse buckling. Additionally, a twisted
   flexible loop spanned by a soap film buckles at a value of the twist
   density less that the value at which buckling would occur if the soap
   film were absent.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Understanding linkages between human well-being and ecological
   stewardship at the land-water nexus is needed in order to develop
   effective, equitable, and resilient institutions to govern watershed
   resources. In this paper, we argue that payments for ecosystem services
   (PES) plays a useful role for achieving integrated and adaptive water
   resource management, but only if attention is drawn to: (a) nested
   governance arrangements which reflect horizontal coordination across
   space according to the economic characteristics of watershed goods and
   services as well as hierarchical legitimacy between higher and lower
   levels of governance; (b) `payments' that are socially negotiated rather
   than designed according to oversimplified efficiency claims for
   watershed services and (c) `payments' that are well placed to overcome
   the individual, social and physical constraints associated with
   watershed goods and services so that capabilities or the freedom to do
   and be can be enhanced. This paper illustrates the impossibility of
   effectuating sheer market-based trades for regulating, cultural and
   supporting ecosystem services due to their inherent non-rival
   characteristics. Furthermore, a heuristic approach to characterising
   watershed goods and services clearly demarcates the extent to which PES
   can serve as an implementation tool for integrated and adaptive water
   resources management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Journal = {{2D MATERIALS}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Graphene and boron nitride (GPBN) heterostructures provide a viable way
   to realize tunable bandgap, promising new opportunities in
   graphene-based nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. In the present
   study, we investigated the interplay between vacancies and graphene/h-BN
   interfaces in monolayer GPBN heterostructures. The energetics and
   kinetics of monovacancies and divacancies in monolayer GPBN
   heterostructures were examined using first-principle calculations. The
   interfaces were shown to be preferential locations for vacancy
   segregation. Meanwhile the kinetics of vacancies was found to be
   noticeably modified at interfaces, evidenced by the minimum energy paths
   and associated migration barriers calculations. The role of interfacial
   bonding configurations, energy states and polarization on the formation
   and diffusion of vacancies were discussed. Additionally we demonstrated
   that it is important to recognize the dissimilarities in the diffusion
   prefactor for different vacancies for accurate determination of the
   vacancy diffusion coefficient. Our results provide essential data for
   the modeling of vacancies in GPBN heterostructures, and important
   insights towards the precise engineering of defects, interfaces and
   quantum domains in the design of GPBN-based devices.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Oral diseases, specifically dental caries and periodontal disease, are
   characterised by increases in pathogenic microorganisms, increased
   demineralisation and increased inflammation and levels of inflammatory
   markers. Despite the therapeutic strategies, oral diseases have elevated
   prevalence rates. Recent work has demonstrated that probiotic
   bio-therapeutics can decrease oral pathogen counts, including
   caries-causing Streptococcus mutans and oral inflammation. The aim of
   this work was to investigate putative probiotic bacteria, selected for
   S. mutans inhibition and for their oral health-promoting
   characteristics. The probiotic bacteria were screened for S. mutans
   inhibition, probiotic bacteriocin activity, salivary pH modulation,
   probiotic nutrient (sucrose) competition, probiotic co-aggregation with
   S. mutans, bacterial attachment to oral epithelial keratinocytes,
   bacterial nitric oxide production and bacterial antioxidant activity.
   The results indicate that Lactobacillus reuteri strains NCIMB 701359,
   NCIMB 701089, NCIMB 702655 and NCIMB 702656 inhibited S. mutans to
   non-detectable levels (<10 cfu/ml). L. reuteri strains also demonstrated
   the highest antioxidant capacity of the tested strains (7.73-13.99 mu M
   Trolox equivalents), suggesting their use as both caries and periodontal
   disease therapeutics. Although Lactobacillus fermentum NCIMB 5221
   inhibited S. mutans at lower levels, it significantly buffered the pH
   (4.18) of saliva containing S. mutans, co-aggregated with S. mutans
   (10.09\%), demonstrated high levels of sucrose consumption (138.11 mM)
   and successfully attached to gingival epithelial cells (11\%). This
   study identified four L. reuteri strains and one L. fermentum strain to
   be further investigated as oral disease biotherapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{Digital holographic microscopy is an ideal tool for investigation of
   microbial motility. However, most designs do not exhibit sufficient
   spatial resolution for imaging bacteria. In this study we present an
   off-axis Mach-Zehnder design of a holographic microscope with spatial
   resolution of better than 800 nm and the ability to resolve bacterial
   samples at varying densities over a 380 mu m x 380 mu m x 600 mu m
   three-dimensional field of view. Larger organisms, such as protozoa, can
   be resolved in detail, including cilia and flagella. The instrument
   design and performance are presented, including images and tracks of
   bacterial and protozoal mixed samples and pure cultures of six selected
   species. Organisms as small as 1 mu m (bacterial spores) and as large as
   60 mu m (Paramecium bursaria) may be resolved and tracked without
   changes in the instrument configuration. Finally, we present a dilution
   series investigating the maximum cell density that can be imaged, a type
   of analysis that has not been presented in previous holographic

Title = {{Wavelet-based multiscale performance analysis: An approach to assess and
   improve hydrological models}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The temporal dynamics of hydrological processes are spread across
   different time scales and, as such, the performance of hydrological
   models cannot be estimated reliably from global performance measures
   that assign a single number to the fit of a simulated time series to an
   observed reference series. Accordingly, it is important to analyze model
   performance at different time scales. Wavelets have been used
   extensively in the area of hydrological modeling for multiscale
   analysis, and have been shown to be very reliable and useful in
   understanding dynamics across time scales and as these evolve in time.
   In this paper, a wavelet-based multiscale performance measure for
   hydrological models is proposed and tested (i.e., Multiscale
   Nash-Sutcliffe Criteria and Multiscale Normalized Root Mean Square
   Error). The main advantage of this method is that it provides a
   quantitative measure of model performance across different time scales.
   In the proposed approach, model and observed time series are decomposed
   using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (known as the a trous wavelet
   transform), and performance measures of the model are obtained at each
   time scale. The applicability of the proposed method was explored using
   various case studies-both real as well as synthetic. The synthetic case
   studies included various kinds of errors (e.g., timing error, under and
   over prediction of high and low flows) in outputs from a hydrologic
   model. The real time case studies investigated in this study included
   simulation results of both the process-based Soil Water Assessment Tool
   (SWAT) model, as well as statistical models, namely the Coupled
   Wavelet-Volterra (WVC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Auto
   Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) methods. For the SWAT model, data from
   Wainganga and Sind Basin (India) were used, while for the Wavelet
   Volterra, ANN and ARMA models, data from the Cauvery River Basin (India)
   and Fraser River (Canada) were used. The study also explored the effect
   of the choice of the wavelets in multiscale model evaluation. It was
   found that the proposed wavelet-based performance measures, namely the
   MNSC (Multiscale Nash-Sutcliffe Criteria) and MNRMSE (Multiscale
   Normalized Root Mean Square Error), are a more reliable measure than
   traditional performance measures such as the Nash-Sutcliffe Criteria
   (NSC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Normalized Root Mean Square
   Error (NRMSE). Further, the proposed methodology can be used to: i)
   compare different hydrological models (both physical and statistical
   models), and ii) help in model calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable engineering design requires consideration of technical and
   ecosystem structures and processes. Even though the concepts of
   ecosystem services and natural infrastructure are maturing, their
   application in concrete engineering design is currently lacking due to
   their ambiguous definitions and a lack of methods that allow for the
   combined consideration of ecosystem and technical approaches in
   engineering design. This article proposes and discusses a new functional
   organization analysis (FOA) method for the comparative analysis and
   design of supply systems for basic needs (i.e., water, energy or food).
   This method allows for the analysis of the organization of system
   functions as well as underlying technical and ecosystem structures and
   associated processes. On this basis the method allows one to gather
   data, information, and knowledge about alternative system designs, and
   analyze their synergies. The theoretical and conceptual background of
   the proposed FOA method is presented, along with a case study regarding
   sustainable food supply systems in Southwestern Ontario. (C) 2014

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Geometrically non-linear static bending and forced vibrations of
   rectangular plates are studied allowing full non-linear terms associated
   with Green-Lagrange strain-displacement relations, second-order
   thickness stretching, third-order shear deformation and rotary inertia
   by using seven independent parameters to describe the shell kihematics.
   In particular, in addition to non-linearities in membrane and transverse
   deflection, non-linear terms associated with rotations and thickness
   deformation parameters are also included. In order to obtain the
   governing equations of motion, the three-dimensional constitutive
   equations are used, removing the assumption of zero transverse normal
   strain. The boundary conditions of the plate are assumed to be simply
   supported immovable and the equations of motion are derived by using a
   Lagrangian approach. The numerical solutions are obtained by using
   pseudo arc-length continuation and collocation scheme. In order to
   compare the non-linear static response, another analysis has also been
   carried out by using the finite element code ANSYS and three-dimensional
   solid modeling. Results reveal that the new theory with full geometric
   non-linearities provides significant accuracy improvement for rotational
   and thickness deformation parameters, and, unlike other shear
   deformation theories, predicts the correct thickness stretching along

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for semiblind
   channel estimation in amplify-and-forward two-way relay networks
   employing square QAM, assuming flat-fading channel conditions. The
   derived bound is exact as it is based on the true likelihood function
   that takes into account the statistics of the transmitted data symbols.
   Using the new bound, we show that exploiting even a limited number of
   transmitted data symbols in addition to the pilot symbols leads to
   substantial estimation accuracy improvements over conventional
   pilot-based estimation. We also propose a semiblind
   expectation-maximization-based estimation algorithm that performs very
   close to the exact CRB at an affordable computational cost. The superior
   accuracy of the semiblind approach makes it possible to significantly
   reduce the training overhead for channel estimation, thus offering a
   higher throughput and a better tradeoff between accuracy and spectral
   efficiency. We also derive the modified CRB, which approximates the
   exact CRB at high SNR for low modulation orders.}},

Abstract = {{Femtosecond laser micromachining has emerged in recent years as a new
   technique for micro/nano structure fabrication because of its
   applicability to virtually all kinds of materials in an easy one-step
   process that is scalable. In the past, much research on femtosecond
   laser micromachining was carried out to understand the complex ablation
   mechanism, whereas recent works are mostly concerned with the
   fabrication of surface structures because of their numerous possible
   applications. The state-of-the-art knowledge on the fabrication of these
   structures on metals with direct femtosecond laser micromachining is
   reviewed in this article. The effect of various parameters, such as
   fluence, number of pulses, laser beam polarization, wavelength, incident
   angle, scan velocity, number of scans, and environment, on the formation
   of different structures is discussed in detail wherever possible.
   Furthermore, a guideline for surface structures optimization is
   provided. The authors' experimental work on laser-inscribed regular
   pattern fabrication is presented to give a complete picture of
   micromachining processes. Finally, possible applications of
   laser-machined surface structures in different fields are briefly

Title = {{Speed limit reduction in urban areas: A before-after study using
   Bayesian generalized mixed linear models}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{252-261}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In fall 2009, a new speed limit of 40 km/h was introduced on local
   streets in Montreal (previous speed limit: 50 km/h). This paper proposes
   a methodology to efficiently estimate the effect of such reduction on
   speeding behaviors. We employ a full Bayes before-after approach, which
   overcomes the limitations of the empirical Bayes method. The proposed
   methodology allows for the analysis of speed data using hourly
   observations. Therefore, the entire daily profile of speed is
   considered. Furthermore, it accounts for the entire distribution of
   speed in contrast to the traditional approach of considering only a
   point estimate such as 85th percentile speed. Different reference speeds
   were used to examine variations in the treatment effectiveness in terms
   of speeding rate and frequency. In addition to comparing rates of
   vehicles exceeding reference speeds of 40 km/h and 50 km/h (speeding),
   we verified how the implemented treatment affected ``excessive
   speeding{''} behaviors (exceeding 80 km/h). To model operating speeds,
   two Bayesian generalized mixed linear models were utilized. These models
   have the advantage of addressing the heterogeneity problem in
   observations and efficiently capturing potential intra-site
   correlations. A variety of site characteristics, temporal variables, and
   environmental factors were considered. The analyses indicated that
   variables such as lane width and night hour had an increasing effect on
   speeding. Conversely, roadside parking had a decreasing effect on
   speeding. One-way and lane width had an increasing effect on excessive
   speeding, whereas evening hour had a decreasing effect. This study
   concluded that although the treatment was effective with respect to
   speed references of 40 km/h and 50 km/h, its effectiveness was not
   significant with respect to excessive speeding-which carries a great
   risk to pedestrians and cyclists in urban areas. Therefore, caution must
   be taken in drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of speed limit
   reduction. This study also points out the importance of using a
   comparison group to capture underlying trends caused by unknown factors.

Abstract = {{This paper presents algorithm, architecture, and fabrication results of
   a nonvolatile context-driven search engine that reduces energy
   consumption as well as computational delay compared to classical
   hardware and software-based approaches. The proposed architecture stores
   only associations between items from multiple search fields in the form
   of binary links, and merges repeated field items to reduce the memory
   requirements and accesses. The fabricated chip achieves memory reduction
   and 89\% energy saving compared to a classical field-based approach in
   hardware, based on content-addressable memory (CAM). Furthermore, it
   achieves reduced number of clock cycles in performing search operations
   compared to the CAM, and five orders of magnitude reduced number of
   clock cycles compared to a fabricated and measured ultra low-power
   CPU-based counterpart running a classical search algorithm in software.
   The energy consumption of the proposed architecture is on average three
   orders of magnitude smaller than that of a software-based approach. A
   magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)-based logic-in-memory architecture is
   presented that allows simple routing and eliminates leakage current in
   standby using 90 nm CMOS/MTJ-hybrid technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Installed in 2009, BIXI is the first major public bicycle-sharing system
   in Montreal, Canada. The BIXI system has been a success, accounting for
   more than one million trips annually. This success has increased the
   interest in exploring the factors affecting bicycle-sharing flows and
   usage. Using data compiled as minute-by-minute readings of bicycle
   availability at all the stations of the BIXI system between April and
   August 2012, this study contributes to the literature on
   bicycle-sharing. We examine the influence of meteorological data,
   temporal characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, land use and built
   environment attributes on arrival and departure flows at the station
   level using a multilevel approach to statistical modeling, which could
   easily be applied to other regions. The findings allow us to identify
   factors contributing to increased usage of bicycle-sharing in Montreal
   and to provide recommendations pertaining to station size and location
   decisions. The developed methodology and findings can be of benefit to
   city planners and engineers who are designing or modifying
   bicycle-sharing systems with the goal of maximizing usage and
   availability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Compromise Programming Based Model for Augmenting Food Production with
   Minimum Water Allocation in a Watershed: a Case Study in the Indian
   Himalayas}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A compromise programming based model has been developed for maximizing
   food production with minimum allocation of available water at watershed
   scale after meeting human, livestock and environmental needs under
   different scenarios. Agricultural water allocation in conjunction with
   available land resources under a set of constraints has been examined.
   The formulated model has the potential to analyze the implications of
   water availability on agricultural water allocation plans, and
   consequently food production. A case study in Indian Himalayan region,
   where despite abundant availability of water, rainfed agriculture is
   mostly practiced by majority of farmers with a primary objective of
   self-sufficiency in food production, well demonstrates the applicability
   of the developed model. Three distinct scenarios affecting water
   availability were considered. Analysis of imposition of fixed mandatory
   outflows of 20 to 70 \% (as per water source) for satisfying
   environmental needs with present production mix revealed water scarcity
   within the study watershed ranging from 4 to 66 \% across various
   quarters of an year, which necessitates optimum utilization of rainfed
   fallow land by allocating it to high value crops ginger and lentil (6 to
   32 times more than existing allocation) on one hand, and drastic
   reduction (76 to 100 \%) of area under all irrigated crops (except onion
   with 4-6 times increase) on the other, to achieve the conflicting
   objectives. The compromise plans also suggested increase (by 14 \% in
   environmental watershed scenario) or decrease (by 29 \% in degraded
   watershed scenario) in size of livestock population as per scenario
   based water availability. Overall, the compromise plans were successful
   in achieving a high percentage (> 93 \%) of ideal values of the
   objective functions, which were 155 to 170 \% of existing food
   production and 71 to 85 \% of existing water utilization across the
   scenarios. The proposed optimization model has the potential for
   application in identical agro-climatic settings to enhance food
   production in an environmental friendly manner.}},

Abstract = {{A general framework to combine the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
   and the finite-element time-domain (FETD) formulations, both based on
   the vector wave equation, is proposed. In contrast to the existing
   stable hybrid FETD-FDTD, there is no transition layer between two
   subdomains. In addition, the stability of the proposed approach is
   analytically proved. This framework allows combining different FDTD and
   FETD formulations together. Particularly, a fully unconditionally stable
   hybrid method is proposed, which is proved to be energy conservative
   too. The key ingredient is a finite-element tearing and interconnecting
   method for electromagnetic problems with a new interface condition that
   preserves the stability of the numerical method in each region. Several
   numerical examples are considered in order to validate the proposed
   methods. The numerical results match with the reference solutions very
   well in all cases.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Min-sum decoding is a low-complexity alternative to the so-called belief
   propagation and consists in simplification of the nonlinear operation on
   the log likelihood ratios (LLRs) in the check nodes. The resulting
   suboptimality may be tempered via appropriate scaling of the LLRs, e.g.,
   the fixed optimal scaling in the normalized min-sum algorithm, and
   variable scaling algorithms gradually appearing in the literature.
   However, up to now, none of the papers studied variable scaling both as
   per iteration and as per different check node degree, due to the
   prohibitive complexity of multioptimization over space of too many
   parameters. In this paper, we propose a generalized mutual information
   (GMI) of LLRs as the criterion to search for the scaling factors for
   different check node degrees in every iteration in a 1-D thus
   low-complexity manner. This approach is first analyzed via density
   evolution, and in addition can be extended to practical LLRs based
   formulas via Monte Carlo tools to cope with the mismatch issue. Bit
   error rate simulation results on two low-density parity-check codes show
   that our proposed GMI metrics have a noticeable gain over the variable
   scaling schemes that appeared in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of storage of minimal processed product is to increase the shelf
   life and thereby extend the period of availability of minimally
   processed produce. The silicone membrane makes use of the ability of
   polymer to permit selective passage of gases at different rates
   according to their physical and chemical properties. Here, the product
   stored maintains its own atmosphere by the combined effects of
   respiration process of the commodity and the diffusion rate through the
   membrane. A study was undertaken to enhance the shelf life of minimally
   processed multiplier onion with silicone membrane. The respiration
   activity was recorded at a temperature of 30 +/- 2 A degrees C (RH = 60
   \%) and 5 A +/- 1 A degrees C (RH = 90 \%). The respiration was found to
   be 23.4, 15.6, 10 mg CO(2)kg(-1)h(-1) at 5 A +/- 1 A degrees C and 140,
   110, 60 mg CO(2)kg(-1) h(-1) at 30 A +/- 2A degrees for the peeled,
   sliced and diced multiplier onion, respectively. The respiration rate
   for the fresh multiplier onion was recorded to be 5, 10 mg CO(2)kg(-1)
   h(-1) at 5 A +/- 1 A degrees C and 30 A +/- 1 A degrees C, respectively.
   Based on the shelf life studies and on the sensory evaluation, it was
   found that only the peeled multiplier onion could be stored. The sliced
   and diced multiplier onion did not have the required shelf life. The
   shelf life of the multiplier onion in the peel form could be increased
   from 4-5 days to 14 days by using the combined effect of silicone
   membrane (6 cm(2)/kg) and low temperature (5 A +/- 1 A degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{Attitude determination is one of the key technologies for Attitude
   Determination and Control System (ADCS) of a satellite. However, serious
   model errors may exist which will affect the estimation accuracy of
   ACDS, especially for a small satellite with low precision sensors. In
   this paper, a central difference predictive filter (CDPF) is proposed
   for attitude determination of small satellites with model errors and low
   precision sensors. The new filter is proposed by introducing the
   Stirling's polynomial interpolation formula to extend the traditional
   predictive filter (PF). It is shown that the proposed filter has higher
   accuracy for the estimation of system states than the traditional PF. It
   is known that the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has also been used in
   the ADCS of small satellites with low precision sensors. In order to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed filter, the UKF is also
   employed to compare it with the CDPF. Numerical simulations show that
   the proposed CDPF is more effective and robust in dealing with model
   errors and low precision sensors compared with the UKF or traditional
   PF. (C) 2014 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   each mine as a Markovian feedback control on the price process. The
   global solution is distributed on multiple mines by a policy iteration
   method, and this iterative method is shown to provide the unique

Abstract = {{Natural materials such as nacre, bone, collagen and spider silk boast
   unusual combinations of stiffness, strength and toughness. Behind this
   performance is a staggered microstructure, which consists of stiff and
   elongated inclusions embedded in a softer and more deformable matrix.
   The micromechanics of deformation and failure associated with this
   microstructure are now well understood at the ``unit cell{''} level, the
   smallest representative volume for this type of material. However, these
   mechanisms only translate to high performance if they propagate
   throughout large volumes, an important condition which is often
   overlooked. Here we present, for the first time, a model which captures
   the conditions for either spreading of deformations or localization,
   which determines whether a staggered composite is brittle or deformable
   at the macroscale. The macroscopic failure strain for the material was
   calculated as function of the viscoplastic properties of the interfaces
   and the severity of the defect. As expected, larger strains at failure
   can be achieved when smaller defects are present within the material, or
   with more strain hardening at the interface. The model also shows that
   strain rate hardening is a powerful source of large deformations for the
   material as well, a result we confirmed and validated with tensile
   experiments on glass-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nacre-like staggered
   composites. An important implication is that natural materials, largely
   made of rate-dependent materials, could rely on strain rate hardening to
   tolerate initial defects and damage to maintain their functionality.
   Strain rate hardening could also be harnessed and optimized in
   bio-inspired composites in order to maximize their overall performance.

Abstract = {{Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is a widely used plasticizer to render
   poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) soft and malleable. Plasticized PVC is used
   in hospital equipment, food wrapping, and numerous other commercial and
   industrial products. Unfortunately, plasticizers can migrate within the
   material and leach out of it over time, ending up in the environment
   and, frequently, the human body. DEHP has come under increased scrutiny
   as its breakdown products are believed to be endocrine disruptors and
   more toxic than DEHP itself. DEHP and its breakdown products have been
   identified as ubiquitous environmental contaminants, and daily human
   exposure is estimated to be in the microgram per kilogram level. The
   objective of this review is to summarize and comment on published
   sources of DEHP exposure and to give an overview of its environmental
   fate. Exposure through bottled water was examined specifically, as this
   concern is raised frequently, yet only little exposure to DEHP occurs
   through bottled water, and DEHP exposure is unlikely to stem from the
   packaging material itself. Packaged food was also examined and showed
   higher levels of DEHP contamination compared to bottled water. Exposure
   to DEHP also occurs in hospital environments, where DEHP leaches
   directly into liquids that passed through PVC/DEHP tubing and equipment.
   The latter exposure is at considerably higher levels compared to food
   and bottled water, specifically putting patients with chronic illnesses
   at risk. Overall, levels of DEHP in food and bottled water were below
   current tolerable daily intake (TDI) values. However, our understanding
   of the risks of DEHP exposure is still evolving. Given the prevalence of
   DEHP in our atmosphere and environment, and the uncertainty revolving
   around it, the precautionary principle would suggest its phaseout and
   replacement. Increased efforts to develop viable replacement compounds,
   which necessarily includes rigorous leaching, toxicity, and impact
   assessment studies, are needed before alternative plasticizers can be
   adopted as viable replacements.}},

Abstract = {{The phytochemical composition of leaves varies with the stages of growth
   of a plant. Hence, during this study, moisture content, total phenolic
   content, total monomeric anthocyanins and antioxidant activity in terms
   of DPPH inhibition activity and FRAP in highbush blueberry leaves of two
   different cultivars Nelson and Elliot, harvested in May, July, September
   and October, were analysed and quantified using microwave assisted
   extraction with a solvent combination of ethanol and citric acid. Colour
   indices for respective powdered leaf samples were also analysed. It was
   observed that leaves of both the cultivars had a high amount of total
   phenolics in October (for Nelson 152.356 +/- 3.369 and for Elliot
   155.830 +/- 2.103 mg GAE/g dry matter respectively). However, the
   blueberry leaves of the Nelson variety had the highest content of
   monomeric anthocyanins (1.202 +/- 0.080 M 3-G equiv./g dry matter). The
   DPPH inhibition activity and FRAP for Elliot leaves were much higher
   than the Nelson leaves collected during May, July and September.
   However, Nelson leaves collected in October had higher DPPH inhibition
   activity and FRAP than the Elliot leaves. Total phenolic contents of the
   leaves were found to be strongly correlated to both DPPH inhibition
   activity and FRAP. Also strong positive correlation was observed between
   colour index ``a{''} and total monomeric anthocyanin content, which
   implied an increase in redness of the leaves with an increase in the
   monomeric anthocyanin content which is experienced in the Fall season.

Abstract = {{AC electroporation of a single cell in a microchannel was numerically
   studied. A m diameter cell was considered in a microchannel m in height
   and the influences of AC electric pulse on its membrane were numerically
   investigated. The cell was assumed to be suspended between two
   electroporative electrodes embedded on the walls of a microchannel. An
   amplitude and a time span of applied electric pulse were chosen to be 80
   kV/m and s, respectively. For different frequency values (50, 100, 200,
   and 500 kHz), simulations were performed to show how the cell membrane
   was electroporated and the creation of nanopores. Obtained numerical
   results show that the most and the largest nanopores are created around
   poles of cell (nearest points of cell membrane to the electrodes). The
   numerical simulations also demonstrate that increased frequency will
   slightly decrease electroporated area of the cell membrane;
   additionally, growth of the created nanopores will be stabilized. It has
   also been proven that size and number of the created nanopores will be
   decreased by moving from the poles to the equator of the cell. There is
   almost no nanopore created in the vicinity of the equator. Frequency
   affects the rate of generation of nanopores. In case of AC
   electroporation, creation of nanopores has two phases that periodically
   repeat over time. In each period, the pore density sharply increases and
   then becomes constant. Enhancement of the frequency will result in
   decrease in time span of the periods. In each period, size of the
   created nanopores sharply increases and then slightly decreases.
   However, until the AC electric pulse is present, overall trends of
   creation and development of nanopores will be ascending. Variation of
   the size and number of created nanopores can be explained by considering
   time variation of transmembrane potential (difference of electric
   potential on two sides of cell membrane) which is clear in the results
   presented in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/Cloisite 30B (C30B) nanocomposites of
   different organoclay concentrations were prepared using a water-assisted
   extrusion process. The reduction of the molecular weight (M-w) of the
   PET matrix, caused by hydrolysis during water-assisted extrusion, was
   compensated by subsequent solid-state polymerization (SSP). Viscometry,
   titration, rheological, and dynamic scanning calorimetry measurements
   were used to analyze the samples from SSP. The weight-average molecular
   weight (M-w) of PET increased significantly through SSP. PET
   nanocomposites exhibited solid-like rheological behavior, and the
   complex viscosity at high frequencies was scaled with the M-w of PET.
   The Maron-Pierce model was used to evaluate the M-w of PET in the
   nanocomposites before and after SSP. It was found that the extent and
   the rate of the SSP reaction in nanocomposites were lower than those for
   the neat PETs, due to the barrier effect of clay platelets.
   Consequently, the SSP rate of PET increased with decreasing particle
   size for the neat PET and PET nanocomposites. The effect of the M-w of
   PET on the crystallization temperature, crystallinity, and the
   half-time, t(1/2), of nonisothermal crystallization was also
   investigated. With increasing M-w of PET, t(1/2) increased, whereas T-c
   and X-c decreased. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 54:2925-2937, 2014. (c) 2014

   biocrusts}},
Journal = {{AEOLIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{217-226}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biocrusts are critical components of desert ecosystems, significantly
   modifying the surfaces they occupy. Although the presence of fine soil
   particles is known to be conducive to biocrust development and recovery
   from disturbance, their influence on the inceptive development of
   biocrusts has not been empirically studied. In this study, the effect of
   substrate granulometry on the development of biocrusts was explored,
   under controlled laboratory conditions of light, soil humidity, and
   temperature. A cyanobacterial inoculum of Microcoleus vaginatus was
   applied to five sand fractions in the range of 1-2000 mu m. The results
   showed that the biocrusts developed more rapidly on the fine fraction
   (<125 mu m) than on the coarser fractions. While the biocrust cover on
   the fine fraction was spatially homogenous, it was patchy and
   discontinuous on the coarse fractions. The difference in the pore size
   between the different fractions is suggested to be the reason for these
   discrepancies in biocrust development, since large pores between the
   particles of coarse soil restrict and regulate the filaments' spreading.
   It was found that the spectroscopic indices, the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index and the Brightness Index, were more sensitive to the
   biocrust development than the bio-physiological parameters of the
   biocrusts (polysaccharides, protein, and chlorophyll contents). The
   faster biocrust development on the fine fractions can explain various
   biophysical phenomena in aeolian environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Core loss is a significant source of energy loss in electric motor steel
   laminates. Therefore, there is interest in monitoring the quality and
   consistency of laminates at various stages of manufacturing. The purpose
   of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using surface
   magnetic Barkhausen noise for the evaluation of AC core loss, and
   further, to examine potential origins of magnetic loss in non-oriented
   electrical steel. Core loss values were measured by a single sheet
   tester and Barkhausen noise measurements were performed using pole flux
   control on eight laminates with various grain size, texture and
   composition. Magnetocrystalline energy was calculated from X-ray
   diffraction data to quantify texture. Results demonstrated higher
   surface Barkhausen emissions for samples with lower core loss.
   Barkhausen noise analyses were used to examine the interplay among core
   loss, grain size, magnetocrystalline energy and B-H characteristics. The
   inverse correlation between core loss and Barkhausen noise emissions was
   qualitatively explained in terms of the orthogonal vector contribution
   of microscopic eddy currents to losses associated with bulk currents
   arising in the sample during magnetization.}},

Abstract = {{Seamless tubes of AZ31, AZ31 + 0.4, and 0.8 wt pctSr were extruded at
   elevated temperatures. By compressing pure copper inserts inside the
   tubes, the extruded tubes were expanded at room and elevated
   temperatures {[}373 K and 473 K (100 A degrees C and 200 A degrees C)].
   Microstructural examinations reveal the formation of twining in the
   as-extruded and expanded tubes. The amount of twinning decreased with
   increasing level of Sr in the expanded microstructures as a result of
   grain refinement and of decreasing Al in solution that facilitates
   dislocation motion. During expansion at room temperature, AZ31 shows
   higher elongation and lower strength than the alloys containing Sr. At
   473 K (200 A degrees C), compared to the lower temperatures, the Sr
   containing alloys exhibit lower flow stress and no fracture in the
   strain range investigated (40 pct reduction in cylinder height). The
   textures of the extruded alloys contain two main components named as RD
   (c-axis parallel to the radial direction) and HD (c-axis parallel to the
   hoop direction) based on their orientation with the sample coordinates.
   During expansion, extension twinning in the HD grains reorients the
   lattice to strengthen the RD and form a new ED (c-axis parallel to the
   extrusion direction) component. By increasing the temperature or level
   of Sr, the ED component is weakened due to the decrease in twinning.
   During expansion, the RD grains undergo contraction and double twining
   which reduce the overall texture strength.}},

Abstract = {{Precoding designs for bidirectional full-duplex (FD) systems have been
   proposed as potential ways to suppress the effects of self-interference
   and improve the spectral efficiency of wireless systems. This letter
   proposes the self-interference pricing based full-duplex precoding
   (FDP-SIP) algorithm that applies pricing-based precoding at the
   transmitter to suppress the self-interference prior to the receiver
   low-noise amplifier (LNA) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to avoid
   overloading while ensuring the receiver linearity. The proposed FDP-SIP
   algorithm can be implemented without the need of active cancellation at
   the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed FDP-SIP algorithm using both channel models and measured data.
   In particular, based on the measured data, FDP-SIP algorithm provides
   the sum-rate nearly 1.8 times that of an optimized half-duplex (HD).}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Using amorphous oxide templates known as micro-crucibles which confine a
   vapor-liquid-solid catalyst to a specific geometry, two-dimensional
   silicon thin-films of a single orientation have been grown laterally
   over an amorphous substrate and defects within crystals have been necked
   out. The vapor-liquid-solid catalysts consisted nominally of 99\% gold
   with 1\% titanium, chromium, or aluminum, and each alloy affected the
   processing of micro-crucibles and growth within them significantly. It
   was found that chromium additions inhibited the catalytic effect of the
   gold catalysts, titanium changed the morphology of the catalyst during
   processing and aluminum stabilized a potential third phase in the
   gold-silicon system upon cooling. Two mechanisms for growing undesired
   nanowires were identified both of which hindered the VLS film growth,
   fast silane cracking rates and poor gold etching, which left gold
   nanoparticles near the gold-vapor interface. To reduce the silane
   cracking rates, growth was done at a lower temperature while an
   engineered heat and deposition profile helped to reduce NWs caused by
   the second mechanism. Through experimenting with catalyst compositions,
   the fundamental mechanisms which produce concentration gradients across
   the gold-silicon alloy within a given micro-crucible have been proposed.
   Using the postulated mechanisms, micro-crucibles were designed which
   promote high-quality, single crystal growth of semiconductors.}},

Title = {{The role of shear deformation in laminated plates with curvilinear fiber
   paths and embedded defects}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{217-227}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) is an advanced technology used to
   manufacture laminated composites with curvilinear fiber paths. During
   the manufacturing, AFP generally leads to the formation of defects, e.g.
   gaps and overlaps, that impact the laminate properties, to an extent
   that largely depends on the geometry, such as thickness and curvature,
   of the part. This paper focuses on moderately-thick laminate plates that
   present gaps and overlaps induced by AFP. We use higher-order shear
   deformation theories to study the role of shear deformation on the plate
   responses. A hybrid Fourier-Galerkin method is used to obtain a
   semi-analytic solution describing the static deformation of the plate.
   Eigenvalue analysis is also conducted to determine its fundamental
   frequency and critical buckling load. The numeric results show that
   shear deformation has a more severe impact on the structural responses
   of a variable stiffness than a constant stiffness plate. We find also
   that gaps deteriorate the structural performance, while overlaps improve
   it. Maps representing structural responses, in particular buckling vs.
   deflection and frequency vs. deflection, are generated to gain insight
   into the design of a variable stiffness laminate plate with defects. (C)

Abstract = {{The 3-D numerically simulated steady state results of an industrial size
   vertical Direct Chill (DC) slab caster fitted with a
   metallic-foam-plated combo bag melt distributor for AA-1050 aluminum
   alloy are reported. The turbulence in the melt and the mushy region
   solidification of the alloy are modeled through the popular low Reynolds
   number kappa-epsilon model of Launder and Sharma and the
   enthalpy-porosity scheme, respectively. The transport of melt through
   the foam is modeled using the Brinkman Forch-heimer extended Darcy
   equation. The verification of the numerical model is performed by
   comparing the predicted and measured solidification front for AA-3104
   rolling ingot reported in the literature. The inlet melt superheat and
   the porosity of the metallic foam of the combo-bag were kept fixed at 32
   degrees C and 0.9, respectively. Parametric studies are carried out by
   varying two important parameters of the process, viz., the casting speed
   and the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) at the metal-mold contact
   region. Specifically, the casting speed and the HTC are varied from 40
   to 100 mm/min and from 750 to 3000 W/(m(2)-K), respectively. With the
   increase of the casting speed, the solidification process is delayed
   while the solid-shell thickness increased with the increase of the HTC.
   The predicted results are presented for the solid-shell thickness, the
   sump depth, the mushy thickness, the surface temperature as well as the
   non-dimensional turbulent viscosity contours. In addition the
   temperature fields and velocity profiles with streamlines are also

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study has been conducted to seek an optimized arrangement of
   steady and pulsating impinging multiple submerged slot jets. A composite
   design consisting of steady as well as intermittent (on/off) or
   sinusoidal jets in different combinations of four slot jets was
   simulated. Effect of large temperature differences between jets and the
   impingement surface was examined by considering fluid properties to be
   dependent on temperature. In addition, the effect of frequency, phase
   angle for both types of pulsation as well as amplitude of the sinusoidal
   pulsing jets was examined on the time-averaged local Nusselt number
   distribution on an isothermal planar target surface. Results indicate
   that the combination of pulsed jets with steady jets provide the most
   uniform and enhanced Nusselt number distribution for the array of four
   jets. Furthermore, due to the alternating pulsating flow patterns, an
   increase in the convective heat transfer is observed around a secondary
   stagnation point. Significantly higher heat transfer can be obtained by
   the combinations of intermittent-steady jets rather than the
   sinusoidal-steady ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

   periodic viscous flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{278}},
Pages = {{92-116}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{An implicit nonlinear Lower-Upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) solver
   has been extended to the adaptive Nonlinear Frequency Domain method
   (adaptive NLFD) for periodic viscous flows. The discretized equations
   are linearized in both spatial and temporal directions, yielding an
   innovative segregate approach, where the effects of the neighboring
   cells are transferred to the right-hand-side and are updated
   iteratively. This property of the solver is aligned with the adaptive
   NLFD concept, in which different cells have different number of modes;
   hence, should be treated individually. The segregate analysis of the
   modal equations prevents assembling and inversion of a large
   left-hand-side matrix, when high number of modes are involved. This is
   an important characteristic for a selected flow solver of the adaptive
   NLFD method, where a high modal content may be required in highly
   unsteady parts of the flow field. The implicit nonlinear LU-SGS solver
   has demonstrated to be both robust and computationally efficient as the
   number of modes is increased. The developed solver is thoroughly
   validated for the laminar vortex shedding behind a stationary cylinder,
   high angle of attack NACA0012 airfoil, and a plunging NACA0012 airfoil.
   An order of magnitude improvement in the computational time is observed
   through the developed implicit approach over the classical modified
   5-stage Runge-Kutta method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Batter coating and pre-drying have recently been used as techniques for
   decreasing fat content of fried foods. The objectives of this study were
   to assess the effect of batter formulations and pre-drying time on
   surface, penetrated and total fat content of batter coating, and to
   evaluate different mathematical models for predicting moisture
   diffusivity and oil transfer during frying. Two different sets of batter
   systems were used. The first set consisted of batter with different
   ratios of wheat to rice flour whereas the second set was
   wheat-flour-based batter with different pre-drying times. The batter
   samples were deep fried at 180 +/- 2 degrees C in canola oil for
   different frying times between 0 and 4 min. Batter with wheat flour
   alone was found to have higher surface fat and total fat contents, while
   its penetrated fat content was lower than that with other batters.
   Batter with no pre-drying showed higher surface, penetrated and total
   fat content than other systems. Moisture diffusivity ranged between 2.01
   x 10(-6) and 2.85 x 10(-6) m(2)/min. Page model was found as the best

Abstract = {{Ceramic-metal composites (cermets) offer unique combinations of hardness
   and toughness, which make them attractive for a variety of applications.
   In this study, we propose a new method for the preparation of the
   metal-sulfur precursor mixture based on the ability to melt-cast the
   precursor mixture. We have used self-propagating high-temperature
   synthesis to produce a chromium/chromium sulfide cermet, exploiting the
   fact that this mixture of metal and sulfur can support the propagation
   of reactive waves. This ability, together with the properties of the
   reaction products (low gas evolution and liquid sulfide products),
   enables the net-shape synthesis of dense, near theoretical density
   product with a relatively simple and low-cost set-up. While the
   thermochemical calculations predict near-zero gas production for the
   chromium-sulfur system, the actual cermets showed a large amount of
   porosity (about 70 \%), when synthesized at atmospheric pressure. The
   possible sources for porosity were identified, and the process improved
   to bring the porosity down to about 7 \%. We also investigated the
   physical properties of the produced cermet with optical microscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and
   X-ray diffraction techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we report the potential use of food waste such as grape
   skin, stalk and seeds obtained after grape processing to produce gold
   nanoparticles (AuNP). The gold nanoparticles were synthesized according
   to the rules of green chemistry and integrating the goals of green
   nanotechnology. Results from the present work establish that AuNP were
   synthesized in a single step method using water at room temperature. The
   growth of AuNP was instantaneous within 5 min and was found to be highly
   stabilized. Thus produced AuNP were characterized using UV-Vis
   spectrophotometer, high resolution transmission electron microscope
   (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The mean
   particle size for the green synthesized gold nanoparticles from grape
   waste ranged from 20 to 25 nm. Furthermore, a central composite design
   was used to determine the influences of the concentrations of catechin
   (0.5, 1, 1.5 mM) and HAuCl4 (0.5, 1, 1.5 mM), and of temperature (10,
   25, 45 degrees C) on the green synthesis of AuNP. Their interactions
   were determined by response surface methodology (RSM). (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the control of flexible-joint robotic manipulators while
   avoiding actuator saturation is investigated. Several proportional
   derivative controllers are developed, all of which disallow actuator
   saturation by guaranteeing that the applied torque is less than a
   specified maximum value. In particular, a Gibbs parameterization of the
   joint angles is included in the control laws, which allows for an
   increased control torque as compared to an Euler angle parameterization.
   An equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is proven to be
   asymptotically stable using the Lyapunov stability analysis. Moreover,
   the proposed control laws do not require any knowledge of the
   manipulator's mass, stiffness, or dissipation properties, and as such,
   are robust to modelling errors. The proposed controllers are tested on a
   single-link flexible-joint manipulator experimentally and on a two-link
   flexible-joint manipulator in simulation, and are compared to the
   performance of controllers found in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{320}},
Pages = {{455-465}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the influence of different gas environments on the
   fabrication of surfaces, homogeneously covered with equally sized and
   spaced micro-structures. Two types of structures have been successfully
   micro-machined with a femtosecond laser on titanium surfaces in various
   atmospheres. The surface chemistry of samples machined in oxygen and
   helium shows TiO2, while machining in nitrogen leads to an additional
   share of iN. The actual surface structure was found to vary
   significantly as a function of the gas environment. We found that the
   ablated particles and their surface triggered two consecutive events:
   The optical properties of the gas environment became non-isotropic which
   then led to the pulse intensity being redistributed throughout the cross
   section of the laser beam. Additionally, the effective intensity was
   further reduced for TiN surfaces due to TiN's high reflectivity. Thus,
   the settings for the applied raster-scanning machining method had to be
   adjusted for each gas environment to produce comparable structures. In
   contrast to previous studies, where only noble gases were found suitable
   to produce homogeneous patches, we obtained them in an oxygen
   environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bone cells are continuously exposed to mechanical deformations
   originating from movement. Mechanical stimulation at fundamental
   frequencies associated with most frequent normal locomotion (0.167-10
   Hz) has been reported to suppress differentiation of osteoclasts.
   However, the effects of very low frequency (0.01 Hz) stimulation (which
   could be a frequency component of normal movement and also relevant to
   locomotion of movement-impaired individuals) on osteoclasts are poorly
   understood. We examined differentiation of osteoclasts from mouse bone
   marrow precursors and RAW 264.7 monocytes cultured on an extendable
   silicone surface that was dynamically stretched at 0.01 Hz. Three
   stimulation regimes were applied: (i) continuously during 4 days of
   differentiation, (ii) non-continuously, 8 h/day for 4 days, and (iii)
   post-differentiation, when stimulation was applied for 24 h after
   osteoclasts were noted. Low frequency mechanical stimulation did not
   inhibit osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, the expression of osteoclast
   marker genes was upregulated in mechanically stimulated cells compared
   to static control. Conditioned medium collected from osteoclast cultures
   stimulated non-continuously or post-differentiation induced
   differentiation of osteoclast precursors plated in standard tissue
   culture plates. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
   phosphorylation was increased in mechanically-stimulated cultures
   compared to static control. Thus, low frequency mechanical stimulation
   has qualitatively different effects on osteoclast formation compared to
   stimulation associated with the fundamental frequencies of normal
   movement. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid crystal flexoelectric actuation uses an imposed electric field to
   create membrane bending, and it is used by the outer hair cells (OHCs)
   located in the inner ear, whose role is to amplify sound through
   generation of mechanical power. Oscillations in the OHC membranes create
   periodic viscoelastic flows in the contacting fluid media. A key
   objective of this work on flexoelectric actuation relevant to OHCs is to
   find the relations and impact of the electromechanical properties of the
   membrane, the rheological properties of the viscoelastic media, and the
   frequency response of the generated mechanical power output. The model
   developed and used in this work is based on the integration of: (i) the
   flexoelectric membrane shape equation applied to a circular membrane
   attached to the inner surface of a circular capillary and (ii) the
   coupled capillary flow of contacting viscoelastic phases, such that the
   membrane flexoelectric oscillations drive periodic viscoelastic
   capillary flows, as in OHCs. By applying the Fourier transform formalism
   to the governing equation, analytical expressions for the transfer
   function associated with the curvature and electrical field and for the
   power dissipation of elastic storage energy were found.}},

Abstract = {{This paper probes the nanoparticle (NP) interaction with hydrogels using
   electroacoustic spectroscopy at MHz frequencies. We measured dynamic
   electrophoretic mobility spectra of silica NPs in polyacrylamide gels
   for a variety of NP sizes and gel concentrations. The spectra are
   exquisitely sensitive to NP entrapment, size, and charge as well as to
   gel rheology and gelation kinetics. For NPs that are large compared to
   the gel mesh size, many of these influences can be quantified using
   electrokinetic theory, which furnishes the apparent NP zeta-potential
   and a complex gel shear modulus at MHz frequencies. The methodology
   provides new insights into the NPhydrogel interaction, since it
   noninvasively probes the nanostructure and the combined influences of
   particle and gel properties. Electroacoustic spectroscopy may therefore
   be a valuable new tool for characterizing soft nanocompositesone that
   complements other noninvasive methods, such as bulk rheometry and

Title = {{An adaptive spinal-like controller: tunable biomimetic behavior for a
   robotic limb}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Spinal-like regulators have recently been shown to support
   complex behavioral patterns during volitional goal-oriented reaching
   paradigms. We use an interpretation of the adaptive spinal-like
   controller as inspiration for the development of a controller for a
   robotic limb. It will be demonstrated that a simulated robot arm with
   linear actuators can achieve biological-like limb movements. In
   addition, it will be shown that programmability in the regulator enables
   independent spatial and temporal changes to be defined for movement
   tasks, downstream of central commands using sensory stimuli. The
   adaptive spinal-like controller is the first to demonstrate such
   behavior for complex motor behaviors in multi-joint limb movements.
   Methods: The controller is evaluated using a simulated robotic apparatus
   and three goal-oriented reaching paradigms: 1) shaping of trajectory
   profiles during reaching; 2) sensitivity of trajectories to sudden
   perturbations; 3) reaching to a moving target. The experiments were
   designed to highlight complex motor tasks that are omitted in earlier
   studies, and important for the development of improved artificial limb
   control.
   Results: In all three cases the controller was able to reach the targets
   without a priori planning of end-point or segmental motor trajectories.
   Instead, trajectory spatio-temporal dynamics evolve from properties of
   the controller architecture using the spatial error (vector distance to
   goal). Results show that curvature amplitude in hand trajectory paths
   are reduced by as much as 98\% using simple gain scaling techniques,
   while adaptive network behavior allows the regulator to successfully
   adapt to perturbations and track a moving target. An important
   observation for this study is that all motions resemble human-like
   movements with non-linear muscles and complex joint mechanics.
   Conclusions: The controller shows that it can adapt to various
   behavioral contexts which are not included in previous biomimetic
   studies. The research supplements an earlier study by examining the
   tunability of the spinal-like controller for complex reaching tasks.
   This work is a step toward building more robust controllers for powered
   artificial limbs.}},

Abstract = {{Tools to measure transmembrane-protein diffusion in lipid bilayer
   membranes have advanced in recent decades, providing a need for
   predictive theoretical models that account for interleaflet leaflet
   friction on tracer mobility. Here we address the fully three-dimensional
   flows driven by a (nonprotruding) transmembrane protein embedded in a
   dual-leaflet membrane that is supported above and below by soft porous
   supports (e.g., hydrogel or extracellular matrix), each of which has a
   prescribed permeability and solvent viscosity. For asymmetric
   configurations, i.e., supports with contrasting permeability, as
   realized for cells in contact with hydrogel scaffolds or culture media,
   the diffusion coefficient can reflect interleaflet friction. Reasonable
   approximations, for sufficiently large tracers on low-permeability
   supports, are furnished by a recent phenomenological theory from the
   literature. Interpreting literature data, albeit for hard-supported
   membranes, provides a theoretical basis for the phenomenological Stokes
   drag law as well as strengthening assertions that nonhydrodynamic
   interactions are important in supported bilayer systems, possibly
   leading to overestimates of the membrane/leaflet viscosity. Our theory
   provides a theoretical foundation for future experimental studies of
   tracer diffusion in gel-supported membranes.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of austenite deformation in non-recrystallization region
   on microstructural development in low-silicon content TRIP-assisted
   steels was investigated. Laboratory simulation of a typical
   thermomechanical control processing was carried out in an automated
   hot-compression testing machine. Specimens subjected to a typical
   multi-stage isothermal deformation/cooling program were deformed to true
   strains of 0, -0.15, -0.25 and -0.35 at various temperatures in
   austenite non-recrystallization region. Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a novel
   tint-etching method were used to investigate the microstructure of
   deformed specimens. The results indicated that the maximum volume
   fraction (V-RA) and carbon content (C-RA\%) of retained austenite can be
   obtained by deforming samples to some intermediate strains (epsilon
   =-0.15 for V-RA and epsilon=-0.25 for C-RA\%). However, further
   straining of samples to epsilon=-0.35 resulted in a drastic reduction of
   both parameters due to formation of pearlite. It was found that a
   decrease in deformation temperature resulted in increasing V-RA and
   C-RA\%. Moreover, deformation of austenite was associated with
   morphology changes in retained austenite particles from interlath
   film-like type in undeformed specimens to blocky and encapsulated types
   in the deformed specimens. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{294}},

Abstract = {{Undoped, mono and codoped TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared with Mo+6 and
   V+5 dopants using ultrasonic-assisted sol-gel method. XRD diffraction
   revealed that photocatalyst powders calcined at 550 degrees C are
   composed of anatase with minor brookite and rutile phases. Codoped
   powders showed largest red shift in the band gap and the decrease in
   photoluminescence intensity demonstrated that electrons holes
   recombination has decreased. Mo+6 and V+5 have been detected by XPS
   analysis indicating that the dopants Mo+6 and V+5 substitute for
   titanium (Ti+4) in the lattice of TiO2. The activity tests reveal that
   codoped (TMo0.125\textbackslash{}V-0.125) powder has the best
   photocatalytic performance in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye
   and antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) under UV and visible light
   irradiations. Briefly, the enhanced activity of codoped TiO2 is due to
   the synergistic effect of TiO2 polymorphs, the Mo+6 and V+5 energy
   levels and their d-d transition with TiO2 conduction band electrons,
   high specific surface area via small crystallite size, surface acidity,
   Ti+3 surface states and oxygen defects. The mechanistic study
   illustrates that the complex band structure of the codoped powders does
   not only improve visible light absorption and promote the separation of
   photoinduced electron hole pairs, but it also facilitates the enhanced
   formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) and superoxide anions
   (O-2(center dot-)). Degradation of methylene blue (MB) and
   sulfamethoxazole (SMX) showed pseudo first order kinetics. With MB
   experiments under UV irradiation a rate constant (k(app)) of 0.064
   min(-1) was obtained with TMo0.125V0.125 powder, which is higher than
   that of commercially available Degussa P25 (0.05 min(-1)) and twice as
   high than the undoped TiO2 (0.031 min(-1)). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{C-LiFePO4 positive electrode materials were prepared by hydrothermal
   synthesis in which the solution was stirred with a rotation frequency
   varying from 50 to 1150 revolutions per minute (rpm), before carbon

   compared in terms of structural, surface-morphological and
   electrochemical properties. The best C-LiFePO4 electrodes have been
   obtained using rotation frequencies in the range 280-360 rpm, in which
   case the capacity retention reaches similar to 137 mAh g(-1) at
   coulombic efficiency >99\% at C/12, against 106 mAh g(-1) in the absence
   of agitation. Better cycling stability at high current rates (1C) were
   also obtained. The improved performance of the C-LiFePO4 material
   obtained by controlled rotating agitation-hydrothermal solution
   synthesis is attributed to the production of less aggregated particles
   with high surface area and smaller concentrations of impurities. The
   controlled rotating agitation of the solution during the synthesis
   provides a scalable and eco-friendly way of producing better performing
   electrode particles for use in Li-ion batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Renewable alternative energy sources are required to decrease or

   produced by electrolysis has been identified as one such renewable
   energy carrier. In the current work, Ni nanoparticle (NP)-decorated
   multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrocatalyst cathodes are prepared
   by a simple two-step procedure. MWCNTs are grown on stainless steel
   meshes by thermal-chemical vapour deposition (t-CVD) and then decorated
   with Ni NPs by pulsed laser ablation (PLA). The morphological and
   electrochemical properties of the produced Ni NP/MWCNT cathodes were
   characterized through electron microscopy and linear Tafel polarization
   (LTP)/electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. SEM
   and TEM imaging revealed that the Ni NPs deposited by PLA are on the
   order of 4 nm in diameter with a narrow size distribution. The LTP
   measurements showed that the electrocatalytic activity of the Ni
   NP/MWCNT cathodes towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is
   dependent on PLA time and shows a maximum at t(PLA) = 40 min. EIS
   measurements revealed that the HER response is characterized by a two

   surface Au was heated to temperatures as high as 700 degrees C. The
   Fe2O3 support particle structure tended to reduce to Fe3O4 and formed
   surface terraces; the formation, coalescence, and mobility of 1- to 2-nm
   particles on the terraces were characterized in SE, STEM-ADF, and TEM-BF

Abstract = {{Extending the photoresponse from the ultraviolet (UV) to the visible
   light region, while maintaining a high photocatalytic activity has been
   an important challenge for TiO2. We demonstrate the use of
   transition-metal doping treatment as a facile and effective strategy to
   substantially improve the performance of TiO2 nanorods in the visible
   light region for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The effect
   of Fe, Mn and Co as dopants on the PEC performance of the TiO2 nanorods
   was investigated, wherein the Fe doping is the most effective route to
   enhance the photoactivity of TiO2. The photocurrent density of Fe-TiO2
   sample significantly increases with bias voltage and reaches 2.92 mA
   cm(-2) at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is five times higher than that of
   the undoped TiO2. Even under visible light illumination (>420 nm), the
   photocurrent density of Fe-TiO2 is as high as 0.96 mA cm(-2) at 0.25 V
   vs. Ag/AgCl. Incident-photon-to-current-conversion (IPCE) efficiency (up
   to similar to 18\%) measurements reveal that the Fe-TiO2 nanorod sample
   significantly improve the photoresponse not only in the UV region, but
   also in the visible light region. Fe doping not only enhances the
   visible light absorption of TiO2 nanorods by creating impurity states
   near the conduction band, but also obviously increases carrier density
   of TiO2, leading to effective carrier separation and transportation and
   relatively long electron lifetime. Because of their relatively high
   photocatalytic activity, the Fe-TiO2 nanorods can serve as a promising
   candidate in various areas, such as solar water splitting,
   dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Alkaloid-containing natural compounds have shown promise in the
   treatment of microbial infections. However, practical application of
   many of these compounds is pending a mechanistic understanding of their
   mode of action. We investigated the effect of two alkaloids, piperine
   (found in black pepper) and reserpine (found in Indian snakeroot), on
   the ability of the uropathogenic bacterium Escherichia coli CFT073 to
   colonize abiotic surfaces. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of both
   compounds (0.5 to 10 mu g/mL) decreased bacterial swarming and swimming
   motilities and increased biofilm formation. qRT-PCR revealed a decrease
   in the expression of the flagellar gene (fliC) and motility genes (motA
   and motB) along with an increased expression of adhesin genes (fimA,
   papA, uvrY). Interestingly, piperine increased penetration of the
   antibiotics ciprofloxacin and azithromycin into E. coli CFT073 biofilms
   and consequently enhanced the ability of these antibiotics to disperse
   pre-established biofilms. The findings suggest that these alkaloids can
   potentially affect bacterial colonization by hampering bacterial
   motility and may aid in the treatment of infection by increasing
   antibiotic penetration in biofilms.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{18609-18618}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{A method is described for measuring the effective electronic
   conductivity of porous fuel cell catalyst layers (CLs) as a function of
   relative humidity (RH). Four formulations of CLs with different carbon
   black (CB) contents and ionomer equivalent weights (EWs) were tested.
   The van der Pauw method was used to measure the sheet resistance (R-s),
   which increased with RH for all samples. The increase was attributed to
   ionomer swelling upon water uptake, which affects the connectivity of CB
   aggregates. Greater increases in R-s were observed for samples with
   lower EW, which uptake more water on a mass basis per mass ionomer.
   Transient R-s measurements were taken during absorption and desorption,
   and the resistance kinetics were fit using a double exponential decay
   model. No hysteresis was observed, and the absorption and desorption
   kinetics were virtually symmetric. Thickness measurements were attempted
   at different RHs, but no discernible changes were observed. This finding
   led to the conclusion that the conducting Pt/C volume fraction does not
   change with RH, which suggests that effective medium theory models that
   depend on volume fraction alone cannot explain the reduction in
   conductivity with RH. The merits of percolation-based models were
   discussed. Optical micrographs revealed an extensive network of ``mud
   cracks{''} in some samples. The influence of water sorption on CL
   conductivity is primarily explained by ionomer swelling, and its effects
   on the quantity and quality of interaggregate contacts were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophilic microporous membranes were prepared based on polypropylene

   ATR-FTIR, XPS and EDS analyses showed that the hydrophilic segments of
   an amphiphilic modifier (PP-g-AA) acted as surface functional groups on
   the film surface. The results indicated that the presence of the
   modifier was very important for grafting TiO2 nanoparticles on the film
   surface. Compared to PP and PP/PP-g-AA blend films, the water contact
   angle decreased by a factor of 2.5 after grafting TiO2 on the surface of
   the films, meanwhile the water vapor permeability of the microporous
   membranes prepared from those films increased by a factor of 1.5. All
   these results indicated that the hydrophilicity of the modified PP

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{A novel design of accelerometer strapdown, intended for the estimation
   of the rigid-body acceleration and velocity fields, is proposed here.
   The authors introduce the concept of isotropic-polyhedral layout of
   simplicial biaxial accelerometers (SBA), in which one SBA is rigidly
   attached at the centroid of each face of the polyhedron. By virtue of
   both the geometric isotropy of the layout and the structural planar
   isotropy of the SBA, the point tangential relative acceleration is
   decoupled from its centripetal counterpart, which is filtered out, along
   with the angular velocity. The outcome is that the rigid-body angular
   acceleration can be estimated independent of the angular velocity,
   thereby overcoming a hurdle that mars the estimation process in current
   accelerometer strapdowns. An estimation algorithm, based on the extended
   Kalman filter, is included. Simulation results show an excellent
   performance of the proposed strapdowns in estimating the acceleration
   and velocity fields of a moving object along with its pose.}},

Abstract = {{Catechol-containing molecules, such as hydrocaffeic acid (HCA) have been
   shown to increase the mucoadhesion of several polymers. We report here a
   simple and bioinspired approach to enhance chitosan (CS) mucoadhesion
   and stabilize it in nanoparticulate form by preparing HCA-CS conjugates.
   HCA-CS conjugates containing 6 and 15 mol\% HCA were synthesized and
   characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR and UV-vis spectrophotometry. HCA-CS
   nanoparticles prepared by ionic gelation with sodium tripolyphosphate
   (TPP) ranged in size between 100 and 250 nm depending on the polymer and
   TPP/CS weight ratio. In contrast to CS nanoparticles, which aggregate at
   pH > 6.5, HCA-CS nanoparticles did not show any sign of aggregation or
   precipitation over the 4-10 pH range and maintain their size.
   Unexpectedly, HCA-CS nanoparticles also maintained their size and
   polydispersity index at pH 7.4 and NaCl concentrations of up to 500 mM.
   Partial oxidation of HCA resulted in nanoparticle cross-linking and
   improved stability at pH < 4. HCA-CS mucoadhesion to rabbit small
   intestine was 6 times higher than unmodified CS. CS and HCA-CS
   nanoparticles were able to induce reversible tight junction opening in
   Caco-2 cell monolayers. Tight junction opening facilitated the
   permeability of a model hydrophilic molecule, fluorescein
   isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (FD4) and was 3 times higher in the cells
   treated with HCA-CS 15\% nanoparticles compared to control groups.
   HCA-CS conjugates were found to be excellent candidates for stable
   nanodelivery systems with enhanced oral absorption of hydrophilic
   molecules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The pronounced seasonality of global groundwater recharge}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater recharged by meteoric water supports human life by providing
   two billion people with drinking water and by supplying 40\% of cropland
   irrigation. While annual groundwater recharge rates are reported in many
   studies, fewer studies have explicitly quantified intra-annual (i.e.,
   seasonal) differences in groundwater recharge. Understanding seasonal
   differences in the fraction of precipitation that recharges aquifers is
   important for predicting annual recharge groundwater rates under
   changing seasonal precipitation and evapotranspiration regimes in a
   warming climate, for accurately interpreting isotopic proxies in
   paleoclimate records, and for understanding linkages between ecosystem
   productivity and groundwater recharge. Here we determine seasonal
   differences in the groundwater recharge ratio, defined here as the ratio
   of groundwater recharge to precipitation, at 54 globally distributed
   locations on the basis of O-18/O-16 and H-2/H-1 ratios in precipitation
   and groundwater. Our analysis shows that arid and temperate climates
   have wintertime groundwater recharge ratios that are consistently higher
   than summertime groundwater recharge ratios, while tropical groundwater
   recharge ratios are at a maximum during the wet season. The
   isotope-based recharge ratio seasonality is consistent with monthly
   outputs from a global hydrological model (PCR-GLOBWB) for most, but not
   all locations. The pronounced seasonality in groundwater recharge ratios
   shown in this study signifies that, from the point of view of predicting
   future groundwater recharge rates, a unit change in winter (temperate
   and arid regions) or wet season (tropics) precipitation will result in a
   greater change to the annual groundwater recharge rate than the same
   unit change to summer or dry season precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{In software debugging, trace generation techniques are used to resolve
   highly complex bugs. However, the emulators increasingly used for
   embedded software development do not yet offer the types of trace
   generation infrastructure available in hardware. In this article, we
   make changes to the ARM ISA emulation of the QEMU emulator to allow for
   continuous instruction-level trace generation. Using a standard GDB
   client, tracepoints can be inserted to dynamically log registers and
   memory addresses without altering executing code. The ability to run
   trace experiments in five different modes allows the scope of trace
   generation to be narrowed as needed, down to the level of a single Linux
   process. Our scheme collects the execution traces of a Linux process on
   average between 9.6x-0.7x the speed of existing QEMU trace capabilities,
   with 96.7\% less trace data volume. Compared to a software-instrumented
   tracing scheme, our method is both unobtrusive and performs on average
   between 3-4 orders of magnitude faster.}},

Abstract = {{In the development of real-time embedded applications, especially those
   on systems-on-chip, an efficient use of RAM memory is as important as
   the effective scheduling of the computation resources. The protection of
   communication and state variables accessed by concurrent tasks must
   provide real-time schedulability guarantees while using the least amount
   of memory. Several schemes, including preemption thresholds, have been
   developed to improve schedulability and save stack space by selectively
   disabling preemption. However, the design synthesis problem is still
   open. In this article, we target the assignment of the scheduling
   parameters to minimize memory usage for systems of practical interest,
   including designs compliant with automotive standards. We propose
   algorithms either proven optimal or shown to improve on randomized
   optimization methods like simulated annealing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the rolling stability of a power-generating tumbleweed
   rover is investigated. The nonlinear equations of motion of the rover
   capture the nonholonomic nature of rolling without slipping, the
   external wind force, and energy dissipation due to rolling friction and
   power generation. To assess stability of the system as it rolls about a
   preferred axis of rotation, Lyapunov's indirect method is employed. When
   the shell of the tumbleweed rover has a uniform mass distribution,
   Lyapunov's indirect method predicts instability; when the inertia about
   a preferred axis of rotation is increased, Lyapunov's indirect method
   predicts stability. Numerical simulation results of both the linearized
   and nonlinear equations of motion confirm both the instability and
   stability predictions of Lyapunov's indirect method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the performance of multi-tier integrated
   fiber-wireless (FiWi) smart grid communications infrastructures based on
   low cost, simple, and reliable next-generation passive optical network
   (PON) with quality-of-service (QoS) enabled wireless local area networks
   (WLANs) in terms of capacity, latency, and reliability. We study the
   coexistence of human-to-human (H2H), e.g., triple-play traffic and
   machine-to-machine (M2M) traffic originating from wireless sensors
   operating on a wide range of possible configurations. Our analysis
   enables the quantification of the maximum achievable data rates of both
   event-and time-driven wireless sensors without violating given upper
   delay limits of H2H traffic. By using experimental measurements of
   real-world smart grid applications, we investigate the impact of
   variable H2H traffic loads on the sensor end-to-end delay performance.
   The obtained results show that a conventional Ethernet PON may cause a
   bottleneck and increase the delay for both H2H and M2M traffic. In
   contrast, by using a 10 G-EPON or wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
   PON, the bottleneck arises in the wireless network. Furthermore, we
   study the interplay between time-and event-driven nodes and show that
   the theoretical upper bound of time-driven sensors decreases linearly as
   a function of the number of sensors, whereas with event-driven sensors,
   the upper bound decrease is nonlinear and more pronounced.}},

   The combinations of ABC-BIL extractants revealed synergistic effects for

   confirmed the novel synergistic extraction. Some synergy coefficients of

Abstract = {{It is of importance to understand the effect of production blasts on the
   surrounding rock formations in underground mines. This study presents a
   numerical procedure to simulate stress waves resulting from nearby
   production blasts. First, the damping coefficient and peak borehole
   pressure are calibrated using a dynamic numerical model of a single
   blast hole. The resulting time-varying particle velocities in the
   surrounding rock mass at the specified points are calculated. These are
   then used as input parameters in a three-dimensional mine-wide model,
   considering a positional relationship between the blast hole and the
   specified points on the wall rock. The mine-wide model encompasses a
   fault running parallel to a steeply dipping, tabular ore deposit.
   Dynamic analysis simulating the effect of production blasts is conducted
   after the extraction of mining blocks with static analysis. In this
   study, variations of stresses along the fault due to blast-induced
   stress waves are examined. Results demonstrate that the developed
   methodology can reasonably simulate stress changes induced by stress
   waves on the fault. The methodology considers blast sequences and
   time-varying blast loads that vary according to the positional
   relationship between the blast holes and the specified points on the

Abstract = {{The poor seismic performance of schools has made their assessment and
   retrofit a priority in moderate and high seismic zones. Given the large
   building inventory to evaluate, rapid seismic screening methods are
   often implemented to prioritize detailed interventions. This paper
   describes schools' specific characteristics to be considered when
   applying these procedures, and shows how the FEMA154 approach can be
   modified to consider them. The adapted method is a score assignment
   procedure based on the following six essential characteristics:
   seismicity, lateral load resisting system, construction year, potential
   structural weaknesses (or irregularities), potential for pounding of
   adjacent buildings, and local soil conditions. The method is illustrated
   with case studies, applied to 101 school buildings in Quebec. Results
   show that most of the parameters considered influence the final scores.
   In particular, the treatment of structural weaknesses and potential for
   pounding proved effective in differentiating the likely seismic
   performance of the buildings.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using captured carbon dioxide as an enabling starting
   material for fresh concrete carbonation curing was studied. Carbonation
   curing of fresh concrete accelerates hydration, shortens production
   time, and recycles carbon dioxide recovered from cement kiln. The
   challenge is if an optimized process window can be established that can
   compete with steam curing. The carbonation reactivity of fresh concrete
   was reduced by high water content and internal relative humidity. It was
   found that water content was more dominant at a fresh state. When the
   water content was reduced to 40\%, the internal relative humidity was
   still over 95\%. A novel process including a high water to cement ratio
   mix, a precondition drying, and a static carbonation curing was
   developed to establish an optimized process window for enhanced carbon
   dioxide uptake and concrete early strength within an 8 h work shift.}},

Abstract = {{The reliable estimation of the seismic performance of structures
   requires quantifying the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties of the
   system parameters. This is efficiently achieved for a case study of a
   four-story steel moment-resisting frame through several important
   advances. First, a state-of-the-art numerical model is formed with full
   spatial parameterization of its strength and plastic deformation
   properties. Empirical relationships derived from experimental data are
   used to model the cyclic behavior of steel sections using
   probabilistically distributed parameters that include intra- and
   inter-component correlation. Finally, incremental dynamic analysis and
   Monte Carlo simulation are employed to accurately assess the seismic
   performance of the model under the influence of uncertainties. Of
   interest is the extent to which model parameter uncertainties may
   trigger negative demand-capacity correlation in structural fragility
   evaluation, where, for example, a lower ductility capacity for a
   component may decrease the threshold for local failure while at the same
   time raising the local demand estimate from an uncertainty-aware model.
   With respect to the examined steel moment-resisting frame and
   considering three construction quality levels (i.e. very good, average,
   low) as per FEMA P-58, it is shown that, despite the good agreement of
   the evaluated structural demands obtained with and without consideration
   of the model parameter uncertainties for well-designed modern buildings,
   the potential demand-capacity correlation is likely to give rise to
   unconservative estimates of fragility for local damage-states,
   especially in cases where substandard quality control is exercised
   during construction. (C) CD 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The influence of mechanical stimulation on the formation of
   torus mandibularis (TM) is still poorly understood. We sought to
   understand the etiology of TMs by investigating the role of
   parafunctional activity and mandibular morphology on the formation of
   TMs.
   Materials and Methods: We designed a case-control study for patients
   attending the dental clinic of the present study (University of Sao
   Paulo School of Dentistry, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil). Patients presenting
   with TMs were defined as cases, and those without TMs were defined as
   controls. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used in 3-dimensional
   mandibular models to examine the stress distribution in the mandibles
   with and without TMs. In addition, the associations of mandibular arch
   shape, mandibular cortical index, and parafunctional activity with the
   presence of T were assessed using odds ratio analysis.
   Results: A total of 10 patients with TMs and 37 without TMs were
   selected (22 men and 25 women, mean age 54.3 +/- 8.4 years). FEA showed
   a stress concentration in the region in which TMs form during simulation
   of parafunctional activity. The radiographic assessment showed that
   those with TMs were more likely to have a square-shaped mandible with
   sharp angles (P = .001) and a normal mandibular cortex (P = .03). The
   subjects without TMs had a round-shaped mandible with obtuse angles and
   an eroded mandibular cortex.
   Conclusions: Parafunctional activity could be causing the formation of
   TMs by concentrating mechanical stress in the region in which TMs
   usually form. Thus, mandibular geometries that favor stress
   concentration, such as square-shaped mandibles, will be associated with
   a greater prevalence of TMs. (C) 2014 American Association of Oral and

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the present study was to construct a new drug
   delivery system for milrinone using microparticles. This novel
   technology enhances drug bioavailability and decreases toxicity, with
   future implications for the treatment of end-stage heart failure.
   Methods: Polylactic-co-glycolic acid microparticles (PLGA-MPs) loaded
   with milrinone were prepared using a double emulsion-solvent evaporation
   technique. In vitro release kinetics was evaluated at physiologic
   conditions. A total of 24 female Lewis rats underwent left coronary
   artery ligation. One week after ligation, all rats were randomized to 1
   of 3 groups (n = 8 per group). Group I received an intravenous injection
   of PLGA-MPs alone; group II, a bolus intravenous injection of milrinone;
   and group III an intravenous injection of milrinone-PLGA-MPs. All
   injections were administrated slowly by way of the tail vein over 10
   minutes. Transthoracic echocardiography, noninvasive heart rate
   monitoring, and blood pressure measurements were performed at different
   predetermined intervals before and for 24 hours after the injection. All
   rats survived for 24 hours and were then killed by euthanasia. Serum
   plasma was taken for cytokine assays and determination of milrinone
   levels using high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Results: Group III had a significantly greater left ventricular ejection
   fraction at 90 minutes and 3, 6, and 12 hours after treatment compared
   with the other groups. The milrinone plasma level was significantly
   greater in group III than in the other groups (group I, 0 ng/mL; group
   II, 1.7 +/- 2.4 ng/mL; group III, 9.1 +/- 2.2 ng/mL; P < .05). The
   intercellular adhesion molecule and cytokine-induced neutrophil
   chemoattractant-1 levels were significantly lower in group III than in
   the other 2 groups (P < .05).
   Conclusions: Drug encapsulation using microparticles can prolong the
   effects of milrinone. We propose a new strategy for future drug delivery
   in patients with end-stage heart failure.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently proposed a new method for integrating design
   optimization with model validation by means of a sequential approach
   that uses variable-size local domains of the design space and
   statistical bootstrap techniques. Our work was motivated by the fact
   that global model validation may be neither affordable nor necessary.
   The method proceeds iteratively by obtaining test data at a design
   point, constructing around it a local domain in which the model is
   considered valid, and optimizing the design within this local domain.
   Due to test variability, it is important to know how many tests are
   needed to size each local domain of the sequential optimization process.
   Conducting an unnecessarily large number of tests may be inefficient,
   while a small number of tests may be insufficient to achieve the desired
   validity level. In this paper, we introduce a technique to determine the
   number of tests required to account for their variability by sizing the
   local domains accordingly. The goal is to achieve a desired level of
   model validity in each domain using the correlation between model data
   at the center and any other point in the local domain. To make the
   method more cost-effective we avoid generating some testsby
   statistically predicting a set of local domains along the optimization
   process. The proposed technique is illustrated with a piston design
   example.}},

   of associated AOPs. This is useful when AOPs are too hard to solve or
   when the design engineer does not have access to the models necessary to
   evaluate all the terms of the AOF. In this case, decomposition-based
   design optimization methods can be useful to solve the AOP as a
   quasi-separable MDO problem. Specifically, we use the analytical target
   cascading methodology to formulate decomposed subproblems of
   quasi-separable MDO problems and coordinate their solution in order to
   obtain Pareto points of the associated AOPs. We first illustrate the
   approach using a well-known simple geometric programming example and
   then present a vehicle suspension design problem with three objectives
   related to ground vehicle ride and handling.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of nine solar radiation (R-s) estimation models and their
   effects on reference evapotranspiration (ETo) were evaluated using data
   from eight meteorological stations in Canada. The R-s estimation models
   were FAO recommended Angstrom-Prescott (A-P) coefficients, locally
   calibrated A-P coefficients, Hargreaves and Samani (H-S) (1982),
   Annandale et al., (2002), Allen (1995), Self-Calibrating (S-C, Allen,
   1997), Samani (2000), Mahmood and Hubbard (M-H) (2002), and Bristow and
   Campbell (B-C) (1984). The estimated R-s values were then compared to
   measured R-s to check the appropriateness of these models at the study
   locations. Based on root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE)
   and modelling efficiency (ME) ranking, calibrated A-P coefficients
   performed better than all other methods. The calibrated H-S method
   (using new K-RS 0.15) estimated R-s more accurately than FAO-56
   recommended A-P in Elora, and Winnipeg. The RMSE of the calibrated H-S
   method ranged between 1-6\% and the RMSE of the calibrated and FAO
   recommended Angstrom-Prescott (A-P) methods ranged between 1-9\%. The
   models with the least accuracy at the eight locations are the Mahmood \&
   Hubbard (2002) and Self-Calibrating models. The percent deviation in ETo
   calculated with estimated R-s was reduced by about 50\% as compared to
   deviation in measured versus estimated R-s.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing R-2R ladders in design of active-RC approach promotes IC
   implementation of low frequency filters and leads to high linear and low
   power design solution for biomedical applications. However, area of R-2R
   ladders limits low frequency operation of this approach to few tens of
   Hz. This range is sufficient for designing 60 Hz powerline notch filter,
   but biomedical lowpass filers requires much lower pole frequencies. This
   paper investigates the use of other types of ladders (R-alpha R) in
   filter design. It shows that among various R-alpha R ladders, the R-0.5R
   ladders provide the most attractive solution for designing lowpass
   filters with ultra-low pole frequency. It is shown that R-0.5R ladders
   would require as low as 0.7 \% of the area of R-2R ladders for realizing
   a given pole frequency. A second-order fully differential filter was
   fabricated in a standard 0.18 A mu m CMOS process. Experimental results
   showing cutoff frequency of around 1 Hz are provided.}},

   the generation of new samples in a motion graph. Formal analysis is
   presented to show probabilistic completeness and convergence of the

   method, most notably, an optimal connection strategy, a bias towards the
   goal region via an Anytime A{*} heuristic, and balancing of exploration
   and exploitation on a simulated annealing schedule. Empirical results
   are presented to assess the proposed method both qualitatively and

Title = {{Methodology for the interpretation of fault-slip seismicity in a weak
   shear zone}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{126-134}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fault-slip related seismic events that occur in underground mines could
   inflict severe damage to underground openings; thus a proper estimation
   of fault-slip potential in active mining areas is of paramount
   importance in assessing its risk. It is not uncommon in underground
   mines that large seismic events take place away from stopes being
   extracted, where fault-slip potential is presumed not to be high enough
   to result in those seismic events. In the present paper, fault-slip
   related seismic events taking place within a weak shear zone in Garson
   Mine, Sudbury, Canada are investigated. First, in order to understand
   the stress states of rockmass in the mine, numerical analysis is carried
   out with a 3D mine-wide model whilst assuming isotropic elasticity. The
   result obtained from the analysis reveals that the shear stress of
   rockmass in a weak shear zone does not reach the maximum shear strength
   determined by Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion with basic friction angles
   of the rockmass. The result contradicts a fact that quite a few seismic
   events have been actually recorded in the regions with micro seismic
   monitoring systems installed in the mine. As an interpretation of that,
   it is postulated that variations in shear stiffness within the shear
   zone contribute to the generation of high slip potential resulting in
   the occurrence of those seismic events. In order to justify the
   postulation, numerical analysis is additionally carried out, in which
   the shear zone is modelled with transversely isotropic models, of which
   shear stiffness is decreased in the same direction as a measured joint
   orientation in the shear zone. For source regions of those seismic
   events, isotropic models are used without decreasing its shear
   stiffness, thus resulting in the discrepancy in shear stiffness between
   the source regions and other areas in the shear zone. The result
   obtained from the analysis verifies that fault-slip potential
   drastically increases within the source regions due to the difference in
   shear stiffness. It is further found out from dynamic analysis in which
   fault-slip is simulated with Barton's shear strength model that the
   increasing slip potential is high enough to cause large seismic events
   in the regions. In the present study, the interpretation of seismic
   events occurring within a weak shear zone is provided, and a methodology
   to simulate high fault-slip potential that could be generated within the
   shear zone is developed. The methodology can be used with back analysis
   to determine the mechanical properties of the weak shear zone, which
   lead to the better estimation of fault-slip potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Development of an oral in vivo predictive dissolution medium for acid
   drugs with a pKa in the physiological range (e.g., Biopharmaceutics
   Classification System Class IIa) requires transport analysis of the
   complex in vivo CO2/bicarbonate buffering system. In this report, we
   analyze this buffer system using hydrodynamically defined rotating disk
   dissolution. Transport analysis of drug flux was predicted using the
   film model approach of Mooney et al based on equilibrium assumptions as
   well as accounting for the slow hydration reaction, CO2 + H2O H2CO3. The
   accuracy of the models was compared with experimentally determined
   results using the rotating disk dissolution of ibuprofen, indomethacin,
   and ketoprofen. The equilibrium and slow hydration reaction rate models
   predict significantly different dissolution rates. The experimental
   results are more accurately predicted by accounting for the slow
   hydration reaction under a variety of pH and hydrodynamic conditions.
   Although the complex bicarbonate buffering system requires further
   consideration given its dynamic nature in vivo, a simplifying
   irreversible reaction (IRR) transport analysis accurately predicts in
   vitro rotating disk dissolution rates of several carboxylic acid drugs.
   This IRR transport model provides further insight into bicarbonate
   buffer and can be useful in developing more physiologically relevant
   buffer systems for dissolution testing. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{The need to reduce greenhouse gases from our current power systems
   accelerates the integration of renewable energy sources (for example,
   wind and solar power). A fundamental difficulty is that renewable energy
   is usually of high variability. Numerous advancements in technologies
   and methods for the smart grid are required to mitigate and absorb this
   variability. In this paper, we focus on one of them: how to plan wind
   farms with high capacity and low variability locally and distributedly.
   First, we study the characteristics of both wind resource and wind
   turbines and propose a novel wind power estimation method based on
   Gaussian regression. The experimental result shows that our method
   achieves a more accurate estimation compared to other ones and has a
   nearly zero error for most of the turbine types. Then, we analyze a
   tradeoff between wind power's quantity and quality for large-scale wind
   farms, and find that there is an optimal turbine type for each location
   as to either the quantity or the quality. We propose an approach to
   optimally combine different types of wind turbines to balance the
   tradeoff. Finally, we explore geographical diversity among different
   locations and develop an extended approach that jointly optimizes the
   combination of locations and turbine types. Besides applying to plan new
   wind farms, we also discuss how to adapt the two approaches to decide an
   upgrade plan for a wind farm and a network of wind farms, respectively.
   We conduct extensive experiments using two different wind resource data
   traces for both local and distributed cases. The result shows that the
   proposed approaches significantly outperform those approaches using a
   single turbine type and those separately optimizing locations and
   turbine types. We also provide interesting insights about the
   quantity-quality balancing.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of the transverse dam-break waves (TDWs) produced
   by the sudden removal of a gate on the side of a waterway are conducted
   based on the shallow-water equations to find solutions to a family of
   water-diversion problems. The Froude numbers in the main flow identify
   the members of the family. The depth and discharge profiles are analysed
   in terms of Ritter's similarity variable. For subcritical main flow, the
   waves are comprised of a supercritical flow expansion followed by a
   subcritical outflow. For supercritical main flow, on the other hand, the
   waves are analogous to the Prandtl-Meyer expansion in gas dynamics. The
   diversion flow rate of two-dimensional TDWs on a flat bed is 55\%
   greater than the one-dimensional flow rate of Ritter in the limiting
   case of zero main flow, and approaches the rate of Ritter in the other
   limit when the value of the Froude number in the main flow approaches
   infinity. The diversion flow rate over a weir is generally higher than
   the rate over a flat bed depending on the Froude number of the main
   flow. These numerical simulation results are consistent with laboratory
   observations.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of the Performance of Eight Record-Extension Techniques Under
   Different Levels of Association, Presence of Outliers and Different
   Sizes of Concurrent Records: A Monte Carlo Study}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this study, eight record extension techniques were described, their
   properties were explored, and their performances were examined and
   compared. The eight record extension techniques are the Ordinary
   least-squares regression (OLS), Kendall-Theil robust line (KTRL),
   Maintenance of variance extension techniques (MOVE1, MOVE2, MOVE3, and
   MOVE4), and two recently developed techniques, the modified KTRL
   (KTRL2), and the robust line of organic correlation (RLOC). The two
   recently proposed techniques have the advantages of being robust in the
   presence of outliers, and they are able to maintain the variance in the
   extended records. Monte-Carlo experiments were conducted to evaluate the
   performance of the eight record extension techniques under different
   levels of data contamination (presence of outliers), different sizes of
   concurrent records, and different levels of association. The performance
   of the eight techniques was examined for bias, and standard error of:
   individual records, moment estimates, and the full range of percentiles.
   Results showed that for individual record estimates, with uncontaminated
   data (no outliers), OLS, MOVE3 and MOVE4 provide comparable results and
   outperform the other techniques under any level of association or size
   of concurrent records. However, under any level of data contamination,
   the KTRL outperforms other techniques, for the estimation of individual
   records, under any level of association or size of concurrent records.
   In the case of uncontaminated data, MOVE techniques, RLOC and KTRL2 were
   almost similar and outperform OLS and KTRL in preserving the
   characteristics of the entire distribution, while MOVE techniques were
   slightly more precise than RLOC and KTRL2 for small sizes of concurrent
   records. However, under any level of contaminated data, RLOC and KTRL2
   outperform other techniques in preserving the characteristics of the
   entire distribution, under any level of association and/or size of
   concurrent records.}},

Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2982-2990}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the velocity fluctuation near the detonation limits is
   investigated experimentally. Five explosive mixtures in five different
   diameter tubes were used and the choice of the mixtures included those
   considered as ``stable{''} with regular cellular pattern and
   ``unstable{''} with highly irregular cellular pattern. Photodiodes
   spaced at regular intervals along the tube were used to measure the
   detonation velocity. Piezoelectric transducers were also used to record
   the pressure profiles. Smoked foils were used to register the cellular
   detonation structure. Away from the limits, the detonation is found to
   propagate at a steady velocity throughout the length of the tube and the
   fluctuations of the local velocity are generally small. For stable
   mixtures with high argon dilution, the onset of the detonation limits is
   indicated by an abrupt drop in the detonation velocity to about 0.4V(CJ)
   after a short distance of travel. The detonation may continue to
   propagate at this low velocity before decaying eventually to a
   deflagration wave. For deflagrations the optical detector sometimes
   failed to register a signal due to low luminosity of the front. In
   unstable mixtures, galloping detonations are observed only in small
   diameter tubes (e.g., D = 12.7, 3.2 and 1.5 mm). A large number of
   fairly reproducible cycles of galloping detonations can be observed in
   very small diameter tubes. In large diameter tubes (e.g., D = 31.7 and
   50.8 mm), no galloping detonations are observed in all stable and
   unstable mixtures. For stable mixtures, no galloping detonations are
   observed even in small diameter tubes of D = 3.2 and 1.5 mm. Smoked
   foils records show that the cellular detonation structure changes from
   multi-headed to single-headed spin as the limit is approached. In a
   galloping detonation cycle, a decay from multi-headed to single-headed
   detonation is observed. However, the cellular structure vanishes for
   further decay of the galloping detonation to the low velocity phase of
   the galloping cycle. Although galloping detonations could be considered
   to define the boundary for detonation limits, this definition lacks
   generality since galloping detonations are not always observed in all
   mixtures and in all tube diameters. Thus the onset of single-headed spin
   is perhaps the most appropriate criterion of the detonation limits in
   tubes. (c) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Presented is an approach for finding periodic responses of structural
   systems subject to unilateral contact conditions. No other non-linear
   terms, e.g. large displacements or strains, hyper-elasticity,
   plasticity, etc. are considered. The excitation period due to various
   forcing conditions-from harmonic external or contact forcing due to a
   moving contact interface-is discretized in time, such that the
   quantities of interest displacement, velocity, acceleration as well as
   contact force can be approximated through time-domain schemes such as
   backward difference, Galerkin, and Fourier. The solution is assumed to
   exist and is defined on a circle with circumference T to directly
   enforce its periodicity. The strategy for approximating time derivative
   terms within the discretized period, i.e. velocity and acceleration, is
   hence circulant in nature. This results in a global circulant algebraic
   system of equations with inequalities that can be translated into a
   unique Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). The LCP is then solved by
   dedicated and established methods such as Lemke's Algorithm. This allows
   for the computation of approximate periodic solutions exactly satisfying
   unilateral contact constraints on a discrete time set. The
   implementation efficiency and accuracy are discussed in comparison to
   classical time marching techniques for initial value problems combined
   with a Lagrange Multiplier contact treatment. The LCP algorithm is
   validated using a simple academic problem. The extension to large-scale
   systems is made possible through the implementation of a Craig-Bampton
   type Modal Component Synthesis. The method shows applicability to
   industrial rotor/casing contact set-ups as shown by studying a
   compressor blade. A good agreement to time marching simulations is
   found, suggesting a viable alternative to time marching or Fourier-based
   harmonic balance simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present study, the geometrically non-linear vibrations of thin
   infinitely long rectangular plates subjected to axial flow and
   concentrated harmonic excitation are investigated for different flow
   velocities. The plate is assumed to be periodically simply supported
   with immovable edges and the flow channel is bounded by a rigid wall.
   The equations of motion are obtained based on the von Karman non-linear
   plate theory retaining in-plane inertia and geometric imperfections by
   employing Lagrangian approach. The fluid is modeled by potential flow
   and the flow perturbation potential is derived by applying the Galerkin
   technique. A code based on the pseudo-arc-length continuation and
   collocation scheme is used for bifurcation analysis. Results are shown
   through bifurcation diagrams of the static solutions, frequency-response
   curves, time histories, and phase-plane diagrams. The effect of system
   parameters, such as flow velocity and geometric imperfections, on the
   stability of the plate and its geometrically non-linear vibration
   response to harmonic excitation are fully discussed and the convergence

   property, the surface energy, plays an important role in the
   adhesiveness, wettability, and consequently flotation of minerals. In
   this work, quartz was chosen as a naturally hydrophilic mineral, and
   dodecylamine was used to hydrophobise the surface. To study the
   correlation between the surface properties as measured from IGC
   experiments and flotation, microflotation experiments were also
   conducted. It was shown that with treatment by dodecylamine, the surface
   energy decreased, as did the work of adhesion to water. The recovery of
   quartz increased after the treatment, indicating a correlation between
   surface energy and flotation response.
   The results indicate that IGC has the capability to determine the
   thermodynamic properties of quartz, pre- and post-conditioning. Relating
   the hydrophobicity and flotation of minerals to the surface energy can
   be observed from combining the results of IGC and microflotation
   experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bastnasite is the chief valuable mineral in two of the world's largest
   rare earth (RE) mineral deposits and is also found in a number of new RE
   deposits currently under development. This work used electrophoretic and
   electroacoustic zeta potential measurements to identify the interaction
   between bastnasite and several different collectors. The results of
   these measurements were then compared with microflotation of bastnasite
   and quartz, a common RE gangue mineral. Zeta potential measurements of
   bastnasite determined the isoelectric point of bastnasite to occur at
   approximately pH 6.3 (via electrophoretic measurement) and pH 8.1 (via
   electroacoustic measurement). Sodium oleate and Flotinor SM15 (a
   commercial phosphoric acid ester) are both shown to chemically adsorb
   onto the bastnasite surface. Zeta potential measurements of bastnasite
   with benzohydroxamic acid indicate significant adsorption, especially
   from pH 5 to pH 10. The microflotation results show that all three
   collectors were able to successfully recover bastnasite. SM15 is the
   least selective collector as it floats both quartz and bastnasite
   whereas benzohydroxamic acid is able to selectively float bastnasite at
   pH 9. The recovery of bastnasite using benzohydroxamic acid is also
   shown to be highly dependent on frother selection. The optimum pH of
   flotation for all three collectors occurs at pH 9. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{The role of caldesmon and its phosphorylation by ERK on the binding

Abstract = {{Background: Studies conducted at the whole muscle level have shown that
   smooth muscle can maintain tension with low Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
   consumption. Whereas it is generally accepted that this property
   (latch-state) is a consequence of the dephosphorylation of myosin during
   its attachment to actin, free dephosphorylated myosin can also bind to
   actin and contribute to force maintenance. We investigated the role of
   caldesmon (CaD) in regulating the binding force of unphosphorylated
   tonic smooth muscle myosin to actin.
   Methods: To measure the effect of CaD on the binding of unphosphorylated
   myosin to actin (in the presence of ATP), we used a single beam laser
   trap assay to quantify the average unbinding force (F-unb) in the
   absence or presence of caldesmon, extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   (ERK)-phosphorylated CaD, or CaD plus tropomyosin.
   Results: F-unb from unregulated actin (0.10 +/- 0.01 pN) was
   significantly increased in the presence of CaD (0.17 +/- 0.02 pN),
   tropomyosin (0.17 +/- 0.02 pN) or both regulatory proteins (0.18 +/-
   0.02 pN). ERK phosphorylation of CaD significantly reduced the F-unb
   (0.06 +/- 0.01 pN). Inspection of the traces of the Funb as a function
   of time suggests that ERK phosphorylation of CaD decreases the binding
   force of myosin to actin or accelerates its detachment.
   Conclusions: CaD enhances the binding force of unphosphorylated myosin
   to actin potentially contributing to the latch-state. ERK
   phosphorylation of CaD decreases this binding force to very low levels.
   General significance: This study suggests a mechanism that likely
   contributes to the latch-state and that explains the muscle relaxation
   from the latch-state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work evaluated essential quality parameters of binary blends of
   vegetable oils using a rapid and non-destructive method namely Fourier
   transform near-infrared (FTNIR) spectroscopy. Crude palm oil and canola
   oil from different vendors were blended at different ratios to obtain 40
   oil samples with wide ranges of iodine values (IV), free fatty acids
   (FFA) and peroxide values (PV). FTNIR spectra of these oil samples were
   acquired and used in the calibration and test validation steps. The IV,
   FFA and PV of the oil samples were analyzed by AOCS methods. The FTNIR
   spectra were correlated to the AOCS data using partial least squares
   (PLS) regression. Calibration models were developed after test
   validation. The chemometric models were further improved through
   spectral processing. The optimal models were first derivative and first
   derivative + straight line subtraction. For IV, coefficient of
   determination (R-2) = 0.98; root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP)
   = 2.54 and residual predictive deviation (RPD) = 6.11. The values for
   FFA were R-2 = 0.9927; RMSEP = 0.35 and RPD = 11.6. While the values for

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to quantify the effects of the specimen
   shape on the accuracy of mechanical properties determined from a
   shape-specific model generation strategy. Digital images of five rabbit
   vocal folds (VFs) in their initial undeformed conditions were used to
   build corresponding specific solid models. The displacement field of the
   VFs under uniaxial tensile test was then measured over the visible
   portion of the surface using digital image correlation. A
   three-dimensional finite element model was built, using ABAQUS, for each
   solid model, while imposing measured boundary conditions. An
   inverse-problem method was used, assuming a homogeneous isotropic linear
   elastic constitutive model. Unknown elastic properties were identified
   iteratively through an error minimization technique between simulated
   and measured force-time data. The longitudinal elastic moduli of the
   five rabbit VFs were calculated and compared to values from a simple
   analytical method and those obtained by approximating the cross-section
   as elliptical. The use of shape-specific models significantly reduced
   the standard deviation of the Young's moduli of the tested specimens.
   However, a non-parametric statistical analysis test, i.e., the Friedman
   test, yielded no statistically significant differences between the
   shape-specific method and the elliptic cylindrical finite element model.
   Considering the required procedures to reconstruct the shape-specific
   finite element model for each tissue specimen, it might be expedient to
   use the simpler method when large numbers of tissue specimens are to be
   compared regarding their Young's moduli. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{The effect of nanostructure on the oxidation of NiAl}},
Journal = {{INTERMETALLICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{209-217}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bulk nanostructured NiAl samples with a grain size of 104 nm have been
   obtained through cryomilling of NiAl intermetallic feedstock powder and
   subsequent sintering via SPS. Oxidation testing of these conventional
   and nanostructured NiAl samples reveals that while the conventional
   samples have oxidation rates on the order of 10(-11) g(2)/cm(4)/s across
   all tested temperatures, nanostructured samples demonstrate decreasing
   oxidation rates with temperature, as low as 6.78 x 10(-13) g(2)/cm(4)/s.
   This decrease in oxidation rate is attributed to an earlier transition
   through the metastable aluminum oxide phases, resulting in a stable slow
   growing alpha-Al2O3 phase earlier in the oxidation tests. In-situ X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) during high temperature oxidation testing has shown
   that lattice strain at the surface of the nanostructured samples is
   substantially higher than conventional, and that the decrease of this
   lattice strain with temperature is significant. It is believed that the
   relief of this lattice strain stimulates the earlier theta-alpha
   transition seen in the nanostructured samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   based on the game theory, a bounded and closed region encircling the

   non-radiative recombination centers in the near-surface region, the
   emission from the InGaN dots strongly increased. PL excitation
   measurements indicate that such an increase cannot be explained by a
   plasma-induced shift of the GaN absorption edge. It is rather ascribed
   to the passivation of grown-in defects and dynamic annealing due to the
   presence of plasma-generated N atoms and N-2 metastables without
   excessive introduction of ion-induced damage.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the phase equilibria of the
   glycinemethanolNH(4)ClH(2)O system was carried out with the objective of
   optimizing the monochloroacetic acid (MCA) process for the production of
   glycine. Phase equilibrium of the glycineNH(4)ClH(2)O system at
   temperatures over the range of 283.2353.2 K was determined for
   concentrations ranging up to the multiple saturation points. The
   solubilities of both glycine and NH4Cl were found to increase with
   increasing temperature, as well as with increasing concentration of
   other solutes. The BromleyZemaitis model for ions and the Pitzer
   formulation for glycine neutral species implemented in the OLI platform
   were used in the regression of the experimental solubilities. The
   average absolute deviations between the regressed solubility values and
   the experimental data were found to be 1.4\% for glycine and 0.93\% for
   NH4Cl. Three binary interaction parameters of the Pitzer formulation
   were newly obtained and coupled with the BromleyZemaitis parameters
   documented in OLIs databank to predict the multiple saturation points of
   the system. Additionally, the solubility of glycine in methanolH(2)O
   mixtures was also measured from 283.2 to 323.2 K, and a sharp decline
   was observed as a function of the content of methanol. Such
   thermodynamic information is definitely useful for improving the
   existing industrial process, as well as providing fundamentals for the
   development of new glycine production processes.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature and pressure dependency of the volume plasmon energy of

   energy, the temperature and pressure dependency of lattice parameter was
   used. Also, by combination of the free electron model and the equation
   of state based on the pseudo-spinodal approach, the temperature and

Abstract = {{Integrin-mediated force application induces a conformational change in
   latent TGF-beta 1 that leads to the release of the active form of the
   growth factor from the extracellular matrix (ECM). Mechanical activation
   of TGF-beta 1 is currently understood as an acute process that depends
   on the contractile force of cells. However, we show that ECM remodeling,
   preceding the activation step, mechanically primes latent TGF-beta 1
   akin to loading a mechanical spring. Cell-based assays and unique strain
   devices were used to produce a cell-derived ECM of controlled
   organization and prestrain. Mechanically conditioned ECM served as a
   substrate to measure the efficacy of TGF-beta 1 activation after cell
   contraction or direct force application using magnetic microbeads. The
   release of active TGF-beta 1 was always higher from prestrained ECM as
   compared with unorganized and/or relaxed ECM. The finding that ECM
   prestrain regulates the bioavailability of TGF-beta 1 is important to
   understand the context of diseases that involve excessive ECM
   remodeling, such as fibrosis or cancer.}},

   behavior of fully restrained composite beam-to-column connections, with
   reduced beam sections. Using the proposed modeling recommendations, a
   system-level analytical study is performed on archetype steel buildings
   that utilize perimeter steel SMFs, with different heights, designed in
   the West-Coast of the USA. It is shown that in average, the composite
   action may enhance the seismic performance of steel SMFs. However,
   bottom story collapse mechanisms may be triggered leading to rapid
   deterioration of the global strength of steel SMFs. Because of composite
   action, excessive panel zone shear distortion is also observed in
   interior joints of steel SMFs designed with strong-column/weak-beam
   ratios larger than 1.0. It is demonstrated that when steel SMFs are
   designed with strong-column/weak-beam ratios larger than 1.5, (i) bottom
   story collapse mechanisms are typically avoided; (ii) a tolerable
   probability of collapse is achieved in a return period of 50years; and
   (iii) controlled panel zone yielding is achieved while reducing the
   required number of welded doubler plates in interior beam-to-column
   joints. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is a technically challenging
   procedure, associated with a significant risk of complications. Virtual
   reality simulation has demonstrated benefit in many disciplines as an
   important educational tool for surgical training. Within the field of
   rhinology, there is a lack of ESS simulators with appropriate validity
   evidence supporting their integration into residency education. The
   objectives of this study are to evaluate the acceptability, perceived
   realism and benefit of the McGill Simulator for Endoscopic Sinus Surgery
   (MSESS) among medical students, otolaryngology residents and faculty,
   and to present evidence supporting its ability to differentiate users
   based on their level of training through the performance metrics.
   Methods: 10 medical students, 10 junior residents, 10 senior residents
   and 3 expert sinus surgeons performed anterior ethmoidectomies,
   posterior ethmoidectomies and wide sphenoidotomies on the MSESS.
   Performance metrics related to quality (e.g. percentage of tissue
   removed), efficiency (e.g. time, path length, bimanual dexterity, etc.)
   and safety (e.g. contact with no-go zones, maximum applied force, etc.)
   were calculated. All users completed a post-simulation questionnaire
   related to realism, usefulness and perceived benefits of training on the
   MSESS.
   Results: The MSESS was found to be realistic and useful for training
   surgical skills with scores of 7.97 +/- 0.29 and 8.57 +/- 0.69,
   respectively on a 10-point rating scale. Most students and residents
   (29/30) believed that it should be incorporated into their curriculum.
   There were significant differences between novice surgeons (10 medical
   students and 10 junior residents) and senior surgeons (10 senior
   residents and 3 sinus surgeons) in performance metrics related to
   quality (p < 0.05), efficiency (p < 0.01) and safety (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The MSESS demonstrated initial evidence supporting its use
   for residency education. This simulator may be a potential resource to
   help fill the void in endoscopic sinus surgery training.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is a powder metallurgy technique that
   employs the use of fast sinteringkinetics to produce final consolidated
   components in a matter of minutes. In order to use blended powders in
   SPS to obtain fully alloyed parts diffusion during sintering must be
   understood. An investigation into the effects of current on the
   diffusion of copper and nickel was performed using SPS. Bulk specimens
   were used to generate diffusion couples in SPS in alternating
   orientations with respect to the direction of the current. Control
   samples were produced using a horizontal insertion vacuum furnace.
   Experiments were performed at temperatures between 850 degrees C and
   1000 degrees C for 3h. Concentration profiles were obtained by the use
   of both energy-dispersive spectroscopy and a Monte Carlo simulated
   correction curve. Diffusion coefficients and activation energies were
   calculated for samples produced by SPS and annealing without current. It
   was shown that at temperatures near 0.9T(m) the application of current
   in SPS inhibits diffusion between copper and nickel due to the
   re-orientation of electrons caused by the loss of ferromagnetism in
   nickel. Activation energy for diffusion is however decreased due to the
   temperature gradients arising from the difference in resistivity between
   the two species. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Two different amounts of tin (Sn) were added to a Mg-3 wt\% Al binary
   alloy to form different amounts of precipitates during hot deformation.
   The thermodynamic modeling software, FactSage (TM), was used to
   calculate the amounts of Sn to generate the desired relative levels of
   precipitation. The alloys were deformed at four different temperatures
   and three different strain rates to generate different amounts of
   precipitates. The objective was to study the effect of these
   precipitates on dynamic recrystallization. The results indicated that
   the formation of strain-induced precipitates is a function of
   deformation temperature, strain, and strain rate. The findings also
   revealed that higher amounts of precipitates reduced the volume fraction
   of dynamic recrystallization and refined the dynamically recrystallized
   grain size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel iterative receiver is proposed for relay-assisted multiuser
   communications in which multiple users transmit to a destination with
   the help of a relay and using fast frequency-hopping modulation. Each

   interference cancellation at the receiver. The signal received at the
   relay is either amplified, or partially decoded with a simple energy
   detector, before being forwarded to the destination. The proposed
   iterative receiver exploits the soft outputs of a channel decoder to
   successively extract the maximum-likelihood symbols of the users and
   perform interference cancellation. Under the same spectral efficiency,
   simulation results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed
   receiver when compared to the performance of an interference
   cancellation scheme that was previously proposed for multiuser

Abstract = {{Polar codes are the first error-correcting codes to provably achieve
   channel capacity, asymptotically in code length, with an explicit
   construction. However, under successive-cancellation decoding, polar
   codes require very long code lengths to compete with existing modern
   codes. Nonetheless, the successive cancellation algorithm enables
   very-low-complexity implementations in hardware, due to the regular
   structure exhibited by polar codes. In this paper, we present an
   improved architecture for successive-cancellation decoding of polar
   codes, making use of a novel semi-parallel, encoder-based partial-sum
   computation module. We also provide quantization results for realistic
   code length N = 2(15), and explore various optimization techniques such
   as a chained processing element and a variable quantization scheme. This
   design is shown to scale to code lengths of up to, N = 2(21) enabled by
   its low logic use, low register use and simple datapaths, limited almost
   exclusively by the amount of available SRAM. It also supports an
   overlapped loading of frames, allowing full-throughput decoding with a
   single set of input buffers.}},

   measured must be carefully selected. This article illustrates that a
   radial parabolic gas velocity profile exists in mechanical cells, in
   some cases with significant variation in gas velocity as a function of
   radial distance from the center. An optimal sampling location for single
   point gas dispersion measurements in mechanical flotation machines is
   proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are widely used as drug carriers, texturizing agents, fat
   replacers, and reinforcing inclusions. Because of a growing interest in
   non-renewable materials, much research has focused on nanocellulose
   derivatives, which are biodegradable, biocompatible, and easily
   synthesized. Among nanocellulose derivatives, nanocrystalline cellulose
   (NCC) has been known for half a century, but its utility is limited
   because its colloidal stability is challenged by added salt. On the
   other hand, electrosterically stabilized nanocrystalline cellulose
   (ENCC) has recently been observed to have superior colloidal stability.
   Here, we use electrokinetic-sonic-amplitude (ESA) and acoustic
   attenuation spectroscopy to assess NCC and ENCC C-potentials and sizes
   over wide ranges of pH and ionic strength. The results attest to a soft,
   porous layer of dicarboxylic cellulose (DCC) polymers that expands and
   collapses with ionic strength, electrosterically stabilizing ENCC
   dispersions at ionic strengths up to at least 200 mmol L-1. (C) 2014

Title = {{Theoretical predictions of disclination loop growth for nematic liquid
   crystals under capillary confinement}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{The combination of low elasticity modulus, anisotropy, and
   responsiveness to external fields drives the rich variety of
   experimentally observed pattern formation in nematic liquid crystals
   under capillary confinement. External fields of interest in technology
   and fundamental physics are flow fields, electromagnetic fields, and
   surface fields due to confinement. In this paper we present theoretical
   and simulation studies of the pattern formation of nematic liquid
   crystal disclination loops under capillary confinement including
   branching processes from a m = +1 disclination line to two m = +1/2
   disclination curves that describe the postnucleation and growth regime
   of the textural transformation from radial to planar polar textures. The
   early postnucleation and growth of emerging disclination loops in
   cylindrical capillaries are characterized using analytical and
   computational methods based on the nematic elastica that takes into
   account line tension and line bending stiffness. Using subdiffusive
   growth and constant loop anisotropy, we found that the solution to the
   nematic elastica is a cusped elliptical geometry characterized by
   exponential curvature variations. The scaling laws that govern the loop
   growth reflect the tension to bending elasticity balance and reveal that
   the loop dilation rate depends on the curvature and normal velocity of
   the disclination. The line energy growth is accommodated by the decrease
   in branch-point curvature. These findings contribute to the evolving
   understanding of textural transformations in nematic liquid crystals
   under confinement using the nematic elastic methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Microcontact printing (mu CP) of proteins is widely used for biosensors
   and cell biology but is constrained to printing proteins adsorbed to a
   low free energy, hydrophobic surface to a high free energy, hydrophilic
   surface. This strongly limits mu CP as harsh chemical treatments are
   required to form a high energy surface. Here, we introduce humidified mu
   CP (H mu CP) of proteins which enables universal printing of protein on
   any smooth surface. We found that by flowing water in proximity to
   proteins adsorbed on a hydrophilized stamp, the water vapor diffusing
   through the stamp enables the printing of proteins on both low and high
   energy surfaces. Indeed, when proteins are printed using stamps with
   increasing spacing between water-filled microchannels, only proteins
   adjacent to the channels are transferred. The vapor transport through
   the stamp was modeled, and by comparing the humidity profiles with the
   protein patterns, 88\% relative humidity in the stamp was identified as
   the threshold for H mu CP. The molecular forces occurring between PDMS,
   peptides, and glass during printing were modeled ab initio to confirm
   the critical role water plays in the transfer. Using H mu CP, we
   introduce straightforward protocols to pattern multiple proteins
   side-by-side down to nanometer resolution without the need for expensive
   mask aligners, but instead exploiting self-alignment effects derived
   from the stamp geometry. Finally, we introduce vascularized H mu CP
   stamps with embedded microchannels that allow printing proteins as
   arbitrary, large areas patterns with nanometer resolution. This work
   introduces the general concept of water-assisted mu CP and opens new
   possibilities for ``solvent-assisted{''} printing of proteins and of
   other nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Brain stimulation, a therapy increasingly used for neurological and
   psychiatric disease, traditionally is divided into invasive approaches,
   such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), and noninvasive approaches, such
   as transcranial magnetic stimulation. The relationship between these
   approaches is unknown, therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, and the
   ideal stimulation site for a given technique is often ambiguous,
   limiting optimization of the stimulation and its application in further
   disorders. In this article, we identify diseases treated with both types
   of stimulation, list the stimulation sites thought to be most effective
   in each disease, and test the hypothesis that these sites are different
   nodes within the same brain network as defined by resting-state
   functional-connectivity MRI. Sites where DBS was effective were
   functionally connected to sites where noninvasive brain stimulation was
   effective across diseases including depression, Parkinson's disease,
   obsessive-compulsive disorder, essential tremor, addiction, pain,
   minimally conscious states, and Alzheimer's disease. A lack of
   functional connectivity identified sites where stimulation was
   ineffective, and the sign of the correlation related to whether
   excitatory or inhibitory noninvasive stimulation was found clinically
   effective. These results suggest that resting-state functional
   connectivity may be useful for translating therapy between stimulation
   modalities, optimizing treatment, and identifying new stimulation
   targets. More broadly, this work supports a network perspective toward
   understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disease, highlighting the
   therapeutic potential of targeted brain network modulation.}},

Abstract = {{Observing nonlinear optical quantum effects or implementing quantum
   information protocols using nonlinear optics requires moving to
   ever-smaller input light intensities. However, low light intensities
   generally mean weak optical nonlinearities, which are inadequate for
   many applications. Here we calculate the performance of four-wave mixing
   in various optical fibers for the case where one of the input beams is a
   single photon. We show that in tapered chalcogenide glass fibers
   (microwires) a single photon plus strong pump beam can produce a pair of
   photons with a probability of 0.1\%, much higher than in previous work
   on bulk and wave-guided crystal sources. Such a photon converter could
   be useful for creating large entangled photon states, for performing a
   loophole-free test of Bell's inequalities, and for quantum
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the flow stress and microstructure for Waspaloy was
   studied in the 950-1140 degrees C temperature range under constant true

   using isothermal hot compression testing. The impact of friction at the
   sample/anvil interface and adiabatic heating during deformation on the
   flow stress evolution was also examined. Mathematical models relating
   the flow stress to the deformation temperature and strain rate were
   derived using a power-law relationship. The strain rate sensitivity and
   the activation energy for hot deformation of Waspaloy were found to be
   considerably different for deformation in the subsolvus and supersolvus
   temperature ranges. According to the microstructural investigations, at
   950 degrees C dynamic recovery (DRV) was the main softening mechanism.
   By contrast, dynamic recrystallization (DRX), partial or complete,
   occurred at temperatures above 950 degrees C and resulted in flow
   softening. (C) 2014 Crown Copyright and Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present study, a 2-D finite-element method (FEM)
   thermal-fluid-stress model has been developed and validated for the twin
   roll casting (TRC) of AZ31 magnesium alloy. The model was then used to
   quantify how the thermo-mechanical history experienced by the strip
   during TRC would change as the equipment was scaled up from a laboratory
   size (roll diameter = 355 mm) to a pilot scale (roll diameter = 600mm)
   and to an industrial scale (roll diameter = 1150 mm) machine. The model
   predictions showed that the thermal history and solidification cooling
   rate experienced by the strip are not affected significantly by caster
   scale-up. However, the mechanical history experienced by the strip did
   change remarkably depending on the roll diameters. Casting with bigger
   rolls led to the development of higher stress levels at the strip
   surface. The roll separating force/mm width of strip was also predicted
   to increase significantly when the TRC was scaled to larger sizes. Using
   the model predicted results, the effect of both casting speed and roll
   diameter was integrated into an empirical equation to predict the exit
   temperature and the roll separating force for AZ31. Using this approach,
   a TRC process map was generated for AZ31 which included roll diameter
   and casting speed. (C) 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Abstract = {{To aid in the designing of an automatic control system, a steady state
   three-dimensional (3D) thermal model is developed to predict the
   temperature distributions for an industrial scale vertical direct chill
   (DC) slab caster for aluminium alloy AA-1050. A single domain approach
   for the liquid, mushy and solid regions is used by employing the
   enthalpy porosity technique. The convective heat transfer in the liquid
   region is taken into account by assuming a slag flow velocity field
   equal to the casting speed. The predicted thermal field is verified with
   the numerically predicted temperature field available in the literature
   and a reasonably good agreement is found. Detailed parametric study is
   carried out by varying important parameters of this process. Results of
   the temperature field, sump depth, mushy zone thickness, shell thickness
   and local surface heat flux are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled short circuiting gas metal arc welding (CSC-GMAW) was
   investigated as a potential solid freeform fabrication (SFF) process for
   AA2199. The low heat input of the CSC-GMAW process resulted in a cooling
   rate on the order of 840-3500 degrees C s(-1) being realised during
   deposition. The solidification time was then calculated to range between
   2-5 ms depending on the location within the weldment. The
   depositedmaterial displayed a fine (4.3 +/- 1 mu m) cellular structure,
   comparable to that previously reported for electron beam welding.
   Through comparison with the Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi (KGT) model for
   microstructural development during solidification, the solidification
   front velocity (SFV) of the CSC-GMAW process was estimated to be similar
   to 2-4.5x10(-4) m s(-1). Chemical analysis revealed lateral segregation
   of copper to the cell walls. TOF-SIMS revealed a homogeneous lateral
   lithium distribution, however depth profiling displayed some extent of
   lithium enrichment at the surface of the deposited material.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations for the wave radiation effect on the linear and
   nonlinear instabilities of rotating and non-rotating shallow flows are
   conducted using shallow-water equations. At a low convective Froude
   number, the results of the instabilities is a string of eddies. The
   coalescence between the neighbouring eddies decides the transverse
   mixing of the shallow shear flow. At a higher convective Froude number,
   the development of the shear flow is characterized by wave radiation and
   the production of shocklets. The radiation of waves in the non-rotating
   shallow flow is a phenomenon analogous to the radiation of sound in gas
   dynamics. In the rotating flow on the other hand, the shallow-flow
   instabilities are intensified due to rotational interference within a
   window of instability over a narrow range of Rossby numbers.}},

Abstract = {{We present a joint estimator of the time of arrival (TOA) and angle of
   arrival (AOA) for impulse radio ultrawideband (UWB) systems in which an
   antenna array is employed at the receiver. The proposed method consists
   of two steps: 1) preliminary estimation of the TOA and the average power
   delay profile (APDP) using energy-based threshold crossing and
   log-domain least-squares fitting, respectively; and 2) joint TOA
   refinement and AOA estimation by local 2-D maximization of a
   log-likelihood function (LLF) that employs the preliminary estimates
   from the first step. The derivation of the LLF relies on an original
   formulation in which the superposition of images from secondary paths is
   modeled as a Gaussian random process, whose second-order statistical
   properties are characterized by a wideband space-time correlation
   function. In addition to the APDP, this function incorporates a special
   gating mechanism to represent the onset of the secondary paths, thereby
   leading to a novel form of the LLF. Closed-form expressions for the
   Cramer-Rao bound on the variance of the TOA and AOA estimators are also
   derived, which formally take into account pulse overlap through this
   gating mechanism. In simulation experiments based on multipath UWB
   channelmodels featuring both diffuse and directional image fields, our
   approach exhibits superior performance to that of a competing scheme
   from the recent literature.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) is a versatile, powerful, sensitive and
   relatively fast technique for characterizing the physicochemical
   properties of materials. Due to its applicability in determining surface
   properties of solids in any form such as films, fibres and powders of
   both crystalline and amorphous structures, IGC became a popular
   technique for surface characterization, used extensively soon after its
   development. One of the most appealing features of IGC that led to its
   popularity among analytical scientists in early years was its similarity
   in principle to analytical gas chromatography (GC). The main aspect
   which distinguishes IGC experiments from conventional GC is the role of
   mobile and stationary phases. Contrary to conventional GC, the material
   under investigation is placed in the chromatographic column and a known
   probe vapour is used to provide information on the surface.
   In this review, information concerning the history, instrumentation and
   applications is discussed. Examples of the many experiments developed
   for IGC method are selected and described. Materials that have been
   analysed include polymers, pharmaceuticals, minerals, surfactants, and
   nanomaterials. The properties that can be determined using the IGC
   technique include enthalpy and entropy of sorption, surface energy
   (dispersive and specific components), work of co/adhesion, miscibility
   and solubility parameters, surface heterogeneity, glass transition
   temperature, and specific surface area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{The effect of urbanization on community-managed water supply: case study
   of Buea, Cameroon}},
Journal = {{COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{524-540}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Community-based projects play an important role in developing countries'
   efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goal of halving the
   population without access to improved water sources. Often associated
   with rural communities, they are increasingly being implemented in urban
   areas, where rural community-based management practices may be
   unsuitable. This research examines a small community-managed water
   supply scheme in Buea, a rapidly growing urban area in Cameroon.
   Stakeholder interviews and household questionnaires were used to better
   understand the implications of urbanization on community-managed water
   supply projects. The urban context adds management and planning
   pressures because of larger, more diverse, populations and rapid
   population growth. Urban community-managed schemes require an
   institutional framework to encourage participation, which is at an
   increased risk of failure due to the urban context. Finally, urban
   community-managed schemes need to be implemented in an institutional
   context, where they have legitimacy in the urban water supply framework,
   thereby allowing them to have access to the institutional and technical
   support they require to function sustainably. The consequence of failure
   is a return to `unimproved' water sources.}},

Title = {{Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in schizophrenia: A review}},

Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Findings from neuroimaging studies in patients with schizophrenia
   suggest widespread structural changes although the mechanisms through
   which these changes occur are currently unknown. Glutamatergic activity
   appears to be increased in the early phases of schizophrenia and may
   contribute to these structural alterations through an excitotoxic
   effect. The primary aim of this review was to describe the possible role
   of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in explaining the presence of
   neuroanatomical changes within schizophrenia. A Medline (R) literature
   search was conducted, identifying English language studies on the topic
   of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in schizophrenia, using the terms
   ``schizophreni{*}{''} and ``glutam{*}{''} and (({''}MRS{''} or ``MRI{''}
   or ``magnetic resonance{''}) or ({''}computed tomography{''} or
   ``CT{''})). Studies concomitantly investigating glutamatergic activity
   and brain structure in patients with schizophrenia were included.
   Results are discussed in the context of findings from preclinical
   studies. Seven studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria.
   These studies provide inconclusive support for the role of
   glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in the occurrence of structural
   changes within schizophrenia, with the caveat that there is a paucity of
   human studies investigating this topic. Preclinical data suggest that an
   excitotoxic effect may occur as a result of a paradoxical increase in
   glutamatergic activity following N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
   hypofunction. Based on animal Literature, glutamate-mediated
   excitotoxicity may account for certain structural changes present in
   schizophrenia, but additional human studies are required to substantiate
   these findings. Future studies should adopt a longitudinal design and
   employ magnetic resonance imaging techniques to investigate whether an
   association between glutamatergic activity and structural changes exists
   in patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All

Abstract = {{This paper studies the medium access design for secondary users (SUs)
   from a game-theoretic learning perspective. In consideration of the
   random return of primary users (PUs), a distributed SU access approach
   is presented based on an adaptive carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
   scheme, in which each SU accesses multiple idle frequency slots of a
   licensed frequency band with adaptive activity factors. The problem of
   finding optimal activity factors of SUs is formulated as a potential
   game, and the existence, feasibility, and optimality of Nash equilibrium
   (NE) are analyzed. Furthermore, to achieve NEs of the formulated game,
   learning-based algorithms are developed in which each SU independently
   adjusts its activity factors. Convergence properties of best-response
   dynamics and log-linear dynamics are studied. Subsequently, by learning
   other SUs' behavior from locally available information, the convergence
   with probability of one to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the
   globally optimal solution is investigated by both analysis and
   simulation.}},

   find the target position of each sensor iteratively, based on the

   corresponding to different sensors with different sensing ranges. Three
   sensor deployment algorithms are provided, which tend to either move
   sensors out of densely packed areas or place them in proper positions
   with respect to the boundaries of the MW-Voronoi regions. Under the
   proposed procedures, the sensors move in such a way that the coverage
   holes in the target field are reduced. Simulations confirm the

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to study the impact of climate change
   on the hazardous weather-related road accidents in the New Brunswick,
   Canada. We develop an Exposure to Weather-Accident Severity (EWAS) index
   multiplying accident and weather severity. The Negative Binomial
   Regression and Poisson regression models are applied to estimate the
   spatial-temporal relationship between the EWAS index and weather-related
   explanatory variables of road accidents. The regression results show
   that the surface-weather condition, weather, driver's gender,
   weather-driver's age, weather-driver's experience, and weather-vehicle's
   age have strong positive correlation with the EWAS index, while the
   surface-road alignment and surface-road characteristics have negative
   relationship with the EWAS index. The climate change model also
   indicates that the number of accidents declines during snowy and
   freezing days-most people stay at home and those who travel extra
   cautious-accidents do occur. The study suggests that the Road Safety
   Strategy 2015 of the Transport Canada should take a holistic approach to
   help minimize the incidences of severe road accident during the normal
   as well as hazardous weather conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the fuel efficiency of commercial hybrid
   electric vehicles (HEVs) and compares their performance with respect to
   standard gasoline vehicles in the context of cold Canadian urban
   environments. The effect of different factors on fuel efficiency is
   studied including road driving conditions (link type, city size),
   temperature, speed, cold-starts and eco-driving training. For this
   study, fuel consumption data at the link level in real-world conditions
   was used from a sample of 74 instrumented vehicles. From the study
   fleet, 21 vehicles were HEVs. Among other results, the beneficial fuel
   efficiency merits of hybrid vehicles were demonstrated with respect to
   gasoline cars, in particular at low speeds and in urban (city)
   environments. After controlling for other factors, sedan HEVs were 28\%
   more efficient than sedan gasoline vehicles. However, the low
   temperatures (below 0 degrees C) observed regularly during winter season
   in the study cities were identified as a detrimental factor to fuel
   economy. In winter, the fuel efficiency of HEVs decrease about 20\% with
   respect to summer. Other factors such as eco-driving training, city
   size, cold start and vehicle type were also found to be statistically
   significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfonamide antibiotics undergo transformation in the aquatic
   environment through biodegradation, photolysis, or hydrolysis. In this
   study, the residual antibacterial activity of 11 traniformation products
   (TPs) of sulfarnethoxazole (SMX) was investigated with regard to their
   in vitro growth and luminescence inhibition on Vibrio fischeri (30 mm
   and 24 h exposure). Two transformation products, 4-hydroxy-SMX and
   N-4-hydroxy-acetyl-SMX, were synthesized in-house and confirmed by
   nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry.
   Results of individual compound experiments showed that TPs modified at
   the para amino group still exhibit clear antibacterial effects, whereas
   TPs resulting from breakdown of the SMX structure lost this mechanism of
   action. 4-NO2- and 4-OH-SMX were found to inhibit growth to a clearly
   greater extent than the parent compound, SMX. In contrast, the
   N-4-acetyl- and N-4-hydroxy-acetyl-derivatives retain less than 10 and
   5\% of the effect of SMX on growth and luminescence inhibition,
   respectively. The effect of a mixture of para-modified TPs was observed
   to be additive. Considering the homologous series of sulfa drugs widely
   prescribed and their common mechanism of action, the potential
   environmental impact must consider the total amount of sulfonamide
   antibiotics and their derivative TPs, which might end up in a water
   body. Extrapolating the results obtained here for the para TPs of SMX to
   other sulfa drugs and determining the persistence and occurrence of
   these compounds in the aquatic environment is required for improved risk
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Rice bran, which is one of the major by products of paddy contain high
   quality proteins and edible oil apart from fibre, ash and NFE (nitrogen
   free extract). The existing solvent extraction method employs n-hexane
   as the most viable solvent for the extraction of oil from rice bran. But
   the high cost and scarce availability of n-hexane resulted in
   uneconomical extraction of rice bran oil. In this study, rice bran was
   ohmically heated for different time periods(1, 2 and 3 min) with
   different current values (5, 15 and 20 A) and with different
   concentration of sodium chloride (1 M, 0.1 M and 0.01 M) as conducting
   medium. The ohmically heated rice bran was subjected to extraction
   studies. Ohmic heating of rice bran of paddy varieties Red Triveni and
   Basmati reduced the extraction time by nearly 75 \% and 70 \%
   respectively and gave a maximum quantity of oil extracted when compared
   to bran, which was not ohmically heated. From the experiments with
   varying concentrations, residence time of ohmic heating and currents, it
   was found that ohmically heating the rice bran with 1 M sodium chloride
   solution and with a current value of 20 A for 3 min gave maximum oil
   extraction with minimum extraction time.}},

Abstract = {{In many multimedia applications, coded video is transmitted over error
   prone heterogeneous networks. Because of the predictive mechanism used
   in video coding, transmission error would propagate temporally and
   spatially and would result in significant quality losses. In order to
   address this problem, different error resilience methods have been
   proposed. One of the techniques, which is commonly used in video
   streaming, is unequal error protection (UEP) of scalable video coding
   (SVC). In this technique, different independent layers of an SVC stream
   are protected differently and based on their importance by using forward
   error correction (FEC) codes. Accurately analyzing the importance or
   utility of each video part is a critical component and would lead to a
   better protection and higher quality of the received video. Calculation
   of the utility is usually based on multiple decoding of sub-bitstreams
   and is highly computationally complex. In this work, we propose an
   accurate low complexity utility estimation technique that can be used in
   different applications. This technique estimates the utility of each
   network abstraction layer (NAL) by considering the error propagation to
   future frames. We utilize this method in an UEP framework with the
   scalable extension of H.264/AVC codec and it achieves almost the same
   performance as highly complex estimation techniques (an average loss of
   0.05 dB). Furthermore, we propose a low delay version of this technique
   that can be used in delay constrained application. The estimation
   accuracy and performance of our proposed technique are studied
   extensively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Optimal switching is developed in this brief. It is also shown in this
   brief that the absolute average power consumption can be less as
   compared with an SO design. The experimental results of a delta-sigma

Abstract = {{This paper generalizes the classical result of R. D. Mindlin for the
   axisymmetric problem related to the action of a concentrated force at
   the interior of an isotropic elastic half-space to include a bi-material
   region that is perturbed by an interface exhibiting flexural behaviour.
   The flexural behaviour of the interface is described by a
   Germain-Poisson-Kirchhoff thin plate theory. A Hankel integral transform
   technique is used to obtain an explicit result for the deflection of the
   flexural interface. The reduction of the solution to conventional
   results associated with both half-space problems and infinite space
   problems is indicated. Formal results are also presented for the case
   where the flexural behaviour of the plate is modelled by the plate
   theory proposed by E. Reissner.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses heat transfer performance of laminar non-Newtonian
   fluid flow in various configurations of coiled square tubes e.g.,
   in-plane spiral ducts, helical spiral ducts and conical spiral ducts.
   The non-Newtonian fluid considered in this study is the aqueous solution
   of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) which is modeled as power-law fluid.
   Effects of tube geometries, power-law index (concentration of CMC) and
   other parameters are quantified and discussed to analyze flow behavior
   and heat transfer performance. Results are compared with those for a
   straight square tube of the same length as that used to form the coils.
   A Figure of Merit is defined to compare the heat transfer performance of
   different geometries with respect to the pumping power. The results
   suggest that CMC solution yields better heat transfer performance of
   about twice than that of water at Re similar to 1000. Among all
   considered designs, helical coil gives the best heat transfer
   performance; however, when the pumping power is considered, in-plane
   coil design performs the best in term of Figure of Merit. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{To restore movements to paralyzed patients, neural prosthetic systems
   must accurately decode patients' intentions from neural signals. Despite
   significant advancements, current systems are unable to restore complex
   movements. Decoding reward-related signals from the medial intraparietal
   area (MIP) could enhance prosthetic performance. However, the dynamics
   of reward sensitivity in MIP is not known. Furthermore, reward-related
   modulation in premotor areas has been attributed to behavioral
   confounds. Here we investigated the stability of reward encoding in MIP
   by assessing the effect of reward history on reward sensitivity. We
   recorded from neurons in MIP while monkeys performed a delayed-reach
   task under two reward schedules. In the variable schedule, an equal
   number of small- and large-rewards trials were randomly interleaved. In
   the constant schedule, one reward size was delivered for a block of
   trials. The memory period firing rate of most neurons in response to
   identical rewards varied according to schedule. Using systems
   identification tools, we attributed the schedule sensitivity to the
   dependence of neural activity on the history of reward. We did not find
   schedule-dependent behavioral changes, suggesting that reward modulates
   neural activity in MIP. Neural discrimination between rewards was less
   in the variable than in the constant schedule, degrading our ability to
   decode reach target and reward simultaneously. The effect of schedule
   was mitigated by adding Haar wavelet coefficients to the decoding model.
   This raises the possibility of multiple encoding schemes at different
   timescales and reinforces the potential utility of reward information
   for prosthetic performance.}},

Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{106}},

Abstract = {{The Respiration Quotient (RQ) is a substrate-dependent respiration
   indicator. The determination of RQ-values from soil gas data obtained
   during the bioremediation of contaminated soils provides useful
   information about whether or not microbial respiration activity is
   specific to the microbial degradation of contaminants. Less attention
   has been paid to the uses of RQ-values for petroleum
   hydrocarbon-contaminated cold-climate soils under a wide range of low
   temperature regimes including sub-zero temperatures. In this study,
   RQ-values were determined for biotreated petroleum
   hydrocarbon-contaminated soils shipped from two cold-region sites and
   were validated using pilot-scale aerobic bioremediation experiments with
   various soil treatments, low temperature regimes and soil types. The
   RQ-values (0.57 to 0.78), empirically determined from CO2 and O-2 in
   soil gas, were consistently close to the theoretical RQ-values for
   target hydrocarbon fractions (0.65-0.8) only when the decrease in
   hydrocarbon concentration was statistically significant in the
   biotreated soils. In addition to the RQ-values, a strong linearity was
   observed in the RQ plots for CO2 production and O-2 consumption, but
   only for the soils in which hydrocarbon biodegradation activity was
   significantly enhanced. Using confirmed hydrocarbon and microbial data
   for the occurrence of hydrocarbon biodegradation, the RQ plot
   characteristics (RQ-values and linearity) proved to be considerably
   relevant to hydrocarbon biodegradation. Due to the substrate-dependency
   of the RQ-values, conventional soil gas monitoring activities involved
   in the bioremediation and management of contaminated soils at remote
   cold sites can be more effective and meaningful by indicating enhanced
   microbial activity specific to petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation. (C)

Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{112-118}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Phenotyping of drought resistance traits in rice is challenging at the
   field level due to the spatial variability of soil characteristics
   linked to soil water content. Apparent soil electrical conductivity
   (ECa) mapping may therefore be useful for characterizing spatial
   variability and improving phenotyping efforts in drought screening
   trials. ECa mapping was conducted over two seasons in lowland rice
   drought phenotyping trials. ECa was positively correlated with clay
   content and soil depth, and negatively correlated with volumetric soil
   water content during periods of moderate to severe drought. In addition,
   ECa was negatively correlated with indicators of plant performance
   including canopy temperature, normalized difference vegetation index,
   biomass, plant height, and grain yield. The results suggest that clay
   content and topsoil depth were the primary factors influencing the
   timing and severity of the drought response during the dry down of the
   field. Overall, the results illustrate the usefulness of ECa mapping for
   the spatio-temporal characterization of soil heterogeneity that
   influences plant performance under drought in lowland rice fields. ECa
   mapping can be useful for optimizing experimental plot layouts to ensure
   their uniformity and to improve validity of drought phenotyping and

Abstract = {{Reliable and fast segmentation of the human cerebellum with its complex
   architecture of lobes and lobules has been a challenge for the past
   decades. Emerging knowledge of the functional integration of the
   cerebellum in various sensori-motor and cognitive-behavioral circuits
   demands new automatic segmentation techniques, with accuracies similar
   to manual segmentations, but applicable to large subject numbers in a
   reasonable time frame. This article presents the development and
   application of a novel pipeline for rapid automatic segmentation of the
   human cerebellum and its lobules (RASCAL) combining patch-based
   label-fusion and a template library of manually labeled cerebella of 16
   healthy controls from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping
   (ICBM) database. Leave-one-out experiments revealed a good agreement
   between manual and automatic segmentations (Dice kappa=0.82). Intraclass
   correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to test reliability of
   segmented volumes and were highest (ICC>0.9) for global measures (total
   and hemispherical grey and white matter) followed by larger lobules of
   the posterior lobe (ICC>0.8). Further we applied the pipeline to all 152
   young healthy controls of the ICBM database to look for hemispheric and
   gender differences. The results demonstrated larger native space volumes
   in men then women (mean (+/- SD) total cerebellar volume in women=217
   cm(3) (+/- 26), men=259 cm(3) (+/- 29); P<0.001). Significant
   gender-by-hemisphere interaction was only found in stereotaxic space
   volumes for white matter core (men>women) and anterior lobe volume
   (women>men). This new method shows great potential for the precise and
   efficient analysis of the cerebellum in large patient cohorts. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional control-volume-based finite difference code is
   developed to simulate a vertical direct chill casting process for
   aluminum alloy AA-1050. The rectangular slab caster is fitted with a
   porous plate occupying 50\% of the width of the ingot and is placed near
   the top in the central region. The turbulence in the liquid sump is
   modeled employing a popular version of the low Reynolds number
   kappa-epsilon model. The enthalpy-porosity technique is used to solve
   the coupled melt flow and solidification heat transfer problem. To model
   the porous plate, the Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy equation is
   considered. The code is first verified with the available experimental
   solidification profile data for a direct chill caster of a rolling ingot
   AA-3104. The effects of casting speed and heat transfer coefficient at
   the metal-mold contact region on solidification characteristics are
   investigated. By varying the latent heat of solidification of the said
   alloy, sensitivity analysis is also carried out. The temperature and
   velocity profiles, along with the solid shell thickness, sump depth,
   mushy thickness, and local surface heat flux, are presented and
   discussed. All results reported here are new and have direct industrial
   significance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a probabilistic method to infer the visual-task

   based on the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) that employs a first
   order Markov process to predict the coordinates of fixations given the
   task. The prediction confidence level of each task-dependent model is
   used in a Bayesian inference formulation, whereby the task with the
   maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability is selected. We applied this
   technique to a challenging dataset consisting of eye movement
   trajectories obtained from subjects viewing monochrome images of real
   scenes tasked with answering questions regarding the scenes. The results
   show that the HMM approach, combined with a clustering technique, can be
   a reliable way to infer visual-task from eye movements data. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Surface water quality monitoring is one of the responsibilities of a
   number of provincial and federal environmental departments in Canada. In
   Saskatchewan, the Ministry of Environment is responsible for the
   province water quality monitoring network. The sampling effort was
   initiated 40 years ago and has been ongoing since, with varying degrees
   of spatial and temporal coverage. The main objective of the Saskatchewan
   monitoring network is the assessment of ambient water quality status. In
   addition, one of the main uses of the generated water quality data is
   the calculation of a Water Quality Index. The adequacy of the monitoring
   network to perform these tasks needs to be validated. The objective of
   this study is to provide a statistical assessment of two of the
   monitoring network main aspects, the water quality variables and their
   sampling frequency. A new rationalization approach is applied for the
   assessment and reselection of water quality variables. The proposed
   approach provides, in a systematic way, the optimal combinations of
   variables to continue measuring, variables that may be redundant and
   could be considered for discontinuance, and variables that may need to
   be added to the list of variables being measured. The confidence
   interval around the mean is used as the main criterion for the sampling
   frequency assessment. A design chart is provided for the sampling
   frequency assessment, which is easy to use, and provides an initial
   assessment of the number of samples required to provide a mean value
   with a predefined error percentage.}},

Abstract = {{Problems in power distribution system reconfiguration (PDSR), such as
   service restoration, power loss reduction, and expansion planning, are
   usually formulated as complex multi-objective and multiconstrained
   optimization problems. Several evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been
   developed to deal with PDSR problems, but the majority of EAs still
   demand high running time when applied to large-scale distribution
   systems (thousands of buses and switches). This paper presents a new
   approach for service restoration in large scale distribution systems
   that employs a discrete differential evolution with ancestor tree
   (DE-Tree). We combine the node-depth encoding (NDE) to represent
   computationally the electrical topology of the system and the ancestor
   tree presented here to implement differential evolution for service
   restoration problems. The ancestor tree is used to build a list of
   elementary movements that maps one solution in the search space into
   another, thus capturing the ``difference{''} between forests encoded
   with the NDE, which is essential in the search engine of differential
   evolution. The use of an ancestor tree is not only central to implement
   differential mutation in our algorithm but also can track the sequence
   of switching operations in the restoration of the system after the
   optimization process is finished. The proposed approach makes
   differential evolution suitable for treating combinatorial optimization
   problems related to PDSR. Results presented on distribution system
   reconfiguration problems suggest the benefits and fast convergence of
   the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDThis work deals with the effect of several additives on the
   morphology of calcium sulfate dihydrate (DH) crystals, produced by
   reactive crystallization involving strong CaCl2-HCl solutions.
   Experiments were conducted at 40 degrees C under various conditions,
   namely homogeneous and seeded (heterogeneous) crystallization in
   CaCl2/HCl solutions ranging from very dilute (0.42molL(-1)/0.04molL(-1))
   to very concentrated (1.8molL(-1)/6.3molL(-1)).
   RESULTSIn the absence of additives a distinct difference in crystal
   morphology was observed depending on solution composition. Homogeneously
   formed DH crystals from dilute solution were in the form of needles. DH
   crystals formed in concentrated acid solution were thick elongated
   plates. The most influential additives in concentrated solutions were
   CTAB (cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide), PAA (polyacrylic acid) and PVS
   (polyvinyl sulfonic acid). CTAB favoured formation of industrially
   interesting thick slab crystals. In contrast PAA favoured the formation
   of elongated and thinner crystals as a result of preferential crystal
   plane adsorption. PVS had a detrimental effect on DH crystal nucleation
   and growth explained by its polymeric structure.
   CONCLUSIONApart from PVS, CTAB and PAA no influence was seen for the
   majority of additives tested. This was attributed to lack of ionization
   caused by the highly acidic solutions. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical

   method: Towards the improvement of biocompatibility}},

Abstract = {{A 316L stainless steel (316L-SS) surface was electrochemically polished
   (EP) in an electrolyte of a new chemical composition at different cell
   voltages, with the aim of improving its corrosion resistance and
   biocompatibility. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results revealed that
   the EP-formed oxide films were characterized by a significantly higher
   atomic Cr/Fe ratio and film thickness, in comparison to the
   naturally-grown passive oxide film formed on the untreated (control)
   316L-SS surface. As a result of the increase in the oxide film thickness
   and relative Cr enrichment, the EP-treated 316L-SS surfaces offered a
   notable improvement in general corrosion resistance and pitting
   potential. In addition, the attachment of endothelial cells (ECs) and
   smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to the 316L-SS surfaces revealed a positive
   effect of electropolishing on the preferential attachment of ECs, thus
   indicating that the EP surfaces could be endothelialized faster than the
   control (unmodified) 316L-SS surface. Furthermore, the EP surfaces
   showed a much lower degree of thrombogenicity in experiments with the
   platelet-rich plasma. Therefore, the use of the electrochemical
   polishing technique in treating a 316L-SS surface, under the conditions
   presented in this paper, indicates a significant improvement in the
   surface's performance as an implant material. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Index-3 augmented Lagrangian formulations with projections of velocities
   and accelerations represent an efficient and robust method to carry out
   the forward-dynamics simulation of multibody systems modeled in
   dependent coordinates. Existing formalisms, however, were only
   established for holonomic systems, for which the expression of the
   constraints at the position-level is known. In this work, an extension
   of the original algorithms for nonholonomic systems is introduced.
   Moreover, projections of velocities and accelerations have two side
   effects: they modify the kinetic energy of the system and they
   contribute to the constraint reaction forces. Although the effects of
   the projections on the energy have been studied by several authors,
   their role in the calculation of the reaction forces has not been
   described so far. In this work, expressions to determine the constraint
   reactions from the Lagrange multipliers of the dynamic equations and the
   Lagrange multipliers of the velocity and acceleration projections are
   introduced. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can be
   used to expand the capabilities of index-3 augmented Lagrangian
   algorithms, making them able to deal with nonholonomic constraints and
   provide correct reaction efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Many techniques have been developed for analyzing and evaluating
   mechanical systems for the purpose of improving design and control, such
   as the operational space formulation. It has been been shown to be a
   useful tool when working with robotic manipulators, but has not been
   extended to consider rovers. Rovers are fundamentally different due to
   the wheel-ground contact, that does not exist for fixed-base systems. In
   this paper, several different aspects of the operations space
   formulation, inertial properties, control, multi-arm systems,
   redundancy, and unactuated coordinates are investigated in the context
   of rovers. By considering a different interpretation of the operational
   space of a rover, several sets of generalized coordinates were chosen to
   represent the movement of two example rovers. Simulations were performed
   to demonstrate how these choices of generalized coordinates can be used
   to analyze various characteristics of the rovers and can improve the
   behavior for certain maneuvers, such as wheel walking.}},

Abstract = {{The optimum dimensions of a two-limb Schonflies motion generator, to
   maximize the overall stiffness of the robot structure is the subject of
   this paper. In the six-dimensional Cartesian space, for a mechanical
   system, six independent stiffnesses can be defined: three translational
   along three independent directions and three rotational about axes
   parallel to these directions. In this study, the objective is to
   maximize the maximum translational and rotational stiffnesses when the
   robot is at a specific pose. To this end, first, the stiffness matrix of
   the robot is obtained using the concept of the generalized spring;
   second, by introducing the translational and rotational stiffness
   indices kappa(r) and kappa(r) respectively, two objective functions are
   defined. For the optimization procedure, a genetic algorithm (GA) is
   used. As a result, three different designs are introduced, their
   stiffness performance over a test trajectory then being analyzed. At the
   end, the sensitivity analysis of the robot stiffness with respect to
   some design parameters is studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The operation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack
   with a dead-end anode requires careful consideration on the gas and
   water management. Water accumulation at the anode and the nitrogen
   crossover from cathode to anode lead to performance deterioration over
   time. The accumulated water and nitrogen need to be removed properly by
   purging method to ensure good and stable stack performance. Thus, the
   careful selection of the operating parameters - inlet humidification,
   stoichiometry, and operating current - is the key factor for ensuring
   efficient water and gas management. This study aims at the experimental
   and numerical evaluation of the effect of the key operating parameters
   on the transient performance of a dead-end anode fuel cell stack. The
   experiments were carried out on a stack with 24 cells and a catalyst
   active area of 300 cm(2). By employing a validated transient two-phase
   mathematical model of a PEMFC with a dead-end anode, numerical
   simulations were performed which yield a better and deeper understanding
   of local distribution of water and species, i.e., hydrogen, oxygen,
   water vapor and nitrogen.
   The results suggest that the performance deterioration over time is
   closely related to the choice of the operating conditions. The study
   reveals that the anode and cathode inlet conditions become a limiting
   factor for the stack performance. Liquid accumulation at the anode is
   found to be strongly related to the inlet humidification as well as
   water transport across the membrane, whereas the cathode stoichiometry
   affects the nitrogen crossover. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Electro-dewatering (ED) increases biosolids dryness from 10-15 to
   30-50\%, which helps wastewater treatment facilities control disposal
   costs. Previous work showed that high temperatures due to Joule heating
   during ED inactivate total coliforms to meet USEPA Class A biosolids
   requirements. This allows biosolids land application if the requirements
   are still met after the storage period between production and
   application. In this study, we examined bacterial regrowth and odour
   emissions during the storage of ED biosolids. No regrowth of total
   coliforms was observed in ED biosolids over 7 d under aerobic or
   anaerobic incubations. To mimic on-site contamination during storage or
   transport, ED samples were seeded with untreated sludge. Total coliform
   counts decreased to detection limits after 4 d in inoculated samples.
   Olfactometric analysis of ED biosolids odours showed that odour
   concentrations were lower compared to the untreated and heat-treated
   control biosolids. Furthermore, under anaerobic conditions, odorous
   reduced sulphur compounds (methanethiol, dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl
   disulphide) were produced by untreated and heat-treated biosolids, but
   were not detected in the headspaces above ED samples. The data
   demonstrate that ED provides advantages not only as a dewatering
   technique, but also for producing biosolids with lower microbial counts
   and odour levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Today's nanofabrication methods have enabled nanoparticles to be
   synthesized having optical properties which are tailored to a variety of
   specific applications in the realms of biological and energy systems.
   These systems are distinctive in that light is absorbed predominantly by
   the nanoparticles which are distributed throughout the fluid. Here we
   report the first experimental study which quantitatively compares
   nanoparticle dispersions {[}amorphous carbon nanoparticles dispersed in
   ethylene glycol and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) dispersed in
   distilled water] to conventional commercial materials (TiNOX (R) coated
   copper substrate) for their performance as selective solar absorbers. It
   has been found that under similar operating conditions, higher average
   stagnation temperatures are achievable if the electromagnetic radiation
   is allowed to directly interact with the bulk of the fluid (which is the
   case in a volumetric system). Moreover, the performance of these
   volumetric systems is sensitive to the amount (volume fraction) of the
   nanoparticles dispersed which, in the limit, approaches surface
   absorption for high volume fractions. Furthermore, the spatial
   temperature distribution has been found to be consistent with the
   underlying theory of volumetric absorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Water is one of the most abundant resources on Earth and the study of
   its phase changes holds many practical implications to both science and
   technology. In the past, several investigations have researched aspects
   of the solidification process that occurs when water freezes to ice. One
   of these facets is its associated linear growth velocity. Traditionally,
   this has been measured either through free growth or capillary tube
   techniques. The current study uses a methodology where measuring this
   velocity is accomplished through the use of infrared imaging. A
   conventional velocity vs. sub-cooling plot was generated and the data
   was fitted to a modified Noyes and Whitney growth model. Furthermore,
   with the use of the thermal images, a novel model was developed to
   calculate the percentage of water that was frozen after the initial
   growth step. From this, a conversion vs. sub-cooling plot was produced
   and the results showed that for the primary growth step, less ice forms
   under higher sub-coolings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a multimodal approach to study safety at
   intersections by simultaneously analysing the safety and flow outcomes
   for both motorized and non-motorized traffic. This study uses an
   extensive inventory of signalized and non-signalized intersections on
   the island of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, containing disaggregate
   motor-vehicle, cyclist and pedestrian flows, injury data, geometric
   design, traffic control and built environment characteristics in the
   vicinity of each intersection. Bayesian multivariate Poisson models are
   used to analyze the injury and traffic flow outcomes and to develop
   safety performance functions for each mode at both facilities. After
   model calibration, contributing injury frequency factors are identified.
   Injury frequency and injury risk measures are then generated to carry
   out a comparative study to identify which mode is at greatest risk at
   intersections in Montreal. Among other results, this study identified
   the significant effect that motor-vehicle traffic imposes on cyclist and
   pedestrian injury occurrence. Motor-vehicle traffic is the main risk
   determinant for all injury and intersection types. This highlights the
   need for safety improvements for cyclists and pedestrians who are, on
   average, at 14 and 12 times greater risk than motorists, respectively,
   at signalized intersections. Aside from exposure measures, this work
   also identifies some geometric design and built environment
   characteristics affecting injury occurrence for cyclists, pedestrians
   and motor-vehicle occupants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{191-196}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent findings suggest that cortical gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)
   levels may provide a surrogate marker for a number of psychiatric and
   neurological conditions, as well as behavioural traits. However, the
   natural variability of GABA levels in the human brain over long periods
   of time (>8 days) has not yet been studied. The purpose of this work was
   to investigate the long-term variability of GABA concentrations in the
   human occipital cortex. Nineteen healthy male participants were
   recruited and underwent two sessions of magnetic resonance spectroscopy
   (MRS) to determine occipital GABA levels with an average between-session
   interval of 7 months. We assessed between-session variability, as well
   as the correlation between session 1 and session 2 GABA measurements.
   The mean coefficient of variation between sessions was 43\% (bootstrap
   95\% confidence interval: 2.5, 6.4), which is comparable to reported
   GABA variability measurements over much shorter time intervals (<8
   days). A significant positive correlation was observed between session 1
   and session 2 GABA measurements (r = 0.53, p = 0.014), and the
   intra-class correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0.52 which was
   also statistically significant (p = 0.012). These findings establish
   experimentally that GABA concentrations in the occipital cortex, as
   measured by MRS, are relatively stable over periods as long as 7 months.
   The findings have significant implications for the internal validity of
   longitudinal studies of GABA levels in the human brain, and they lend
   foundational support to studies relating GABA levels to behavioural
   traits in healthy individuals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights

Abstract = {{A systematic study on the activation of photoluminescence from
   luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles (LPSiNPs) by oxidation in
   aqueous media containing sodium tetraborate (borax) is presented. The
   treatment promotes surface oxidation of the porous silicon skeleton and
   consequently generates an electronically passivated material.
   Photoluminescence is ascribed to quantum confinement effects and to
   defects localized at the Si-SiO2 interface, and the strong
   photoluminescence is attributed to passivation of nonradiative surface
   defects. The oxidation treatment (carried out at 20 degrees C) generates
   a gradual blue shift of the photoluminescence peak wavelength (from 800
   nm to 630 nm), while the bandwidth remains relatively constant
   (approximate to 210 nm). During the treatment period, the external
   quantum yield ((ex) = 365 nm) of photoluminescence increases to a
   maximum value of 23\% after 200 min, and then it decreases at longer
   treatment times. The decrease in photoluminescence intensity at longer
   times is attributed to degradation and dissolution of the nanoparticles,
   which is inhibited at higher nanoparticle concentrations or by addition
   of free silicic acid.}},

   increase in MWNT loading. Furthermore, the hydrophobic MWNTs initially
   enhanced dissolution up until a concentration of 5 ppm, at which point
   the rates began to return to their nominal values. It was also found
   that the addition of either type of MWNT did not significantly affect
   the total number of moles of methane dissolved in the water.}},

Abstract = {{Bioremediation is a potentially cost-effective solution for petroleum
   contamination in cold region sites. This study investigates the extent
   of biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons (C16-C34) in a pilot-scale
   biopile experiment conducted at 15 C for periods up to 385 days, with a
   clayey soil, from a crude oil-impacted site in northern Canada. Although
   several studies on bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated
   soils from cold region sites have been reported for coarse-textured,
   sandy soils, there are limited studies of bioremediation of petroleum
   contamination in fine-textured, clayey soils. Our results indicate that
   aeration and moisture addition was sufficient for achieving 47\%
   biodegradation and an endpoint of 530 mg/kg for non-volatile (C16-C34)
   petroleum hydrocarbons. Nutrient amendment with 95 mg-N/kg showed no
   significant effect on biodegradation compared to a control system
   without nutrient but similar moisture content. In contrast, in a biopile
   amended with 1340 mg-N/kg, no statistically significant biodegradation
   of non-volatile fraction was detected. Terminal Restriction Fragment
   Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses of alkB and 16S rRNA genes
   revealed that inhibition of hydrocarbon biodegradation was associated
   with a lack of change in microbial community composition. Overall, our
   data suggests that biopiles are feasible for attaining the
   bioremediation endpoint in clayey soils. Despite the significantly lower
   biodegradation rate of 0.009 day(-1) in biopile tank compared to 0.11
   day(-1) in slurry bioreactors for C16-C34 hydrocarbons, the
   biodegradation extents for this fraction were comparable in these two
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a gradient elasticity shell formulation is presented for
   free vibration analysis of single-walled carbon nanotube placed on
   Winkler/Pasternak foundation. The proposed formulation is based on the
   combined strain-inertia gradient elasticity. The combined strain-inertia
   gradient elasticity provides an extension to the classical equations of
   elasticity with additional higher-order spatial derivatives of strains
   and two material length scale parameters related to the inertia and
   strain gradients, which enable formulation to investigate the size
   effect on the dynamic behavior of nanotubes. The effects of the length
   scale parameters, aspect ratio of single-walled carbon nanotube and
   foundation parameters on the fundamental frequencies for different
   values half-axial wave number and circumferential wave number are
   investigated. The natural frequencies obtained from the proposed shell
   formulation show the effects of size-dependent properties. It can be
   concluded that a continuum model enriched with higher-order inertia
   terms has been proposed as alternative to the continuum description
   obtained with classical elasticity theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Carbon dioxide activated ladle slag binder}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{214-221}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The viability of converting steelmaking ladle slag into cementing binder
   through carbon dioxide activation was studied. Two typical ladle slag
   materials were examined: one with higher silica content and one with
   higher alumina content. It was found that ladle slag with higher silica
   content contained more calcium silicate compounds and less free lime,
   leading to higher carbonation reactivity in its as-received form. Ladle
   slag with higher alumina could not be activated directly by carbon
   dioxide to gain strength. Heat treatment with silica addition was thus
   developed to produce more calcium silicates and reduce free lime
   content. Findings reveal that carbonation reactivity is not solely based
   on chemical compositions of the material, rather, the constituting
   mineralogical phases. Calcium silicates of any polymorph played a
   critical role in the formation of the strength-contributing binder
   matrix activated by carbonation. Strength gain was the result of
   simultaneous formation of calcium silicate hydrates and calcium
   carbonates. To produce value-added ladle slag as cementing binder to
   replace Portland cement, silicon is recommended as deoxidation agent in
   steel refinery process. The building products based on carbonation
   activated ladle slag have shown much reduced embodied energy and much
   reduced natural material consumption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We use a two-dimensional phase-field model coupled to a nucleation
   mechanism to study the evolution of interdendritic liquid pools during
   late-stage solidification of Mg-Al alloys under spatially uniform
   temperature and constant cooling rates. We obtain the channel size
   distribution (CSD) of liquid pools at solid fractions close to those
   where eutectic phase is expected to form and investigate the influence
   of cooling rate on the morphology of the CSD at different solidification
   stages. Our results show that the CSD is unimodal, exhibiting a peak at
   small channel widths followed by a shoulder and longer decay tail at
   large channel widths. This feature is correlated to the presence of two
   distinct liquid regions, small channels between secondary branches of
   the primary phase and larger channels between adjacent grains. We
   construct a cooling-rate/solid-fraction morphology diagram that shows
   the relative importance of the shoulder in the CSD. We characterize the
   mean and standard deviation of the CSD and show that, within the range
   of data examined, the mean channel size vs. cooling rate curves scale
   with solid fraction. The numerical tools developed for this work can
   also be used to analyze experimental results. We include the analysis of
   two experimental micrographs previously published by Paliwal et al. (C)

Abstract = {{Engineered nanoparticles of diverse forms are being profoundly used for
   various applications and demand ecologically benign synthesis processes.
   Conventional chemical methods employed for the syntheses of
   nanoparticles are environmentally unfriendly and energy intensive.
   Biologically inspired biofabrication approaches that utilize naturally
   existing microorganisms or plant extracts or biomaterials might overcome
   these issues. The present investigation for the first time shows the
   synthesis of small and monodispersed cadmium selenide nanoparticles
   utilizing the plant pathogenic fungus, Helminthosporum solani upon
   incubating with an aqueous solution of CdCl2 and SeCl4 under ambient
   conditions. Multiple physical characterizations involving ultraviolet
   visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy, selected area electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy confirmed the production, purity, optical and surface
   characteristics, crystalline nature, size and shape distributions, and
   elemental composition of the nanoparticles. Pluralities of the particles
   are monodisperse spheres with a mean diameter of 5.5 +/- 2 nm, are
   hydrophilic, highly stable with a broad photoluminescence and 1\%
   quantum yield. This approach provides an alternative facile route for
   the biofabrication of quantum dot that is reliable, environmentally
   friendly, and lends itself directly for the creation of fluorescent
   biological labels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a rapidly developing additive
   manufacturing technique, with advantages in flexibility and low material
   waste. Many parameters used in a SLS process are determined by powder
   type: blended powders have limitations due to wetting and diffusion,
   while prealloyed powders require processing in a small temperature range
   dictated by the alloy composition. As an alternative to these, a coated
   powder was fabricated by electrochemical means. This tin-copper
   composite powder was compared with a blend of tin and copper powders,
   using metallographic, crystallographic, and thermal analysis techniques
   as well as SLS. It was found that, because of the uniform distribution
   of liquid and increased contact between phases in the composite powder,
   sintering took place in the composite powder but not in the blend. After
   a homogenization treatment, mechanical testing of the sintered samples
   showed that the strength and ductility were comparable to high-porosity
   materials produced using other techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Static deflection as well as free and forced nonlinear vibration of thin
   square plates made of hyperelastic materials are investigated. Two types
   of materials, namely rubber and soft biological tissues, are considered.
   The involved physical (material) nonlinearities are described through
   Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Ogden hyperelastic laws; geometrical
   nonlinearities are modeled by the Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory.
   Dynamic local models are first built in the vicinity of a static
   configuration of interest that has been previously calculated. This
   gives rise to the approximation of the plate's behavior in the form of a
   system of ordinary differential equations with quadratic and cubic
   nonlinear terms in displacement. Numerical results are compared and
   validated in the static case via a commercial FE software package: they
   are found to be accurate for deflections reaching 100 times the
   thickness of the plate. The frequency shift between low- and
   large-amplitude vibrations weakens with an increased initial deflection.

   interconnectivity of the pores, was analyzed to quantify the effect of
   stretching on the membrane performance. The cold stretching step was
   found to be the important one for promoting interconnection between the
   pores. Furthermore, it was shown that applying a low strain rate
   improved the permeability of the membranes. Finally, no maximum was
   observed in the permeability by increasing the stretch ratio during the

   provided solvatophilic groups (the ester in MMA or ethylene glycol units
   in OEGMA) to the terpolymers and their composition was varied to study
   the effect of solvatophilicity on the terpolymer phase separation and
   re-dissolution processes in the IL. The concentration of solvatophilic
   groups in the terpolymer was not only shown to affect phase separation
   temperature significantly, but also demonstrated to be crucial in
   driving the re-dissolution process. A minimum concentration of
   solvatophilic groups to facilitate reversible phase separation was in
   the range of 20-30 mol\% for both terpolymer systems. Solution
   concentration (1-10 wt\%) also showed significant effects on phase
   separation temperature but lower concentration did not guarantee
   improved re-dissolution. Phase separation temperature was also
   demonstrated to be inversely proportional to the polymer molecular
   weight (7.3-22.5 kg mol(-1)). Finally, the reversibility of phase

Abstract = {{Cell navigation is directed by inhomogeneous distributions of
   extracellular cues. It is well known that noise plays a key role in
   biology and is present in naturally occurring gradients at the micro-and
   nanoscale, yet it has not been studied with gradients in vitro. Here, we
   introduce novel algorithms to produce ordered and random gradients of
   discrete nanodots called digital nanodot gradients (DNGs) -according to
   monotonic and non-monotonic density functions. The algorithms generate
   continuous DNGs, with dot spacing changing in two dimensions along the
   gradient direction according to arbitrary mathematical functions, with
   densities ranging from 0.02\% to 44.44\%. The random gradient algorithm
   compensates for random nanodot overlap, and the randomness and spatial
   homogeneity of the DNGs were confirmed with Ripley's K function. An
   array of 100 DNGs, each 400x400 mm(2), comprising a total of 57 million
   200x200 nm(2) dots was designed and patterned into silicon using
   electron-beam lithography, then patterned as fluorescently labeled IgGs
   on glass using lift-off nanocontact printing. DNGs will facilitate the
   study of the effects of noise and randomness at the micro-and nanoscales
   on cell migration and growth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the thermal conductivity of cemented backfill.
   Two major measurement methods, namely, steady state and unsteady state,
   are compared. Effect of backfill design parameters such as pulp density
   and binder content, along with sample homogeneity and sample size, are
   studied. Thermal conductivity of backfill with and without sodium
   silicate additive, as a new binder, is investigated. A novel method for
   interpreting thermal conductivity of backfill is presented by
   introducing backfill as amultiphase porous material for which the
   effects of physical parameters, such as degree of saturation, porosity,
   and thermal conductivity of solid particles, are studied. The results of
   this research help to better understand the thermal interaction of
   backfill with the surrounding rock mass and therefore contribute to
   progressive improvement of backfill technology.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a low-cost dispersion-tuned actively mode-locked laser with
   long coherence length (up to 3 cm) by combining a wide-band, high
   reflectivity, and high-dispersion chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG)
   with a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA). The dependence
   of the tuning characteristics on the varying physical length of CFBG in
   the cavity is studied experimentally and theoretically in the CFBG and
   RSOA based laser for the first time. The results show that the
   wavelength tuning range reduces when the harmonic number is increasing.
   Moreover, the high-dispersion and high-reflectivity CFBG yields high
   optical signal to noise ratio (>48 dB), narrow spectral width (lower
   than 0.033 nm), and more than 3-cm coherence length in the
   harmonicallymode-locked laser. This low-cost dispersion tuned
   mode-locked laser with wide tuning range, stable and small
   time-bandwidth product, and long coherence length can lead to enhanced

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the error and diversity performances of
   full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) single-relay systems under the
   effect of residual self-interference. The variance of this interference
   is assumed to be proportional to the lambda-th power of the transmitted
   power (0 <= lambda <= 1). The study considers the cooperative linear
   relaying protocol with direct source-destination link and the dual-hop
   scheme without direct link, both under uncoded and coded frameworks. At
   first, closed-form pairwise error probability expressions are derived
   for the uncoded systems, which are then used to obtain tight bounds to
   the bit error rate (BER) of the coded systems. To shed an insight on the
   diversity behavior, asymptotic expressions at high transmission powers
   are also presented. Different from previous works that treat the direct
   link as interference, this paper shows that FD linear relaying systems
   with a suitable precoder can attain the same diversity function as their
   half-duplex (HD) counterparts. However, further analysis shows that HD
   orthogonal AF using a superposition constellation is asymptotically
   optimal in terms of maximum coding gain. In addition, it is shown that
   the diversity of FD dual-hop systems is a decreasing function of lambda
   and is equal to zero when lambda = 1. Although HD relaying is
   asymptotically optimal under the considered protocols and interference
   model, illustrative results show that FD relaying is advantageous at
   practical BER levels when lambda is sufficiently small.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber optical parametric oscillators (FOPOs) contain multiple
   longitudinal modes arising from the hundreds of meters to a kilometer
   scale length of their cavity. To obtain better understanding of the
   longitudinal modes and to find out how to suppress them, a model for the
   operation of FOPOs is introduced. This model utilizes the
   sinusoidal-input describing function (SIDF) as a quasi-linear
   approximation of the nonlinear dynamics of parametric amplification.
   Applying this model, the SIDF of the FOPO is derived, which predicts
   that the origin of the longitudinal modes is the presence of the cavity
   round-trip delay term in the characteristic equation (the denominator)
   of the transfer function. To eliminate the effect of the delay term, a
   modified Smith predictor control scheme has been applied to the FOPO
   cavity, and a control algorithm is developed. This algorithm has been
   numerically analyzed and experimentally implemented, where the results
   indicate drastic suppression of the longitudinal modes.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the water balance, crop yield, and water use
   efficiency (WUE) of a water table management system compared to a
   conventional drainage system at three nitrogen levels. A two-year field
   study was conducted using three blocks; each block was composed of two
   water management treatments: controlled drainage with subirrigation
   (CD-SI) and conventional or free drainage (FD). The water table depth
   was maintained at 60 cm below the soil surface in the CD-SI plots. Three
   nitrogen treatments (low, medium, and high) were applied in strips
   across all blocks. The seasonal water balance indicated surplus water
   conditions in the CD-SI plots, while the FD plots had deficit
   conditions. In 2008 and 2009, the corn grain WUE for the FD plots was
   2.49 and 2.46 kg(-3) respectively. The corn grain WUE for the CD-SI
   plots was 2.43 and 2.26 kg(-3) in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The WUE
   of corn grain responded to the water treatments (p < 0.05) in 2009 but
   not in 2008. In 2009, at low and high nitrogen levels, the water
   management treatments demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05) in
   grain yields. However, water management demonstrated no significant
   effect (p > 0.05) on grain yields at the normal nitrogen level.
   Furthermore, the two water treatments had no effect on the aboveground
   dry biomass yields in both years.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal ions released into various water systems have a severe
   impact on the environment and human beings, and excess exposure to toxic
   metal ions through drinking water poses high risks to human health and
   causes life-threatening diseases. Thus, there is high demand for the
   development of a rapid, low-cost, and sensitive method for detection of
   metal ions in water. We present a portable analytical system for
   colorimetric detection of lead (Pb2+) and aluminum (Al3+) ions in water
   based on gold nanoparticle probes and lab-on-a-chip instrumentation. The
   colorimetric detection of metal ions is conducted via single-step assays
   with low limits of detection (LODs) and high selectivity. We design a
   custom-made microwell plate and a handheld colorimetric reader for
   implementing the assays and quantifying the signal readout. The
   calibration experiments demonstrate that this portable system provides
   LODs of 30 ppb for Pb2+ and 89 ppb for Al3+, both comparable to
   bench-top analytical spectrometers. It promises an effective platform
   for metal ion analysis in a more economical and convenient way, which is
   particularly useful for water quality monitoring in field and
   resource-poor settings. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   conditions. Experimental tests on a laboratory distribution static

   can simultaneously (i) support the voltages of unbalanced 3-phase loads
   against droop; (ii) equalise the complex powers at source-side of the

Abstract = {{In operating flotation plants, the viscosity of the pulp can vary
   significantly. Consequently, the resulting impact on bubble size is of
   interest as many plants experience seasonal changes in water
   temperature, or particle size changes as ore hardness, mineralogy and
   throughput fluctuate. However, given its importance in flotation, there
   existed no mathematical relationship linking bubble size created in
   flotation machines to the key process variable of fluid viscosity. In
   this study, a program of investigation to develop such a model was
   utilizing a pilot-scale mechanical flotation machine, to investigate the
   effect of water viscosity due to temperature on bubble size
   distribution. The bubble sizes were determined using a specific bubble
   viewer and imaging technology. The temperature itself was varied as a
   method for introducing significant viscosity change. The
   viscosity-temperature effect introduced a correspondingly significant
   change in the water viscosity (1619 to 641 mu Pa.s). It is suggested
   that a considerably stronger relationship may exist, yielding D-32
   versus (mu/mu(20))(0.776), and hence viscosity becomes an important
   design consideration for plants operating where pulp temperature
   fluctuations, very small particles or high solid fractions are present.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of post-silicon debugging is to locate errors undetected
   during the pre-silicon verification. Although high speed of hardware
   prototype can be leveraged to expedite running a large number of
   realistic test vectors, the low level of observability and
   controllability of signals inside a prototype is a big concern. Design
   for Debug (DFD) techniques aim to improve the observability of signals
   and speed up the root-cause analysis of errors. Incorporation of an
   Embedded Logic Analyzer (ELA) is introduced as one of the practical DFD
   techniques. An ELA contains a trigger unit that controls conditions for
   which trace signals should be captured in a buffer for post-processing.
   In this paper, we propose a tool to generate hierarchical triggers,
   providing compact trace information for root-cause analysis. Major
   advantages of our technique as a means to generate trigger units are: 1)
   failure localization and root-cause analysis is expedited by keeping the
   hierarchical trace of interactions leading to failures, 2) overlapped
   failure patterns can be found by mechanism which results in a 60-65\%
   reduction in hardware overhead compared to the previously proposed
   method, 3) it can be parameterized to generate several units, making it
   possible to incorporate checkers into scarce silicon area and enabling
   on-chip debugging by means of time-multiplexing scheme.}},

   biosensor operating in the visible spectrum}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing is one of the most widely used
   methods to implement biosensing due to its sensitivity and capacity for
   label-free detection. Whilst most commercial SPR sensors operate in the
   angular regime, it has recently been shown that an increase in
   sensitivity and a greater robustness against noise can be achieved by
   measuring the reflectivity when varying both the angle and wavelength
   simultaneously, in a so-called spectro-angular SPR biosensor. A single
   value decomposition method is used to project the two-dimensional
   spectro-angular reflection signal onto a basis set and allow the image
   obtained from an unknown refractive index sample to be compared very
   accurately with a pre-calculated reference set. Herein we demonstrate
   that a previously reported system operated in the near infra-red has a
   lower detection limit when operating in the visible spectrum due to the
   improved spatial resolution and numerical precision of the image sensor.
   The SPR biosensor presented here has an experimental detection limit of
   9.8 x 10(-7) refractive index unit. To validate the system as a
   biosensor, we also performed the detection of synthetic RNA from
   pathogenic Legionella pneumophila with the developed biosensing
   platform. (c) 2014 Author(s).}},
