Abstract = {{We derive theoretical expressions of the optimum step-size for diffusion
   least-mean squares (LMS) algorithms. The resulting optimal step-size
   leads to the largest correction for the distributed LMS adaptive filter
   from iteration i to iteration i + 1. For practical computation, we use
   time-averaging filters and establish the mean-square stability for
   adapt-then-combine (ATC) and combine-then-adapt (CTA) strategies. We
   introduce optimal variable step-size diffusion LMS algorithms with
   detailed and practical guidelines for their implementation. Simulation
   results support the analysis and prove that the proposed algorithms
   significantly improve the performance in both transient phase and steady
   state. The numerical experiments reveal that, compared with the existing
   approaches, the proposed adaptive algorithms are less sensitive to
   control parameters and more robust with respect to statistical
   variations of the environment.}},

Abstract = {{The research discussed here proposes a control system with compensation
   to maintain consistent performance for quadrotors under system
   variations, specifically due to battery drainage and mass changes. This
   compensation control system is comprised of three subsystems. The first
   subsystem is a baseline PID controller, which generates a desired rpm
   for each motor. The second subsystem compensates for battery drainage.
   Based on a complete relationship of PWM-rpm-Voltage obtained from
   experiments, this compensation subsystem calculates an appropriate PWM
   command needed to obtain the rpm received from the PID controller,
   taking into account the current battery voltage. The last subsystem
   consists of an online mass estimator to estimate the total mass of the
   quadrotor and payload, and correspondingly adapts the output of the PID
   controller in order to maintain performance. Simulation and experiments
   were conducted, both with and without the compensation strategies. The
   results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 2-stage robust distributed algorithm is proposed for
   cooperative sensor network localization using time of arrival (TOA) data
   without identification of non-line of sight (NLOS) links. In the first
   stage, to overcome the effect of outliers, a convex relaxation of the
   Huber loss function is applied so that by using iterative optimization
   techniques, good estimates of the true sensor locations can be obtained.
   In the second stage, the original (non-relaxed) Huber cost function is
   further optimized to obtain refined location estimates based on those
   obtained in the first stage. In both stages, a simple gradient descent
   technique is used to carry out the optimization. Through simulations and
   real data analysis, it is shown that the proposed convex relaxation
   generally achieves a lower root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to
   other convex relaxation techniques in the literature. Also by doing the
   second stage, the position estimates are improved and we can achieve an
   RMSE close to that of the other distributed algorithms which know a
   priori which links are in NLOS.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical models and numerical predictions of heat conduction and
   laminar natural convection in ice-water systems containing porous metal
   foams are presented, in the context of computationally convenient
   two-dimensional steady-state problems with rectangular calculation
   domains. The Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer equations were used to model
   momentum transfer in the liquid-water-metal-foam region. For modeling
   the heat transfer, volume-averaged equations governing two
   intrinsic-phase-average temperature fields were used: one for the metal
   foam and the other for the water (solid or liquid). The following
   improvements are proposed: novel expressions for the interfacial
   (metal-water) heat transfer coefficient in both the convection and
   conduction regimes; and effective thermal conductivity correlations that
   provide consistency between the formulations of one-temperature and
   two-temperature models in the limit of local thermal equilibrium. A
   well-established fixed-grid, co-located, finite volume method (FVM) was
   adapted and used for the numerical solutions. The proposed models and
   FVM were used to solve the test and demonstration problems involving

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of steady, laminar, fluid flow and heat
   transfer in a vertical closed-loop thermosyphon operating with slurries
   of a microencapsulated phase-change material (MCPCM) suspended in
   distilled water is presented. The MCPCM particles consisted of a
   solid-liquid phase-change material (PCM) encapsulated in a thin polymer
   resin shell. Their effective diameter was in the range 0.5 to 12.5
   micrometers, and had a mean value of 2.5 micrometers. The melting and
   freezing characteristics and the latent heat of fusion of the PCM were
   determined using a differential scanning calorimeter. The effective
   density of the MCPCM was measured, and the effective thermal
   conductivity of the slurries was determined using a published
   correlation. In the range of parameters considered, it was determined
   that the slurries exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. The closed-loop
   thermosyphon consisted of two vertical straight pipes, joined together
   by two vertical semi-circular 180-degree bends made of the same pipe. An
   essentially constant heat flux was imposed on a portion of one of the
   vertical pipes. The wall temperature of a portion of the other vertical
   pipe was maintained at a constant value. The outer surfaces of the
   entire thermosyphon were very well insulated. Calibrated thermocouples
   were used to measure the outer-wall-surface temperature at numerous
   points over the heated portion and the bulk temperature of the slurry at
   four different locations. A special procedure was formulated,
   benchmarked, and used to deduce the mass flow rate of the slurries in
   the thermosyphon. The investigation was conducted with slurries of MCPCM
   mass concentration 0\% (pure distilled water), 7.471\%, 9.997\%,
   12.49\%, 14.95\%, and 17.5\%. The results are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper for the first time investigates the nonlinear planar dynamics
   of a cantilevered extensible pipe conveying fluid; the centreline of the
   pipe is considered to be extensible resulting in coupled longitudinal
   and transverse equations of motion; specifically, the kinetic and
   potential energies are obtained in terms of longitudinal and transverse
   displacements and then the extended- version of the Lagrange equations
   for systems containing non-material volumes is employed to derive the
   equations of motion. Direct time integration along with the
   pseudo-arclength continuation method are employed to solve the
   discretized equations of motion. Bifurcation diagrams of the system are
   constructed as the flow velocity is increased as the bifurcation
   parameter. As opposed to the case of an inextensible pipe, an extensible
   pipe elongates in the axial direction as the flow velocity is increased
   from zero. At the critical flow velocity, the stability of the system is
   lost via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, emerging from the trivial
   solution for the transverse displacement and non-trivial solution for
   the longitudinal displacement and leading to a flutter.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear forced vibrations of completely free laminated composite

   Nonlinear higher-order shear deformation theory is used and the
   nonlinear response to transverse harmonic excitation in the frequency
   neighborhood of the fundamental mode is investigated. The numerical
   analysis is conducted in two steps. First, the plate displacements and
   rotations are expanded in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and a linear
   analysis is performed to obtain the natural frequencies and mode shapes.
   Then, the energy functional is discretized by using the natural modes of
   vibration and a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with
   cubic and quadratic nonlinear terms is obtained. A pseudo arc-length
   continuation and collocation scheme is employed to carry out a
   bifurcation analysis. A consistent reduced-order model necessary to
   capture the nonlinear dynamics of the plate is developed and the effect
   of number of modes retained in the numerical model is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Static deflection and large amplitude vibrations of a rubber plate are
   analyzed. Both the geometrical and physical (material) nonlinearities
   are taken into account. The properties of the plate hyperelastic
   material are described by the Neo-Hookean law. A method for building a
   local model, which approximates the plate behavior around a deformed
   configuration, is proposed. This local model takes the form of a system
   of ordinary differential equations with quadratic and cubic
   nonlinearities. The results obtained with the help of this local model
   are compared to the solution of the exact model, and are found to be
   accurate. The difference between the model retaining both physical and
   geometrical non-inearities and a model with only geometrical
   nonlinearities is also analyzed. It is found that influence of
   physically induced nonlinearities at moderate strains is significant.}},

   is examined numerically. The Von Karman plate theory along with the
   Kirchhoff's hypothesis are employed to construct the kinetic and
   potential energies of the system. The Lagrange equation is used so as to
   obtain the equations of motion which are in the form of a set of
   second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations. This set is
   recast into a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential
   equations with coupled terms. Gear's backward-differentiation-founula is
   employed to integrate this set of equations numerically, yielding the
   generalized coordinates of the system as a function of time. The
   bifurcation diagrams of Poincare maps are then constructed by sectioning
   these time histories in every period of the external excitation force.
   The results are shown in the form of time histories, phase-plane
   portraits, and Poincare sections. The effect of the stiffness of the
   rotational springs on the global dynamics of the system is also

   microgalvanic corrosion effect on as sprayed specimens. Although
   annealed 316L coatings indicate better ultimate strength, porosity and
   ductility, their degradation study signifies their poor degradability in
   Hank's physiological solution. In contrast to that, immersion and
   potentiodynamic polarization tests under Hank's physiological solution
   indicate that corrosion rate of as sprayed composite increases as amount
   of iron increases. More iron particles release more iron ions and

Abstract = {{Annulus dilation is one of the main causes of functional mitral
   regurgitation. Although the annulus dilation is usually accompanied by
   left ventricle dilation and dysfunction, the mechanical relation between
   them is not fully elucidated yet. In this paper, the assumption is made
   that the ventricular dysfunction increases the cyclic loading conditions
   on the mitral-valve apparatus. this effect may cause fatigue and weaken
   the tissue. This hypothesis is investigated in vitro by applying
   increased cyclic loadings to the tissue and evaluating the tissue
   stiffness during the cycles. The results of this study show that the
   tissue loses its strength after cyclic fatigue loadings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two complexity reduction techniques for blind
   adaptive beamforming in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
   (OFDM) antenna array systems. For each sub-carrier, a beamformer with
   generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure is designed according to
   the constrained constant modulus (CCM) criterion with weight vectors
   adaptation based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. The two
   techniques that we propose for complexity reduction rely on frequency
   domain interpolation and spatial domain clustering, respectively. The
   former exploits the coherence bandwidth of the radio channel, so that
   only the weight vectors at selected frequencies need to be adapted,
   while the remaining weight vectors are obtained via interpolation. The
   latter relies on the partitioning of the receiving array into sub-arrays
   of smaller size. In addition, a combination of these two techniques is
   proposed to further reduce the complexity. A complexity analysis is
   presented to quantify the computational savings offered by the proposed
   techniques. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate that
   these savings can be obtained at the price of only a minor, acceptable
   loss in performance when compared to the direct application of the
   conventional CCM-RLS-GSC beamforming algorithm to the wideband OFDM
   antenna array systems.}},

Abstract = {{Applying a collaborative approach under a power-sharing institutional
   structure, coupled with a shift in paradigms, sustainable water
   resources management often requires political-institutional reform to
   achieve its goals. Most of Brazil's river basins are subject to rapid
   urbanization; however, basin stakeholders generally lack sufficient
   institutional capacity to address the attending water resource issues.
   Subject to urbanisation, the Pitimbu River basin supplies potable water
   to approximately 280 000 people in Brazil's Natal region. This study
   investigated how current institutional models influence both water
   management and fluvial contamination by metals. Sediment samples
   collected at eight sites along the river revealed elevated levels of Pb,
   Fe, Al, Ni and Zn, whose sources were linked to industries, vehicles, as
   well as agricultural and construction wastes Aluminium enrichment of
   surface waters was mainly linked to inadequate sanitation
   infrastructure. In light of this, the region's poor institutional
   capacity must be addressed through institutional reform, including a new
   management structure open to public collective water management
   planning. In so doing, Brazil's water policies should acknowledge
   capacity building as a critical element of institutional reform.}},

Abstract = {{Pore network modeling was applied to a full PEM membrane electrode
   assembly sandwich. This model included liquid water percolation and gas
   transport in the gas diffusion and catalyst layers, ionic transport in
   the catalyst layers and membrane, and Butler-Volmer kinetics. The
   ability of pore network models to resolve discrete water clusters played
   a key role in the electrochemical simulations. It was found that local
   water blockages in the GDL not only cause concentration polarization,
   but also that the protons generated in the anode must travel longer
   paths to reach an active site on the cathode (not masked by a discrete
   water). Consequently, the IR polarization was actually increased in the
   presence of liquid water. This behavior is not typically observed in
   continuum models since they do not treat water treated as explicit
   blockages and hence do not see the increased transport lengths resulting
   from the localized production and consumption of protons.}},

   (FD-SFC) scheme suitable for Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) downlink
   transmission in an OFDM cellular wireless network to mitigate ICI while
   benefiting from spatial diversity by grouping cell-edge users (UE) and
   sharing sub-carriers among neighbor cells. A distributed decoder is
   proposed to reduce the UE decoding complexity to 50\% of that of the
   optimal decoder for the same non-distributed FD-SFC. Achievable
   transmission rate (in b/s/Hz) versus UE relative distance to its
   base-station (eNodeB) of the proposed scheme is studied in comparison
   with the Alamouti CoMP and non-CoMP schemes, and its performance upper
   and lower bounds are derived. It is shown that the proposed scheme
   outperforms both Alamouti-CoMP and non-CoMP schemes in serving cell-edge
   UE's. The derived performance bounds are then used to establish the UE
   relative distance threshold for switching between the proposed CoMP and

Abstract = {{This paper considers cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in cognitive

   In this paper, we propose a new hybrid double-threshold based energy
   detection (HDTED) to improve the spectrum sensing performance by
   exploiting both local decision at the SUs and global decision at the FC.
   In the proposed HDTED, to make a final decision on the availability of
   licensed spectrum, each SU performs a hybrid combination of both local
   and global decisions. Particularly, taking into account a practical
   scenario where all sensing, reporting, and backward channels suffer from
   Rayleigh fading, we derive the missed detection probability and false
   alarm probability to show that the proposed HDTED scheme achieves a
   better CSS performance than the conventional schemes. Finally,
   simulation results are provided to verify the analytical findings.}},

Abstract = {{The power electric grid is undergoing a paradigm shift with the
   inclusion of information and communication technologies that allow for
   two-way flow of information, automation and distributed intelligence. A
   reliable and secure Smart-Grid Communications Network (SGCN), is
   necessary to achieve the SG goals. In particular, the SG Neighbor Area
   Network (NAN) poses a communications challenge due to the bottlenecks
   associated with the converge-cast nature of uplink traffic. This can
   potentially be addressed through network coding. Therefore, this paper
   aims to determine the feasibility of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC)
   at the SG NAN level. Specifically, RLNC is considered in converge-cast
   scenarios while both network size and link reliability are varied. This
   preliminary study suggests that inter-session RLNC does achieve
   throughput enhancements but at the cost of higher network load.
   Additionally, performance drops sharply with low link reliabilities due
   to the lack of partial decoding. Therefore, for large converge-cast
   networks, as in the case of the SG NAN, network coding that allows for
   partial decoding operations should be more beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study message passing-based decoding of real network
   coded packets. We explain our developments on the idea of using real
   field network codes for distributed compression of inter-node correlated
   messages. Then, we discuss the use of iterative message passing-based
   decoding for the described network coding scenario, as the main
   contribution of this paper. Motivated by Bayesian compressed sensing, we
   discuss the possibility of approximate decoding, even with fewer
   received measurements (packets) than the number of messages. As a
   result, our real field network coding scenario, called quantized network
   coding, is capable of inter-node compression without the need to know
   the inter-node redundancy of messages. We also present our numerical and
   analytic arguments on the robustness and computational simplicity
   (relative to the previously proposed linear programming and standard
   belief propagation) of our proposed decoding algorithm for the quantized
   network coding.}},

Abstract = {{As semiconductor processes scale, making transistors more vulnerable to
   transient upset, a wide variety of microarchitectural and system-level
   strategies are emerging to perform efficient error detection and
   correction computer systems. While these approaches often target various
   application domains and address error detection and correction at
   different granularities and with different overheads, an emerging trend
   is the use of state compression, e.g., cyclic redundancy check (CRC), to
   reduce the cost of redundancy checking. Prior work in the literature has
   shown that Fletcher's checksum (FC), while less effective where error
   detection probability is concerned, is less computationally complex when
   implemented in software than the more-effective CRC. In this paper, we
   reexamine the suitability of CRC and FC as compression algorithms when
   implemented in hardware for embedded safety-critical systems. We have
   developed and evaluated parameterizable implementations of CRC and FC in
   FPGA, and we observe that what was true for software implementations
   does not hold in hardware: CRC is more efficient than FC across a wide
   variety of target input bandwidths and compression strengths.}},

Abstract = {{Rational yet simple and fast evaluation methods are needed to assess the
   seismic behavior of existing buildings. This is particularly important
   for post-disaster buildings such as emergency shelters and hospitals,
   for evaluations before or after an earthquake event. Current guidelines
   available in Canada (NRC 92) or United States (FEMA 154) propose rapid
   visual screening methods for this purpose. However, a more reliable
   method that could quantify structural seismic demand parameters and
   provide a better assessment of building performance is still needed. In
   this research, a 3-dimensional simplified assessment method is proposed
   for post-disaster buildings. The method is based on in situ building
   data collected from inspection, information on site conditions, and
   ambient vibration measurements (AVM). The proposed assessment method can
   be employed for the evaluation of seismic demand parameters such as
   relative floor displacements; story drift ratios, floor absolute
   accelerations and story shear forces.
   Another research project is being conducted in parallel which is aimed
   at evaluating the seismic performance of Operational and Functional
   Components (OFCs) (also called nonstructural components) of buildings.
   This matter is of high importance since OFC failure or malfunction can
   cause life safety hazards and significantly impact building
   functionality, and damage to property even if the structural system has
   performed satisfactorily during the earthquake. In this project, an
   inclusive database of buildings in which AVM were performed was
   collected. Using the aforementioned procedure, floor response-histories
   are derived for selected levels of the buildings and then considered as
   base excitation for OFCs to generate the corresponding floor response
   spectra (FRS). These experimental FRS are then used for seismic response
   evaluation of OFCs, with due consideration of dynamic interaction
   between the primary and secondary systems. The second objective of the
   research is to compare the derived FRSs with the corresponding Design
   Uniform Hazard Spectrum (UHS) recommended in the National Building Code
   of Canada (NBCC 2010) and develop a mathematical model to generate FRSs
   directly from the UHS taking into consideration the effect of different
   types of seismic force resisting systems, building height, soil
   conditions, location of the OFCs in the building, OFC/building period
   ratio, and estimated damping.
   The oral presentation will also include a detailed case study to
   illustrate the proposed procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The primary source of dynamic loads on transmission lines is from wind
   effects on the towers and conductors. Conductors are particularly
   sensitive to wind as they are long and flexible (compared to their
   supports) and are literally wind-catching structures in the electric
   power grid infrastructure. In current overhead transmission line design
   codes, it is routinely prescribed to consider the wind load on
   conductors and towers as an equivalent static pressure during analysis.
   In windstorms, however, wind turbulence intensity is much higher than in
   steady-state conditions. Therefore, applying wind pressure on line
   conductors by an equivalent static and uniformly distributed load is not
   realistic for the evaluation of line response. This issue is of concern
   in the case of line conductors as they experience large motions during
   wind storms, which in turn implies that windconductor aerodynamic
   interactions may affect the predicted response. The goal of this
   computational study is to provide more insight in the dynamic nature of
   the wind loads transferred from conductors to supporting towers, with a
   view to assess and improve the accuracy of wind load calculations used
   in practical design.}},

Abstract = {{This research is an attempt to propose an integrated accreted ice
   failure model for iced overhead line conductors that will lead to more
   realistic nonlinear dynamic analysis of the ice-shedding phenomenon of
   transmission lines, by taking into account the adhesive /cohesive
   strength of ice deposits.
   Ice shedding induced by sudden mechanical forces is understood to be a
   two-stage process. First, the continuous ice deposits along the
   conductor span are broken into smaller separate ice chunks and fragments
   (ice fracture failure), and then these fragments detach from the cables
   and fall off due to insufficient cohesive strength within the ice or
   adhesive strength at the icecable interface (ice detachment failure).
   Two recent successive studies have developed computational models using
   ice deposit failure criteria based on the maximum effective plastic
   strain and the maximum bending stress. These models have yielded
   reasonably accurate results in predicting cable tensions and mid-span
   displacements, by comparing their numerical results with experimental
   data from tests carried out on a 4m reduced-scale model span with
   varying cable diameters and ice thickness, following sudden mechanical
   shock loads. However, there is still about 20\% disparity in ice
   fracture rates between the computational results and experimental data,
   and it is deemed necessary to refine the ice failure model to introduce
   the effects of adhesive /cohesive forces.
   Therefore, as the first step towards the development of an integrated
   two-tier ice shedding criterion, the authors have improved the previous
   FE models, in terms of mesh size, load types and locations, material
   models and so on, to provide a better description of the experiment
   results. Then, the refined FE models of the reduced-scale span tests are
   used to check the newly proposed ice adhesive /cohesive failure
   criterion. The idea of this criterion is to simply compare the inertia
   forces acting on the fractured ice segments, and the ice adhesive
   strength or cohesive strength. The process is done automatically by a
   subroutine interacting with the nonlinear dynamic analysis commercial
   software ADINA. Although there is no satisfactory model to calculate the
   adhesive and cohesive strengths of glaze ice - especially for
   atmospheric ice, only several representative pairs of values are
   selected. Validation is underway to ascertain that the proposed two-tier
   glaze ice shedding criterion provides a more realistic description of
   the ice-shedding phenomenon of transmission lines than in the previous
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) exhibits unusual optical properties that
   make it of interest for hierarchical optical encryption in
   nanostructured films. The color-travel phenomenon of iridescence is
   exhibited by NCC when cast as a film from chiral nematic aqueous phase
   suspensions of the nanocrystals. ``Iridescence by self-assembly{''} has
   potential for overt encryption as an anti-counterfeiting measure. It
   also offers an intrinsic level of covert encryption by reflecting
   left-circularly polarized light. We show that addition of a UV sensitive
   dye adds another level of (covert) encryption, and that specially
   prepared films manifest a rare form of optical non-reciprocity that does
   not require the application of an external field. Chirality parameters
   and stokes vector analyses suggest a simple authentication scheme. The

Abstract = {{The present paper focuses on the theory and experiments for
   geometrically nonlinear vibrations of shell type structures made of
   traditional and advanced materials. Closed shells, curved panels and
   rectangular plates made of isotropic, sandwich and laminated composite
   materials are studied. Several original aspects of nonlinear vibrations
   of shells and panels including the effects of geometric imperfections,
   geometry and boundary conditions have been addressed and consistent
   reduced-order models essential to capture shell dynamics are obtained.
   The numerical analysis is based on multi-dimensional Lagrangian approach
   and pseudo arc-length continuation technique is used for bifurcation
   analysis. Moreover, the experimental analysis, an example of the set-up
   is shown in Figure 1, is carried out following a stepped-sine testing
   procedure and by increasing and decreasing the excitation frequency in
   very small steps at specific force amplitudes controlled in a
   closed-loop. Comparisons between experimental results and numerical
   simulations are performed and show good agreement for shells and panels
   oscillating at large-amplitude vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the issue of cooperative spectrum sensing with a
   crowd of low-end personal spectrum sensors (such as smartphones,
   tablets, and in-vehicle sensors), where one critical challenge is the
   uncertainty of the quality of sensing data from crowd sensors that may
   be unreliable, untrustworthy, or even malicious. Moreover, due to either
   unexpected equipment failures or malicious behaviors, every crowd sensor
   could sporadically and randomly contribute abnormal data, which makes
   the existing defense schemes ineffective. To tackle these unique
   challenges, we propose a robust spectrum sensing scheme by developing a
   data cleansing framework, where the under-utilization of licensed
   spectrum bands and the sparsity of nonzero abnormal data are jointly
   exploited to robustly cleanse out the potential nonzero abnormal data
   component from the original corrupted sensing data. Simulation results
   demonstrate that the proposed robust sensing scheme outperforms the
   state-of-art schemes under various abnormal data parameter
   configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Single-cell-based coverage hole detection algorithms are developed for
   mobile sensors deployment under inaccurate location information and
   non-identical sensing ranges. Existing Voronoi-based diagrams require
   the exact location of sensors to guarantee a simple, single-cell-based
   coverage detection, and they miss the mark if the location information
   is inaccurate. The guaranteed Voronoi-based diagrams, proposed in this
   paper, extend the existing diagrams in a way to guarantee the
   single-cell based coverage hole detection when upper bounds on location
   errors are provided. Simulation results show that with inaccurate
   location information the proposed algorithms can largely increase the
   network coverage. Even if the location information is exactly known, we
   suggest assuming some error margins to improve the network coverage
   based on the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the channel estimation for residual
   self-interference cancellation at the baseband in a full-duplex
   transceiver. In particular, we analyze and develop a semiblind
   maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithm to jointly estimate both the residual
   self-interference channel and intended channel based on the perfectly
   known transmitted symbols from its own transmitter, and both known pilot
   and unknown data symbols sent from the other intended transmitter. We
   first derive a closed-form solution for the channel estimate, and
   subsequently develop an iterative procedure to improve the estimation
   performance of the closed-form approach at high SNR. The iterative
   algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the ML solution when properly
   initiated. Simulation results show that, with a modest complexity, the
   proposed algorithm can offer good channel estimation MSE that follows
   well the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), and good cancellation performance for a
   large SNR range.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying
   for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiuser relay networks,
   where each source transmits multiple data streams to its corresponding
   destination with the assistance of multiple relays. Assuming only
   imperfect channel state information (CSI) of all the source-relay and
   relay-destination links, we propose a robust approach to jointly design
   the source and relay precoders and the receive filters, in which the
   worst per-stream mean square error (MSE) is minimized subject to source
   and relay power constraints. The channel uncertainties are assumed to be
   Gaussian distributed and the well-known Kronecker model is employed to
   characterize the spatial correlations in the proposed design. The
   resultant optimization problem is nonconvex and therefore, an
   algorithmic solution with proven convergence is proposed by resorting to
   the iterative block coordinate update approach along with matrix
   transformation and convex conic optimization techniques. Simulation
   results show that the proposed joint transceiver design can achieve an
   improved robustness against the channel uncertainties when compared to
   the non-robust approaches.}},

   integrating zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO-NWs), as user interfaces in

   hydrothermal method. A piece of ZnO-NW paper with two screen-printed
   silver electrodes forms a touch button, and touch-induced electric
   charges from the button is converted into a voltage signal using a
   charge amplifier circuit. A touch pad consisting of an array of buttons
   can be readily integrated into paper-based electronic devices, allowing
   user input of information for various purposes such as programming,
   identification checking, and gaming. This novel design features ease of
   fabrication, low cost, and ultra-thin structure, and good compatibility

Abstract = {{we have developed a low power neurotransmitter biosensor which can be
   applied in an implantable closed-loop CMOS neurotrophic factor delivery
   microsystem which by protecting the healthy neurons and restoring
   damaged ones can maintain therapeutic levels of chemical concentrations
   in the brain. The hybrid microsystem is composed of novel biosensor that
   can sense micromolar concentration of neurotransmitters (dopamine) and
   embedded negative feedback circuits that control the flow of
   pharmacological agents in micro fluidic channels. The focus of this
   manuscript is on sensing, control and decision making circuitry. It
   consists of a current conveyer, a low noise low power amplifier, an
   integrator and a comparator with offset cancelation. Circuit is
   fabricated in CMOS 0.18 um with low power consumption of 921 nW.}},

Abstract = {{Different from the traditional subtractive manufacturing, additive
   manufacturing -- a more flexible and material saving manufacturing
   technology has been developed in these recent years. This paper presents
   a simulation and optimization framework for Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   processes in practical industry. Starting from multi-level part design,
   to process optimization and planning, from energy and material
   consumption to the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) evaluation, the paper
   presents a complete practical working flow of AM technologies. Four
   models are developed within the framework: the design model, the process
   optimization and planning model, the energy and material consumption
   model and the production model. All the four models connect subsequently
   one another. Their concepts and corresponding methods will be presented
   in order in each chapter of the paper. A close optimization loop can be
   formed by these models. The feedbacks of each model will be used to
   optimize the design as well as the process planning. Preliminary
   experiments data are generalized and analysed by each model.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to develop new products to compete in existing or new
   markets is a core competency of many successful companies. Companies can
   assess their success from different perspectives, including the overall
   innovation strategy at company level. This paper evaluates 56 success
   metrics through the course of product lifecycle (PLC), by considering
   the influence of the company's business innovation strategy. Data is
   collected by using survey questionnaires with experienced product
   development managers of 21 Canadian and Danish companies, mainly
   practicing in mechatronics and aerospace industry. Outcomes show no
   statistically significant difference among innovation strategy
   attributes. `Financial' and `market share' are the most important
   success indicators in early PLC with `product' and `process management
   performance' being more important in the late phase. Moreover, sets of
   success metrics are proposed during course of the PLC. These aim to
   guide companies in determining critical success factors and set ideal
   practices in measuring the success of their products.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of precoding design and power
   scheduling in a multiple-input multipleout (MIMO) system, assuming
   channel state information (CSI) availability at both the receiver and
   the transmitter. We derive an optimal power scheduling policy in time
   and space to minimize the ergodic summation of the mean squared error
   (MSE) subject to both peak (short-term) and average (long-term) power
   constraints. By applying a rotation matrix to the MIMO precoder, we also
   propose a suboptimal power scheduling policy to improve the bit error
   rate (BER) performance. We then obtain a closed-form solution to the
   power scheduling strategy for identically and independently distributed
   (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical results shows that the peak
   power constraint does not have a great effect on the power scheduling
   policy at the mid-signal-to-noise region. Numerical results also show
   the improvement in terms of MSE and BER performance by the proposed
   power scheduling policy over allocation schemes in space only.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of rock slopes in open pit mines is crucial to the safe
   and efficient operation of a surface mine. When not planned for, rock
   slope failures can cause injuries, equipment damage or loss, delayed
   production schedule, and even loss of economic ore. Slope monitoring has
   emerged as a viable engineering tool to help mine operators better
   understand rock slope behaviour and response to mining activities and
   environmental conditions during the life of the mine. This paper
   presents a state-of-the-art review of slope monitoring technologies with
   focus on the most recent development of Ground-Based interferometric
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-SAR). Discrete slope surface monitoring
   systems such as laser prism surveys and surface extensometers provide
   very accurate and precise point measurements. The data obtained from
   strategically placed discrete monitoring systems is generally sufficient
   to accurately describe simple, local failures. For large scale, complex
   failures however, monitoring systems that produce full-face scans such
   as radar are necessary. For the purpose of providing near real-time
   slope displacement data, the most suitable method is ground-based radar
   interferometry. High resolution, combined with large area coverage,
   thanks to the possibility of installing the radar at long distances from
   the slope, and short scan time, make GB-SAR one of the most effective
   slope monitoring technologies available today. In this paper, it is
   shown that the GB-SAR systemis able to timely detect and provide alarms
   on large scale slope movements for both gentle and steep slopes, as well
   as local scale movements at bench-scale which is equally important to
   the safety of mine operators at the work face.}},

Abstract = {{Infants recovering from general anesthesia are at risk of postoperative
   apnea (POA), a potentially life threatening event. There is no accurate
   way to identify which infants will experience POA, and thus all infants
   with postmenstrual age < 60 weeks are monitored for apnea in hospital
   postoperatively. Using a comprehensive, automated analysis of the
   postoperative breathing patterns, we identified the occurrence of
   respiratory pauses in 24 infants at age risk for POA. We determined the
   POA category for each infant by using Kmedoids to cluster the duration
   of the longest respiratory pause. Two clusters were identified,
   corresponding to APNEA and NO-APNEA, with a threshold of 14.6 s, a value
   consistent with the clinically accepted threshold of 15 s. K-medoids
   derived POA labels were used to evaluate the predictive ability of
   demographic and anesthetic management variables. Weight and the
   intraoperative doses of atropine, propofol, and opioids discriminated
   between the APNEA and NO-APNEA groups. A linear Gaussian discriminant
   analysis classifier provided a very good classification with a
   probability of detection P-D = 0.73 and a probability of false alarm
   P-FA = 0.22. This approach provides a promising tool for the systematic,
   objective study of infants at risk of POA.}},

   a compression that preserves more naturally the clinically significant
   features of these signals. In this paper, we illustrate this through the
   example of EEG signals; more specifically, we analyze three specific
   lossy EEG compression schemes. These schemes are based on signal models
   that have different degrees of reliance on signal production and
   physiological characteristics of EEG. The resilience of these schemes is
   illustrated through the performance of seizure detection post

   parallel-cascade (LPV-PC) model of joint stiffness consisting of two
   pathways: (a) an LPV impulse response function (IRF) for intrinsic
   mechanics and (b) an LPV Hammerstein cascade with time-varying static
   nonlinearity and a time-invariant linear dynamics for the reflex
   pathway. A subspace identification technique is used to estimate a
   statespace representation of the reflex stiffness dynamics. Then, an
   orthogonal projection decouples intrinsic from reflex response and
   subsequently identifies an LPV-IRF model of intrinsic stiffness.
   Finally, an LPV model of the reflex static nonlinearity is estimated
   using an iterative, separable least squares method. The LPV method was
   validated using experimental data from two healthy subjects where the
   ankle was moved passively by an actuator through its range of motion
   first without and then with perturbations. The identification results
   demonstrated that (a) the dynamic response of the intrisic pathway
   changes systematically with joint position; and (b) the static
   nonlinearity of the reflex pathway resembles a half-wave rectifier whose
   threshold decreases and gain increases as ankle is moved to dorsiflexed
   position.}},

Abstract = {{Generation of torque around a joint usually involves the activation of
   several agonist muscles and may also involve the co-activation of
   antagonist muscles. Therefore, a valid model for the dynamic relation
   between surface EMG (an indirect measured of the muscle's neural input)
   and the torque should take the form of a Multiple-Input/Single-Output
   (MISO) system to account for the contributions of the different muscles.
   This paper presents a new method to accurately estimate the dynamic
   EMG/Torque relation when multiple muscles are active simultaneously.
   Using our method we found that flexor and extensor muscles at the ankle
   have different dynamic properties.}},

Abstract = {{A feature of healthy gait is a clearly defined heel strike upon initial
   contact of the foot with the ground. However, a common consequence of
   ageing is deterioration of the heel first nature of gait towards a
   shuffling gait (flat foot at contact). Physiotherapy can be effective in
   correcting this but is costly and labour intensive. Gait rehabilitation
   could be accelerated with home exercise, guided by a biofeedback device
   that distinguishes between heel first and shuffling gait.
   This paper describes an algorithm that distinguishes between heel-to-toe
   gait and shuffling gait on the basis of angular velocity of the foot,
   using an inertial measurement unit. Measurements were made of normal and
   abnormal gait and used to develop an algorithm that distinguishes
   between good and bad steps.
   Results demonstrate very good algorithm performance, with a
   classification accuracy at the accuracy-optimal threshold of 92.7\% when
   compared with physiotherapist labels. The sensitivity and specificity at
   this threshold are 84.4\% and 97.5\% respectively. These performance
   metrics suggest that this algorithm is usable in a biofeedback device.}},

   parameters are optimized to obtain a good impedance match over the
   required frequency range. The designed antenna size is 18mm x 18mm.
   Further, a flexible conformal 4 x 4 ultra-wideband antenna array, in a

Abstract = {{Ankle stiffness is a nonlinear, time-varying system which contributes to
   the control of human upright stance. This study sought to examine the
   nature of the contribution of stiffness to postural control by
   determining how intrinsic and reflex stiffnesses varied with sway.
   Subjects were instructed to stand quietly on a bilateral
   electro-hydraulic actuator while perturbations were applied about the
   ankle. Subjects performed three types of trials: normal stance, forward
   lean, and backward lean. Position, torque, and EMGs from the tibialis
   anterior and triceps surae were recorded. Background torque, intrinsic
   stiffness and reflex stiffness were calculated for each perturbation.
   Intrinsic and reflex stiffnesses were heavily modulated by postural
   sway. Moreover, they were modulated in a complimentary manner; intrinsic
   stiffness was lowest when reflex gain was highest, and vice versa. These
   findings suggest that intrinsic stiffness is modulated simultaneously
   with reflex stiffness to optimize the control of balance.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of speed on
   patterns of grip forces during twisting movement involving forearm
   supination against a torsional load (combined elastic and inertial
   load). For slow and moderate speed rotations, the grip force increased
   linearly with load torque. However, for fast rotations in which the
   contribution of the inertia to load torque was significantly greater
   than slower movements, the grip force-load torque relationship could be
   segmented into two phases: a linear ascending phase corresponding to the
   acceleration part of the movement followed by a plateau during
   deceleration. That is, during the acceleration phase, the grip force
   accurately tracked the combined elastic and inertial load. However, the
   coupling between grip force and load torque was not consistent during
   the deceleration phase of the movement.
   In addition, as speed increased, both the position and the force
   profiles became smoother. No differences in the baseline grip force,
   safety margin to secure the grasp during hold phase or the overall
   change in grip force were observed across different speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies of geocoding systems have been used to assign
   geographical coordinates to incident reports identified simply with
   textual address references. These studies have typically focused on the
   level of accuracy achieved by various geocoding systems and found that
   acceptable results can be achieved. Depending on the quality of the
   input data, a match rate between 70\% and 83\% can be expected, with
   varying levels of accuracy. However, few studies have looked at the
   potential of freely available online geocoding services to spatially
   locate traffic crash records. It is proposed that although limitations
   currently exist, services such as the Google Maps API provide sufficient
   functionality and adequate accuracy for use with a wide variety of
   geocoding applications. A case study used traffic crash records from a
   municipality in the province of Quebec, Canada, with the goal of
   quantifying the geocoding results. It was found that although a
   competitive match rate was obtained, manual revision was required to
   ensure that the results returned by the geocoder referred to the same

Abstract = {{``Annual average daily bicyclists traffic{''} (AADBT) is a term commonly
   used in various cycling-related research and practical applications. The
   AADBT value is usually estimated by averaging the daily cyclist totals
   recorded with a long-term automatic counter or by using such a counter
   to extrapolate short-term counts. The latter method, often referred to
   as the expansion factor method, produces estimates with considerable
   error. In an effort to mitigate this error, two AADBT estimation methods
   were proposed: one that uses a cycling weather model to adjust
   short-term counts and one that is based on individual daily totals from
   long-term counts (as opposed to annual averages by day or by month).
   These methods were compared with two traditional expansion factor
   methods. The weather and disaggregate methods outperformed the
   traditional methods, which produced an average absolute relative error
   of roughly 11\% when based on 1 day of short-term data.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in energy storage systems have provided viable
   solutions to challenges posed by the evolving grid. Electric grid
   related energy storage applications include energy time-shift, upgrade
   deferral for transmission and distribution network infrastructure and
   energy management services. In the microgrid context, energy storage can
   enable a higher penetration of renewable energy sources. In this regard,
   a battery energy storage system (BESS) has been set on the distribution
   test line in Varennes to study the potential applications of a BESS in a
   distribution network. This paper describes the installation, electrical
   characteristics and operation modes of the 100kWh Lithiumion BESS.
   Results of the commissioning tests are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of replacing steam by carbon dioxide in concrete masonry
   units (CMU) curing was studied for carbon dioxide utilization and
   performance improvement. A laboratory study had shown that CMU could
   uptake 18 \%-24 \% CO2 by mass based on cement content through a
   carbonation period of 2-4 h. In comparison to steam process, carbonated
   CMUs could have equivalent strength and much improved durability
   performance. If all CMUs produced in the United States can be treated by
   carbon dioxide curing, approximately 1.5 x 10(6) tonnes of CO2 will be
   utilized each year. If this CO2 is captured from cement kilns, the
   reduction of carbon emission for US cement industry will reach 3 \% due
   to the contribution by CMU industry alone. The carbon dioxide curing of
   CMU will facilitate carbon capture and storage with benefits to both
   environment and business.}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Post-industrial waste (PIW) polyamide 6 is successfully used in lieu of
   commercial virgin polyamide 6, in several automotive applications. The
   presence of polyamide 66 in the final formulation may affect the
   mechanical and thermal properties of the PIW polyamide 6 materials.
   Using unreinforced polyamide 6 from PIW and commercial sources, it was
   found that the addition of polyamide 66 (below 10 wt.\%) lowered the
   crystallization rate and crystallinity level of all polyamide 6
   materials. The thermal and mechanical properties of glass fiber (GF)
   reinforced PIW polyamide 6 compounds with and without polyamide 66 were
   also studied. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that
   reinforced materials without polyamide 66 had a higher level of
   crystallinity. Furthermore, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) showed
   that reinforced compounds without polyamide 66 also had a faster storage
   modulus buildup immediately after injection molding. Reinforced PIW
   polyamide 6 compounds without polyamide 66 also exhibited higher tensile
   and higher vibration weld strengths as well as a thicker heat affected
   zone (HAZ) than those with polyamide 66, leading to the conclusion that
   polyamide 66 had a detrimental effect on crystallinity level and
   consequently on the mechanical properties of GF-reinforced PIW polyamide
   6 materials.}},

   Large Gain Theorem are designed specifically to tackle this issue, they
   are not yet widely used. This paper aims to facilitate the practical
   application of minimum gain and the Large Gain Theorem. An altered
   definition of minimum gain broadens the applicability of the Large Gain
   Theorem and the novel Minimum Gain Lemma provides linear matrix
   inequality conditions that imply and are often equivalent to a minimum
   gain for unstable linear time invariant systems. Both results play
   crucial roles in establishing a stability result that is robust with

Abstract = {{Power transfer and gear shifting control are the main duties of the
   transmission in a vehicle. This paper focuses on the modeling,
   simulation and control of a two speed automated transmission for
   electric vehicles having a seamless gear shifting specification. The
   transmission incorporates two-stage planetary gear sets and two braking
   mechanisms to control the gear shifting. Controlling the input power of
   the electric motor and the embedded brakes provides seamless flow of
   power during a gear change. The dynamic model of the mechanism has been
   developed by using the power and the kinematic equations of the
   planetary gear trains and the free body diagram of the mechanism. The
   simulation model has been built up in MATLAB/Simulink (R) to investigate
   the performance of the proposed controller. The control algorithm is
   inspired by the two main control phases in Dual Clutch Transmissions
   (DCT), namely the torque phase and the inertia phase. An Input Output
   Feedback Linearization control technique with a PID controller are used
   for the torque phase and an optimal MIMO H-infinity controller is
   designed for the inertia phase. Simulation results show the ability of
   the proposed transmission with the control algorithm to have a smooth
   gear change without excessive oscillations in the output torque and
   speed.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{255-269}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable water resource management (WRM) is failing to be fully
   implemented in Canada due to, among other things, cultural and
   structural inhibiting factors. There is a need for water professionals
   to develop their understanding of the ways in which cultural and
   structural barriers within prominent water resource management
   institutions can be broken down and/or navigated so that climate change
   and sustainability challenges can be more appropriately addressed. This
   study explored, for the first time in Canada, champion leadership
   approaches by interviewing champions in the Canadian water sector, with
   a focus on behavioural attributes, strategies and contextual factors.
   The findings revealed the significance of both formal and informal
   relationships, passion in communication, respectful and humble
   networking and work relations alongside necessary risk taking as key
   behavioural strategies for Canadian water champions. It also exposed the
   need to understand contextual realities of mandate gaps, control and
   secrecy at the federal level versus the more open and responsive culture
   at the municipal level. While the context can inhibit change, it does
   not necessarily inhibit it if the champion is well equipped to
   understand the institution and the strategies that can influence it.
   Such strategies include the creation of windows of opportunities and the
   use of media such as journalists, for risk-taking change efforts that do
   not have to be socially and professionally threatening. Water
   professionals who have a better understanding of the champion experience
   in Canada may be in a better position to contribute to a more effective
   implementation of sustainable WRM in Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a rapid growth in demand for ultra high speed
   data transmission with end users expecting fast, high bandwidth network
   access. With this rapid growth in demand, data centres are under
   pressure to provide ever increasing data rates through their networks
   and at the same time improve the quality of data handling in terms of
   reduced latency, increased scalability and improved channel speed for
   users. However as data rates increase, present technology based on
   well-established CMOS technology is becoming increasingly difficult to
   scale and consequently data networks are struggling to satisfy current
   network demand. In this paper the interrelated issues of electronic
   scalability, power consumption, limited copper interconnect bandwidth
   and the limited speed of CMOS electronics will be explored alongside the
   tremendous bandwidth potential of optical fibre based photonic networks.
   Some applications of photonics to help alleviate the speed and latency
   in data networks will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a communication system in which a transmitter observes n
   independent Markov sources and has to jointly quantize them in real-time
   for a single receiver. Although the model is a special case of real-time
   quantization of Markov sources, a direct application of the results of
   real-time quantization is infeasible due to computational complexity. We
   restrict attention to a encoding-decoding strategies having a specific
   structure, and identify a dynamic program to find the best strategies
   with that structure. This dynamic program has uncountable state space.
   For the special case when all source alphabets are equal to each other
   and to the quantization alphabet, we reduce the dynamic program to one
   with a countable state space. We then present a finite-state
   approximation of this dynamic programming. The feasibility of the
   approach is shown by means of examples.}},

Abstract = {{In the continuous casting process of steel, the submerged entry nozzle
   (SEN) typically made of the stabilized ZrO2-graphite can interact with
   mould flux and molten steel. In particular, the significant corrosion of
   the SEN by mould flux (CaO-SiO2-Na2O-Al2O3-K2O-Li2O-F) is commonly
   reported. In order to understand the corrosion mechanism accurately,
   thermodynamic database for the system is required. As part of a large
   thermodynamic database development for the mould flux in the continuous
   casting process, the thermodynamic modeling of the Li2O-ZrO2-SiO2 system
   was carried out in the present study. All thermodynamic property data
   and phase diagram data related to binary Li2O-ZrO2 and ternary
   Li2O-ZrO2-SiO2 systems in literature were critically evaluated and
   optimized to obtain one set of optimized model parameters. The liquid
   solution was in particular described using the Modified Quasichemical
   Model which takes into account the short range ordering in molten slag.
   The model parameters with thermodynamic models can be used to calculate
   any thermodynamic properties and phase diagram section using the

Abstract = {{The importance of road lighting in improving nighttime safety is
   evident; however, the lack of actual field measurements of illuminance
   results in a gap in knowledge about the adequacy of installed road
   lighting for clear nighttime visibility. Previous studies have
   considered the effect of the presence or absence of road lighting on
   safety, but few have measured actual illuminance. This study tested a
   uniform method for performing a simple road lighting audit and safety
   screening for any area. To perform the proposed audit, a photometric
   sensor, data logger, and information on the city lighting standards,
   georeferenced accident data, and traffic flow data were used. To collect
   field measurements, data collectors crossed each side of an intersection
   with a sensor. On the basis of the collected data, the following values
   were calculated: the average illuminance of each approach to an
   intersection and of the whole intersection and the uniformity ratio of
   the intersection. These results were used to compare the intersection
   illuminance with the city lighting standard to see if the installed road
   lighting was performing adequately. This method was applied to a case
   study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where the lighting at 59\% of the
   selected sample intersections was found to be substandard. Statistical
   analysis showed that the number of night accidents was correlated with
   traffic flow and substandard illuminance. The factors contributing to
   average illuminance were clear sky, hour of night, and presence of light
   poles and commercial lights.}},

   wireless communication technologies, it also allows medical staff to
   access to patient health conditions and other information (e.g.,

   from anywhere at anytime in order to have fast and efficient responses
   to emergency situations. Network architecture and system design of iVS

Abstract = {{The flow of a river past a shallow embayment (similar to that past a
   pair of groynes) was physically modeled in a laboratory channel that was
   2 m long and 0.4 m wide with a 0.24 by 0.24 m(2) embayment at
   mid-channel. Measurements were obtained using three-dimensional particle
   tracking velocimetry. Three cameras were mounted above the channel to
   track neutrally buoyant particles seeded into the flow. Based on these
   measurements, the entrainment mechanisms between the embayment and the
   main flow were studied. Analysis has shown that particles tend to
   penetrate the embayment at the downstream end of the interface, closer
   to the bottom, and leave the embayment through the upstream end of the
   interface, closer to the surface. Two theories are proposed to explain
   this behaviour. One is the secondary circulation in the embayment, that
   occurs as a result of cyclostrophic imbalance near the bottom solid
   boundary. A pressure gradient, balanced by the centrifugal force in the
   embayment vortex, dominates near the bottom, where the flow is
   decelerated by the bottom friction. As a result, particles at the bottom
   boundary start to move radially towards the centre of the embayment,
   where, by continuity, they subsequently start to rise slowly, in a
   spiral-like motion, with increasing radius of rotation. Once the
   particles reach the surface, they continue spiraling outwards towards
   the edges of the embayment, where re-entrainment into the main flow can
   occur. Along the edges of the embayment the particles are then entrained
   into a downward flow back to the bottom boundary, closing the flow path.
   This circulation can be partially responsible for the previous
   observations of particles entering an embayment along the bottom
   boundary and exiting it near the surface. The second mechanism affecting
   the entrainment mechanism between the embayment and the main flow
   pertains to the importance of the Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices in the shear
   layer between the slow-moving embayment flow and relatively fast channel
   flow. The bottom shear affects the Kelvin-Helmholtz structures,
   distorting the vortices that initially have a vertical axis of rotation.
   Deceleration of the flow near the bottom can tilt the axis of these
   vortices forward, resulting in the amplification of the effect, where
   the flow is principally oriented into the embayment along the bottom
   boundary and out of the embayment near the surface.}},

Abstract = {{A traffic simulation was developed for a dense neighborhood in the city
   of Montreal, Quebec, Canada (8,656 links), and was linked with a
   regional traffic assignment model, which was used to determine the
   travel demand originating in and destined for the study area. With a
   version of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Motor Vehicle
   Emissions Simulator model fit with local data, traffic emissions for
   each link were simulated by the use of instantaneous speed profiles.
   Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and
   carbon monoxide (CO) were modeled under a range of regional and local
   policies, including fleet renewal, street closures, reduced demand,
   reduced internal car trips, and reduced through traffic. Several traffic
   scenarios were modeled in the traffic assignment and simulation models
   to represent these policies. Because of the high congestion levels in
   the neighborhood under base case conditions, limited networkwide
   reductions in emissions were observed, except in the scenario that aimed
   to reduce through traffic (29\% reduction in GHG emissions compared with
   that in the base case scenario). Significant changes in the spatial
   patterns of emissions were detected. Average and instantaneous
   speed-based estimates were also compared; the average speed mode tended
   to overestimate total emissions as network speeds decreased. Finally,
   dispersion modeling was conducted along selected corridors to evaluate
   the effects of different scenarios on air quality. The study found
   significant increases in air pollution as a result of the street closure
   scenario and significant decreases with the reduced through traffic
   scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian estimators of short time spectral amplitude (STSA) have
   received considerable attention in the field of speech enhancement. In
   this paper, we propose new multi-microphone extensions for the
   conventional Ephraim and Malah's speech spectral amplitude estimation
   method. Unlike the conventional estimators where the spectral phase is
   assumed to be uniformly distributed, the proposed extensions treat the
   latter as an unknown parameter to be estimated. It is shown that the
   proposed methods can exploit spectral phase estimates to improve the
   performance of the current speech STSA estimators and have the potential
   to provide even further improvement given a more accurate estimate of
   the spectral phase. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the
   new approaches in terms of noise reduction and speech distortion
   measures, in addition to the reduced computational complexity provided
   by the proposed minimum mean square method as compared to
   state-of-the-art solutions.}},

   micromolar neurotransmitter concentration; and a micro-power Sigma Delta
   Analog to Digital Convertor (ADC) to convert the analog signal (AP or

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an analog-to-stochastic converter using a
   magnetic-tunnel junction (MTJ) device for stochastic computation.
   Stochastic computation has recently been exploited for area-efficient
   hardware implementation, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC)
   decoders and image processors. However, power-and-area hungry
   analog-to-digital and digital-to-stochastic converters are required for
   the analog to stochastic signal conversion. The MTJ devices exhibit
   probabilistic switching behaviour between two resistance states.
   Exploiting the probabilistic behaviour, analog signals can be directly
   converted to stochastic signals to mitigate the signal-conversion
   overhead. The analog-to-stochastic signal conversion is mathematically
   described and the conversion circuit is designed based on a
   transistor/MTJ hybrid structure. The conversion characteristic is
   evaluated using device and circuit parameters that determines proper
   parameters for designing the analog-to-stochastic converter.}},

   for northeastern Iran's 2037.5 km(2) Hable-roud watershed, a
   step-by-step process was developed and implemented, consisting of image
   preprocessing, extraction of training and reference sampling locations,
   decomposition of multi-spectral thematic mapper bands into features by
   independent component analysis methods, classification using these
   features and slope maps, enhancement of land-use classes through image
   segmentation and zonal statistics, then through consideration of
   normalized difference vegetation index and climatic zones, followed by
   ground truthing. This newly developed approach provided maps that
   distinguished dryland farming, irrigated farmland, forest plantations,
   and low-, medium-, and high-vegetation density rangelands, while
   currently available maps for the watershed left 39\% of lands
   unclassified or in combined classes. The new maps' ground-truthing-based
   overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 88.3\% and 0.83,
   respectively. In order to develop such an improved LULC map, it was
   necessary to go beyond the mere analysis of reflectance information, to
   incorporating climatic and topographic data through this newly proposed

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss the Fermi-level pinning issue on InN grown
   surfaces, in particular the nonpolar m-planes. Detailed angle-resolved
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies show that for intrinsic InN
   nanowires the Fermi-level on the nonpolar grown surfaces is located 0.1
   to 0.2 eV below the conduction band edge, i.e., not pinned in the
   conduction band. This indicates that the commonly measured Fermi-level
   pinning in the conduction band on nonpolar grown surfaces is not an
   intrinsic property of InN. Furthermore, our studies also suggest that
   surface states are positioned near the band edge and therefore do not
   contribute to the Fermi-level pinning. This is consistent with recent
   theoretical and experimental studies. In the end, with the absence of
   the Fermi-level pinning in the conduction band and surface electron
   accumulation, the unique electrical and optical properties of intrinsic
   InN nanowires are discussed, and compared with previously reported InN
   epilayers and n-type InN nanowires. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&

   time-domain radar system contains a multistatic 16-antenna
   hemi-spherical array operating in the 2-4 GHz frequency range. We
   investigate, for the first time with such a system in clinical trials,
   the repeatability of measurements and its effect on image
   reconstruction. We record vertical and horizontal measurement
   uncertainties under different scenarios and verify using previously
   introduced compensation methods that they can be successfully reduced to
   an acceptable level from the standpoint of image reconstruction. We also
   examine how placement of an immersion medium can affect collected breast
   scan data. Finally, we probe the repeatability and consistency of
   measurements with patients. With the goal of confirming the feasibility
   of frequent breast health monitoring, with our system, we obtain a total
   of 342 breast scans collected over 57 patient visits to determine how
   much scan data varies when there are no changes in between scans, and
   how much it varies when the patient is repositioned in the system. We
   confirm that, by taking care in patient positioning in the system and
   with respect to the immersion medium, the measurement repeatability is
   high.}},

Abstract = {{Novel rock breakage techniques are becoming more viable and attractive
   to industry. Microwave energy, as a thermal energy which is capable of
   inducing micro cracks through differential heating (therefore expansion
   of Minerals) is a technology gaining considerable attention in mineral
   processing and ore comminution applications. Recently, use of microwave
   has been evaluated as a possible avenue for terrestrial and
   extraterrestrial drilling applications and full face tunneling or rock
   breaking machines. As part of an overall research on use of microwave in
   rock breaking systems, the influence of microwave energy on the
   mechanical properties of some common hard rock types has been
   investigated. Experimental and simulation results underlined the
   potential impact of the use of microwave energy in underground or
   surface excavation applications such as mining and tunneling. This will
   also contribute economically when mine-to-mill operation is fully
   considered. It also outlines the potential impact of a future microwave
   assisted tunnel boring machine enhanced with microwave and its
   performance.}},

   Empirical Assessment}},

Pages = {{99-109}},
Abstract = {{An empirical assessment of the transferability of tour-based time-of-day
   (TOD) choice models across different counties in the San Francisco Bay
   Area of California is presented. Transferability was assessed with two
   approaches: (a) an application-based approach that tests the
   transferability of a model as a whole and (b) an estimation-based
   approach that allows the analyst to test which specific parameters in
   the model are transferable. Also tested was the hypothesis that pooling
   data from multiple geographic contexts helps in developing models with
   better transferability than those estimated from a single context. The
   estimation-based approach yielded encouraging results in favor of
   transferability of the TOD choice model, with a majority of parameter
   estimates in a pooled model found to be transferable. Pooling data from
   multiple geographic contexts appears to help in developing better
   transferable models with better transferability. However, attention is
   needed in selecting the geographic contexts from which to pool data. The
   pooled data should exhibit the same demographic characteristics and
   travel level-of-service conditions as in the application context.}},

Title = {{Should activated sludge models consider influent seeding of nitrifiers?
   Field characterization of nitrifying bacteria}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1526-1532}},
Abstract = {{This study revealed the presence of nitrifying bacteria in influent
   municipal wastewaters reaching full-scale biological wastewater
   treatment plants. Respirometric assays showed that the influent
   nitrifiers were active following a 5- to 8-hour period of metabolic
   induction. Diversity analyses by pyrosequencing of functional gene PCR
   (polymerase chain reaction) amplicon suggested that the nitrifiers in
   the influent stream likely seeded activated sludge bioreactors since the
   most abundant operational taxonomic units in the influent and mixed
   liquor were the same. Based on the estimated seeding intensity of 0.3 g
   of nitrifiers per day per gram of nitrifiers already present, the
   absolute minimum solids retention time (SRT) was reduced by
   approximately 56\% at 5 degrees C as compared to non-seeding conditions.
   This can have important repercussions on the design and sizing of
   bioreactors operating in cold climates and calls for a need to fine-tune
   process modelling by considering the contribution of autotrophic
   nitrifying biomass from municipal influent streams.}},

Title = {{Cholesterol Assimilation by Lactobacillus Probiotic Bacteria: An In
   Vitro Investigation}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), an
   important cause of mortality worldwide. Current CVD therapeutic
   measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents
   for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. Probiotic bacteria
   have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different
   mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of
   compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
   coenzyme A, and cholesterol assimilation. This work investigates 11
   Lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. Probiotic strains
   for investigation were selected from the literature: Lactobacillus
   reuteri NCIMB 11951, L. reuteri NCIMB 701359, L. reuteri NCIMB 702655,
   L. reuteri NCIMB 701089, L. reuteri NCIMB 702656, Lactobacillus
   fermentum NCIMB 5221, L. fermentum NCIMB 8829, L. fermentum NCIMB 2797,
   Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC
   314, and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917. Cholesterol assimilation
   was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal
   conditions. The best cholesterol assimilator was L. plantarum ATCC 14917
   (15.18 +/- 0.55mg/10(10) cfu) in MRS broth. L. reuteri NCIMB 701089
   assimilated over 67\% (2254.70 +/- 63.33mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol,
   the most of all the strains, under intestinal conditions. This work
   demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under
   intestinal conditions, with L. reuteri NCIMB 701089 showing great
   potential as a CVD therapeutic.}},

   algorithms, we increase energy efficiency without sacrificing error
   correction performance. We present the GSP and IGSP algorithms, and ASIC
   designs of these algorithms for the 10 Gbps Ethernet (2048,1723) LDPC
   code. In 65nm CMOS, our pipelined GSP decoder achieves a core area of
   5.29mm(2), throughput of 88.1 Gbps, and energy efficiency of 39.3
   pJ/bit, while our IGSP decoder achieves a core area of 6.00mm(2),
   throughput of 100.3 Gbps, and energy efficiency of 14.6 pJ/bit. Both
   algorithms achieve error correction performance equivalent to the offset
   min-sum algorithm. The throughput per unit area and energy efficiency of

Abstract = {{The use of a graph embedding framework is investigated as a
   regularization technique in the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm
   applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR). The technique is
   motivated by the fact that graph embeddings of feature vectors have been
   shown to provide useful characterizations of the underlying manifolds on
   which these features lie. Incorporating intrinsic graphs that describe
   these manifolds in the optimization criteria for the EM algorithm has
   the effect of constraining the solution space in a way that preserves
   the local structure of the data. Graph embedding based regularization is
   applied here to estimating parameters in constrained maximum likelihood
   linear regression (CMLLR) speaker adaptation in continuous density
   hidden Markov model (CDHMM) based ASR. CMLLR adaptation has been widely
   used as a maximum likelihood procedure for reducing mismatch between a
   given HMM model and utterances from an unknown speaker through a linear
   feature space transformation. However, there is no guarantee that CMLLR

Abstract = {{A two-stage speaker adaptation approach is proposed for the subspace
   Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) {[}1] in large vocabulary automatic speech
   recognition (ASR). The SGMM differs from the more well known continuous
   density hidden Markov model (CDHMM) in that a large portion of the SGMM
   parameters are dedicated to shared full covariance Gaussian subspace
   parameters and a relatively small number of parameters are used for
   state dependent projection vectors. Both model space and feature space
   adaptation are investigated. First, an efficient regression based
   approach for subspace vector adaptation (SVA) is presented. Second, an
   efficient approach is presented for feature space adaptation using
   constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) in the SGMM.
   While both of these adaptation scenarios have previously been
   investigated in the context of the SGMM {[}2, 3], a more efficient and
   numerically stable procedure is presented here for estimating the
   parameters of the regression based transformations. Both transformation
   matrices are obtained using an optimization technique that iteratively
   updates the rows of the regression matrices. It is shown that using
   these feature space and model space approaches for unsupervised speaker
   adaptation provides complementary improvements in SGMM based ASR word
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new Kernel Recursive Least Squares (KRLS) algorithm that is
   able to efficiently track time-varying systems. In order to alleviate
   the detrimental effect of a large dictionary size on the algorithm's
   tracking ability, we decouple the equality between dictionary size and
   weight vector size, an equality that has been encountered in all
   previous KRLS algorithms. In the proposed method, the maximum size of
   the weight vector is fixed and is independent from the dictionary size.
   We introduce the Kernel Subspace Pursuit algorithm which we use to
   choose a subset of the dictionary that tracks best the most recent
   received data samples. The selected dictionary elements are then used in
   the KRLS iterations. We show through simulations that our algorithm
   outperforms existing KRLS algorithms in tracking time-varying systems.}},

Abstract = {{Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) can denoise a signal by greedily
   approximating a least-squares (LS) estimate as a linear combination of
   elements (atoms) of a dictionary. OMP iteratively decomposes a signal
   through deterministic atom selections at each iteration step. Recently
   proposed randomized OMP algorithms employ random atom selections instead
   and have the potential to further improve denoising. Typically, the best
   approximation from these algorithms can be obtained only within a narrow
   range of iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage
   randomized OMP (MS-ROMP) denoising approach that performs successive
   ROMP runs, each denoising the obtained estimate from the previous one.
   We show through simulations that, under certain conditions, this can
   significantly improve denoising performance by producing a good
   approximation after any number of iterations beyond the sparsity level.}},

Abstract = {{Gunning materials are used as a dispensable protective layer to extend

   introducing steel reoxidation and exogenous inclusions. In the present
   work, the interaction between molten steel and three types of
   refractory, i.e. MgO, Al2O3, and MgO + 2MgO center dot SiO2 based
   gunning materials (GM) have been investigated. Compared to MgO and MgO +
   2MgO center dot SiO2 GM, the Al2O3 GM exhibited better infiltration
   resistance to molten steel. The two phase MgO + 2MgO center dot SiO2 GM
   was found to be less prone to steel infiltration than single-phase MgO
   GM. The compositional evolution of steel influenced by gunning material
   was experimentally measured and also predicted with thermodynamic
   equilibrium calculations. The steel cleanliness in terms of inclusion
   size, number density, area fraction and morphology was measured and
   evaluated. Although large Al2O3/AlTiOx inclusions were formed through
   the erosion of Al2O3 GM, the use of Al2O3 GM resulted in an improved
   steel cleanliness due to its lower content of reducible compounds
   compared to that of MgO and MgO + 2MgO center dot SiO2 GM.}},

   plywoods}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{9446-9453}},
Abstract = {{The twisted plywood architecture, known as the Bouligand structure, is a
   ubiquitous biological and synthetic fibrous composite structure,
   analogous to that of cholesteric liquid crystals. Twisted plywoods can
   show ideal or non-ideal structures and are formed via equilibrium or
   non-equilibrium liquid crystal self-assembly processes. A key to the
   structure characterisation of plywood films is the specification of the
   local and global helix vector h(x) and pitch p(x) of the cholesteric
   order. Previous extensive work demonstrated that oblique cuts of the
   plywood give rise to arc-patterns that depend both on the unknown
   incision angle a and the unknown pitch p(x), thus making the precise 3D
   cholesteric reconstruction ambiguous. In this paper we present an

Abstract = {{Drying is one of the most common methods for processing and preserving
   squids. A novel forced convective dryer based on infrared heating was
   developed with an online temperature control. By setting the drying
   medium temperature of 50 degrees C, we studied the effects of infrared
   wavelength and air velocity on drying characteristics of the shredded
   squid and qualities of dried squid products. We also compared it with
   the conventional hot-air drying (HAD) and advanced microwave vacuum
   drying (MVD). The infrared heating rate increase was faster than that of
   HAD. The heating and drying at the wavelength of 2.5-3.0 mu m were more
   effective than those at the infrared wavelength of 5.0-6.0 mu m.
   Specific energy consumption linearly increased with the air velocity.
   Microstructure observation showed that the infrared-dried rehydrated
   sample displayed a muscle fiber structure similar to the fresh sample.
   The infrared-dried squids had less drying shrinkage, brighter color, and
   better rehydration capacity than HAD products. Their sensory qualities
   were better than HAD and MVD products. Above all, infrared drying with
   wavelength of 2.5-3.0 mu m and air velocity of 0.5m/s was suggested as
   the best drying condition for squids in this study.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few decades, researchers have found blueberry leaves to be
   an interesting source of different phenolic compounds, and drying is an
   important part of their postharvest and sample preparation processes. In
   the current study, blueberry leaves were dried using microwave-assisted
   hot air drying or hot air drying alone at 45, 60, and 75 degrees C to
   10-15\% wet basis. Corresponding drying characteristics were determined
   by fitting the moisture ratio obtained in each case with eight
   theoretical and semitheoretical models for hot air and microwave drying
   stages. It was observed that best fitting drying models for blueberry
   leaves depended not only on the nature of the biomaterial but also on
   the method of drying and the temperature of drying. Phenolic content,
   monomeric anthocyanin content, and the corresponding antioxidant
   activity in terms of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition
   activity and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) activity were
   evaluated for the leaf extract obtained following microwave extraction
   of the dried samples obtained using the above-mentioned drying methods
   and were compared to the corresponding bioactive compositional
   characteristics of freeze-dried blueberry leaves. It was observed that
   the freeze-dried sample had the highest content of total phenolics and
   total monomeric anthocyanins along with high antioxidant activity.
   Furthermore, extracts obtained from the microwave-dried leaf samples
   obtained with a drying temperature of 60 degrees C had highest total
   phenolic content and highest total monomeric anthocyanin content among
   all other drying methods and the extract had an antioxidant activity
   similar to the freeze-dried blueberry leaf samples, implying that
   microwave drying at 60 degrees C is a potential alternative to freeze
   drying for preservation of the phenolic components and antioxidant
   activity of dried blueberry leaves.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic nanostructures possess many advantages for utilization in
   various applications including sensing applications. However, achieving
   an easy to fabricate platform with high sensitivity performance is
   considered the main challenge in designing such nanostructures. Two
   factors should be considered when designing a wavelength based
   nanostructured sensor; the field distribution around the nanostructures,
   and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the sensor spectral
   response. In this paper, we study suspended nanodisc structures as a
   candidate for enhancing the electric field distribution in-plane and out
   of plane axes of the nanodiscs, and hence enhancing the probe depth of
   the nanosensor. Another advantage of the suspended nanodisc structure is
   that it offers a 100\% surface coverage. The Finite Difference Time
   Domain (FDTD) method is used for the study of optical properties of the
   structure. The resonance location depends on the dimensions of the
   nanodiscs as well as the polymer base. Higher order modes can also be
   supported by nanodiscs with larger dimensions. The local electric field
   is enhanced as it is distributed in both perpendicular and horizontal
   planes with respect to the plane of gold nanodiscs without altering the
   FWHM relative to the regular nanodisc structure. This is considered as
   an advantage in sensing applications. Another advantage of this
   structure is that it can be readily fabricated by nanoimprint
   lithography and gold deposition.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we review studies that have investigated whether
   neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and neuroimaging measures predict
   decline to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prospective neuropsychological
   studies indicate that cognitive performance may be an excellent
   indicator of future progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to
   AD, particularly when episodic memory is combined with tasks relying on
   executive control and language tasks. Research on neuropsychiatric
   symptoms reveal that depression, apathy, anxiety, and sleep disturbances
   can contribute to predictive models, though their sensitivity is
   typically lower than that found with cognitive measures. Finally,
   different structural brain imaging markers reveal excellent predictive
   accuracy. The paper discusses issues that will have to be addressed in
   future studies. First, it will be necessary to increase the evaluation
   of combined markers, as this may considerably improve predictive
   accuracy. Second, it will be necessary to move to earlier stages than
   MCI in order to expand the detection window. Third, processes of
   compensation and plasticity will have to be better investigated as
   research moves into earlier stages. The Consortium for the early
   identification of AD-Quebec (CIMA-Q) is presented as an instance of this
   approach, and potential batteries of measures are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory heats of an API X100 steel (Mn-Mo-Nb)with two levels of
   vanadium (0.004\% and 0.063\%) were melted and control rolled simulating
   a coiled plate production process. Extensive microstructural analyses
   were performed, including optical, EBSD and TEM. Texture analyses of the
   two alloys were also compared. Mechanical properties were determined for
   various rolling and pipe axis orientations. Only minor differences in
   microstructure and texture properties were observed between the two
   alloys. Yet the 0.063\% V alloy had from 8 to 14\% higher yield and
   tensile strengths in all directions, while the toughness and ductility
   measurements were similar for both alloys. Higher strength of the V
   added pipeline steel was partially due to its smaller grain size and
   larger fraction of subgrain boundaries. Some, but perhaps not all, of
   the strength differences could be related to the observed smaller
   precipitate size of the higher vanadium steel. The vanadium addition was
   necessary in this alloy to ensure meeting the required strength
   properties of X100 steel.}},

   medical devices can be improved by protein coatings. Plasma fibronectin
   (FN) is a circulating soluble protein capable of assembling into
   insoluble filaments, fibrils and networks which promote various cellular
   processes and tissue integrity. FN fibrillogenesis is initiated by a
   conformational change, which has been proposed to involve
   charge-mediated opening of its structure. In this study, we have used a
   bare gold surface polarized electrochemically in the double-layer region
   to modulate its charge from highly positive to highly negative. The
   negatively charged surface promoted molecular extension and assembly of
   FN into beaded filaments and creation of a stable protein coating as
   examined by atomic force microscopy and electrochemical differential
   capacitance measurements. Gold surfaces with open and filamentous FN
   showed significantly improved endothelial cell adhesion while allowing
   formation of cell-cell contacts. Such surfaces may be used to promote
   rapid endothelialisation of cardiovascular stents.}},

Abstract = {{The Thick-Walled Cylinder method was used on corrugated Ni-Al reactive
   laminates to examine how their mesostructures accommodate large strain,
   high strain rate plastic deformation and to examine the potential for
   intermetallic reaction initiation due to mechanical stimuli. Three main
   mesoscale mechanisms of large plastic strain accommodation were observed
   in addition to the bulk distributed uniform plastic flow: (a) the
   extrusion of wedge-shaped regions into the interior of the cylinder
   along planes of easy slip provided by angled layers, (b) the development
   of trans-layer shear bands in the layers with orientation close to
   radial and (c) the cooperative buckling of neighbouring layers
   perpendicular to the radius. These mesoscale mechanisms acted to block
   the development of periodic patterns of multiple, uniformly distributed,
   shear bands that have been observed in all previously examined solid
   homogeneous materials and granular materials. The high-strain plastic
   flow within the shear bands resulted in the dramatic elongation and
   fragmentation of Ni and Al layers. The quenched reaction between Al and
   Ni was observed inside these trans-layer shear bands and in a number of
   the interfacial extruded wedge-shaped regions. The reaction initiated in
   these spots did not ignite the bulk of the material, demonstrating that
   these mesostructured Ni-Al laminates are able to withstand high-strain,
   high-strain rate deformation without reaction. Numerical simulations of
   the explosively collapsed samples were performed using the digitized
   geometry of corrugated laminates and predictions of the final, deformed
   mesostructures agree with the observed deformation patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Collision avoidance for small unmanned aerial vehicles operating in a
   variety of environments is limited by the types of available depth
   sensors. Currently, there are no sensors that are lightweight, function
   outdoors in sunlight, and cover enough of a field of view to be useful
   in complex environments, although many sensors excel in one or two of
   these areas. We present a new depth estimation method, based on concepts
   from multi-view stereo and structured light methods, that uses only
   lightweight miniature cameras and a small laser dot matrix projector to
   produce measurements in the range of 112 meters. The field of view of
   the system is limited only by the number and type of cameras/projectors
   used, and can be fully omnidirectional if desired. The sensitivity of
   the system to design and calibration parameters is tested in simulation,
   and results from a functional prototype are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Working under low light conditions is of particular interest in machine
   vision applications such as night vision, tone-mapping techniques,
   low-light imaging, photography, and surveillance cameras. This work aims
   at investigating the perception of color at low light situations imposed
   by physical principles governing photon emission. The impact of the
   probabilistic nature of photon emission on our color perception becomes
   more significant at low light levels. In this regard, physical
   principles are leveraged to develop a framework to take into account the
   effects of low light level on color vision. Results of this study shows
   that the normalized spectral power distribution of light changes with
   light intensity and becomes more uncertain at low light situation as a
   result of which the uncertainty of color perception increases.
   Furthermore, a color patch at low light levels give rise to uncertain
   color measurements whose chromaticities form an elliptic shape inside
   the chromaticity diagram around the high intensity chromaticity of the
   color patch. The size of these ellipses is a function of the light
   intensity and the chromaticity of color patches however the orientation
   of the ellipses depends only on the patch chromaticity and not on the
   light level. Moreover, the results of this work indicate that the
   spectral composition of light is a determining factor in the size and
   orientation of the ellipses. The elliptic shape of measured samples is a
   result of the Poisson distribution governing photon emission together
   with the form of human cone spectral sensitivity functions and can
   partly explain the elliptic shape of MacAdam ellipses.}},

Abstract = {{Axially stretched free-surface vortices occur at low-head hydropower
   intakes under specific flow and geometric conditions. When they are
   sufficiently strong, they can harm performance or cause premature
   failure of mechanical components such as turbine blades or guide vanes.
   Laboratory-scale experimental models are currently used to assess the
   risk of vortex formation during the design phase, but uncertainty
   remains as to how vortex characteristics translate from the laboratory
   scale to the much larger scale of an actual hydropower plant. This paper
   proposes a semi-empirical model that roughly predicts how the approach
   flow and intake geometry determine the key vortex characteristics (the
   core radius, bulk circulation and the depth of the free surface
   depression). The model is developed using detailed velocity measurements
   of the approach flow and the flow inside the vortex in a
   laboratory-scale physical model, using analytical models and insights
   drawn from previous work.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Engineers frequently use physical scale models of hydropower intakes to
   assess and minimize the occurrence of harmful free surface vortices. The
   impact of surface tension, viscosity and turbulence on the scaling
   behaviour of the vortices is examined here using an analytical free
   surface vortex model developed from measurements in a laboratory-scale
   hydropower intake. First, the effect of surface tension on the free
   surface depression is computed using a finite-difference model over a
   wide range of depression scales and shapes. The impact and scaling
   behaviour of surface tension are found to be qualitatively different
   depending on whether the depression is dimple-or funnel-shaped. The
   influence of viscosity on scaling predicted by the analytical vortex
   model contradicts trends recorded by previous authors, which suggests
   that additional processes such as turbulent diffusion may play a
   significant role at larger scales. Scale effects due to the interplay of
   viscosity and turbulence require further investigation, whereas those
   due to surface tension are fairly easily quantified and predicted.}},

Pages = {{34-44}},
Abstract = {{Research on travel demand modeling has primarily focused on weekday
   activity travel patterns. However, weekend activities and travel
   constitute a major component of individuals' overall weekly activity
   travel participation. This paper describes a modeling effort that
   focuses on weekend activity travel demand for discretionary events. This
   study bridges the gap in the literature by modeling participation in
   discretionary types of events, the duration of participation, and
   accompaniment type jointly in a simultaneous equations model system. A
   joint discrete continuous modeling framework is formulated for analysis
   of these dimensions as a choice bundle. Specifically, the combination of
   event type and accompaniment type constitutes the discrete component,
   whereas the duration of participation constitutes the continuous
   component. The model uses a copula-based sample selection approach that
   ties the discrete choice error component with the duration error
   component in a flexible manner. The data used in the paper are drawn
   from the 2008-2009 National Household Travel Survey sample of the
   greater Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona. The results from the
   estimation process highlight the presence of sample selection in the
   joint modeling context. Furthermore, the results also highlight the
   flexibility of copula models in capturing such sample selection. The
   best copula model results are used to generate hazard profiles for
   various alternative related duration intervals. The generated profiles
   highlight the inaccurate predictions obtained by the use of approaches
   that ignore the presence of sample selection.}},

Title = {{Numerical prediction of size, mass, temperature and trajectory of
   cylindrical wind-driven firebrands}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{698-708}},
Abstract = {{Mathematical models and numerical solution procedures for predicting the
   trajectory, oscillation, possible rotation, and mass and size
   time-evolution of cylindrical wind-driven firebrands are described and
   discussed. Two test problems and the results, used for validating the
   mathematical models, are presented. In one, experimental measurements of
   non-burning cylindrical particles falling in still air are compared to
   numerical predictions and in the other, predictions of time-evolution of
   mass and size of stationary burning particles in air flows are compared
   with experimental results reported in the literature. Results yielded by
   the proposed models for a demonstration problem involving cylindrical
   wind-driven firebrands, with the same initial volume, mass and position,
   but different initial aspect ratios and distinct initial orientations
   relative to the wind velocity, are then presented. These results show
   the following: the horizontal distance travelled by the firebrand from
   release to landing locations is an increasing function of its initial
   aspect ratio; and the initial orientation of the firebrand, and its
   subsequent oscillations including possible rotation, have a significant
   influence on its trajectory, thus it is important to account for them in
   mathematical models formulated for predicting the spread of fires by
   spotting.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{36}},
Pages = {{6917-6925}},
Abstract = {{Thin lubrication flows accompanying drainage from curved surfaces
   surround us (e.g., the drainage of the tear film on our eyes). These
   draining aqueous layers are normally covered with surface-active
   molecules that render the free surface viscoelastic. The non-Newtonian
   character of these surfaces fundamentally alters the dynamics of
   drainage. We show that increased film stability during drainage can
   occur as a consequence of enhanced surface rheology. Increasing the
   surfactant layer viscosity decreases the rate of drainage; however, this
   retarding influence is most pronounced when the insoluble surfactant
   layer has significant elasticity. We also present a simple theoretical
   model that offers qualitative support to our experimental findings.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to apply an Ant colony
   optimization approach for the solution of the topological design of
   interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines.
   Design/methodology/approach - The IPM motor design domain is discretized
   into a suitable equivalent graph representation and an Ant System (AS)
   algorithm is employed to achieve an efficient distribution of materials
   into this graph.
   Findings - The single-objective problems associated with the
   maximization of the torque and with the maximization of the shape
   smoothness of the IPM are investigated. The rotor of the device is
   discretized into a 9 x 18 grid in both cases, and three different
   materials are considered: air, iron and permanent magnet.
   Research limitations/implications - The graph representation used
   enables the solution of topological design problems with an arbitrary
   number of materials, which is relevant for 2 and 3D problems.
   Originality/value - From the numerical experiments, the AS algorithm was
   able to achieve reasonable shapes and torque values for both design
   problems. The results show the relevance of the mechanism for
   multi-domain topology optimization of electromagnetic devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results from an experimental program that
   studied the effects of simulated delamination and corrosion on the
   structural response of six two-way slab-column specimens with details
   typical of older construction. The results in terms of load-deflection
   response, punching shear resistance, and cracking are compared. The test
   results demonstrate that a reduction in reinforcing bar cross-sectional
   area (simulated corrosion) leads to a significant drop in punching shear
   resistance and results in increased crack widths. In addition, the study
   demonstrates that a critical degree of delamination can lead to a
   reduction in punching shear capacity, greater crack widths, and loss of

Pages = {{708-718}},
Abstract = {{The reaction of fresh lightweight concrete with carbon dioxide during
   early-age carbonation curing is hindered by surface saturation due to
   vibration consolidation. To promote a high degree of carbonation of
   fresh lightweight concretes, a dynamic carbonation system was developed
   to remove surface free water and inject carbon dioxide simultaneously.
   Based on cement mass, the resulting carbon uptake reached 13\% in 4 h
   carbonation and 20\% in 18 h carbonation. The early strength by fresh
   carbonation is comparable to that of steam curing, while the late
   strength is higher in a much reduced process time. The dynamic system
   can effectively control the relative humidity of the chamber to prevent
   water accumulation and create a route of capillaries for carbon dioxide
   diffusion and precipitation of carbonates. Dynamic carbonation creates a
   carbonate-bond matrix. The process provides an excellent means to
   recycle carbon dioxide, with economic and environmental benefits.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss recent progress and challenges in realizing Bragg-grating
   devices on the submicron silicon-on-insulator platform for
   next-generation optical communications applications, such as on-chip
   optical interconnects and signal processing. In particular, we focus on
   grating-assisted, wavelength-selective couplers, known as
   contra-directional couplers (contra-DCs). In contrast to conventional
   two-port Bragg gratings operating in the reflection mode, contra-DCs are
   four-port devices with very weak backreflections and, therefore, can be
   easily integrated with other photonic components on a chip. In order to
   provide a reliable on-chip wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
   solution for high-speed optical interconnects, we have developed
   high-performance add-drop filters and, furthermore, wavelength
   multiplexers/demultiplexers with combined advantages of flat-top
   responses, low insertion loss (< 1 dB), and low crosstalk (< -23 dB).
   These WDM devices are ultra-compact and highly tolerant to temperature
   fluctuations (up to +/- 50 degrees C), showing great potential for
   large-scale integration and low-power consumption. We further discuss a
   novel four-port Bragg photonic resonator for high-speed, low-power
   optical switching. Using a coupler-chirped design with uniform Bragg
   gratings, we have recently achieved an on-chip, continuously tunable
   photonic delay line with low insertion loss. These system-orientated
   devices indicate great potential for large-scale integration of
   Bragg-grating-defined functions using CMOS-compatible silicon photonics
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{A coherent jet of particles may be generated by accelerating a conical
   volume of particles by detonating a layer of explosive lining the
   outside of the cone. Experiments have been carried out to determine the
   dependence of the velocity history and coherency of the jet on the
   particle properties and the ratio of the masses of the particles and
   explosive. Steel particles form thin, coherent jets, whereas lighter
   glass particles lead to more diffuse jets. For steel particles, the cone
   angle had little effect on the coherency of the jet. The efficiency of
   the conversion of chemical to kinetic energy is explored by comparing
   the experimental jet velocity with the velocity predicted from a
   formulation of the Gurney method for a conical geometry. The effect of
   particle density and cone angle on the jet formation and development was
   also investigated using a multimaterial hydrocode. The simulations give
   insight into the extent of the deformation of the particle bed in the
   early stages of explosive particle dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{The classical theory of detonation wave propagation has been highly
   successful in prediction of detonation dynamics based on a macroscopic,
   continuum-based approach, wherein the heterogeneity of the energetic
   material only enters the model via the reaction rate term (e.g.,
   hot-spot based reaction mechanisms). The effects of spatial
   heterogeneity are rarely treated explicitly in detonation models.
   However, considerable evidence can be found that mesoscale phenomenon
   can influence the dynamics of the detonation front on scales larger than
   the heterogeneities. Two scenarios are identified that may result in
   spatial non-uniformity of the detonation front influencing the
   macroscopic dynamics of the wave propagation: (1) large-scale
   heterogeneities and (2) transverse or longitudinal instability of the
   front. This evidence is critically reviewed, and possible directions for
   modeling approaches that incorporate the spatial granularity
   (discreteness) of the energetic material are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to soft-launch projectiles to velocities exceeding 10 km/s
   is of interest for a number of scientific fields, including orbital
   debris impact testing and equation of state research. Current
   soft-launch technologies have reached a performance plateau below this
   operating range. In the implosion-driven launcher (ILD) concept,
   explosives are used to dynamically compress a light driver gas to
   significantly higher pressures and temperatures than the propellant of
   conventional light-gas guns. The propellant of the IDL is compressed
   through the linear implosion of a pressurized tube. The imploding tube
   behaves like a piston which travels into the light gas at the explosive
   detonation velocity, thus forming an increasingly long column of
   shock-compressed gas which can be used to propel a projectile. The
   McGill designed IDL has demonstrated the ability to launch a 0.1-g
   projectile to 9.1 km/s. This work will focus on the implementation of a
   novel launch cycle in which the explosively driven piston is accelerated
   in order to gradually increase driver gas compression, thus maintaining
   a relatively constant projectile driving pressure. The theoretical
   potential of the concept as well as the experimental development of an
   accelerating piston driver will be examined.}},

Abstract = {{The detonation behavior of high explosives containing quantities of
   dense additives has been previously investigated with the observation
   that such systems depart dramatically from the approximately ``gamma
   law{''} behavior typical of conventional explosives due to momentum
   transfer and thermalization between particles and detonation products.
   However, the influence of this non-ideal detonation behavior on the
   divergence speed of plates has been less thoroughly studied and existing
   literature suggests that the effect of dense additives cannot be
   explained solely through the straightforward application of the Gurney
   method with energy and density averaging of the explosive. In the
   current study, the acceleration history and terminal velocity of
   aluminum flyers launched by packed beds of granular material saturated
   by amine-sensitized nitromethane is reported. It was observed that
   terminal flyer velocity scales primarily with the ratio of flyer mass to
   mass of the explosive component; a fundamental feature of the Gurney
   method. Velocity decrement from the addition of particles was only
   20\%-30\% compared to the resulting velocity if propelled by an
   equivalent quantity of neat explosive.}},

Abstract = {{The high-strain-rate response of granular media has received
   considerable attention due to increasing interest in granular
   penetration. In the present study, we investigate the response of wetted
   packed particle beds under varying flyer plate-induced shock loadings.
   We investigate the critical conditions for the onset of particle
   deformation in systems of spherical macroscopic glass beads. Resulting
   particle deformations from the shock compression are characterized using
   microscopy as well as particle size analysis, and the effects of shock
   strength are compared. A fracturing response with a bimodal particle
   distribution is observed, with an increasing shift to the lower particle
   size range as shock loading is initially increased. As the transmitted
   shock pressure exceeds 1 GPa, a significant decrease in the mean
   particle size is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Ni-Al laminates have shown promise as reactive materials due to their
   high energy release through intermetallic reaction. In addition to the
   traditional ignition methods, the reaction may be initiated in hot spots
   that can be created during mechanical loading. The explosively driven
   thick walled cylinder (TWC) technique was performed on two Ni-Al
   laminates composed of thin foil layers with different mesostructues:
   concentric and corrugated. These experiments were conducted to examine
   how these materials accommodate large plastic strain under high strain
   rates. Finite element simulations of these specimens with mesostuctures
   digitized from the experimental samples were conducted to provide
   insight into the mesoscale mechanisms of plastic flow. The dependence of
   dynamic behaviour on mesostructure may be used to tailor the hot spot
   formation and therefore the reactivity of the material system.}},

Abstract = {{The present study outlines a new approach to collecting shock Hugoniot
   data in foams using photonic Doppler velocimetry to perform mid-plane
   measurements of the foam deformation. Plate impact experiments were
   carried out to investigate wave propagation in a closed-cell polymeric
   foam and an open-cell aluminum foam. Dual-wave structures were observed
   in both materials with the leading precursor wave determined to be an
   elastic wave. The discussion of the results focuses on the nature of
   foam compression under high-rate loading, particularly the difference
   between the strain history in a foam undergoing uniform stress
   compaction and uniaxial strain compression. These results are discussed
   in reference to the current interpretations of Taylor-Hopkinson bar
   experiments on similar metallic foams. The importance of gas-filtration
   driven flows in the wave dynamics of open-cell foams is discussed in
   relation to the nature of the precursor waves.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses experimental data derived from surface permeability
   tests conducted on a bench-scale 508 mm cuboidal sample of Indiana

   modelling to test the hypothesis that the geometric mean is a good proxy
   to represent permeability when the spatial distribution of the
   permeability for the heterogeneous rock, with no evidence of hydraulic
   anisotropy or fractures, is log-normal. The predictive capabilities of
   the geometric mean as a measure of the effective permeability are
   further assessed by examining specific examples where three-dimensional
   flows are initiated in the heterogeneous domain and where the equivalent
   homogeneous problem gives rise to purely circular flows that have exact
   solutions. The approach is also applied to examine a hypothetical
   hydraulic pulse test that is conducted on a cuboidal region with sealed
   lateral boundaries, consisting of the experimentally measured
   heterogeneous distribution of permeability and an equivalent homogeneous

Abstract = {{Electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI) was used in the cold-field
   emission scanning electron microscope (CFE-SEM) to image the
   microstructure on deformed bulk specimen. Imaging was conducted with a
   pole-piece mounted silicon photodiode detector at 5 keV to collect
   backscattered electrons generated from a low-tilted (0 - 3 degrees)
   specimen. Broad ion beam milling surface preparation technique was used
   to remove surface layers and reveal near-surface deformation features.
   The uniaxial hot-compression tests were conducted on Mg-0.3 wt\% Al-0.2
   wt\% Ca alloy. ECCI observations on deformed bulk specimen showed
   irregular and complex channelling contrast variations inside parent
   grains and low angle grain boundaries originated from parent grain
   boundaries. ECCI on an ion milled prepared surface provides
   non-destructive and rapid visualisation and characterisation of strain
   fields along with near-surface deformation substructures in CFE-SEM.}},

Abstract = {{The high photocatalytic activity of anatase is markedly enhanced by the
   presence of a rutile interface. Such phase heterojunctions have
   previously been formed by sintering admixtures, which results in
   biphasic particles or agglomerated powders. Current efforts to orientate
   these heterojunctions relative to the incident light and electrodes to
   optimize and further improve photoactivity have focussed on sputter
   coating, dip coating and doctor blading. These techniques offer two ways
   by which photoactivity may be increased; firstly by maximizing the area
   of the heterojunction relative to the volume of the two phases and
   secondly by optimizing spatial ordering of the phases, charge carrier
   flow direction and path length. Here we report a one step room
   temperature self-assembly technique which reproducibly creates
   microstructurally phase graduated photoanodes consisting of a base layer
   of rutile nanorods and increasing concentrations of anatase in
   subsequent layers. A large increase in current density and OCP was
   observed (0.4 to 0.75 mA cm(-2)) that coincided with the appearance of
   anatase in the coating i.e. the initial formation of a heterojunction,
   and longer deposition times were concomitant with increasing current
   density to a maximum of 1.1 mA cm(-2) The resulting nanostructured
   electrodes were evaluated in non-optimised N3-dye-sensitized solar cells
   (DSSCs) where they demonstrated 188\% higher short current density than
   P25 controls.}},

Abstract = {{CexLa1xF3 nanoparticles have been proposed for use in
   nanoscintillator-photosensitizer systems, where excitation of
   nanoparticles by ionizing radiation would result in energy transfer to
   photosensitizer molecules, effectively combining the effects of
   radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy. Thus far, there have been few
   experimental investigations of such systems. This study reports novel
   synthesis methods for water-dispersible Ce0.1La0.9F3/LaF3 and CeF3/LaF3
   core/shell nanoparticles and an investigation of energy transfer to
   photosensitizers. Unbound deuteroporphyrin IX 2,4-disulfonic acid was
   found to substantially quench the luminescence of large (>10 nm
   diameter) aminocaproic acid-stabilized nanoparticles at reasonable
   concentrations and loading amounts: up to 80\% quenching at 6\% w/w
   photosensitizer loading. Energy transfer was found to occur primarily
   through a cascade, with excitation of `' regular `' site Ce3+ at 252 nm
   relayed to photosensitizer molecules at the nanoparticle surface through
   intermediate `' perturbed `' Ce3+ sites. Smaller (<5 nm)
   citrate-stabilized nanoparticles were coated with the bisphosphonate
   alendronate, allowing covalent conjugation to chlorin e6 and resulting
   in static quenching of the nanoparticle luminescence: similar to 50\% at
   similar to 0.44\% w/w. These results provide insight into energy
   transfer mechanisms that may prove valuable for optimizing similar
   systems.}},

Title = {{A multiple-discrete approach for examining vehicle type use for daily
   activity participation decisions}},

   RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition that the choice of vehicle type and
   usage decisions form a crucial element in understanding
   transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The traditional
   approach to examining these dimensions is focused on vehicle fleet
   purchase decisions (number and type) and annual usage. These studies
   aggregate the overall vehicle usage as an annual decision, whereas in
   reality households face the choice of vehicle type for out-of-home
   activity participation on a daily basis. With the recent emphasis on
   activity-travel models, there is growing recognition that daily vehicle
   usage choice is affected by activity purpose choice and the travel group
   for the activity. This study develops a representative framework to
   examine daily vehicle type and usage decisions while incorporating the
   influence of activity type and accompaniment type choices. In the
   authors' approach, travel mode choice by considering the various travel
   mode alternatives (transit, walking/bicycling) and replacing the private
   vehicle alternative with various vehicle type options that are available
   to individuals is included. Thus the three choice dimensions, travel
   mode that implicitly considers vehicle type, activity purpose, and
   accompaniment type, are jointly analyzed by generating combination
   alternatives. The mixed multiple-discrete continuous extreme value
   (MMDCEV) framework provides an elegant modeling approach to study these
   choices. In the authors' study, the discrete component is formed as a
   combination of travel mode, activity purpose, and accompaniment type
   while mileage for each combination provides the continuous component.
   The proposed model approach is empirically tested for workers and
   non-workers in New York region using the National Household Travel
   Survey (NHTS) 2009. The model results provide insights on how
   socio-demographics, location, and temporal attributes influence daily
   vehicle type and usage, activity type, and accompaniment type decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Neurodegeneration is characterized by a progressive loss of neuron
   structure and function. Most neurodegenerative diseases progress slowly
   over the time. There is currently no cure available for any
   neurodegenerative disease, and the existing therapeutic interventions
   only alleviate the symptoms of the disease. The advances in the drug
   discovery research have come to a halt with a lack of effective means to
   deliver drugs at the targeted site. In addition, the route of delivering
   the drugs is equally important as most invasive techniques lead to
   postoperative complications. This chapter focuses on a non-invasive,
   intranasal mode of therapeutic delivery using nanoparticles, which is
   currently being explored. The intranasal route of delivery is a
   well-established route to deliver drugs via the olfactory and trigeminal
   neuronal pathways. It is known to be the fastest and most effective way
   to bypass the blood-brain barrier to reach the central nervous system.
   The presented chapter highlights the method of intranasal delivery in
   mice using chitosan- siRNA nanoparticle formulation, under mild
   anesthesia and the identification of successful siRNA delivery in the
   brain tissues, through histology and other well-established laboratory
   protocols.}},

Title = {{Dynamical stability analysis of a hose to the sky}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{226-234}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Stratospheric Shield was proposed as a geoengineering concept to
   control the Earth's climate and reverse global warming. This approach
   seeks to release sulphur dioxide (SO2) aerosols in the stratosphere to
   decrease the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface of the Earth.
   It was proposed that this can be done by pumping liquefied SO2 from the
   ground to the stratosphere in a 30 km long hose supported by aerostats.
   In this paper we evaluate the dynamic stability of a hose to the sky
   considering distributed supportive aerostats and an atomiser nozzle that
   forces a radial discharge of the fluid at the free end of the pipe. We
   modelled the pipe as a taut string conveying fluid using the finite
   element method.
   With a nozzle that discharges the flow straight through, we found that
   the pipe loses stability by buckling when the tension becomes null at
   least at one location along its length. This instability can be avoided
   by having a sufficient minimum tension To throughout the whole length of
   the pipe. The distribution of aerostats does not influence this
   instability but it modifies the mode shapes and affects the complex
   frequencies. The atomiser discharging the flow radially at the tip of
   the pipe has for effect to remove the possibility of an instability; its
   use is thus recommended. Moreover, we showed that the Coriolis damping
   can be significant and that by appropriately selecting the number of
   aerostats as well as the dimensionless flow velocity, stability can be
   increased. With this in mind, a functional hose to the sky could be
   designed to maximise Coriolis damping and thus passively damp the motion
   of the pipe due to forcing from the wind. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effects of intercritical deformation on development of
   microstructure in low-silicon contents multiphase TRIP-assisted steels
   were investigated by laboratory simulation of
   controlled-thermomechanical processing in an automated hot compression
   testing machine. A typical multiple cooling stages TMP program was
   applied and samples were deformed in intercritical region to different
   strains. Microstructures of samples were characterized by optical and
   scanning electron microscopy, XRD and Mossbauer. The result indicated
   that intercritical straining increases volume fraction of polygonal
   ferrite and granular-type retained austenite particles, but reduces
   fraction of bainite. The increase in retained austenite volume fraction
   is attributed to strain-assisted diffusion of carbon and to refinement
   of retained austenite particles.}},

Abstract = {{The gut microbiota is a bacterial bioreactor whose composition is an
   asset for human health. However, circulating gut microbiota derived
   endotoxins cause metabolic endotoxemia, promoting metabolic and liver
   diseases. This study investigates the potential of orally delivered
   microencapsulated Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697 to modulate the
   gut microbiota and reduce endotoxemia in F344 rats. The rats were
   gavaged daily with saline or microencapsulated B. infantis ATCC 15697.
   Following 38 days of supplementation, the treated rats showed a
   significant (P < 0.05) increase in fecal Bifidobacteria (4.34 +/- 0.46
   versus 2.45 +/- 0.25\% of total) and B. infantis (0.28 +/- 0.21 versus
   0.52 +/- 0.12\% of total) and a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in fecal
   Enterobacteriaceae (0.80 +/- 0.45 versus 2.83 +/- 0.63\% of total)
   compared to the saline control. In addition, supplementation with the
   probiotic formulation reduced fecal (10.52 +/- 0.18 versus 11.29 +/-
   0.16 EU/mg; P = 0.01) and serum (0.33 +/- 0.015 versus 0.30 +/- 0.015
   EU/mL; P = 0.25) endotoxins. Thus, microencapsulated B. infantis ATCC
   15697 modulates the gut microbiota and reduces colonic and serum
   endotoxins. Future preclinical studies should investigate the potential
   of the novel probiotic formulation in metabolic and liver diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate that p-type InN nanowires can be realized
   by direct magnesium (Mg) doping. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   experiments on the sidewalls of Mg-doped InN nanowires indicate no
   surface electron accumulation with the background electron concentration
   below 1x10(16) cm(-3). The presence of Mg-acceptors is clearly observed
   by the low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, which shows
   a band-to-band recombination PL peak and a Mg-acceptor energy level
   related PL peak. The peak energy separation is about 60 meV, which is
   consistent with the Mg activation energy in InN. Single nanowire
   field-effect transistors are further fabricated and investigated, which
   clearly exhibits a p-type transistor behavior, representing the first
   direct evidence for p-type conduction in any InN structures. The
   potential device applications based on InN nanowires are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the popularity of using data-driven non-linear methods for
   forecasting streamflow, there has been no exploration of how well such
   models perform in climate regimes with differing hydrological
   characteristics, nor has the performance of these models, coupled with
   wavelet transforms, been compared for lead times of less than 1 month.
   This study compares the use of four different models, namely artificial
   neural networks (ANNs), support vector regression (SVR), wavelet-ANN,
   and wavelet-SVR in a Mediterranean, Oceanic, and Hemiboreal watershed.
   Model performance was tested for 1, 2 and 3 day forecasting lead times,
   measured by fractional standard error, the coefficient of determination,
   Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency, multiplicative bias, probability of
   detection and false alarm rate. SVR based models performed best overall,
   but no one model outperformed the others in more than one watershed,
   suggesting that some models may be more suitable for certain types of
   data. Overall model performance varied greatly between climate regimes,
   suggesting that higher persistence and slower hydrological processes
   (i.e. snowmelt, glacial runoff, and subsurface flow) support reliable
   forecasting using daily and multi-day lead times.}},

Abstract = {{One common feature of many functional surfaces found in nature is their
   modular composition often exhibiting several length scales. Prominent
   natural examples for extreme behaviors can be named in various plant
   leaf (rose, peanut, lotus) or animal toe surfaces (Gecko, tree frog).
   Influence factors of interest are the surface's chemical composition,
   its microstructure, its organized or random roughness and hence the
   resulting surface wetting and adhesion character. Femtosecond (fs) laser
   micromachining offers a possibility to render all these factors in one
   single processing step on metallic and polymeric surfaces. Exemplarily,
   studies on Titanium and PTFE are shown, where the dependence of the
   resulting feature sizes on lasing intensity is investigated. While Ti
   surfaces show rigid surface patterns of micrometer scaled features with
   superimposed nanostructures, PTFE exhibits elastic hairy structures of
   nanometric diameter, which upon a certain threshold tend to bundle to
   larger features. Both surface patterns can be adjusted to mimic specific
   wetting and flow behaviour as seen on natural examples. Therefore,
   fs-laser micromachining is suggested as an interesting industrially
   scalable technique to pattern and fine-tune the surface wettability of a
   surface to the desired extends in one process step. Possible
   applications can be seen with surfaces, which require specific wetting,
   fouling, icing, friction or cell adhesion behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Femtosecond lasers are gaining industrial interest for surface
   patterning and structuring because of the reduced heat effects to the
   surrounding material, resulting in a good quality product with a high
   aspect ratio. Analysis of the plasma plume generated during ablation can
   provide useful information about the laser-material interactions and
   thereby the quality of the resulting surface patterns. As a low-cost
   alternative to rather complicated ICCD camera setups, presented here is
   an approach based on filming the laser machining process with a high
   speed camera and tuning the frame rate of the camera to slightly lower
   than the laser pulse frequency. The delay in frequency between the laser
   and camera results in frames taken from sequential pulses. Each frame
   represents a later phase of plume expansion although taken from
   different pulses. Assuming equal plume evolution processes from pulse to
   pulse, the sequence of images obtained completes a plume expansion
   video. To test the assumption of homogeneity between sequential plumes,
   the camera can be tuned to the frequency of the laser, as to capture
   consecutive plumes at the same phase in their evolution. This approach
   enables a relatively low-cost, high resolution visualization of plasma
   plume evolution suitable for industrial micromachining applications with
   femtosecond lasers. Using this approach we illustrate differences in
   plume expansion at the example of machining homogeneous surface patterns
   in different liquid and gaseous processing environments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an integrated CMOS-MEMS inertial sensor
   microsystem, consisting of a 3-axis accelerometer sensor device and its
   complementary readout circuit, which is designed to operate over a wide
   temperature range from 55 degrees C to 175 degrees C. The accelerometer
   device is based on capacitive transduction and is fabricated using
   PolyMUMPS, which is a commercial process available from MEMSCAP. The
   fabricated accelerometer device is then post-processed by depositing a
   layer of amorphous silicon carbide to form a composite sensor structure
   to improve its performance over an extended wide temperature range. We
   designed and fabricated a CMOS readout circuit in IBM 0.13 mu m process
   that interfaces with the accelerometer device to serve as a capacitance
   to voltage converter. The accelerometer device is designed to operate
   over a measurement range of +/- 20g. The described sensor system allows
   low power, low cost and mass-producible implementation well suited for a
   variety of applications with harsh or wide temperature operating
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency references are used in almost every modern electronic device
   including mobile phones, personal computers, and scientific and medical
   instrumentation. With modern consumer mobile devices imposing stringent
   requirements of low cost, low complexity, compact system integration and
   low power consumption, there has been significant interest to develop
   batch-manufactured MEMS resonators. An important challenge for MEMS
   resonators is to match the frequency and temperature stability of quartz
   resonators. We present 1MHz and 20MHz temperature compensated Free-Free
   beam MEMS resonators developed using PolyMUMPS, which is a commercial
   multi-user process available from MEMSCAP. We introduce a novel
   temperature compensation technique that enables high frequency stability
   over a wide temperature range. We used three strategies: passive
   compensation by using a structural gold (Au) layer on the resonator,
   active compensation through using a heater element, and a Free-Free beam
   design that minimizes the effects of thermal mismatch between the
   vibrating structure and the substrate. Detailed electro-mechanical
   simulations were performed to evaluate the frequency response and
   Quality Factor (Q). Specifically, for the 20MHz device, a Q of 10,000
   was obtained for the passive compensated design. Finite Element Modeling
   (FEM) simulations were used to evaluate the Temperature Coefficient of
   frequency (TCf) of the resonators between -50 degrees C and 125 degrees
   C which yielded +0.638 ppm/degrees C for the active compensated,
   compared to -1.66 ppm/degrees C for the passively compensated design and
   -8.48 ppm/degrees C for uncompensated design for the 20MHz device.
   Electro-thermo-mechanical simulations showed that the heater element was
   capable of increasing the temperature of the resonators by approximately
   53 degrees C with an applied voltage of 10V and power consumption of
   8.42 mW.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the molecular beam epitaxial growth and
   characterization of InN nanowires. Detailed optical and electrical
   transport studies confirm that nondoped InN nanowires can exhibit
   extremely low (< 10(15) cm(-3)) residual electron density. Furthermore,
   the near-surface Femi-level was measured to be 0.4 to 0.5 eV above the
   valence band maximum (VBM), suggesting the absence of Fermi-level
   pinning and surface electron accumulation. These features are
   fundamentally different from those of n-type degenerate InN nanowires or
   InN epilayers. The absence of surface electron accumulation was also
   observed in Mg-doped InN nanowires, where p-type conduction was directly
   measured via Mg-doped InN nanowire field-effect transistors.
   Furthermore, the near-surface Fermi-level can be tuned from 0.1 eV to 1
   eV above the VBM, i.e., from p-type degenerate to n-type degenerate
   through controlled Mg and Si dopant incorporations, a first
   demonstration for any semiconducting nanowire structures.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence of singular
   configurations poses an obstruction to the small-time local
   controllability (STLC) and stabilizability of the attitude dynamics of a
   spacecraft actuated by single-gimbal control moment gyroscopes (CMGs).
   We identify a class of singular CMG configurations called critically
   singular configurations, at which the linearized dynamics fail to be
   controllable. Linear controllability, and hence STLC and
   stabilizability, hold at equilibria in which the CMG array is in a
   nonsingular or singular, but not critically singular, configuration. We
   give sufficient conditions and necessary conditions on critically
   singular configurations for STLC to hold. In particular, we show that
   STLC and stabilizability fail to hold at an equilibrium if the magnitude
   of the total spin angular momentum of the CMG array has a local maximum
   at the equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of Widmanstatten ferrite was investigated in a 0.036\% Nb
   microalloyed steel at temperatures above the Ae(3) using optical

   consecutives stages: (i) stage I, first observed at strains below 0.5,
   leads to the presence of Widmanstatten ferrite plates only about 200nm
   wide, (ii) stage II, observed at strains >0.5, involves the coalescence
   of the Widmanstatten plates into grains. Thus the microstructures formed
   by dynamic transformation are composed of fresh Widmanstatten plates
   (stage 1) and polygonal grains (stage 2). Over the experimental
   temperature range of 836-896 degrees C, the ultrafine ferrite plates and

Title = {{High mechanical strain of primary intervertebral disc cells promotes
   secretion of inflammatory factors associated with disc degeneration and
   pain}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Excessive mechanical loading of intervertebral discs
   (IVDs) is thought to alter matrix properties and influence disc cell
   metabolism, contributing to degenerative disc disease and development of
   discogenic pain. However, little is known about how mechanical strain
   induces these changes. This study investigated the cellular and
   molecular changes as well as which inflammatory receptors and cytokines
   were upregulated in human intervertebral disc cells exposed to high
   mechanical strain (HMS) at low frequency. The impact of these metabolic
   changes on neuronal differentiation was also explored to determine a
   role in the development of disc degeneration and discogenic pain.
   Methods: Isolated human annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP)
   cells were exposed to HMS (20\% cyclical stretch at 0.001 Hz) on
   high-extension silicone rubber dishes coupled to a mechanical stretching
   apparatus and compared to static control cultures. Gene expression of
   Toll-like receptors (TLRs), neuronal growth factor (NGF) and tumour
   necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was assessed. Collected conditioned
   media were analysed for cytokine content and applied to rat
   pheocromocytoma PC12 cells for neuronal differentiation assessment.
   Results: HMS caused upregulation of TLR2, TLR4, NGF and TNF alpha gene
   expression in IVD cells. Medium from HMS cultures contained elevated
   levels of growth-related oncogene, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-15,
   monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), MCP-3, monokine induced by.
   interferon, transforming growth factor beta 1, TNF alpha and NGF.
   Exposure of PC12 cells to HMS-conditioned media resulted in both
   increased neurite sprouting and cell death.
   Conclusions: HMS culture of IVD cells in vitro drives cytokine and
   inflammatory responses associated with degenerative disc disease and
   low-back pain. This study provides evidence for a direct link between
   cellular strain, secretory factors, neoinnervation and potential
   degeneration and discogenic pain in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated carbonation is a process in which CO2 is intentionally
   introduced to concrete at an early age for a short period of time to
   promote rapid strength gain. The accelerated carbonation of portland
   limestone cement (PLC) was studied to examine the possibility of
   replacing ordinary portland cement (OPC) by PLC in carbonation curing of
   precast concrete products. Carbonation behavior was characterized by
   strength gain, CO2 uptake, pH change, XRD, TG, SEM, FTIR, and Si-29 NMR
   spectroscopy. It was found that PLC was a CO2 reactive material. Its CO2
   uptake reached 12\% based on dry cement mass. In reference to hydrated
   PLC, the strength of carbonated PLC was 79\% higher at 20 h and of close
   value at 28 days, even though the ultimate CaCO3 content in carbonated
   PLC was over 40\%. The calcium carbonates produced by accelerated
   carbonation were found to be imbedded in calcium silicate hydrates,
   forming an intermingled microstructure. The high carbonation reactivity
   of PLC was possibly attributed to its fine particle size and the
   existence of limestone powder nuclei for calcium carbonate
   precipitation. The use of PLC in accelerated carbonation of concrete
   products can significantly contribute to a net gain in carbon emission
   reduction.}},

   in gastric acid, bile, and through human gastrointestinal transit was
   investigated, as well as the formulation's effect on the gut microbiota.
   Results show that microencapsulation increases B. infantis ATCC 15697
   cell survival at pH1.0 (33.54 +/- 2.80\% versus <1.00 +/- 0.00\%), pH1.5

Title = {{Mechanisms and shape predictions of nematic disclination branching under
   conical confinement}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3245-3258}},
Abstract = {{Liquid crystals (LCs) are self-organizing anisotropic viscoelastic soft
   materials that flow like viscous liquids and display anisotropies like
   crystals. When a nematic liquid crystal is confined to a capillary tube
   with strong anchoring conditions, disclination defects of higher (+1)
   and lower (+1/2) topological charges can coexist, connected through a
   defect branch point. The shape of the +1/2 disclination lines emanating
   from the branch point are functions of confinement and bulk elasticity.
   Previous work shows that nematic liquid crystals under cylindrical
   confinement display a radial (one + 1 line)-to-planar polar (two + 1/2
   lines) defect texture transition through the nucleation and uniform
   motion of a disclination branch point. Here we present analysis, scaling
   and modeling based on a non-linear non-local nematic elastic equation
   that shows that a branch point also can be generated from disclinations
   in a liquid crystal confined to different conical geometries with
   homeotropic anchoring conditions. The cone aperture increases the
   bending stiffness but decreases the curvature of the disclination. These
   competing effects lead to a decrease in the total disclination
   curvature, increase in elastic energy and volume of the branching
   region. The results are summarized into power laws and integrated into a
   shape/energy diagram that reveals the effects of confinement and its
   gradient (cone angle) on disclination shape selection. These new
   findings are useful to assess the Frank elasticity of new nematic liquid
   crystals and to predict novel defect structures in complex confinement,
   including biological microfluidics and mesophase fiber spinning.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental apparatus was built to measure CO2 solubility for both
   tomato slurry and water at different pressures and temperatures. Water
   measurements were used to evaluate the efficacy of the designed system.
   The relationship between solubility and equilibrium CO2 pressure was
   determined and then Henry's constant was established as a function of
   temperature for predicting the CO2 solubility within tomato. It was
   demonstrated that the CO2 solubility in water measured using the
   designed system was always lower than published data, however this
   difference was less than 5\% in all cases. Measured CO2 solubility in
   tomato slurry was significantly lower than in water; it increased
   linearly with the increase of CO2 partial pressure. Finally, the value
   of Henry's constant for CO2 was determined for the tomato slurry as a
   function of the liquid temperature. The result will be used for the
   measurement of CO2 gas solubilization/release in tomato flesh because of
   variation of the CO2 partial pressure taking place around the produce
   during hyperbaric storage.}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic database for the oxyfluoride system
   CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-Na2O-K2O-Li2O-MnO-FeO-F has been developed based on

   fluxes. In addition, a kinetic model was developed to simulate the
   interactions between the mold flux and molten steel using effective
   equilibrium reaction volumes combined with the thermodynamic database.
   The kinetic model successfully reproduced the significant Al2O3
   accumulation observed when casting high Al steel with CaO-SiO2 based

Series = {{Signals and Communication Technology}},

Pages = {{325-355}},
Abstract = {{This chapter presents selective gossip which is an algorithm that
   applies the idea of iterative information exchange to vectors of data.
   Instead of communicating the entire vector and wasting network
   resources, our method adaptively focuses communication on the most
   significant entries of the vector. We prove that nodes running selective
   gossip asymptotically reach consensus on these significant entries, and
   they simultaneously reach an agreement on the indices of entries which
   are insignificant. The results demonstrate that selective gossip
   provides significant communication savings in terms of the number of
   scalars transmitted. In the second part of the chapter we propose a
   distributed particle filter employing selective gossip. We show that
   distributed particle filters employing selective gossip provide
   comparable results to the centralized bootstrap particle filter while
   decreasing the communication overhead compared to using randomized
   gossip to distribute the filter computations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a family of discriminative manifold learning
   approaches to feature space dimensionality reduction in noise robust
   automatic speech recognition (ASR). The specific goal of these
   techniques is to preserve local manifold structure in feature space
   while at the same time maximizing the separability between classes of
   feature vectors. In the manifold space, the relationships among the
   feature vectors are defined using nonlinear kernels. Two separate
   distance measures are used to characterize the kernels, namely the
   conventional Euclidean distance and a cosine-correlation based distance.
   The performance of the proposed techniques is evaluated on two task
   domains involving noise corrupted utterances of connected digits and
   read newspaper text. Performance is compared to existing approaches used
   for feature space transformations, including linear discriminant
   analysis (LDA) and locality preserving linear projections (LPP). The
   proposed approaches are found to provide a significant reduction in word
   error rate (WER) with respect to the more well-known techniques for a
   variety of noise conditions. Another contribution of the paper is to
   quantify the interaction between acoustic noise conditions and the shape
   and size of local neighborhoods which are used in manifold learning to
   define local relationships among feature vectors. Based on this
   analysis, a procedure for reducing the impact of varying acoustic

Abstract = {{Electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) fed with carbon
   monoxide (CO) has been recently demonstrated; however, the microbial
   ecology of this system has not yet been described. In this work the
   diversity of the microbial community present at the anode of CO-fed MFCs
   was studied by performing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
   and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analyses. HTS indicated a
   significant increase of the archaeal genus Methanobacterium and of the
   bacterial order Clostridiales, notably including Clostridium species,
   while in both MFCs DGGE identified members of the bacterial genera
   Geobacter, Desulfovibrio, and Clostridium, and of the archaeal genera
   Methanobacterium, Methanofollis, and Methanosaeta. In particular, the
   presence of Geobacter sulfurreducens was identified. Tolerance of G.
   sulfurreducens to CO was confirmed by growing G. sulfurreducens with
   acetate under a 100 \% CO atmosphere. This observation, along with the
   identification of acetogens, supports the hypothesis of the two-step
   process in which CO is converted to acetate by the carboxidotrophic
   Bacteria and acetate is then oxidized by CO-tolerant electricigenic
   Bacteria to produce electricity.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of frothers in preventing bubble coalescence during flotation of
   minerals has long been investigated. To evaluate the performance of a
   frother, an apparatus to measure the bubble size is a basic necessity.
   McGill Bubble Size Analyzer (MBSA) or bubble viewer that has been
   developed and completed by McGill University's Mineral Processing Group
   during the last decade is a unique instrument to serve this purpose. Two
   parameters which are thought to influence the bubble size measurements
   by McGill bubble viewer include water quality and frother concentration
   in the chamber. Results show that there is no difference in Sauter mean
   (D (32)) when tap or de-ionized water was used instead of process water.
   However, the frother concentration, in this research DowFroth 250
   (DF250), inside the chamber exhibited a pronounced effect on bubble
   size. Frother concentration below a certain point can not prevent
   coalescence inside the chamber and therefore caution must be taken in
   plant applications. It was also noted that the frother concentration
   which has been so far practiced in plant measurements (CCC75-CCC95) is
   high enough to prevent coalescence with the bubble viewer.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-soaked flax stems were subjected to microwave assisted retting at
   different power levels and the effectiveness of microwave assisted
   retting was studied through the analysis of chemical compounds presented
   in the retted flax fibers processed from the stems. Response surface
   statistical design was used for this study with JMP (R) 10 software.
   Chemical analyses were performed by gravimetric methods to find out
   percentage of compounds. Cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and pectin
   concentrations and the sugar content in the solution obtained after the
   treatment were subjected to analysis. Cellulose percentage in the fiber
   was increased significantly (p < 0.0001) with the increase of microwave
   power at various soaking levels, which proved the release of cellulosic
   fiber with the application of microwave energy during retting.
   Hemicellulose, lignin and pectin concentrations decreased significantly
   after microwave-assisted retting which explained higher degree of
   retting after the treatment. This study noted change in chemical
   composition of the fibers, which can be used as a tool to estimate the
   effectiveness of microwave-assisted retting and the results could lead
   to optimization of the process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The utilization of canola proteins as feedstock for bio-based polymers
   has not been demonstrated extensively. However, canola proteins has an
   amino acid profile similar to that of soy proteins, suggesting that
   canola protein may be a potential feedstock for manufacturing
   biodegradable polymeric materials. This study reports for the first
   time, the synthesis of canola protein isolate-based films plasticized
   with glycerol by solution casting. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and
   stearic acid (SA) were used as the protein denaturant and co-plasticizer
   respectively. The functional properties of the films, including the
   structural, mechanical, thermal, water absorptive and morphological
   properties were determined. It was found that SDS substantially
   increased the mechanical properties and raised the water absorption
   capacities of the resulting film up to 1115\%. However, films
   co-plasticized by SA had weaker mechanical properties, and lower water
   absorption capacities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1611-1620}},
Abstract = {{Phase ordering over solid substrates is a ubiquitous and important soft
   material transformation process whose description incorporates wetting,
   anchoring and phase transition kinetics. In this paper the kinetics of
   the isotropic-to-nematic isothermal phase transition over a flat solid
   surface in a growing spherical drop is analyzed based on the Landau-de
   Gennes Q-tensor order parameter equations. The model, based on a
   previously derived interface force balance and a newly derived contact
   line force balance, is shown to be consistent with the generic model of
   conservative interface and contact line motions. The advancing dynamic
   contact angle equation is extracted from kinematic compatibility between
   the moving isotropic-nematic interface and contact line. A tractable
   surface phase transition kinetic model obtained by focusing on the
   dominant phase transition and wetting driving forces yields: (i) the
   constant advancing dynamic contact angle theta, and (ii) the contact
   line speed as a function of undercooling Delta T. It is shown that as
   undercooling increases, the surface phase transition mode approaches the
   bulk phase transition mode, such that theta approaches pi. The elastic
   and wetting parameters that control the phase transformation process are
   identified and experiments for their determination are defined. These
   dynamic wetting and surface phase transition results significantly
   expand existing characterization methods of LC-substrate interfaces
   based on static phase transition droplet methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we examine, for the first time, the use of classification

   contains a 16-element antenna array, and testing is done on breast
   phantoms that mimic breast tissue dielectric properties. We obtain
   experimental data from multiple breast phantoms with two possible tumor
   locations. In this work, we investigate a method for detecting the
   tumors within the breast but without the usual complexity inherent to
   image-generation methods, and confirm its feasibility on experimental
   data. The proposed method uses machine learning techniques, namely
   Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to
   determine whether the current breast being scanned is tumor-free. Our
   results show that both SVM and LDA methods have promise as algorithms
   supporting early breast cancer microwave screening.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the maximization of the weighted sum-rate
   (WSR) in the multicell MIMO multiple access channel (MAC). We consider a
   multicell network operating on the same frequency channel with multiple
   mobile stations (MS) per cell. Assuming the interference coordination
   mode in the multicell network, each base-station (BS) only decodes the
   signals for the MSs within its cell, while the inter-cell transmissions
   are treated as noise. Nonetheless, the uplink precoders are jointly
   optimized at MSs through the coordination among the cells in order to
   maximize the network weighted sum-rate (WSR). Since this WSR
   maximization problem is shown to be nonconvex, obtaining its globally
   optimal solution is rather computationally complex. Thus, our focus in
   this work is on low-complexity algorithms to obtain at least locally
   optimal solutions. Specifically, we propose two iterative algorithms:
   one is based on successive convex approximation and the other is based
   on iterative minimization of weighted mean squared error. Both solution
   approaches shall then reveal the structure of the optimal uplink
   precoders. In addition, we also show that the proposed algorithms can be
   implemented in a distributed manner across the coordinated cells.
   Simulation results show a significant improvement in the network
   sum-rate by the proposed algorithms, compared to the case with no
   interference coordination.}},

Title = {{Joint Subchannel Assignment and Power Allocation for OFDMA Femtocell

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a joint subchannel and power allocation
   algorithm for the downlink of an orthogonal frequency-division multiple
   access (OFDMA) mixed femtocell/macrocell network deployment.
   Specifically, the total throughput of all femtocell user equipments
   (FUEs) is maximized while the network capacity of an existing macrocell
   is always protected. Towards this end, we employ an iterative approach
   in which OFDM subchannels and transmit powers of base stations (BS) are
   alternatively assigned and optimized at every step. For a fixed power
   allocation, we prove that the optimal policy in each cell is to give
   each subchannel to the user with the highest
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) on that subchannel. For a
   given subchannel assignment, we adopt the successive convex
   approximation (SCA) approach and transform the highly nonconvex power
   allocation problem into a sequence of convex subproblems. In the
   arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) approximation, we apply geometric
   programming to find optimal solutions after condensing a posynomial into
   a monomial. On the other hand, logarithmic and
   difference-of-two-concave-functions (D.C.) approximations lead us to
   solving a series of convex relaxation programs. With the three proposed
   SCA-based power optimization solutions, we show that the overall joint
   subchannel and power allocation algorithm converges to some local
   maximum of the original design problem. While a central processing unit
   is required to implement the AGM approximation-based solution, each BS
   locally computes the optimal subchannel and power allocation for its own
   servicing cell in the logarithmic and D.C. approximation-based
   solutions. Numerical examples confirm the merits of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-123}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of categorical and continuous variables is performed using a
   new pattern-based simulation method founded upon coding spatial patterns
   in one dimension. The method consists of, first, using a spatial
   template to extract information in the form of patterns from a training
   image. Patterns are grouped into a pattern database and, then, mapped to
   one dimension. Cumulative distribution functions of the one-dimensional
   patterns are built. Patterns are then classified by decomposing the
   cumulative distribution functions, and calculating class or cluster
   prototypes. During the simulation process, a conditioning data event is
   compared to the class prototype, and a pattern is randomly drawn from
   the best matched class. Several examples are presented so as to assess
   the performance of the proposed method, including conditional and
   unconditional simulations of categorical and continuous data sets.
   Results show that the proposed method is efficient and very well
   performing in both two and three dimensions. Comparison of the proposed
   method to the filtersim algorithm suggests that it is better at
   reproducing the multi-point configurations and main characteristics of
   the reference images, while less sensitive to the number of classes and
   spatial templates used in the simulations.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Highly mineralized natural materials such as teeth or mollusk shells
   boast unusual combinations of stiffness, strength and toughness
   currently unmatched by engineering materials. While high mineral
   contents provide stiffness and hardness, these materials also contain
   weaker interfaces with intricate architectures, which can channel
   propagating cracks into toughening configurations. Here we report the
   implementation of these features into glass, using a laser engraving
   technique. Three-dimensional arrays of laser-generated microcracks can
   deflect and guide larger incoming cracks, following the concept of
   `stamp holes'. Jigsaw-like interfaces, infiltrated with polyurethane,
   furthermore channel cracks into interlocking configurations and pullout
   mechanisms, significantly enhancing energy dissipation and toughness.
   Compared with standard glass, which has no microstructure and is
   brittle, our bio-inspired glass displays built-in mechanisms that make
   it more deformable and 200 times tougher. This bio-inspired approach,
   based on carefully architectured interfaces, provides a new pathway to
   toughening glasses, ceramics or other hard and brittle materials.}},

Title = {{Decreased solute adsorption onto cracked surfaces of mechanically

Abstract = {{Background: Currently available methods for contrast agent-based
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of
   articular cartilage can only detect cartilage degradation after
   biochemical changes have occurred within the tissue volume. Differential
   adsorption of solutes to damaged and intact surfaces of cartilage may be
   used as a potential mechanism for detection of injuries before
   biochemical changes in the tissue volume occur.
   Methods: Adsorption of four fluorescent macromolecules to surfaces of
   injured and sliced cartilage explants was studied. Solutes included
   native dextran, dextrans modified with aldehyde groups or a chondroitin
   sulfate (CS)-binding peptide and the peptide alone.
   Results: Adsorption of solutes to fissures was significantly less than
   to intact surfaces of injured and sliced explants. Moreover, solute
   adsorption at intact surfaces of injured and sliced explants was less
   reversible than at surfaces of uninjured explants. Modification of
   dextrans with aldehyde or the peptide enhanced adsorption with the same
   level of differential adsorption to cracked and intact surfaces.
   However, aldehyde-dextran exhibited irreversible adsorption.
   Equilibration of explants in solutes did not decrease the viability of
   chondrocytes.
   Conclusions and general significance: Studied solutes showed promising
   potential for detection of surface injuries based on differential
   interactions with cracked and intact surfaces. Additionally, altered
   adsorption properties at surfaces of damaged cartilage which visually
   look healthy can be used to detect micro-damage or biochemical changes
   in these regions. Studied solutes can be used in in vivo fluorescence
   imaging methods or conjugated with MRI or CT contrast agents to develop
   functional imaging agents. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{160-166}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Variable stiffness composite laminates can be manufactured using
   Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) technology. An improvement in structural
   performance can be achieved by tailoring their material properties in
   directions that are more favorable to carry loads. During AFP
   manufacturing, however, the formation of defects, mainly gaps and
   overlaps, is inevitable. The extent of a defected zone is generally
   controlled by two sets of parameters: design parameters; and
   manufacturing parameters. In this work, we investigate how the
   parameters governing the formation of defects impact the set of optimal
   solutions for a multi-objective optimization problem, where in-plane
   stiffness and buckling load are simultaneously maximized. It is found
   that increasing the number of tows within a course reduces the amount of
   defected areas, where the course width is kept constant. Furthermore,
   the amount of defect areas significantly reduces by using a wide course,
   which has the effect of both increasing the deviation from the designed
   fiber path and reducing the number of manufacturable designs. The
   results show that a complete gap strategy shifts the defect-free Pareto
   front, obtained without considering the effect of defects, towards lower
   in-plane stiffness and buckling load; on the other hand, a complete
   overlap strategy shifts the Pareto front towards higher structural
   properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Automated fiber placement is a manufacturing technology that enables to
   build composite laminates with curvilinear fibers. To determine their
   optimum mechanical properties, finite element analysis is commonly used
   as a solver within an optimization framework. The analysis of laminates
   with curvilinear fibers coupled with the fiber path optimization
   requires a large number of function evaluations, each time-consuming. To
   reduce the time for analysis and thus for optimization, a metamodel is
   often proposed. This work examines a set of metamodeling techniques for
   the design optimization of composite laminates with variable stiffness.
   Three case studies are considered. The first two pertain to the fiber
   path design of a plate under uniform compression. The third concerns the
   optimization of a composite cylinder under pure bending. Four
   metamodeling methods, namely Polynomial Regression, Radial Basis
   Functions, Kriging and Support Vector Regression, are tested, and their
   performance is compared. Accuracy, robustness, and suitability for
   integration within an optimization framework are the appraisal criteria.
   The results show that the most accurate and robust models in exploring
   the design space are Kriging and Radial Basis Functions. The suitability
   of Kriging is the highest for a low number of design variables, whereas
   the best choice for a high number of variables is Radial Basis
   Functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of distributed adaptive estimation over networks
   where nodes cooperate to estimate physical parameters that can vary over
   both space and time domains. We use a set of basis functions to
   characterize the space-varying nature of the parameters and propose a
   diffusion least mean-squares (LMS) strategy to recover these parameters
   from successive time measurements. We analyze the stability and
   convergence of the proposed algorithm, and derive closed-form
   expressions to predict its learning behavior and steady-state
   performance in terms of means-quare error. We find that in the
   estimation of the space-varying parameters using distributed approaches,
   the covariance matrix of the regression data at each node becomes
   rank-deficient. Our analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm can
   overcome this difficulty to a large extent by benefiting from the
   network stochastic matrices that are used to combine exchanged
   information between nodes. We provide computer experiments to illustrate
   and support the theoretical findings.}},

Abstract = {{In a conventional arrangement of the airflow pathway in
   nonunidirectional airflow cleanrooms with wall return schemes, the
   supply air is introduced from ceiling air grills and the return air,
   close and vertical to the floor, is extracted from the wall air grills.
   However, such a wall return ventilation system is theoretically not an
   optimal design for removing heat and particles released from processing
   machinery. The conventional wall return system currently used in
   cleanrooms aims to create an environment with diluted particle
   concentration in which downward cold supply air from ceiling filters
   encounters upward air currents generated by drifted particles from
   processing machinery. To solve the problem, we introduced a new design
   called fan dry coil units (FDCUs). In this article, we compare the
   performances of both innovative and traditional ventilation systems in a
   full-scale cleanroom. For each return air ventilation system, we
   investigated the effects of air change rates on the removal of 0.1
   approximate to 5m particles. Based on the results, it is noted that the
   FDCU-return system eliminates about 60\% more particles from the
   cleanrooms, compared with conventional wall-return system.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an adaptive controller for multi-joint, multi-muscle arm
   movements based on simplified spinal-like circuits found in the
   periphery, muscle synergies, and interpretations of gain-field
   projections from reach related neurons in the Superior Colliculus. The
   resulting innovation provides a highly robust sensory based controller
   that can be adapted to systems which require multi-muscle co-ordination.
   It provides human-like responses during perturbations elicited either
   internally or by the environment and for simple point-to-point reaching.
   We simulate limb motion and EMGs in Simulink using Virtual Muscle models
   and a variety of paradigms, including motion with external
   perturbations, and varying levels of antagonist muscle co-contractions.
   The results show that the system can exhibit smooth coordinated motions,
   without explicit kinematic or dynamic planning even in the presence of
   perturbations. In addition, we show by varying the level of muscle
   co-contractions from 0\% to 40\%, that the effects of external
   perturbations on joint trajectories can be reduced by up to 42\%. The
   improved controller design is novel providing robust behavior during
   dynamic events and an automatic adaptive response from

Abstract = {{Sandblasting is a commonly used surface treatment technique for dental
   crowns to improve the adhesion of the mating parts of a restoration. The
   goal of this work is to study the effect of different sandblasting
   conditions on the mechanical properties of 3 mol \% yttria stabilized
   tetragonal zirconia (3Y-TZP), such as biaxial strength, surface elastic
   modulus, contact hardness and residual stresses induced by sandblasting.
   The specimens were sandblasted considering two different particle sizes
   (110, 250 pm), two pressures (2 and 4 bar) and two impact angles (30 and
   90). Biaxial strength of 3Y-TZP increases when sandblasted with 110 mu m
   particles while its decreases with 250 mu m particles for impact angle
   of 90. Strength increases slightly when sandblasting with 30' impact
   angle regardless of the size of the particle. Elastic modulus and
   contact hardness were not affected by sandblasting with 110 mu m
   particles, and compressive residual stresses are produced down to a
   depth of similar to 10 mu m. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique for real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) compression
   is proposed in this paper. This technique makes use of the redundancy
   between the different frequency subbands present in EEG segments of one
   channel. It uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and dynamic reference
   lists to compute and send the decorrelated subband coefficients. Set
   partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) is also used as source coder.
   Experimental results showed that the proposed method can not only
   compress EEG channels in one dimension (1-D), but also detect
   seizure-like activity. A diagnostics-oriented performance assessment was
   performed to evaluate the performance of both the compression and
   detection capabilities of the proposed method. In this paper, we show
   that the algorithm can positively detect seizure sections in the
   recordings at bitrates down to 2 bits per sample.}},

Abstract = {{Static deflection as well as free and forced large-amplitude vibrations
   of thin rectangular rubber plates under uniformly distributed pressure

   geometrical non-linearities are accounted for. The deflections of a thin
   initially flat plate are described by the von Karman non-linear plate
   theory. A method for building a local model, which approximates the
   plate behavior around a deformed configuration, is proposed. This local
   model takes the form of a system of ordinary differential equations with
   quadratic and cubic non-linearities. The corresponding results are
   compared to the exact solution and are found to be accurate. Two models
   reflecting both physical and geometrical non-linearities and geometrical
   non-linearities only are compared. It is found that the sensitivity of
   the deflection to the physically induced non-linearities at moderate
   strains is significant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{57-75}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A geometrically non-linear theory is developed for shells of generic
   shape allowing for third-order thickness stretching, higher-order shear
   deformation and rotary inertia by using eight parameters; geometric
   imperfections are also taken into account. The geometrically non-linear
   strain-displacement relationships are derived retaining full non-linear
   terms in the in-plane and transverse displacements and are presented in
   curvilinear coordinates, ready to be implemented in computer codes.
   Higher order terms in the transverse coordinate are retained in the
   derivation so that the theory is suitable also for thick laminated
   shells. The theory uses the three-dimensional constitutive equations and
   does not need the introduction of traction/compression free hypothesis
   at the shell inner and outer surfaces. The traction/compression free
   condition is introduced only to obtain a simplified model with six
   parameters instead of eight. The third-order thickness stretching theory
   is applied to cross-ply symmetrically laminated circular cylindrical
   shells complete around the circumference and simply supported at both
   ends. Geometrically non-linear forced vibrations are studied by using
   the present theory and results are compared to those obtained by using a
   refined higher-order shear deformation non-linear shell theory, which
   neglects thickness stretching, and to results obtained by using
   first-order and second-order thickness stretching theories. Results
   obtained by using the reduced third-order thickness stretching model
   with six parameters are also presented and compared. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of steady viscous forces (skin friction and
   pressurization) on the non-linear behaviour and stability of
   cantilevered shells conveying fluid is investigated for the first time.
   These forces are obtained by using the time-mean Navier-Stokes equations
   and are modelled as initial loadings on the shell, which are in a
   membrane-state of equilibrium with in-plane stresses. The unsteady
   fluid-dynamic forces, associated to shell motions, act as additional
   loadings on this pre-stressed configuration; they are modelled by means
   of potential flow theory and obtained by employing the Fourier transform
   technique. The problem is formulated using the extended Hamilton's
   principle in which the shell model is geometrically non-linear and based
   on Flugge's thin shell assumptions. This model includes non-linear terms
   of mid-surface stretching and the non-linear terms of curvature changes
   and twist, as well. The displacement components of the shell are
   expanded by using trigonometric functions for the circumferential
   direction and the cantilevered beam eigenfunctions for the longitudinal
   direction. Axisymmetric modes are successfully incorporated into the
   solution expansion based on a physical approximation. The system is
   discretized and the resulting coupled non-linear ODEs are integrated
   numerically, and bifurcation analyses are performed using the AUTO
   program. Results show that the steady viscous effects diminish the
   critical flow velocity of flutter and extend the range of flow velocity
   over which limit cycle responses are stable. On the other hand, the
   non-linear terms of curvature changes and twist have very little effect
   on the dynamics. The system exhibits rich post-critical dynamical
   behaviour and follows a quasiperiodic route to chaos. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The design of steel sheathed cold-formed steel (CFS) framed shear walls
   is not addressed in Canadian design standards. A program of displacement
   based loading tests was carried out on single-storey shear walls of

   to lateral loading and combined lateral plus gravity loading, differed
   in sheathing thickness, screw fastener detailing, framing thickness,
   aspect ratio and framing reinforcement. The performance under loading
   was directly related to the sheathing connection pattern; however, when
   the framing elements were not blocked tension field forces resulted in
   significant damage to the chord studs. Details of the test program and

Abstract = {{Metabolic syndrome, encompassing type 2 diabetes mellitus and
   cardiovascular disease, is a growing health concern of industrialized
   countries. Ferulic acid (FA) is a phenolic acid found in foods normally
   consumed by humans that has demonstrated antioxidant activity,
   cholesterol-lowering capabilities, and anti-tumorigenic properties.
   Select probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus fermentum NCIMB 5221,
   produce FA due to intrinsic ferulic acid esterase activity. The aim of
   the present research was to investigate a FA-producing probiotic, L.
   fermentum NCIMB 5221, as a biotherapeutic for metabolic syndrome. The
   probiotic formulation was administered daily for 8 weeks to Zucker
   diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, a model of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia.
   Results show that the probiotic formulation reduced fasting insulin
   levels and insulin resistance, significantly reduced serum triglycerides
   (p = 0.016), lowered serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p
   = 0.008), and significantly reduced the atherogenic (p = 0.016) and
   atherosclerosis (p = 0.012) index as compared to the control animals. In
   addition, the probiotic formulation significantly increased high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p = 0.041) as compared to the control
   animals. This research indicates that administration of the FA-producing
   L. fermentum NCIMB 5221 has the potential to reduce insulin resistance,
   hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, and other markers involved in
   the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Further studies are required to
   investigate the human clinical potential of the probiotic formulation in
   affecting the markers and pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a ``distributed high-voltage dc (HVDC) converter{''}
   for offshore wind farms. The proposed converter topology allows series
   interconnection of wind turbines with the need of neither ac transformer
   nor offshore platform at the sending end. Each wind turbine is equipped
   with a 5-MW permanent-magnet synchronous generator and an ac-dc-dc
   converter. The converter topology is a diode rectifier (ac-dc) cascaded
   with a single-switch step-down converter (dc-dc). The dc-dc stage allows
   the current to flow at all times in the dc link while simultaneously
   regulating generator torque. The inverter station, located onshore, is a
   thyristor-based converter that performs dc link current regulation. It
   also regulates the HVDC link voltage through supervisory inverter
   controls. A complete wind farm is simulated using the PSCAD/EMTDC
   software package. The 150-MW wind farm is modelled using six units of 25
   MW with a rated dc link voltage of 125 kV at 1.2 kA. The simulation
   demonstrates the stable operation of the proposed configuration where
   each turbine is able to independently perform peak power tracking.}},

Abstract = {{Individual bubbles ca. 2.3 mm in diameter were produced at a capillary

   bubble aspect ratio and rise velocity were measured at 1 ms time
   intervals over a distance ca. 1.15-1.20 m above the capillary. All
   conditions showed oscillations in bubble aspect ratio and velocity that
   were related. Increasing concentration, on average, created more
   spherical bubbles that rose at lower velocities. The same observations
   were made in the presence of MIBC frother. Results suggest a unique

Abstract = {{Energy of activation (E-a) and specific heat capacity (C-p) for mixtures

   the range reported for Ni- and Cu-concentrates. The E-a is close to that
   for partial oxidation of H2S which adds to the contention that the
   partial oxidation of H2S contributes to SH of sulphides at low
   temperature. The C-p values ranged from 0.152 to 1.071 JK(-1) g(-1) as
   temperature rose from 50 degrees C to 80 degrees C, similar to the

   correlate with difference in alumina and bubble zeta potential
   supporting an electrostatic model of interaction with non-hydrophobic
   particles. Pick up also correlated with contact angle (Washburn method)
   indicating the electrostatic force is sufficient to establish a
   solid-air interface. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy uses visible light to acquire vibrational
   fingerprints of molecules, thus making it a powerful tool for chemical
   analysis in a wide range of media. However, its potential for optical
   imaging at high resolution is severely limited by the fact that the
   Raman effect is weak. Here, we report the discovery of a giant Raman
   scattering effect from encapsulated and aggregated dye molecules inside
   single-walled carbon nanotubes. Measurements performed on rod-like dyes
   such as alpha-sexithiophene and beta-carotene, assembled inside
   single-walled carbon nanotubes as highly polarizable J-aggregates,
   indicate a resonant Raman cross-section of (3+/-2) x 10(-21) cm(2)
   sr(-1), which is well above the cross-section required for detecting
   individual aggregates at the highest optical resolution. Free from
   fluorescence background and photobleaching, this giant Raman effect
   allows the realization of a library of functionalized nanoprobe labels
   for Raman imaging with robust detection using multispectral analysis.}},

Title = {{Analyzing commuter train user behavior: a decision framework for access

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of the current research effort is to develop a framework for
   a better understanding of commuter train users' access mode and station
   choice behavior. Typically, access mode and station choice for commuter
   train users is modeled as a hierarchical choice with access mode being
   considered as the first choice in the sequence. The current study
   proposes a latent segmentation based approach to relax the hierarchy. In
   particular, this innovative approach simultaneously considers two
   segments of station and access mode choice behavior: Segment 1-station
   first and access mode second and Segment 2-access mode first and station
   second. The allocation to the two segments is achieved through a latent
   segmentation approach that determines the probability of assigning the
   individual to either of these segments as a function of
   socio-demographic variables, level of service (LOS) parameters, trip
   characteristics, land-use and built environment factors, and station
   characteristics. The proposed latent segment model is estimated using
   data from an on-board survey conducted by the Agence M,tropolitaine de
   Transport for commuter train users in Montreal region. The model is
   employed to investigate the role of socio-demographic variables, LOS
   parameters, trip characteristics, land-use and built environment
   factors, and station characteristics on commuter train user behavior.
   The results indicate that as the distance from the station by active
   forms of transportation increases, individuals are more likely to select
   a station first. Young persons, females, car owners, and individuals
   leaving before 7:30 a.m. have an increased propensity to drive to the
   commuter train station. The station model indicates that travel time has
   a significant negative impact on station choice, whereas, presence of
   parking and increased train frequency encourages use of the stations.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions with local extracellular cues direct cell migration. A
   versatile method to study cell response to a protein consists of
   patterning the protein cue on a substrate and quantifying the
   distribution of cells between patterned and non-patterned areas. Here,
   we define the concepts of (i) cell-surface affinity to describe cell
   choices, and of (ii) reference surface (RS) to clarify that the choice
   is made relative to a reference. Furthermore, we report a method to
   systematically tune the RS and show that it can dominate the
   experimental cell response to a protein cue. The cell response to a cue
   can be switched from strong preference to strong aversion by only
   changing the RS. Using microcontact printing, we patterned the
   extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin or netrin-1 adjacent to a
   series of RSs with different ratios of poly-D-lysine (PDL) and
   polyethylene glycol (PEG), which are of high affinity and of
   low-affinity for cells, respectively. C2C12 myoblasts or primary neurons
   seeded on substrates with a high affinity RS (high \% PDL) did not
   respond to a printed protein of interest, and conversely on RSs of low
   affinity (high \% PEG) the cells preferred the printed protein even in
   the absence of a specific interaction. However, when testing cell
   response to a standardized series of RSs varying from high to low
   affinity, a specific response curve was obtained that was unique to each
   cell type-protein pair. Importantly, for intermediate RSs with moderate
   affinity, the cell response to the cue was dependent on the activation
   of biologically relevant protein-specific biochemical signal
   transduction pathways. Our results establish that choices made by cells
   in response to a surface-bound cue must take into account, and be
   interpreted in the context of, the RS. The use of a series of RSs with
   varying cell-surface affinity reveals specific response curves of cells
   to a cue that can be compared quantitatively and that may help gain new
   insights into cellular responses to extracellular proteins. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine whether hyperbaric treatment has an

   was treated with different pressure and temperature conditions
   (100-850kPa at 20 degrees C and 100kPa at 4 degrees C). A preliminary
   experiment was performed with different treatment periods, that is, 3, 5
   and 7days. Hyperbaric treatment of lettuces at 20 degrees C caused
   noticeable changes in sensory quality, but the product was still
   marketable after 3days. On the other hand, the cold-stored lettuce
   showed little degradation even after 7days of treatment, at which time
   all the lettuce treated at 20 degrees C was unmarketable. At 5days of
   treatment, the respiration rate of hyperbaric-treated lettuces at 625
   and 850kPa remained fairly stable, while that of the
   lower-pressure-treated lettuce began to increase, indicating the
   initiation of decay. The 850-kPa hyperbaric treatment showed better

Abstract = {{This article investigates parasitic radiating structures for coupling
   reduction between two 900MHz planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) in a
   hand-held device. Measurement of the initial prototype shows that a
   maximum isolation enhancement of more than 8 dB is achieved with a
   single parasitic element. This is followed by optimization of the
   parasitic structure for compactness, improved bandwidth, and tuning
   capability. First, different techniques for miniaturization are employed
   to obtain 60\% less footprint with a 22 mm x 15 mm meandered parasitic
   element. Second, it is demonstrated that the isolation bandwidth can be
   increased by employing several parasitic radiators with different
   lengths. Finally, it is presented that the operation of a handheld
   device, as well as the coupling reduction technique, is compromised in
   proximity to the human body. For the first time, a miniaturized
   electronically tunable parasitic radiating element is designed to
   compensate for the detuning of the coupling reduction technique and
   adjusting its resonance to achieve maximum isolation between two handset
   PIFAs. Measurements of the fabricated prototype show 810-960 MHz tuning
   range. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J RF and Microwave CAE

   deformations. Although some models have been proposed to describe their
   structural behavior, several uncertainties remain. This paper examines
   the effects of errors introduced by model simplifications on predicted
   values. The results are used to improve the estimation of parameter
   values using model-based data-interpretation strategies. The procedure
   is illustrated for the Grand-Mere Bridge located in Canada. This bridge
   is affected by excessive long-term vertical displacements. Model
   simplifications such as in its degree of complexity are found to have an
   important influence on prediction errors. Representing these errors by
   zero-mean independent Gaussian noise does not adequately describe the
   relationships among the errors observed in this case study. Estimated
   errors are used in the interpretation of the ambient vibration
   acceleration data recorded on the structure. The interpretation approach
   employed is based on error-domain model falsification. This study
   provides ranges of parameter values that can be used subsequently to
   characterize more accurately aspects such as long-term creep and
   shrinkage behavior. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to a variety
   of automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, both in discriminative
   feature extraction and hybrid acoustic modeling scenarios. The
   development of improved loss functions and regularization approaches
   have resulted in consistent reductions in ASR word error rates (WERs).
   This paper presents a manifold learning based regularization framework
   for DNN training. The associated techniques attempt to preserve the
   underlying low dimensional manifold based relationships amongst speech
   feature vectors as part of the optimization procedure for estimating
   network parameters. This is achieved by imposing manifold based locality
   preserving constraints on the outputs of the network. The techniques are
   presented in the context of a bottleneck DNN architecture for feature
   extraction in a tandem configuration. The ASR WER obtained using these
   networks is evaluated on a speech-in-noise task and compared to that
   obtained using DNN-bottleneck networks trained without manifold
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a remote sensing system that consists of a
   sensor and an estimator. A sensor observes a first order Markov source
   and must communicate it to a remote estimator. Communication is
   noiseless but expensive. At each time, based on the history of its
   observations and decisions, the sensor chooses whether to transmit or
   not. If the sensor does not transmit, then the estimator must estimate
   the Markov process using its past observations. We study the average
   cost problem in the light of vanishing discount approach. The problem
   was studied previously by Lipsa and Martins, IEEE TAC, 2011 and by
   Nayyar et al, IEEE TAC, 2013, where it was shown that the optimal
   estimation policy is Kalman-like and the optimal communication policy is
   to communicate when the estimation error is greater than a threshold. In
   the discounted set-up, we had earlier characterized the optimal policy
   and the optimal thresholds as a function of communication cost. The
   average cost problem is investigated as the limiting case of the
   discounted cost problem as the discount factor approaches one. The
   average cost and the optimal values of the thresholds are provided in
   terms of the communication cost. Lastly, we present an example of
   birth-death Markov chain to illustrate our results.}},

   interview questions, and the ACRL Information Literacy Standards for
   Science and Engineering/Technology were used to examine the findings.
   Only survey findings are reported in the current paper. Although there
   are some areas where both groups reported challenges such as finding
   enough relevant information and incorporating ideas from their readings
   into their paper, other areas such as evaluating sources and knowing

Abstract = {{The measurement of respiration rate and tidal volume variability are
   critical to the diagnosis and monitoring of a wide range of breath
   disorders as well as being useful broader This paper presents a portable
   real-time platform designed to support a computationally efficient human
   respiratory tracking system for medical applications. The proposed
   system is designed particularly for patients with breathing problems (e.
   g. respiratory complications after surgery) or sleep disorders. We
   introduce the use of accelerometer sensor to detect changes in the
   anterior-posterior diameter of the chest; whereas these changes provide
   an accurate measurement of respiration rate as well as tidal volume
   variability. The complete system was comprised of wearable calibrated
   accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database. The
   experiments are conducted with 8 subjects and the overall error in
   respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.2\% considering SPR-BTA
   spirometer as the reference. We also present a method for Tidal Volume
   variability (TVvar) estimation while validated using Pearson
   correlation. The mean value of the correlation coefficient between TVvar
   derived from the accelerometer and spirometer for all subjects and three
   breath patterns is 0.87 which shows a high correspondence of two
   signals. Furthermore, the results indicate that the accelerometer driven
   TVvar achieves the average MSE 1.6E-03 +/- 3.69E-03 compared to the
   reference.}},

Abstract = {{Even in the absence of a physical network infrastructure, it is
   important that mobile devices can take advantage of the opportunities
   presented to them to maintain communication. Opportunistic networks are
   a class of mobile networks that must rely on unscheduled sporadic
   meetings between nodes to achieve communication. The main challenge in
   these networks is to route messages towards a destination with high
   delivery probability, low average latency and efficient usage of network
   resources. Despite the numerous proposals for opportunistic routing
   protocols, there are relatively few analytical characterizations of
   their behaviour. In this paper, we propose both centralized and
   decentralized message forwarding algorithms that, under relatively
   strong assumptions about the network's behaviour, minimize the expected
   latency to a destination. After presenting proofs of the optimality of
   our proposed algorithms, we confirm their improvement in system
   performance through numerical simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel stochastic macromodeling technique for the
   variability analysis of complex electromagnetic (EM) structures is
   proposed. This work combines a pseudo spectral approach with the Loewner
   matrix interpolation technique to generate the polynomial chaos
   macromodel from the stochastic S-parameters of the structure. The major
   benefit of the proposed strategy is that by exploiting the non-intrusive
   nature of the pseudo spectral approach, the stochastic macromodel can be
   generated directly from a small number of deterministic EM full-wave
   simulations. This enables the utilization of the robustness and
   versatility of conventional deterministic full-wave techniques without
   the need for the cumbersome stochastic Galerkin formulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a jointly cooperative relay and jamming protocol
   based on full-duplex (FD) capable relay to increase the
   source-destination secrecy rate in the presence of different types of
   eavesdroppers. In this so called FD-Relay with jamming (FDJ) protocol,
   the FD-Relay, first, simultaneously receives data and sends jamming to
   the eavesdropper, and, then, forwards the data, while the source jams
   the eavesdropper. Achievable secrecy rates of the proposed FDJ in the
   presence of different eavesdropper types and self-interference (SI) are
   derived and compared with those of the traditional half-duplex (HD)
   relay. The adaptive power allocation for secrecy rate maximization in a
   multi-carrier scenario for both proposed FDJ and HD-Relay is formulated
   as a non-convex optimization problem and corresponding iterative
   solution algorithm is developed using the
   difference-of-two-concave-functions (DC) programming technique. The
   simulation results confirm that FDJ offers significant improvements in
   the secrecy rate over the HDRelay.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a robust transceiver scheme with switched
   preprocessing (SP) for K-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   interference channels. The channel state information (CSI) available is
   assumed to be imperfect under norm-bounded errors (NBE). Each
   transmitter is provided with a codebook of permutation matrices, so that
   each arrangement of permutation matrices among the K transmitters will
   generate a group of K parallel transceivers. The optimum transceiver
   group within the class of all possible such groups is chosen by a
   suitable selection mechanism for data transmission. To design each
   transceiver group, we adopt a worst-case design approach to minimize the
   maximum per user MSE. We show that the proposed transceiver design
   problem can be partitioned into an alternating sequence of optimization
   and worst-case analysis subproblems, which involves solving Second-Order
   Cone Programming (SOCP) problems. Simulation results show that the
   performance of the proposed SP-based transceiver is significantly better
   than existing methods in the presence of imperfect CSI.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, cooperative localization of mobile nodes in non-line of
   sight (NLOS) situation is considered using a constrained square root
   unscented Kalman filter (CSRUKF). The NLOS measurements are used as
   quadratic constraints, which form a convex feasible region inside which
   the positions of the mobile nodes are supposed to be. The CSRUKF
   consists of two main stages: square root unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF)
   and sigma point projection. In the former, a conventional SRUKF is used
   to estimate the state vector and the Cholesky factor of the error
   covariance matrix. In the latter, a new set of sigma points are
   generated, and the ones violating the constraints are projected onto the
   feasible region by solving a set of convex quadratically constrained
   quadratic programs (QCQP). Each QCQP can be solved independently and in
   parallel for each sigma point violating the constraint, thus the
   algorithm is suitable for distributed processing. The simulation results
   show that our algorithm can perform well in different NLOS scenarios.}},

   need to efficiently share the spectrum, and hence, avoid low-performance
   experience of users due to high collision rates and long backoff

   in which APs can self-configure their channel choices to mitigate
   interference and thereby maximize network throughput. Aiming to minimize
   interference sum utility, a channel assignment problem is formulated as
   a non-convex optimization problem and solved using
   difference-of-convex-functions (DC) programming. Subsequently, two
   distributed algorithms are developed in which each AP independently
   adapts its channel selection to the optimal values over time by
   measuring the received interference in different channels. The
   convergence, complexity, and efficiency of the developed algorithms are

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a remote sensing system that consists of a
   sensor and an estimator. A sensor observes a first order Markov source
   and must communicate it to a remote estimator. Communication is
   noiseless but expensive. At each time, based on the history of its
   observations and decisions, the sensor chooses whether to transmit or
   not. If the sensor does not transmit, then the estimator must estimate
   the Markov process using its past observations. It was shown by Lipsa
   and Martins, 2011 and by Nayyar et al, 2013 that the optimal strategy
   has the following structure. The optimal estimation strategy is
   Kalman-like and the optimal communication strategy is to communicate
   when the estimation error is greater than a threshold. We derive closed
   form expressions for infinite horizon discounted cost version of the
   problem. Our solution approach is inspired by the idea of calibration
   used in multi-armed bandits. We identify the value of the communication
   cost for which one is indifferent between two consecutive threshold
   based strategies. Using these values, we characterize the optimal
   thresholds as a function of the communication cost. Lastly, we present
   an example of birth-death Markov chain to illustrate our results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a class of asynchronous distributed algorithms for
   convex optimization where nodes communicate using push-only
   (feedback-free) broadcast messages, and where nodes do not necessarily
   perform updates at the same rate. This is especially relevant for
   implementation in a compute cluster where resources are shared among
   multiple users and may be simultaneously executing multiple tasks. We
   consider a distributed variant of Nesterov's dual averaging algorithm
   {[}1], making use of distributed averaging to enable a distributed
   implementation, and we provide conditions under which the algorithm is
   guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution. This requires careful
   scaling of the step size parameters to account for different update
   rates at different nodes without biasing the solution. The proposed
   parameter settings assume that nodes have access to readings of a global
   clock, but otherwise they do not need any global information, including
   knowledge of their own update rate nor the overall rate at which updates
   occur across the network. Numerical examples illustrate the performance
   of the proposed approach and the pitfalls of alternative step-size

Abstract = {{We investigate team optimal control of stochastic subsystems that are
   weakly coupled in dynamics (through the mean-field of the system) and
   are arbitrary coupled in the cost. The controller of each subsystem
   observes its local state and the mean-field of the state of all
   subsystems. The system has a non-classical information structure.
   Exploiting the symmetry of the problem, we identify an information state
   and use that to obtain a dynamic programming decomposition. This dynamic
   program determines a globally optimal strategy for all controllers. Our
   solution approach works for arbitrary number of controllers and
   generalizes to the setup when the mean-field is observed with noise. The
   size of the information state is time-invariant; thus, the results
   generalize to the infinite-horizon control setups as well. In addition,
   when the mean-field is observed without noise, the size of the
   corresponding information state increases polynomially (rather than
   exponentially) with the number of controllers which allows us to solve
   problems with moderate number of controllers. We illustrate our approach
   by an example motivated by smart grids that consists of 100 coupled
   subsystems.}},

Abstract = {{Mean field game (MFG) theory where there is a major player and many
   minor players (MM-MFG) has been recently introduced in both the linear
   quadratic Gaussian (LQG) case and in the case of nonlinear state
   dynamics and nonlinear cost functions. In this framework, a major player
   has a significant influence, i. e., asymptotically non-vanishing, on any
   minor agent. In contrast to the situation without major agents, the mean
   field term now becomes stochastic due to the stochastic evolution of the
   state of the major player and, as a result, the best response control
   actions of the minor agents depend on the state of the major agent as
   well as the stochastic mean field. In a decentralized environment, one
   is led to consider the situation where the agents are provided only with
   partial information on the major agent's state and the mean field term.
   In this work, we consider such a scenario for systems with nonlinear
   dynamics and cost functions and develop MFG theory for a partially
   observed MM-MFG setup. More explicitly, we consider a MFG problem with
   (i) partial observations on the major player state provided to the minor
   agents individually and (ii) complete observations on that state
   provided to the major player. The first step of such a theory requires
   one to develop an estimation theory for partially observed stochastic
   dynamical systems whose state equations are of McKean-Vlasov (MV) type
   stochastic differential equations. The next approach to the problem for
   MM-MFG systems in this work is to follow the procedure of constructing
   the associated completely observed system via the application of
   nonlinear filtering theory. The existence and uniqueness of Nash
   equilibria is then analyzed in this setting.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a transceiver strategy with switched

   equipped with a codebook of permutation matrices. For the given MIMO
   interference channel, all the combinations of permutation matrices among
   the transmitters can create a number of parallel transceivers. Based on
   the given channel state information (CSI) and a block of transmit
   symbols, the optimum transceiver branch is chosen by a suitable
   selection criterion for transmission. For each branch, we introduce a
   robust transceiver design algorithm based on minimizing the mean square
   error (MSE) criterion. The selection criterion is designed to minimize
   the Euclidean distance between the true transmit symbol vector and the
   pre-estimated noiseless received vector. Simulation results show that
   the performance of the proposed technique is significantly better than

Abstract = {{This paper considers the wire-tap channel in which a source node
   communicates to a destination node with the help of a single
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay and in the presence of an eavesdropper.
   The secrecy capacity and respective optimal power allocation scheme at
   the source and relay are investigated under both individual and joint
   power constraints. Given that the links among the nodes might not always
   be available for transmission (e.g., due to heavy shadowing), several
   network topologies are considered. These include combinations of
   dual-hop, orthogonal AF and direct transmission schemes. To deal with
   the non-concave optimization problems in solving the optimal power
   allocation schemes, we first propose an analytical approach based on
   Descartes' rule of signs. It is then shown that the power allocation
   strategies that maximize the secrecy rates can be obtained in closed
   form. Simulation results are finally provided to verify the optimality

   device-to-device (D2D) and cellular links in a multi-carrier cellular
   network to maximize the weighted network sum-rate while guaranteeing the
   minimum individual cellular link data rates and proportional fairness
   among D2D links. In particular, we formulate an NP-hard non-orthogonal
   resource allocation problem, and develop an iterative algorithm that
   alternates between the sub-carrier assignment and power allocation in
   each iteration until convergence. It is shown that the sub-carrier
   assignment problem corresponds to an integer linear program while the
   power allocation is reformulated into a
   difference-between-two-concave-functions (DC) problem. We establish the
   important properties of the developed algorithms and prove their

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of carrier frequency synchronization
   and time-varying channel equalization in the uplink of a broadband
   multi-user wireless communication system employing an oversampled
   perfect reconstruction filter bank (OPRFB) transceiver structure for
   multi-carrier modulation. Based on the maximum likelihood (ML)
   principle, a pilotaided joint estimator of the carrier frequency offsets
   (CFO) and channel equalizer coefficients of the multiple users is
   proposed. The performance of the new estimator is examined for various
   subband allocation schemes by means of numerical simulations under
   realistic conditions of operation. For mobile users with time-varying
   fading channels, we also study the effect of using different
   distributions of pilots over time. Our results show that the proposed
   estimator can provide accurate estimates of the unknown CFO and channel
   parameters, which in turn can be used to design effective compensation
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the problem of joint multiuser downlink beamforming
   and admission control in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   heterogeneous networks. Considered is a network where a newly deployed
   femtocell base-station (FBS) has the coverage overlapped with that of an
   existing macrocell base-station (MBS). Our design objective is to serve
   as many femto-users (FUEs) as possible at their quality-of-service (QoS)
   requirements while maintaining the QoS requirements at the macro-users
   (MUEs). In the first part of this work, we consider the joint downlink
   beamforming and admission control problem as a joint optimization
   problem, which can be solved in a centralized manner with full
   coordination between the MBS and the FBS. In the second part, we propose
   a distributed algorithm in performing joint downlink beamforming and
   admission control at the femtocell with only limited MBS-FBS
   coordination. Specifically, after acquiring certain design parameters
   from the MBS, the FBS unilaterally determines its beamforming and
   admission control strategy while coordinating its induced interference
   to the macrocell. We then prove that the distributed algorithm will
   converge to a fixed-point where the QoS at the MUEs and admitted FUEs is
   guaranteed. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithm
   performs as well as the centralized one in terms of number of FUEs
   served with only a small penalty on the power usage at the MBS and the
   FBS.}},

Abstract = {{Neighbor area network (NAN) is one of the most important segments of
   smart grid communications network (SGCN) since it is responsible for the
   information exchanges between the utility and a large number of smart

   protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) have been considered as
   the most promising layer-3 protocols for wireless mesh NANs. This paper
   compares the system performance and investigates the applicability of
   these two protocols in practical NAN scenarios. Specifically,
   transmission reliability, latency and routing path details of GPSR and
   RPL are studied by extensive simulations. The advantages and
   disadvantages of each protocol with respect to the characteristics and

Abstract = {{Advanced Distribution Automation (ADA) is one of the key applications of
   the Smart Grid (SG). Since Narrow-band Power Line Communications
   (NB-PLC) can offer a cost-effective communication infrastructure
   supporting data acquisition and automation, it has appeared to be one of
   the most promising technologies to enable ADA. However, the
   applicability of NB-PLC needs to be investigated carefully since this
   technology, still exhibits some limitations related to throughput,
   signal attenuation/distortion and reliability in ADA scenarios. This
   paper attempts to give a reasonable data rate estimation by considering
   realistic ADA infrastructures/applications and IEC 61850 as the primary
   data modeling and communications standard for ADA. Effects of channel
   contention at Medium Access Control (MAC) layer on the achievable
   throughput of existing NB-PLC technologies are investigated. The data
   rate estimation and throughput analysis are then used to evaluate the
   feasibility of NB-PLC in supporting ADA applications.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the signal-to-residual-interference ratio (SIRout) in a

   consideration of three major sources of imperfection: (i)
   self-interference channel estimation error, (ii) quantization error in
   the receiver analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and (iii) quantization
   error in the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) used to generate the
   self-interference replica. In particular, we first derive the Cramer-Rao
   lower bound on the variance of the self-interference channel estimation
   error, and use it to further develop a closed-form expression of the
   SIRout. The resulting SIRout expression facilitates a study of the limit
   of a full-duplex system and determines the minimum required resolution
   for the ADC and DAC in order to meet a given performance. The expression
   reveals that, with a sufficiently high number of bits, the effects of
   ADC and DAC are negligible, but the cancellation performance is limited
   by the thermal noise and, in the best case, we can obtain a SIRout equal

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the error performance of a full-duplex (FD)
   amplify-and-forward (AF) single-relay system under the effect of
   residual self-interference whose variance is proportional to the
   lambda-th power of the transmitted power (0 <= lambda <= 1). Our focus
   is on the cooperative FD linear relaying (LR) protocol that makes use of
   direct source-destination link. At first, a closed-form expression of
   the pairwise error probability (PEP) is derived for the considered
   system. This expression allows us to analyze the diversity behavior in
   high transmission power regions. Thanks to the use of the direct link,
   it is shown that the FD LR system can attain the same diversity function
   as its half-duplex (HD) counterpart as long as a suitable precoder is
   applied. Different from previous works that either ignore the direct
   link or treat it as a source of interference, a non-zero diversity order
   is thus achieved and the error floor behavior can be eliminated despite
   the existence of self-interference in FD. More interestingly, it is then
   demonstrated that transmitting a superposition of all symbols in HD mode
   maximizes the asymptotic coding gain. Although HD relaying is hence
   asymptotically optimal, simulations results reveal that FD is
   advantageous at practical bit error rate (BER) levels when lambda is
   sufficiently small.}},

Abstract = {{Head pose estimation has been receiving a lot of attention due to its
   wide range of possible applications. However, most approaches in the
   literature have focused on head pose estimation in controlled
   environments. Head pose estimation has recently begun to be applied to
   real-world environments. However, the focus has been on estimation from
   single images or video frames. Furthermore, most approaches frame the
   problem as classification into a set of coarse pose bins, rather than
   performing continuous pose estimation. The proposed multi-layer
   probabilistic temporal graphical model robustly estimates continuous
   head pose angle while leveraging the strengths of multiple features into
   account. Experiments performed on a large, real-world video database
   show that our approach not only significantly outperforms alternative
   head pose approaches, but also provides a pose probability assigned at
   each video frame, which permits robust temporal, probabilistic fusion of
   pose information over the entire video sequence.}},

Abstract = {{The quest for ever faster pick-and-place robots has led to ingenious
   parallel robots with reduced mobility, e.g., capable of producing
   motions proper of SCARA systems: three independent translations and one
   rotation about an axis of fixed direction. These robots are also known
   as Schonflies-motion generators (SMG). Some parallel versions are
   commercially available, as are serial-parallel designs. The former are
   provided with four limbs, the latter with three, the fourth degree of
   freedom being appended in series with a Delta robot. Parallel robots are
   more attractive than their hybrid counterparts, but the presence of four
   legs poses serious challenges to their designers, as limb-interference
   limits the rotatability of the moving plate. A solution to this problem
   includes a gear train for rotation-range amplification, but this
   increases the inertial load on the motors and complicates the design-too
   many parts-and the control-because of inherent gear backlash and Coulomb
   friction. Recently, a SMG system was proposed that is supplied with two
   limbs, arrayed in an isostatic structure, which provides high
   rotatability of its gripper. This robot is driven by one C
   (cylindrical)-joint at each limb. As this joint allows for two degrees
   of freedom, it calls for two motors, that might as well be fixed to the
   base, which poses interesting design challenges. Reported in this paper
   is a design solution for the drive of a C joint, which is termed the C
   (cylindrical)-drive, based on a cylindrical differential mechanism of
   the RHHR type, with R standing for revolute, H for helical (or screw)
   joint. The design, kinematics and dynamics of the drive are discussed,
   along with a realization, and preliminary tests.}},

Abstract = {{A number of applications of wheeled robots, including planetary
   exploration rovers and rescue missions, require that the vehicle
   operates in a non-structured environment. Optimizing the vehicle
   mobility is of key importance in such applications. Reduced mobility can
   limit the ability of the robot to achieve the mission goals, or even
   render it immobile in extreme cases. In this paper, the effect of normal
   contact forces on mobility is reported. A performance indicator based on
   the force distribution is defined and used to compare different vehicle
   configurations. The validity of this indicator was assessed using both
   simulation and experimental results obtained for a six-wheel rover
   prototype. Results suggest that modifying the robot configuration to
   alter the normal force distribution can lead to increased traction force
   available at the wheel-terrain interfaces, thus improving the mobility.}},

Abstract = {{With the fast development of the electric vehicle (EV) technology and
   the pressing environment conditions. It is expected that EVs will grow
   rapidly in the near feature. However, the broad adoption of EVs will
   produce a high power demand on the power grid. Smart charging control of
   the EVs could help to relieve the possible negative influences on the
   power grid. Many researchers have investigated possible algorithms for
   EV charging control. Considering customers' willingness, this paper
   proposes a mixed charging control framework. The proposed control
   framework is aimed to minimize the charging cost and satisfy the
   customers' charging freedom requirements. A user satisfaction
   determining method is also proposed which can help to evaluate user
   satisfactions for different control algorithms. Within the proposed
   framework, both the benefits for the utility companies and the customers
   are considered. The optimization framework is evaluated with the data
   from a local utility company. Simulation results show the efficiency of
   the proposed framework. The framework can also be further used to
   evaluate the penetration for a certain neighborhood level network.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a single channel speech enhancement
   algorithm based on regularized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).
   In our proposed formulation, the log-likelihood function (LLF) of the
   magnitude spectral components, based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM)
   for both the speech and background noise signals, is included as a
   regularization term in the NMF cost function. By using this spectral
   type of regularization, we can incorporate the statistical properties of
   the signals during the estimation of both the basis and excitation
   martices in NMF model. Furthermore, borrowing from the
   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and to reduce the computational
   complexity of the NMF update, the LLF is replaced by its expected value.
   Experimental results of perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ),
   source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and source-to-interference ratio (SIR)

Abstract = {{PET quantitation in the thorax and upper abdomen is confounded by
   artifacts introduced by breathing motion. This has led to the emergence
   of a variety of techniques for motion compensated image reconstruction,
   many of which rely on motion information computed from a series of
   respiratory-gated anatomical images synchronized with the PET gates. A
   simpler alternative to this approach is to derive deformation fields
   directly from non-attenuation-corrected gated 4DPET images. The goal of
   this paper is to assess the accuracy of motion compensated image
   reconstruction based on PET-derived motion information using the ground
   truth and anatomically derived motion information as references. We used
   the Monte Carlo simulation software GATE to generate realistic PET
   images of the XCAT phantom with pulmonary lesions. Deformation fields
   were derived from 4DPET images in two passes. In the first pass, the
   fields were estimated from 4D non-attenuation-corrected PET images. In
   the second pass, 4D attenuation maps were generated using the first-pass
   motion estimates and then used to reconstruct 4D attenuation-corrected
   PET images. A second set of deformation fields were then computed from
   the 4D attenuation-corrected PET images. The PET-derived deformation
   fields were compared with the true XCAT deformations. For more realistic
   validation, gated pseudo-MR images were generated from the XCAT phantom.
   We then compared MR-derived deformation fields with the true
   deformations. Finally, motion compensated PET images were reconstructed
   using the different motion estimates, and error estimates were computed
   for individual organs and lesions.}},

Abstract = {{We outline a possible method for exploiting population-based data for
   regularization in iterative PET reconstruction. Multi-modal and
   high-resolution mean shape templates are derived from a set of
   co-registered PET-MR images. The functional component of the template,
   representing the average radiotracer distribution among the images in
   the set, is used in a Bayesian reconstruction scheme for regularization
   of a given image. Unlike conventional anatomical-based priors, our
   proposed method makes no assumptions about relations between anatomy and
   function. Instead of regularizing based on differences between anatomy
   and function, we regularize based on differences between a mean
   functional image and a given functional image. Our proposed method
   outperforms both conventional MLEM and quadratic priors.}},

Abstract = {{Power flow is the backbone of steady-state analysis of power systems.
   Various steady-state applications such as contingency analysis, transfer
   limit calculations, and initialization of transient stability
   simulation, etc., hinge on the solution of power flow analysis. Hence,
   any performance improvement in power flow will improve various
   steady-state applications. In this paper we present a fast power flow
   analysis using a hybrid current-power balance formulation with the
   variables expressed in rectangular form. The computational efficiency
   and robustness of the proposed algorithm is presented for several test
   systems ranging from 100 to 3000 buses.}},

Abstract = {{The great development in the area of evolutionary algorithms in recent
   decades has increased the range of applications of these tools and
   improved its performance in different fronts. In particular, the
   Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm has proven to be a simple and
   efficient optimizer in several contexts. Despite of its success, its
   performance is closely related to the choice of variation operators and
   the parameters which control these operators. To increase the robustness
   of the method and the ease of use for the average user, the pursuit for
   methods of self-configuration has been increasing as well. There are

   multi-user spread-spectrum communication systems. Our proposed system
   combines coding and cooperation between a relay and users to boost the
   throughput and to exploit interference. To this end, each pair of users,
   A and B, that communicate with each other via a relay R. shares the same
   spreading code. The relay has two roles, it synchronizes network
   transmissions and it broadcasts the combined signals received from
   users. From user B's point of view, the signal is decoded, and then, the
   data transmitted by user A is recovered by subtracting user B's own
   data. We derive the analytical performance of this system for an
   additive white Gaussian noise channel with the presence of multi-user

   multiple single-antenna user-equipments (UE) experiencing

   background noise power. Assuming perfect knowledge of channel state
   information and noise power at the base-station (eNB), we propose a new
   regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder, which takes advantage of the
   non-homogeneous user conditions. Given in a closed-form solution, the
   proposed RZF precoder outperforms other well-known linear precoders,
   while achieving a close performance to the locally optimal iterative
   weighted minimization of mean squared error precoder, in terms of the
   achievable network sum-rate. We then propose a greedy user selection
   algorithm in conjunction with the proposed RZF precoder when the number
   of UEs exceeds the number transmit antennas at the eNB.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the uplink subchannel and power allocation
   problem for device-to-device (D2D) and cellular links in the Orthogonal

   This resource allocation problem aims to maximize the weighted sum
   throughput of D2D links while guaranteeing the minimum rate of each
   cellular link. The proposed formulation allows non-orthogonal spectrum
   sharing between the cellular and the D2D links to enhance the total D2D
   throughput. We develop an iterative algorithm that decouples the
   bandwidth and power allocation in two different steps and improves the
   objective function over iterations. For the power allocation
   sub-problem, we exploit the DC (difference between concave functions)
   structure of the objective function in the underlying problem and
   transform it into the convex optimization problem. We establish the
   convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results confirm that

Abstract = {{This paper studies quality-of-service (QoS)-aware frequency provisioning
   schemes for a downlink multi-user multi carrier system in a
   frequency-selective fading environment with diverse user-QoS
   requirements in terms of target delay and effective capacity (EC). Since
   a jointly optimal power and sub carrier allocation requires an
   exponential-time exhaustive search, we explore an alternative simpler
   approach with two steps: (i) frequency provisioning to allocate the
   available subcarriers to the demanding users, followed by (ii) power
   allocation for the set of subcarriers assigned to each user. The
   single-user EC-based power allocation can be directly applied to step
   (ii). Furthermore, its results can also be used to develop a
   low-complexity knowledge-based frequency provisioning algorithm for step
   (i). The proposed iterative frequency provisioning algorithm starts with
   an initial rate-based guess and analyzes the incremental cost of power
   with respect to each user's QoS requirement to modify the allocated
   numbers of subcarriers that can further reduce the power consumption, if
   possible, in each subsequent iteration. Illustrative results show that
   the initial rate-based guess can be very effective in many situations,
   whereas, when the demanding users have similar required ECs but
   widespread delay requirements, the initial rate-based guess can be far
   from the optimum solution and therefore, more iterations are needed.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the effective capacities of dual hop networks with
   relay selection. The source uses buffer to store the arrival packets.
   For non-buffer relays, they forward the packets received from the source
   to the destination in the next time slot in the same transmission frame.
   For buffer-aided relays, they can store the received packets and forward
   them in future transmission frame(s). Two different buffer- aided relays
   can be selected for packet reception and packet forwarding in a frame to
   exploit the relay selection diversity in both relay and access links. As
   a result, higher throughput can be achieved as compared to the case of
   non-buffer relays at the expense of increased buffering delay. To
   provision delay QoS guarantees, the source and buffer- aided relays
   operate under statistical delay guarantees in terms of maximum delay
   violation probabilities. The effective capacities (i.e., maximum
   constant arrival rates to the source) are characterized as function of
   the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the source and relays, delay

   mitigation capacity under different bandwidths of direct voltage control
   stipulated by the network operator and implemented by a distributed wind
   farm, different MV/HV substation transformer ratings, series
   compensation of the distribution line and finally, the change of the
   wind farm connection point. The purpose of this paper is to provide
   results that help in the understanding of the feasibility and
   effectiveness of flicker mitigation solutions in the planning phase of a
   wind farm. A detailed typical North-American 25 kV distribution network
   is employed as the test network and a 10 MW DFIG-based wind farm is
   employed as the source of wind power. The flicker measurement is carried
   out for a 10-minute time frame according to the guidelines of IEC
   standard 61000-4-15. All studies are conducted on a multi-processor
   real-time simulator for its superior computational capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Vision systems, consisting of conventional color cameras and depth
   cameras have proved capable of solving the problem of indoor scene
   reconstruction with sufficient detail and satisfactory accuracy.
   However, there are few guidelines for how many cameras of each type are
   really needed to obtain a reconstruction with sufficient accuracy. At
   the same time, there has been little formal, quantitative, evaluation of
   the 3D reconstruction result; instead, comparisons are typically made
   subjectively. In the present work, we attempt to provide a feasible way
   to discuss the relationship between the number of cameras used and the
   final reconstruction accuracy. We present a general pipeline, from
   pre-calibration of the system to the final 3D point cloud output to
   demonstrate a full 3D reconstruction process for large static scenes,
   using a number of different system con figurations. We evaluate and
   compare the reconstruction accuracy of these systems for a common target
   object in the scene. Our hope is that these results can offer some
   guidelines for camera selection based on the actual requirements for
   reconstruction accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Calibration for Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras are different from
   traditional color cameras, in that their calibration involves additional
   error compensation steps for the depth camera caused by complicated
   factors. Without this process, there may be obvious misalignment between
   the projection of 3d points measured by the ToF camera, and their
   corresponding points in the intensity image provided at the same time,
   via a perspective mapping. To this regard, we begin by analyzing the
   various error sources of ToF camera, and then modeling the two main
   kinds of errors, namely, distance-based and intensity based error. Based
   on this we compensate for the two errors and automatically obtain a
   precise alignment between the 3D and 2D data given by the ToF camera.
   Experimental results demonstrate the validity, of our method, and we
   anticipate that this error compensation approach can serve to improve
   the quality of 3D reconstructions obtained from such combinations of
   imaging devices.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and prediction of the dynamics of slender flexible
   cylinders in axial film is of interest for the design and safe operation
   of heat exchangers and nuclear reactors, specifically that of heat
   exchanger tubes, nuclear fuel elements, control rods, and monitoring
   tubes. In such fluid-structure interaction problems, the fluid forces
   acting on the flexible structure play a vital role in defining its
   dynamics. Therefore, a precise calculation of the coefficients
   associated to these forces, such as the longitudinal and normal viscous
   force coefficients, and base drag coefficient in the equation of motion
   is imperative. The present work is aimed at (i) calculating these force
   coefficients for a cantilevered slender flexible cylinder, fitted with
   an ogival end-piece, in axial flow and (ii) conducting experiments on
   the same system. In the calculation of these force coefficients, the
   parameters of the experimental system are used, so that the
   theoretically predicted dynamics would be representative of the actual
   physical system. These calculated force coefficients are then
   incorporated in the linear and nonlinear equations of motion and the
   predicted dynamics are compared with those of the experiments. The
   comparison shows good agreement between the theoretical and experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, some experiments are described which were designed to
   illustrate the dynamical behaviour of towed flexible cylinders and to
   test the theory. A silicone rubber cylinder was manufactured such that
   it was almost neutrally buoyant when immersed in water. The cylinder was
   terminated by plexiglas end pieces and was held in horizontal water flow
   by a length of nylon thread (towrope). Video capturing along with image
   processing techniques were used to measure the transverse displacement
   of the cylinder in the horizontal plane. For the cylinder with
   relatively streamlined nose and tail end-pieces, non flexural (rigid
   body), as well as flexural instabilities developed as the flow velocity
   was increased; using a sufficiently blunt tail end-piece significantly
   stabilized the system, while shortening the towrope was not very
   effective for stabilizing the system. The experimental observations are
   generally in qualitative agreement with the nonlinear theory.
   Quantitative comparison of various quantities, e.g. the instability
   thresholds, between experiment and theory, based on the estimated values
   of some of the theoretical non-dimensional parameters, is also fairly
   good.}},

Abstract = {{The subject of this paper is the study of dynamics and stability of a
   pipe flexibly supported at its ends and conveying fluid. First, the
   equation of motion of the system is derived via the extended form of
   Hamilton's principle for open systems. In the derivation, the effect of
   flexible supports, modelled as linear translational and rotational
   springs, is appropriately considered in the equation of motion rather
   than in the boundary conditions. The resulting equation of motion is
   then discretized via the Galerkin method in which the eigenfunctions of
   a free-free Euler-Bernoulli beam are utilized. Thus, a general set of
   second order ordinary differential equations emerge, in which, by
   setting the stiffness of the end-springs suitably, one can readily
   investigate the dynamics of various systems with either classical or
   non-classical boundary conditions.}},

   The paper shows different types of integrals of the perturbing forces
   over the time. These integrals represent the total change of velocity
   per orbit that the satellite receives from the perturbing forces. Solar
   radiation pressure, J2 to J4 zonal harmonics terms of the geopotential,
   and lunisolar perturbations are considered. The results provide the
   magnitude of each perturbing forces, so it is possible to see if the

Abstract = {{This paper investigates convergence properties of scalable algorithms
   for nonconvex and structured optimization. We consider a method that is
   adapted from the classic quadratic penalty function method, the
   Alternating Direction Penalty Method (ADPM). Unlike the original
   quadratic penalty function method, in which single-step optimizations
   are adopted, ADPM uses alternating optimization, which in turn is
   exploited to enable scalability of the algorithm. A special case of ADPM
   is a variant of the well known Alternating Direction Method of
   Multipliers (ADMM), where the penalty parameter is increased to
   infinity. We show that due to the increasing penalty, the ADPM
   asymptotically reaches a primal feasible point under mild conditions.
   Moreover, we give numerical evidence that demonstrates the potential of
   the ADPM for computing local optimal points when the penalty is not
   updated too aggressively.}},

Abstract = {{In many signal processing applications it is required to estimate the
   unobservable state of a dynamic system from its noisy measurements. For
   linear dynamic systems with Gaussian Mixture (GM) noise distributions,
   Gaussian Sum Filters (GSF) provide the MMSE state estimate by tracking
   the GM posterior. However, since the number of the clusters of the GM
   posterior grows exponentially over time, suitable reduction schemes need
   to be used to maintain the size of the bank in GSF. In this work we
   propose a low computational complexity reduction scheme which uses an
   initial state estimation to find the active noise clusters and removes
   all the others. Since the performance of our proposed method relies on
   the accuracy of the initial state estimation, we also propose five
   methods for finding this estimation. We provide simulation results
   showing that with suitable choice of the initial state estimation (based
   on the shape of the noise models), our proposed reduction scheme
   provides better state estimations both in terms of accuracy and
   precision when compared with other reduction methods.}},

   (PSD) matrix estimation based on IMCRA which consists of two parts. For
   the auto-PSD (diagonal) estimation, we propose a modification to IMCRA
   where a special level detector is employed to improve the tracking of
   non-stationary noise backgrounds. For the cross-PSD (off-diagonal)
   estimation, we propose to calculate a smoothed cross-periodogram by
   using estimated noise components derived as residuals after the
   application of a speech enhancement algorithm on the individual
   microphone signals. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our
   proposed approach in estimating the noise PSD matrix and its robustness
   against reverberation when used in combination with an MVDR-based speech

Title = {{Gold nanoparticles and their alternatives for radiation therapy
   enhancement}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Radiation therapy is one of the most commonly used treatments for
   cancer. The dose of delivered ionizing radiation can be amplified by the
   presence of high-Z materials via an enhancement of the photoelectric
   effect; the most widely studied material is gold (atomic number 79).
   However, a large amount is needed to obtain a significant dose
   enhancement, presenting a challenge for delivery. In order to make this
   technique of broader applicability, the gold must be targeted, or
   alternative formulations developed that do not rely solely on the
   photoelectric effect. One possible approach is to excite scintillating
   nanoparticles with ionizing radiation, and then exploit energy transfer
   between these particles and attached dyes in a manner analogous to
   photodynamic therapy (PDT). Doped rare-earth halides and semiconductor
   quantum dots have been investigated for this purpose. However, although
   the spectrum of emitted light after radiation excitation is usually
   similar to that seen with light excitation, the yield is not.
   Measurement of scintillation yields is challenging, and in many cases
   has been done only for bulk materials, with little understanding of how
   the principles translate to the nanoscale. Another alternative is to use
   local heating using gold or iron, followed by application of ionizing
   radiation. Hyperthermia pre-sensitizes the tumors, leading to an
   improved response. Another approach is to use chemotherapeutic drugs
   that can radiosensitize tumors. Drugs may be attached to high-Z
   nanoparticles or encapsulated. This article discusses each of these
   techniques, giving an overview of the current state of
   nanoparticle-assisted radiation therapy and future directions.}},

Title = {{Specific resting-state brain networks in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{We studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) differences
   in resting-state networks between patients with mesial temporal lobe
   epilepsy (MTLE) and healthy subjects. To avoid any a priori hypothesis,
   we use a data-driven analysis assessing differences between groups
   independently of structures involved. Shared and specific independent
   component analysis (SSICA) is an exploratory method based on independent
   component analysis, which performs between-group network comparison. It
   extracts and classifies components (networks) in those common between
   groups and those specific to one group. Resting fMRI data were collected
   from 10 healthy subjects and 10 MILE patients. SSICA was applied
   multiple times with altered initializations and different numbers of
   specific components. This resulted in many components specific to
   patients and to controls. Spatial clustering identified the reliable
   resting-state networks among all specific components in each group. For
   each reliable specific network, power spectrum analysis was performed on
   reconstructed time-series to estimate connectivity in each group and
   differences between groups. Two reliable networks, corresponding to
   statistically significant clusters robustly detected with clustering
   were labeled as specific to MILE and one as specific to the control
   group. The most reliable MILE network included hippocampus and amygdala
   bilaterally. The other MTLE network included the postcentral gyri and
   temporal poles. The control-specific network included bilateral
   precuneus, anterior cingulate, thalamus, and parahippocampal gyrus.
   Results indicated that the two MTLE networks show increased connectivity
   in patients, whereas the control-specific network shows decreased
   connectivity in patients. Our findings complement results from
   seed-based connectivity analysis (1). The pattern of changes in
   connectivity between mesial temporal lobe structures and other areas may
   help us understand the cognitive impairments often reported in patients
   with MTLE.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown a dramatic increase in multi-bit upset (MBU)
   events and related errors as transistors continue to shrink. To assist
   designers with addressing MBU in microprocessor register files, we have
   extended an architectural description language, ADL, to simulate and
   analyze the effect of MBU on the fault coverage of hardware mitigation
   techniques. Our approach (a) considers the effect of SRAM layout on MBU
   patterns, (b) considers the data-dependent nature of transient upsets,
   and (c) runs benchmarks to completion to accurately evaluate coverage.
   To accelerate fault injection campaigns, we propose a suite of
   techniques that reduce the execution time of individual trials without
   compromising accuracy by only simulating mitigation techniques when
   faults are present and stopping simulation entirely when all errors have
   been detected or corrected. When evaluating parity, SECDED, and 2-bit 2D
   ECC, we achieve a mean fault injection performance speedup of 5.1 x, but
   up to nearly 60x in one case.}},

Abstract = {{In the work of Huang (2010) and Nguyen and Huang (2012) the linear
   quadratic mean field systems and control problem is solved in the case
   where there is a major agent (i.e. non-asymptotically vanishing as the
   population size goes to infinity) together with a population of minor
   agents (i.e. individually asymptotically negligible). The new feature in
   this case is that the mean field becomes stochastic and by minor agent
   state extension Nguyen and Huang (2012) establish the existence of
   epsilon-Nash equilibria together with the individual agents' control
   laws that yield the equilibria. This paper presents results initially
   announced in Caines and Kizilkale (2013); Caines (2013) where it is
   shown that if the major agent's state is partially observed by the minor
   agents, and if the major agent completely observes its own state, all
   agents can recursively generate estimates (in general individually
   distinct) of the major agent's state and the mean field, and thence
   generate feedback controls yielding epsilon-Nash equilibria.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most popular approaches to process high-density proximal soil
   sensing data is to aggregate similar measurements representing unique
   field conditions. An innovative constraint-based spatial clustering
   algorithm has been developed. The algorithm seeks to minimize the mean
   squared error during the interactive grouping of spatially adjacent
   measurements similar to each other and different from the other parts of
   the field. After successful implementation of a one soil property
   scenario, this research was to accommodate multiple layers of soil
   properties representing the same area under investigation. Six
   agricultural fields across Nebraska, USA, were chosen to illustrate the
   algorithm performance. The three layers considered were field elevation
   and apparent soil electrical conductivity representing both deep and
   shallow layers of the soil profile. The algorithm was implemented in
   MATLAB, R2013b. Prior to the process of interactive grouping, geographic
   coordinates were projected and erroneous data were filtered out.
   Additional data pre-processing included bringing each data layer to a
   20x20 m raster to facilitate multi-layer computations. An interactive
   grouping starts with a new ``nest{''} search to initiate the first group
   of measurements that are most different from the rest of the field. This
   group is grown using a neighbourhood search approach and once growing
   the group fails to reduce the overall mean squared error, the algorithm
   seeks to locate a new ``nest{''}, which will grow into another group.
   This process continues until there is no benefit from separating out an
   additional part of the field. Results of the six-field trial showed that
   each case generated a reasonable number of groups which corresponded to
   agronomic knowledge of the fields. The unique feature of this approach
   is spatial continuity of each group and capability to process multiple

Abstract = {{In this paper, the stability of a periodic cantilevered pipe conveying
   fluid is studied theoretically by means of a novel transfer matrix
   method. This method is first validated by comparing the results to those
   available in the literature for a uniform pipe, showing that it is
   capable of high accuracy and displaying good convergence
   characteristics. Then, the stability of periodic pipes is investigated,
   with geometric, material-properties periodicity, and a combination of
   the two, showing that a considerable stabilizing effect may be achieved
   over different ranges of the mass parameter beta (beta = m(f)/(m(f) +
   m(p) ), where m(f) and m(p) are the fluid and pipe masses per unit
   length). The effect of other different system parameters is also probed.}},

Title = {{Alternative Ordered Response Frameworks for Examining Pedestrian Injury
   Severity in New York City}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{275-300}},
Abstract = {{This article focuses on identifying the appropriate ordered response
   structure for modeling pedestrian injury severity. The alternative
   ordered response approaches considered for the empirical analysis
   include ordered logit model (OL), generalized ordered logit model (GOL),
   and latent segmentation based ordered logit model (LSOL). The GOL and
   LSOL models enhance the traditional OL model in different ways. The GOL
   model relaxes the restrictive thresholds in the OL model by allowing for
   individual-level exogenous variable impacts on the threshold parameters.
   On the other hand, the LSOL model allows for differential impact on the
   alternatives by segmenting the pedestrian crash population into various
   segments with segment-specific OL parameters. In this study, the authors
   focus on examining the performance of these two model structures
   relative to the traditional OL model in the context of pedestrian injury
   severity. The performance of the formulated injury severity models are
   tested based on the New York City (NYC) Pedestrian Research Data Base
   for the years 2002 through 2006. To the authors' knowledge, the study
   provides a first of its kind comparison exercise among OL, GOL, and LSOL
   models for examining pedestrian injury severity. The model estimation
   results clearly highlight the presence of segmentation based on the
   crash location attributes of pedestrian accidents. The crash location
   attributes that affect the allocation of pedestrians into these segments
   include regional county, functional classification of roadway,
   pedestrian location on roadway, number of travel lanes, and number of
   parking lanes in the roadway system. The key factors influencing
   pedestrian injury severity are weather condition, lighting condition,
   vehicle types, pedestrian age, and season. Overall, the results of the
   empirical analysis provide credence to the hypothesis that LSOL model is
   a promising ordered framework to accommodate population heterogeneity in
   the context of pedestrian injury severity.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft sizing, route network design, demand estimation and allocation
   of aircraft to routes are different facets of the air transportation
   optimization problem that can be viewed as individual ``systems,{''}
   since they can be conducted independently. In fact, there is a large
   body of literature that investigates each of these as a stand-alone
   problem. In this regard, the air transportation design optimization
   problem can be viewed as an optimal system-of-systems (SoS) design
   problem. The resulting mixed variable programming problem cannot be
   solved all-in-one (AiO) because its size and complexity grow
   exponentially with increasing number of network nodes. In this work, we
   use a nested multidisciplinary formulation and the Mesh Adaptive Direct
   Search (MADS) optimization algorithm to solve the optimal SoS design
   problem. The expansion of a regional Canadian airline's network to
   enable national operations is considered as an example.}},

Abstract = {{Typical challenges of simulation-based design optimization include
   unavailable gradients and unreliable approximations thereof expensive

   failure of the analysis to return a value to the optimizer. The remedy
   for all these issues is to use surrogate models in lieu of the
   computational models or simulations and derivative free optimization
   algorithms. In this work, we use the R dynaTree package to build
   statistical surrogates of the blackboxes and the direct search method
   for derivative free optimization. We present different formulations for
   the surrogate problem considered at each search step of the Mesh
   Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm using a surrogate management
   framework. The proposed formulations are tested on two simulation-based
   multidisciplinary design optimization problems. Numerical results
   confirm that the use of statistical surrogates in MADS improves the
   efficiency of the optimization algorithm.}},

   profile. An iterative co-simulation procedure, consisting of tooth-root
   profile shape synthesis via nonlinear programming and finite element
   analysis software tools is conducted, for the purpose of forming the

   proposed design was verified to be capable of reducing the stress

Abstract = {{Camus' concept of Auxiliary Surface (AS) is extended to the case of
   involute gears with skew axes. In the case at hand, we show that the AS
   is an orthogonal helicoid whose axis a) lies in the cylindroid and b) is
   normal to the instant screw axis of one gear with respect to its meshing
   counterpart; in general, the helicoid axis is skew with respect to the
   latter. According to the spatial version of Camus' Theorem, any line
   attached to the AS, in particular any generator g of AS itself, can be
   chosen to generate a pair of conjugate flanks with line contact.
   While the pair of conjugate flanks is geometrically feasible, as they
   always share a line of contact and the tangent plane at each point of
   this line, there are poses where the flanks even have a common Disteli
   axis. Then there is a G(2)-contact at the striction point and the two
   surfaces penetrate each other.
   The outcome is that the surfaces are not realizable as tooth flanks.
   Nevertheless, this is a fundamental step towards the synthesis of the
   flanks of involute gears with skew axes.}},

Abstract = {{Efficiently predicting the vibratory responses of flexible structures
   which experience unilateral contact is becoming of high engineering
   importance. An example of such a system is a rotor blade within a
   turbine engine; small operating clearances and varying loading
   conditions often result in contact between the blade and the casing.
   The method of weighted residuals is a effective approach to simulating
   such behaviour as it can efficiently enforce time periodic solutions of
   lightly damped, flexible structures experiencing unilateral contact. The
   Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) based on Fourier expansion of the sought
   solution is a common formulation, though it is hypothesized wavelet
   bases that can sparsely define nonsmooth solutions may be superior. This
   is investigated herein using an axially vibrating rod with unilateral
   contact conditions. A distributional formulation in time is introduced
   allowing periodic, square-integrable trial functions to approximate the
   second-order equations. The mixed wavelet Petrov-Galerkin solutions are
   found to yield consistent or better results than HBM, with similar
   convergence rates and seemingly more accurate contact force prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies focused on the numerical prediction of structural
   instabilities that may arise in rotating components of an aircraft
   engine. These instabilities are commonly classified into two categories:
   those induced by aerodynamic phenomena (such as the pressure applied on
   the blade by the incoming air flow) and those related to structural
   phenomena (such as potential blade/casing contacts). Based on an
   existing numerical strategy for the analysis of rotor/stator
   interactions induced by unilateral contacts between rotating and static
   components, this paper aims at combining both types of instabilities and
   provides a qualitative analysis of structural interactions that may
   arise within the high-pressure compressor of an aircraft engine. The
   aerodynamic pressure on the blade is simplified as a sinusoidal external
   load whose frequency depends on the number of upstream guide vanes.
   Results are presented both in time and frequency domains. Detailed
   bifurcation diagrams and Poincare maps underline the fundamental
   differences in the nature of the witnessed interactions with and without
   aerodynamic loading on the blade.}},

Title = {{Immobilized phage proteins for specific detection of staphylococci}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{179-186}},
Abstract = {{Rapid, specific detection of pathogenic bacteria remains a major
   challenge in infectious disease diagnostics. Bacteriophages can show
   genus- or even species-level specificity and have been developed for
   biosensing purposes, but the possibility of using individual phage
   proteins for detection has not been fully explored. This work exploits
   the ability of specific phage proteins, the endolysins LysK and Phi 11,
   and the bacteriocin lysostaphin, fixed on silicon wafers to bind
   staphylococci. The proteins show activity against eight tested clinical
   isolates of S. aureus and to S. epidermidis, but no binding to
   Escherichia coli and limited binding to Micrococcus. Binding was
   quantified by clearing assays in solution and by functionalization of
   silicon wafers followed by light microscopy. Bacterial binding densities
   on functionalized surfaces were similar to 3 cells/100 mu m(2). The
   small size of the proteins makes the system robust and easy to handle,
   and the principle is generalizable to many different biosensor
   platforms, including label-free systems such as optical microresonators.}},

Abstract = {{Natural materials and structures are increasingly becoming a source of
   inspiration for the design novel of engineering systems. In this
   context, the structure of fish skin, made of an intricate arrangement of
   flexible plates growing out of the dermis of a majority of fish, can be
   of particular interest for materials such as protective layers or
   flexible electronics. To better understand the mechanics of these
   composite shells, we introduce here a general computational framework
   that aims at establishing a relationship between their structure and
   their overall mechanical response. Taking advantage of the periodicity
   of the scale arrangement, it is shown that a representative periodic
   cell can be introduced as the basic element to carry out a
   homogenization procedure based on the Hill-Mendel condition. The
   proposed procedure is applied to the specific case of the fish skin
   structure of the Morone saxatilis, using a computational finite element
   approach. Our numerical study shows that fish skin possesses a highly
   anisotropic response, with a softer bending stiffness in the
   longitudinal direction of the fish. This softer response arises from
   significant scale rotations during bending, which induce a stiffening of
   the response under large bending curvature. Interestingly, this
   mechanism can be suppressed or magnified by tuning the rotational
   stiffness of the scale-dermis attachment but is not activated in the
   lateral direction. These results are not only valuable to the
   engineering design of flexible and protective shells, but also have
   implications on the mechanics of fish swimming. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the potential of real-time
   monitoring of airborne cat allergen powder using quartz crystal
   microbalance (QCM) technology. Monoclonal antibodies of cat allergen
   (Fel d 1) were immobilized onto a gold-coated quartz crystal using a
   cysteamine self-assembled monolayer (SAM). The QCM responses exhibited
   negative frequency shifts characteristic of mass uptake onto the sensor
   surface when exposed to airborne cat allergen powder. The cat allergen
   powder was 0.01 wt\% Fel d 1; therefore, antigen-antibody binding
   occurred despite potential interference from dust particles. The
   absolute frequency shift increased linearly (log-log, R-2 = 0.968) over
   the immunosensor working range, from 5.2 ng/L to 1.6 x 10(5) ng/L.
   Selectivity of the immunosensor between the cat allergen and a test dust
   was confirmed using SEM images and antibody affinity was confirmed by
   challenging an Escherichia coli antibody-coated crystal with airborne
   cat allergen. Positive frequency shifts were observed with the QCM for
   both negative controls. The research demonstrates that immunosensors
   based on QCM technology may become a viable alternative to conventional
   methods of real-time monitoring of bioaerosols. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

   magnetic torque rods cannot produce torque. A mathematical model of the
   system dynamics is derived first. Then a controller is developed to
   stabilize the attitude angles of a satellite equipped with the
   abovementioned set of actuators. The effect of failure of the fluid ring
   or a magnetic torque rod is examined as well. It is noted that the case
   of failure of the magnetic torque rod whose torque is along the pitch
   axis is the most critical, since the coupling between the roll or yaw
   motion and the pitch motion is quite weak. The simulation results show
   that the control system proposed is quite fault tolerant. (C) 2013 IAA.

Abstract = {{Liquid compositions obtained through vapor + liquid + hydrate
   equilibrium modeling are often neglected and not reported in literature.
   This work demonstrates the sensitivity and importance of the liquid
   phase compositions on selected models and parameters. The equations of
   state used to model two-phase systems are the Soave-Redlich-Kwong, the
   Valderrama-Patel-Teja and the Trebble-Bishnoi equations of state. The
   modeling analysis for three-phase systems is based on the
   Trebble-Bishnoi equation of state along with the model by van der Waals
   and Platteeuw. The vapor + liquid equilibrium model predictions at gas
   hydrate formation conditions were found to be greatly dependant on the
   liquid phase compositions. At the three-phase equilibrium, small
   modifications in the equation of state's interaction parameters
   significantly affected the liquid composition predictions while leaving
   the vapor compositions mostly unchanged. Lastly, the interaction
   parameters were optimized for the two phases separately using vapor +
   liquid equilibrium data. When optimized only for liquid, vapor and
   liquid compositions were predicted correctly. However, when optimized
   only for vapor, liquid compositions failed to fit experimental data. (C)

Title = {{Acoustic modelling for speech recognition in Indian languages in an

Abstract = {{In developing speech recognition based services for any task domain, it
   is necessary to account for the support of an increasing number of
   languages over the life of the service. This paper considers a small
   vocabulary speech recognition task in multiple Indian languages. To
   configure a multi-lingual system in this task domain, an experimental
   study is presented using data from two linguistically similar languages
   Hindi and Marathi. We do so by training a subspace Gaussian mixture
   model (SGMM) (Povey et al., 2011; Rose et al., 2011) under a
   multi-lingual scenario (Burget et al., 2010; Mohan et al., 2012a).
   Speech data was collected from the targeted user population to develop
   spoken dialogue systems in an agricultural commodities task domain for
   this experimental study. It is well known that acoustic, channel and
   environmental mismatch between data sets from multiple languages is an
   issue while building multi-lingual systems of this nature. As a result,

Abstract = {{This work presents a methodology to analyze hydrogen peroxide reduction
   reaction (HPRR) studied by rotating disk electrode (ROE). Generally the
   Koutecky-Levich equation is used to determine the kinetic parameters of
   an electrochemical reaction. This equation is not applicable to
   electrochemical reactions with a complex reaction mechanism. The HPRR is
   an example of these complex reactions because the H2O2 reduction, H2O2
   decomposition and O-2 reduction may take place simultaneously on the
   electrode surface. In the current work the mass transport equations of
   H2O2 in the electrolyte and the reaction equations on the electrode
   surface are solved simultaneously under the steady state conditions to
   derive a specific equation for HPRR. The new equation shows the same
   linear relationship between the inverse of the current density (j(-1))
   and the inverse square root of the rotation frequency (omega(-1/2)), but
   the slopes and the intercepts of the lines are shown to be functions of
   the reaction rate constants involved in the HPRR. One of the most
   important results of the work is the possibility to determine the
   hydrogen peroxide decomposition rate constant directly from RDE data.
   Prediction of simultaneous reduction of H2O2 and O-2 on the electrode
   and suggestion a mechanism for HPRR are other advantages of the derived
   equation when compared with Koutecky-Levich equation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new intersymbol interference (ISI)-free nonlinearity-tolerant
   frequency domain root M-shaped pulse (RMP) is derived for dispersion
   unmanaged coherent optical transmission systems. Beginning with the

   Experimental demonstrations reveal that by employing the proposed pulse
   at a roll-off factor of 1, the maximum transmission reach of a
   single-channel 56 Gb/s polarization-division-multiplexed quadrature
   phase-shift keying (PDM-QPSK) system can be extended by 33\% and 17\%,
   when compared to systems using a root raised cosine (RRC) pulse and a
   root optimized pulse (ROP), respectively. For a single-channel 128 Gb/s
   polarization-division-multiplexed 16-quadrature amplitude modulation
   (PDM-16QAM) system, the reach can be extended by 44\% and 18\%,

Abstract = {{In the present study, we investigate the irradiation-defects hybridized
   graphene scaffold as one potential building material for the anode of
   Li-ion batteries. Designating the Wigner V-2(2) defect as a
   representative, we illustrate the interplay of Li atoms with the
   irradiation defects in graphene scaffolds. We examine the adsorption
   energetics and diffusion kinetics of Li in the vicinity of a Wigner
   V-2(2) defect using density functional theory calculations. The
   equilibrium Li adsorption sites at the defect are identified and shown
   to be energetically preferable to the adsorption sites on pristine
   (bilayer) graphene. Meanwhile, the minimum energy paths and
   corresponding energy barriers for Li migration at the defect are
   determined and computed. We find that, while the defect is shown to
   exhibit certain trapping effects on Li motions on the graphene surface,
   it appears to facilitate the interlayer Li diffusion and enhance the
   charge capacity within its vicinity, because of the reduced interlayer
   spacing and characteristic symmetry associated with the defect. Our
   results provide critical assessment for the application of irradiated
   graphene scaffolds in Li-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, gas hydrates have sparked the interest of many industries for
   their potential use in natural gas transportation, component separation
   and carbon dioxide sequestration. In order to optimize the efficiencies
   of such applications, there has been a pronounced focus on finding
   techniques and additives that promote hydrate growth. Previous studies
   have found that the addition of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to
   methane hydrate systems greatly enhances production. In this study, the
   growth rates of methane hydrates were measured in the presence of
   as-produced (hydrophobic) and plasma functionalized (hydrophilic) MWNTs.
   For each condition, the effect of MWNT loading in the aqueous phase was
   determined. At higher concentrations, the hydrophobic MWNTs produced an
   enhanced growth rate whose effect plateaued with MWNT loading. The
   hydrophilic MWNTs' effect had an initial local maximum at lower
   concentrations and then followed to increase almost linearly with an
   increase in concentration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface and near-surface soils in cold climate regions experience low
   temperature and freeze thaw (FT) conditions in the winter.
   Microorganisms that are of concern to groundwater quality may have the
   potential to survive low temperature and FT in the soil and aqueous
   environments. Although there is a body of literature on the survival of
   pathogenic bacteria at different environmental conditions, little is
   known about their transport behavior in aquatic environments at low
   temperatures and after FT. Herein, we studied the survival, transport,
   and virulence of a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Yersinia
   enterocolitica, when subjected to low temperature and several FT cycles
   at two solution ionic strengths (10 and 100 mM) in the absence of
   nutrients. Our findings demonstrate that this bacterium exhibited higher
   retention on sand after exposure to FT. Increasing the number of FT
   cycles resulted in higher bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and
   impaired the swimming motility and viability of the bacterium. Moreover,
   the transcription of flhD and fliA, the flagellin-encoding genes, and
   lpxR, the lipid A 3'-O-deacylase gene, was reduced in low temperature
   and after FT treatment while the transcription of virulence factors such
   as ystA, responsible for enterotoxin production, ail, attachment
   invasion locus gene, and rfbC, O-antigen gene, was increased. Y.
   enterocolitica tends to persist in soil for long periods and may become
   more virulent at low temperature in higher ionic strength waters in cold
   regions.}},

Title = {{Analysis and experimental demonstration of novel 8PolSK-QPSK modulation
   at 5 bits/symbol for passive mitigation of nonlinear impairments}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new modulation format providing 5 bits of information per
   recovered symbol while maintaining constant the total optical power. The
   proposed format applies a simple power constrain to the DP-8QAM format.
   This modulation format provides a passive way to mitigate nonlinear
   impairments due to Kerr effects occurring during propagation, and most
   specifically in the first 40 km. This report presents, to the authors'
   knowledge, a new transmission format using solely phase and polarization
   as modulation methods. The performance of this format, named
   8PolSK-QPSK, is experimentally compared with that of the DP-8QAM format
   as both require equal transmitter complexity and implementation penalty,
   at the expense of a 20\% increase in signaling baud rate. The greater
   nonlinear tolerance of this format is experimentally demonstrated.
   Moreover, thorough analysis of the Manakov-PDM propagation equation
   applied to both formats provides analytic explanation of the
   8PolSK-QPSK's improved performance. The constant power property of the
   symbol set of the proposed format mitigates self- and cross-phase
   modulation (SPM, XPM) nonlinear effects and is experimentally validated
   over a long-haul transmission system in a WDM scenario. A total
   throughput of 7 x 129 Gbps is maintained for the transmission format
   comparison. Simulation of the same transmission system allows separate
   analysis of the strength of SPM, XPM and Cross-Polarization Modulation
   (XPolM) nonlinear effects and demonstrate reduced nonlinear impairments
   for the proposed format in the first span. We show an experimental
   reduction of the required OSNR for a BER threshold of 1.4 x 10(-2) of
   0.5 dB for 8PolSK-QPSK compared to DP-8QAM in back-to-back. After 1920
   km of SMF fiber, we demonstrate a required OSNR (ROSNR) diminution for
   increasing launch power, allowing a ROSNR relief of 0.95 dB at optimal
   launch power of -1 dBm for the proposed format. Using the same
   threshold, we show an increased reach by more than 34\%, or 975 km, at
   optimal launch power. We also demonstrate that the relative reach
   increase for 8PolSK-QPSK compared to DP-8QAM monotonically increases
   with increasing BER threshold and that the BER growth with distance,
   after the first span, is equal for both formats. (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{The incorporation of carbon nanotubes to thermoplastic fibers can
   potentially improve mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. In
   this article, a methodology to tailor the mechanical properties of
   carbon nanotube/nylon fibers is presented. Multiwalled nanotubes (MWNT)
   were combined to polyamide 12 through melt compounding and twin-screw
   extrusion. Pellets containing between 0 and 5.0 wt \% MWNT were extruded
   and subsequently melt spun with a capillary rheometer to produce
   filaments. To further promote the alignment of the polymer chains and
   MWNTs, postdrawing parameters were systematically investigated:
   temperature, drawing speed and elongation. The best improvements in
   terms of elastic modulus and yield strength were measured at 140 degrees
   C and 500\% elongation, whereas drawing speed was shown to have a
   negligible effect. It was confirmed through electron microscopy and
   X-ray diffraction that these enhancements were mainly induced by the
   alignment of the polymer chains along the fibers' axis. (c) 2013 Wiley

Title = {{Multiscale streamflow forecasting using a new Bayesian Model Average
   based ensemble multi-wavelet Volterra nonlinear method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{507}},

Abstract = {{Over the last five years, wavelet transform based models have begun to
   be explored for hydrologic forecasting applications. In general, a
   particular wavelet transform (and a particular set of levels of
   decomposition) is selected as the `optimal' wavelet transform to be used
   for forecasting purposes. However, different wavelets have different
   strengths in capturing the different characteristics of particular
   hydrological processes. Therefore, relying on a single model based on a
   single wavelet often leads to predictions that capture some phenomena at
   the expenses of others. Ensemble approaches based on the use of multiple
   different wavelets, in conjunction with a multi model setup, could
   potentially improve model performances and also allow for uncertainty
   estimation. In this study, a new multi-wavelet based ensemble method was
   developed for the wavelet Volterra coupled model. Different wavelets,
   levels of decomposition, and model setups are used in this new approach
   to generate an ensemble of forecasts. These ensembles are combined using
   Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to develop more skilful and reliable
   forecasts. The new BMA based ensemble multi-wavelet Volterra approach
   was applied for forecasting stream flow at different scales (daily,
   weekly and monthly) observed at two stations in the USA. The results of
   this study reveal that the proposed BMA based ensemble multi-wavelet
   Volterra nonlinear model outperforms the single best wavelet Volterra
   model, as well as the mean averaged ensemble wavelet Volterra model. (C)

Abstract = {{Eumelanin is a ubiquitous pigment in the human body, animals, and
   plants, with potential for bioelectronic applications because of its
   unique set of physical and chemical properties, including strong UV-vis
   absorption, mixed ionic/electronic conduction, free radical scavenging
   and anti-oxidant properties. Herein, a detailed investigation is
   reported of eumelanin thin films grown on substrates patterned with gold
   electrodes as a model system for device integration, using electrical
   measurements, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   fluorescence microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass
   spectroscopy. Under prolonged electrical biasing in humid air, one can
   observe gold dissolution and formation of gold-eumelanin nanoaggregates,
   the assembly of which leads to the formation of dendrites forming
   conductive pathways between the electrodes. Based on results collected
   with eumelanins from different sources, a mechanism is proposed for the
   formation of the nanoaggregates and dendrites, taking into account the
   metal binding properties of eumelanin. The surprising interaction
   between eumelanin and gold points to new opportunities for the
   fabrication of eumelanin-gold nanostructures and biocompatible memory
   devices and should be taken into account in the design of devices based
   on eumelanin thin films.}},

Abstract = {{A capacitively coupled radio-frequency afterglow is used to isolate the
   role of electron bombardment in the degradation process of muti-walled
   carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). MWNTs grown on a metal substrate act as a
   nanostructured anode that accelerate and focus electron bombardment,
   facilitated by the field enhancement effect. Tip-localized MWNT
   degradation has been observed in scanning electron microscope images
   showing the progression of the MWNT degradation process. This finding is
   confirmed by Raman spectra. GC-MS measurements indicate that the major
   products of MWNT degradation are short unsaturated hydrocarbons,
   identified as both propyne and 1,3-butadiyne vapours. This finding is
   corroborated by time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy during
   plasma oxidation of the degradation products. Analysis of the kinetics
   of plasma oxidation confirm that MWNT degradation produces species
   consistent with thermal evaporation, such as short carbon chains, C3-C4,
   but not monatomic or diatomic species, C1 and C2.}},

Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Palladium-doped nanosized zerovalent iron (Pd-NZVI) particles can
   contribute to the transformation of chlorinated solvents and various
   other contaminants into innocuous products. To make Pd-NZVI an effective
   in situ subsurface remediation agent, these particles need to migrate
   through a targeted contaminated area. However, previous studies have
   reported very limited mobility of these particles in the groundwater
   environment and attributed it to rapid aggregation and subsequent pore
   plugging In this study, we systematically investigated the influence of
   selected natural and nontoxic organic macromolecules (carboxymethyl
   cellulose, rhamnolipid biosurfactants, and soy protein) on the
   aggregation and transport behavior of bare and coated Pd-NZVI.
   Aggregation behavior was investigated using dynamic light scattering by
   monitoring the evolution of hydrodynamic diameter as a function of time,
   whereas transport behavior was investigated by conducting
   water-saturated sand-packed column experiments. While bare Pd-NZVI is
   prone to rapid aggregation, we observed good colloidal stability and
   concurrent enhanced transport of Pd-NZVI coated with carboxymethyl
   cellulose, rhamnolipid biosurfactants, and soy protein. Each surface
   modifier performed well at lower ionic strength (IS) (10 mM NaHCO3), and
   one of the rhamnolipid surface modifiers (JBR215) significantly enhanced
   transport of 150 mg/L Pd-NZVI at concentrations as low as 10 mg/L total
   organic carbon. However, an increase in the solution IS induced
   significant Pd-NZVI aggregation with a simultaneous decrease in the
   transport potential in accordance with the DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau,
   Verwey, and Overbeek) theory of colloidal stability. Nonetheless, at the
   highest IS (300 mM NaHCO3) investigated, the mobility of
   rhamnolipid-coated Pd-NZVI is significantly higher than that of Pd-NZVI
   coated with the other surface modifiers, suggesting that biosurfactants
   may be the most suitable surface modifiers in field application.
   Overall, this study emphasizes how stabilization of Pd-NZVI with natural
   macromolecules such as rhamnolipids can improve the transport potential
   of these reactive nanoparticles in subsurface remediation applications
   at concentrations significantly lower than those of other commonly used
   polymers.}},

Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides time-dependent expressions for the expected degree
   distribution of a given network that is subject to growth. We consider
   both uniform attachment, where incoming nodes form links to existing
   nodes selected uniformly at random, and preferential attachment, where
   probabilities are assigned proportional to the degrees of the existing
   nodes. We consider the cases of single and multiple links being formed
   by each newly introduced node. The initial conditions are arbitrary,
   that is, the solution depends on the degree distribution of the initial
   graph which is the substrate of the growth. Previous work in the
   literature focuses on the asymptotic state, that is, when the number of
   nodes added to the initial graph tends to infinity, rendering the effect
   of the initial graph negligible. Our contribution provides a solution
   for the expected degree distribution as a function of time, for
   arbitrary initial condition. Previous results match our results in the
   asymptotic limit. The results are discrete in the degree domain and
   continuous in the time domain, where the addition of new nodes to the
   graph are approximated by a continuous arrival rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modeling framework developed for the City of
   Montreal, Canada, and is intended to quantify two indicators that can
   explain the spatial distribution of traffic-related air pollution at a
   metropolitan level. The indicators are estimated at the level of the
   traffic analysis zone (TAZ) and include: (1) the average level of
   emissions generated per individual and (2) the level of emissions
   occurring in a zone as a proxy for air pollution exposure. A regional
   traffic assignment model is extended with capabilities for emission
   modeling at an individual trip level while taking into account vehicle
   (type and age) and trip attributes (road type, speed, and volume). We
   observe that individuals who generate higher emissions from travel tend
   to reside in areas with lower exposure to traffic emissions while
   individuals associated with low levels of travel emissions (e.g. travel
   smaller distances, conduct less trips, and use alternative modes) reside
   in areas with high levels of traffic pollution. A regression analysis of
   the two indicators against a set of land-use and socio-economic
   variables shows that generated emissions per individual are positively
   associated with car ownership and larger vehicles, while being
   negatively associated with ownership of newer vehicles, and location in
   dense and walkable neighborhoods with high levels of commercial
   land-use. Meanwhile, exposure to emissions is positively associated with
   dense and walkable neighborhoods and negatively associated with car
   ownership and larger vehicles. These findings indicate major inequities
   in the generation of and exposure to traffic-related air pollution. (C)

Abstract = {{Vickers microindentation and Berkovich nanoindentation tests were
   carried out on a polycrystalline nickel (Ni) bulk specimen. Electron
   channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) in conjunction with electron
   backscattered diffraction was used to image and characterize plastic
   deformation inside and around the indents using a field emission
   scanning electron microscope. The ECCI was performed with a 5 keV beam
   energy and 0 degrees tilt specimen position. The strain field
   distribution, slip lines, and Taylor lattices were imaged on an indented
   surface. Orientation mapping was used to investigate the local
   crystallographic misorientation and identify specific < 110 > slip
   systems. An ion milling surface preparation technique was used to remove
   materials from the surface which permitted the study of deformed
   microstructure below the indent. A dislocation density of 10(11) cm(-2)
   was calculated based on the curvature of bend contours observed in the
   ECCI micrographs obtained from the Vickers indents. A yield strength of
   500 MPa was calculated based on the size of the strain field measured
   from the ECCI micrographs of the nanoindents. The combination of ion
   milling, ECCI, and electron backscattered diffraction was shown to be

Abstract = {{A forescatter electron detector (FSED) was used to acquire dark-field
   micrographs (DF-FSED) on thin specimens with a scanning electron
   microscope. The collection angles were adjusted with the detector
   distance from the beam axis, which is similar to the camera length of
   the scanning transmission electron microscope annular DF detectors. The
   DF-FSED imaging resolution was calculated with SMART-J on an aluminum
   alloy and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) decorated with platinum nanoparticles.
   The resolution was three to six times worse than with bright-field
   imaging. Measurements of nanometer-size objects showed a similar feature
   size in DF-FSED imaging despite a signal-to-noise ratio 12 times
   smaller. Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict the variation of
   the contrast of a CNT/Fe/Pt system as a function of the collection
   angles. It was constant for very high collection angles (>450 mrad) and
   confirmed experimentally. The reverse contrast between carbon black
   particles and the smallest titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles was
   predicted by Monte Carlo simulations and observed in the DF-FSED
   micrograph of a battery electrode coating. However, segmentation of the
   micrograph was not able to isolate the TiO2 nanoparticle phase because
   of the close contrast of small TiO2 nanoparticles compared to the C
   black particles.}},

Abstract = {{A central challenge in host-pathogen systems biology is the elucidation
   of general, systems-level principles that distinguish host-pathogen
   interactions from within-host interactions. Current analyses of
   host-pathogen and within-host protein-protein interaction networks are
   largely limited by their resolution, treating proteins as nodes and
   interactions as edges. Here, we construct a domain-resolved map of
   human-virus and within-human protein-protein interaction networks by
   annotating protein interactions with high-coverage, high-accuracy,
   domain-centric interaction mechanisms: (1) domain-domain interactions,
   in which a domain in one protein binds to a domain in a second protein,
   and (2) domain-motif interactions, in which a domain in one protein
   binds to a short, linear peptide motif in a second protein. Analysis of
   these domain-resolved networks reveals, for the first time, significant
   mechanistic differences between virus-human and within-human
   interactions at the resolution of single domains. While human proteins
   tend to compete with each other for domain binding sites by means of
   sequence similarity, viral proteins tend to compete with human proteins
   for domain binding sites in the absence of sequence similarity.
   Independent of their previously established preference for targeting
   human protein hubs, viral proteins also preferentially target human
   proteins containing linear motif-binding domains. Compared to human
   proteins, viral proteins participate in more domain-motif interactions,
   target more unique linear motif-binding domains per residue, and contain
   more unique linear motifs per residue. Together, these results suggest
   that viruses surmount genome size constraints by convergently evolving
   multiple short linear motifs in order to effectively mimic, hijack, and
   manipulate complex host processes for their survival. Our
   domain-resolved analyses reveal unique signatures of pleiotropy,
   economy, and convergent evolution in viral-host interactions that are
   otherwise hidden in the traditional binary network, highlighting the
   power and necessity of high-resolution approaches in host-pathogen
   systems biology.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing, used to economically produce natural gas from
   shale formations, has raised environmental concerns. The objective of
   this study is to assess one of the largely unexamined issues, which is
   the potential for slow contamination of shallow groundwater due to
   hydraulic fracturing at depth via fluid migration along conductive
   faults. We compiled publically available data of shale gas basins and
   hydraulic fracturing operations to develop a two-dimensional,
   single-phase, multispecies, density-dependent, finite-element numerical
   groundwater flow and mass transport model. The model simulates hydraulic
   fracturing in the vicinity of a permeable fault zone in a generic,
   low-recharge, regional sedimentary basin in which shallow, active
   groundwater flow occurs above nearly stagnant brine. A sensitivity
   analysis of contaminant migration along the fault considered basin,
   fault and hydraulic fracturing parameters. Results show that specific
   conditions are needed for the slow contamination of a shallow aquifer: a
   high permeability fault, high overpressure in the shale unit, and
   hydrofracturing in the upper portion of the shale near the fault. Under
   such conditions, contaminants from the shale unit reach the shallow
   aquifer in less than 1000 years following hydraulic fracturing, at
   concentrations of solutes up to 90\% of their initial concentration in
   the shale, indicating that the impact on groundwater quality could be
   significant. Important implications of this result are that hydraulic
   fracturing should not be carried out near potentially conductive faults,
   and that impacts should be monitored for long timespans. Further work is
   needed to assess the impact of multiphase flow on contaminant transport
   along natural preferential pathways.}},

Abstract = {{We examine an alternative method to incorporate potential presence of
   population heterogeneity within the Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme
   Value (MDCEV) model structure. Towards this end, an endogenous
   segmentation approach is proposed that allocates decision makers
   probabilistically to various segments as a function of exogenous
   variables. Within each endogenously determined segment, a segment
   specific MDCEV model is estimated. This approach provides insights on
   the various population segments present while evaluating distinct choice
   regimes for each of these segments. The segmentation approach addresses
   two concerns: (1) ensures that the parameters are estimated employing
   the full sample for each segment while using all the population records
   for model estimation, and (2) provides valuable insights on how the
   exogenous variables affect segmentation. An Expectation-Maximization
   algorithm is proposed to address the challenges of estimating the
   resulting endogenous segmentation based econometric model. A prediction
   procedure to employ the estimated latent MDCEV models for forecasting is
   also developed. The proposed model is estimated using data from 2009
   National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) for the New York region. The
   results of the model estimates and prediction exercises illustrate the
   benefits of employing an endogenous segmentation based MDCEV model. The
   challenges associated with the estimation of latent MDCEV models are
   also documented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for retting of flax stem was introduced by using microwave
   energy. The combined effect of pre-soaking, microwave volumetric heating
   and the non-thermal effect of microwave energy were applied in the
   retting of flax stem. Effective retting was observed in various
   combinations of pre-soaking, Microwave treatment times and microwave
   energy. The samples soaked for 24 and 36 h with microwave treatments of
   20 min showed better retting efficiency. Fried tests, Near Infrared
   analysis and fibre diameter analysis were done to find out the retting
   efficiency. The effect of non-thermal effect of microwave in flax
   retting was proved experimentally. Colourimetric tests and tensile
   strength tests were conducted to compare the quality of fibres after
   microwave retting and no significant changes in the physical qualities
   were observed. The water released after pre-soaking was not contaminated
   because of less microbial activity in short duration of the entire
   process. In industrial point of view, this method is acceptable because
   of the ease of recyclability of the pre-soaked water and comparably
   short duration of the process. (C) 2013 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Radio-frequency (RF) tomography is the method of tracking targets using
   received signal-strength (RSS) measurements for RF transmissions between
   multiple sensor nodes. When the targets are near the line-of-sight path
   between two nodes, they are more likely to cause substantial attenuation
   or amplification of the RF signal. In this paper, we develop a
   measurement model for multitarget tracking using RF tomography in indoor
   environments and apply it successfully for tracking up to three targets.
   We compare several multitarget tracking algorithms and examine
   performance in the two scenarios when the number of targets is 1) known
   and constant, and 2) unknown and time varying. We demonstrate successful
   tracking for experimental data collected from sensor networks deployed
   in three different indoor environments posing different tracking
   challenges. For the fixed number of targets, the best algorithm achieves
   a root-mean-squared error tracking accuracy of approximately 0.3 m for a
   single target, 0.7 m for two targets and 0.8 m for three targets.
   Tracking using our proposed model is more accurate than tracking using
   previously proposed observation models; more importantly, the model does
   not require the same degree of training.}},

Abstract = {{Radio frequency (RF) sensing networks are a class of wireless sensor
   networks (WSNs) which use RF signals to accomplish tasks such as passive
   device-free localization and tracking. The algorithms used for these
   tasks usually require access to measurements of baseline received signal
   strength (RSS) on each link. However, it is often impossible to collect
   this calibration data (measurements collected during an offline
   calibration period when the region of interest is empty of targets). We
   propose adapting background subtraction methods from the field of
   computer vision to estimate baseline RSS values from measurements taken
   while the system is online and obstructions may be present. This is done
   by forming an analogy between the intensity of a background pixel in an
   image and the baseline RSS value of a WSN link and then translating the
   concepts of temporal similarity, spatial similarity, and spatial
   ergodicity, which underlie specific background subtraction algorithms to
   WSNs. Using experimental data, we show that these techniques are capable
   of estimating baseline RSS values with enough accuracy that RF
   tomographic tracking can be carried out in a variety of different
   environments without the need for a calibration period.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-based therapies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation require
   in vitro cell expansion. However, standard culture techniques require
   cell passaging, leading to dedifferentiation into a fibroblast-like cell
   type. Primary chondrocytes grown on continuously expanding culture
   dishes (CE culture) limits passaging and protects against
   dedifferentiation. The authors tested whether CE culture chondrocytes
   were advantageous for producing mechanically competent cartilage matrix
   when three-dimensionally seeded in dense collagen gels. Primary
   chondrocytes, grown either in CE culture or passaged twice on static
   silicone dishes (SS culture; comparable to standard methods), were
   seeded in dense collagen gels and cultured for 3 weeks in the absence of
   exogenous chondrogenic growth factors. Compared with gels seeded with SS
   culture chondrocytes, CE chondrocyte-seeded gels had significantly
   higher chondrogenic gene expression after 2 and 3 weeks in culture,
   correlating with significantly higher aggrecan and type II collagen
   protein accumulation. There was no obvious difference in
   glycosaminoglycan content from either culture condition, yet CE
   chondrocyte-seeded gels were significantly thicker and had a
   significantly higher dynamic compressive modulus than SS
   chondrocyte-seeded gels after 3 weeks. Chondrocytes grown in CE culture
   and seeded in dense collagen gels produce more cartilaginous matrix with
   superior mechanical properties, making them more suitable than SS
   cultured cells for tissue engineering applications. (C) 2013 Acta

Title = {{Mechanical properties of lattice materials via asymptotic homogenization
   and comparison with alternative homogenization methods}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{249-262}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Several homogenization schemes exist in literature to characterize the
   mechanics of cellular materials. Each one has its own assumptions,
   advantages, and limitations that control the level of accuracy a method
   can provide. There is often the need in heavy multiscale analyses of
   lattice materials to find the method that can provide the best trade-off
   between accuracy and computational cost.
   In this paper, asymptotic homogenization (AH) is used as a benchmark to
   test the accuracy of alternative schemes of homogenization applied to
   lattice materials. AH is first applied to determine the effective
   elastic moduli and yield strength of six lattice topologies for the
   whole range of relative density. Yield surfaces are also obtained under
   multiaxial loading for square, hexagonal, and Kagome lattices, and
   closed-form expressions of the yield loci are provided for a convenient
   use in multiscale material problems. With respect to the relative
   density, the results are then compared to those obtained with other
   methods available in literature. The analysis shows that the latter can
   predict the elastic constants with an error below 10\% for rho < 0.25,
   whereas for the yield strength the discrepancy is above 20\% for rho >=
   0.1 due to the model assumptions. The results of this work on the
   effective properties of lattice materials provide not only handy
   expressions of prompt use in multiscale design problems, but also
   insight into the level of accuracy that alternative homogenization
   techniques can attain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article deals with the effect of the intrinsic length-scale on the
   stability and fundamental frequency of a fully clamped circular
   micro-plate, which can be used as a RF MEMS resonator. A modified couple
   stress theory is utilized to model the micro-plate, considering the
   variable length-scale parameter. A variational formulation based on
   Hamilton's principle is used to obtain the nonlinear governing equation
   of motion. The static and dynamic pull-in phenomena, limiting the stable
   regions of capacitive resonators, are determined and compared to those
   obtained by the classical theory. The numerical results reveal that the
   intrinsic size dependence of materials leads to an increase in the
   pull-in voltage and natural frequency depending on the thickness of the
   micro-plate. Comparing these results with the experimental ones reveals
   that utilizing the fixed material length-scale leads to unrealistic
   results in some manner. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive skin loss and chronic wounds are still a significant challenge
   to clinicians: even if injured epidermis is normally able to self-renew,
   deep injuries can cause negative regulation of the wound healing
   cascade, leading to chronic wound formation. Skin-autografting surgical
   procedures are often limited by the poor availability of healthy tissue,
   whereas the use of non-self-tissues for allografts presents some severe
   risks. Tissue-engineered skin substitutes have recently become viable as
   a suitable alternative to auto- and allografts. However, biologists,
   biochemists, and technical engineers are still struggling to produce
   complex skin substitutes that can readily be transplanted in large
   quantities. The ambitious goal is now to construct a dermoepidermal
   substitute that rapidly vascularizes and optimally supports a
   stratifying epidermal graft on a biodegradable matrix. This review
   analyzes these aspects in light of the available literature and the

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that aerial disturbances affecting landing
   aircraft have a coherent signature in the Lagrangian aerial particle
   dynamics inferred from ground-based lidar scans. Specifically,
   attracting Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) mark the intersection
   of localized material upwelling within the cone of the lidar scan. This
   study tests the detection power of LCSs on historical landing data and
   corresponding pilot reports of disturbances from Hong Kong International
   Airport. The results show that a specific LCS indicator, the gradient of
   the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field along the landing path,
   is a highly efficient marker of turbulent upwellings. In particular, in
   the spring season, projected FTLE gradients closely approach the
   efficiency of the wind shear alert system currently in operation at the
   airport, even though the latter system relies on multiple sources of
   data beyond those used in this study. This shows significant potential
   for the operational use of FTLE gradients in the real-time detection of
   aerial disturbances over airports.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of the tympanic membrane displays both
   non-linearity and viscoelasticity. Previous finite-element models of the
   tympanic membrane, however, have been either non-linear or viscoelastic
   but not both. In this study, these two features are combined in a
   non-linear viscoelastic model. The constitutive equation of this model
   is a convolution integral composed of a non-linear elastic part,
   represented by an Ogden hyperelastic model, and an exponential
   time-dependent part, represented by a Prony series. The model output is
   compared with the relaxation curves and hysteresis loops observed in
   previous measurements performed on strips of tympanic membrane. In
   addition, a frequency-domain analysis is performed based on the obtained
   material parameters, and the effect of strain rate is explored. The
   model presented here is suitable for modeling large deformations of the
   tympanic membrane for frequencies less than approximately 3 rad/s or
   about 0.6 Hz. These conditions correspond to the pressurization involved
   in tympanometry. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of the vocal folds (VFs) vary as a function of
   depth relative to the epithelial surface. The poroelastic anisotropic
   properties of porcine VFs, at various depths, were measured using atomic
   force microscopy (AFM)-based indentation. The minimum tip diameter to
   effectively capture the local properties was found to be 25 mu m, based
   on nonlinear laser scanning microscopy data and image analysis. The
   effects of AFM tip dimensions and AFM cantilever stiffness were
   systematically investigated. The indentation tests were performed along
   the sagittal and coronal planes for an evaluation of the VF anisotropy.
   Hertzian contact theory was used along with the governing equations of
   linear poroelasticity to calculate the diffusivity coefficient of the
   tissue from AFM indentation creep testing. The permeability coefficient
   of the porcine VF was found to be 1.80 +/- 0.32 x 10(-15) m(4)/N s. (c)

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering approaches for articular cartilage (AC) repair using
   collagen type I (Coll)-based hydrogels are limited by their low collagen
   fibril density (CFD; <0.5wt\%) and their poor capacity to support
   chondrocyte differentiation. Chitosan (CTS) is a well-characterized
   polysaccharide that mimics the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) present in
   native AC extracellular matrix and exhibits chondroprotective
   properties. Here dense Coll/CTS hydrogel discs (16mm diameter, 140-250m
   thickness) with CFD (approximate to 6wt\%) approaching that of AC were
   developed to investigate the effect of CTS content on the growth and
   differentiation of three-dimensionally seeded RCJ3.1C5.18
   chondroprogenitor cells. Compared to dense Coll alone, cells seeded
   within Coll/CTS showed increased viability and metabolic activity, as
   well as a decrease in cell-mediated gel contraction.
   Immunohistochemistry for collagen type II, in combination with Safranin
   O staining and GAG quantification, indicated greater chondroprogenitor
   differentiation within Coll/CTS, compared to cells seeded within Coll
   alone. The complex interplay between scaffold geometry, microstructure,
   composition, mechanical properties and cell function was further
   evaluated by rolling dense planar sheets to prepare cylindrically shaped
   constructs having clinically relevant diameters (3-5mm diameter, 9mm
   height). The compressive modulus of the cylindrically shaped constructs
   decreased significantly after 7 days in culture, and remained unchanged
   up to 21 days for each scaffold composition. Unlike Coll, cells seeded
   within Coll/CTS showed greater viability along the entire radial extent
   of the cylindrical rolls and increased GAG production at each time
   point. While GAG content decreased over time and reduced cell viability
   was observed within the core region of all cylindrical rolls, the
   incorporation of CTS diminished both these effects. In summary, these
   findings provide insight into the challenges involved when scaling up
   scaffolds designed and optimised in vitro for tissue repair.}},

Abstract = {{Cutoff grade specifies the available supply of metallic ore from an open
   pit mine to the multiple processing streams of an open pit mining
   complex. An optimal cutoff grade strategy maximizes the net present
   value (NPV) of an open pit mining operation subject to the mining,
   processing, and marketing/refining capacity constraints. Even though,
   the quantities of material flowing from the mine to the market are
   influenced by the expected variation in the available metal content or
   inherent uncertainty in the supply of ore, the majority of cutoff grade
   optimization models not only disregard this aspect and may lead to
   unrealistic cash flows, but also they are limited in application to an
   open pit mining operation with single processing facility. The model
   proposed herein determines the optimal cutoff grade policy based on a
   stochastic framework that accounts for uncertainty in supply of ore to
   the multiple ore processing streams. An application on a large-scale
   open pit mining operation develops a unique cutoff grade policy along
   with a portfolio of mining, processing, and marketing/refining rates.
   Owing to the geological uncertainty, the approach addresses risk by
   showing a difference of 14\% between the minimum and maximum production
   rates, cash flows and NPV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) possesses excellent properties as a drug carrier.
   To overcome the challenge of drug functionalization with CNT, we have
   developed a lipid-drug approach for efficient drug loading onto CNT, in
   which a long chain lipid molecule is conjugated to the drug molecule so
   that the lipid-drug can be loaded directly onto CNT through binding of
   the lipid `tail' in the drug molecule to CNT surfaces via hydrophobic
   interactions. In a proof-of-concept study, drug paclitaxel (PTX) was
   conjugated with a nontoxic lipid molecule docosanol for
   functionalization with CNT. Folic acid was also conjugated to CNT for
   targeted drug delivery. High level of drug loading onto SWNT could be
   achieved by lipid-drug approach. Conjugation of FA to SWNT-lipid-PTX led
   to an increase in cell penetration capacity, and the targeted
   SWNT-lipid-PTX showed much improved drug efficacy in vitro in comparison
   to free drug Taxol and non-targeted SWNT-lipid-PTX at 48 h (78.5\% vs.
   31.6\% and 59.1\% in cytotoxicity respectively, p < 0.01). In vivo
   analysis using a human breast cancer xenograft mice model also confirmed
   the improved drug efficacy. The targeted SWNT-lipid-PTX was found
   non-toxic as evaluated by biochemical analysis using blood samples, and
   by histological analysis of major organs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Identifying the effects of carbon dioxide displacing coal bed methane
   under supercritical condition can provide a theoretical basis for the
   carbon dioxide injection parameters of deep coal seam. Regarding Sihe
   mine anthracite and Yuwu mine lean coal as the research objects, the
   adsorption experiments and displacement experiments of carbon dioxide
   and coal bed methane under supercritical conditions were carried out.
   According to the nature of the volumetric method for testing adsorption,
   the absolute adsorption of carbon dioxide and coal bed methane under
   different pressures was calculated and the Langmuir pressure and
   Langmuir volume of carbon dioxide and coal bed methane were obtained.
   With Langmuir isothermal adsorption model and its extensions, the
   desorption rate of carbon dioxide displacing coal bed methane at unit
   pressure drop under supercritical pressure range and low pressure range
   were calculated.
   The results showed that the desorption rate of the carbon dioxide
   displacing coal bed methane at unit pressure drop under supercritical
   pressure range or low pressure range both are higher than the desorption
   rate of coal bed methane in the natural desorption states at unit
   pressure drop. Desorption rate of coal bed methane at unit pressure drop
   under the supercritical pressure range or low pressure range for
   Anthracite increased by 268.13\% and 8.71\%, and lean coal increased by
   73.71\% and 3.75\%; The effect of carbon dioxide displacing coal bed
   methane under supercritical pressure range was more obvious.}},

Abstract = {{Closed-loop glucose control is an emerging treatment approach to manage
   type 1 diabetes. Closed-loop systems consist of a continuous glucose
   monitor, an insulin infusion pump, and a dosing algorithm that directs
   insulin delivery based on sensor levels. Testing of dosing algorithms in
   computer simulations may replace animal testing, accelerates
   development, and saves resources. We propose here a novel approach to
   generate a virtual population, to be used in metabolic simulators, from
   routine experimental data through the process that we term ``stochastic
   e-cloning.{''} We build on a nonlinear physiologically motivated
   time-varying model of glucose regulation. We adopt the Bayesian approach
   to estimate model parameters and to obtain the joint posterior
   probability distribution of time-invariant and time-varying parameters
   with the use of the Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology. The estimation
   process combines prior knowledge and experimental data to generate a
   sample from the posterior distribution, which can be subsequently used
   to conduct in silico experiments reflecting population and individual
   variability, and associated uncertainty as closely as possible. The
   approach is exemplified using data collected in 12 young subjects with
   type 1 diabetes. We demonstrate unbiased fit to the data, physiological
   plausibility of parameter estimates, and results of in silico testing
   using a stochastic virtual subject.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simple, intuitive method of analyzing and

   the acceleration coupling. These values can be determined for a system
   formulated in terms of joint coordinates, but when used with systems
   formulated in terms of workspace coordinates, this work provides a
   unified method of determining important, well-established concepts such
   as effective mass (particularly important in the field of human-robot
   interaction) and dynamic isotropy (an important consideration for
   robotic manipulators and haptic devices). Two examples are provided

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel dual-axis accelerometer structure with low
   cross-sensitivity. The device is fabricated in an SOI process, namely
   SOIMUMPs, and its fabrication is finalized by an in-house release step.
   The device measures 1 x 1 mm(2) with four proof masses that are able to
   sense accelerations in the X and Y axes independently. Two commercial
   capacitance-to-digital converters are used to read both axes outputs of
   the device in a system in package implementation. Simulations show a
   sensitivity of 25 fF/g and the fabricated device exhibits a sensitivity
   of 101 digital counts/g or 16.83 fF/g. The measured cross-sensitivity is
   <1 \% throughout the 4 g linear range. The rotational motion and Z
   accelerations have no impact on the device X and Y readings, thanks to
   the particular geometry and differential nature of the device.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are conditions that are
   frequently observed in clinical practice. A post-hoc analysis has been
   undertaken to evaluate the effect of bile salt hydrolase-active L.
   reuteri NCIMB 30242 on GI health status based on Rome III questionnaire
   response in otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic subjects.
   Research design/Methods: A total of 127 subjects received either L.
   reuteri NCIMB 30242 or placebo capsules over a 9-week intervention in a
   randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multicenter
   study. Subjects were asked to complete the Rome III diagnostic GI
   questionnaire prior to the baseline and end point visits of the clinical
   study.
   Main outcome measure: GI health status was evaluated, per questionnaire,
   by assessing all questions with 5- or 7-point response scales for
   symptoms of the stomach and intestines.
   Results: Subjects receiving L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 reported significant
   improvements in general GI health status (p = 0.029) and in symptoms
   related to diarrhea (p = 0.018) as compared to placebo over the
   intervention period. Further, a greater proportion of L. reuteri-treated
   subjects showed improved general GI health status (p = 0.042) and
   improved diarrhea symptoms (p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 capsules appear to be well tolerated
   and potentially beneficial for GI health status. Further clinical
   investigation is warranted for the treatment of functional GI disorders.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{736}},
Pages = {{250-286}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The effect of different levels of background turbulence on the dynamics
   and mixing of an axisymmetric turbulent jet at different Reynolds
   numbers has been investigated. Approximately homogeneous and isotropic
   background turbulence was generated by a random jet array and had a
   negligible mean flow (< U-alpha >/u(alpha rms) << 1). Velocity
   measurements of a jet issuing into two different levels of background
   turbulence were conducted for three different jet Reynolds numbers. The
   results showed that the mean axial velocities decay faster with
   increasing level of background turbulence (compared with a jet in
   quiescent surroundings), while the mean radial velocities increase,
   especially close to the edges of the jet. Furthermore, the axial
   root-mean-square velocities of the jet increased in the presence of
   background turbulence, as did the jet's width. However, the mass flow
   rate of the jet decreased, from which it can be inferred that the
   entrainment into the jet is reduced in a turbulent background. The
   effect of background turbulence on the entrainment mechanisms is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of steel slag as a no-clinker binder was studied. Steel slag was

   analysis, thermal analysis and field emission scanning electron
   microscopy analysis affiliated with energy dispersive spectrometer
   analysis. Results showed that the mineral components of steel slag, such
   as calcium hydroxide and calcium silicates (C3S and C2S), were CO2
   reactive. The reaction products were strength contributing. Immediate
   carbonation of 2 h was capable of developing rapid early strength while
   promoting subsequent hydration. The reaction products of steel slag
   after carbonation and hydration were the combination of poorly
   crystalline CaCO3 intermingled with C-S-H gel, which was the
   characteristic of the early hardening structure of no-clinker steel

Title = {{Prevention of arterial calcification corrects the low bone mass
   phenotype in MGP-deficient mice}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{499-508}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Matrix gla protein (MGP), a potent inhibitor of extracellular matrix
   (ECM) mineralization, is primarily produced by vascular smooth muscle
   cells (VSMCs) and chondrocytes. Consistent with its expression profile,
   MGP deficiency in mice (Mgp-/- mice) results in extensive mineralization
   of all arteries and cartilaginous ECMs. Interestingly, we observed a
   progressive loss of body weight in Mgp-/- mice, which becomes apparent
   by the third week of age. Taking into account the new paradigm linking
   the metabolic regulators of energy metabolism and body mass to that of
   bone remodeling, we compared the bone volume in Mgp-/- mice to that of
   their wild type littermates by micro-CT and bone histomorphometry. We
   found a decrease of bone volume over tissue volume in Mgp-/- mice caused
   by an impaired osteoblast function. In culture, early differentiation of
   Mgp-/- primary osteoblasts was not affected; however there was a
   significant upregulation of the late osteogenic marker Bglap
   (osteocalcin). We examined whether the prevention of arterial
   calcification in Mgp-/- mice could correct the low bone mass phenotype.
   The bones of two different genetic models: Mgp-/-;SM22-Mgp and
   Mgp-/-;Eln+/- mice were analyzed. In the former strain, vascular
   calcification was fully rescued by transgenic overexpression of Mgp in
   the VSMCs, while in the latter, elastin haploinsufficiency significantly
   impeded the deposition of minerals in the arterial walls. In both
   models, the low mass phenotype seen in Mgp-/- mice was rescued. Our data
   support the hypothesis that the arterial calcification, not MGP
   deficiency itself, causes the low bone mass phenotype in Mgp-/- mice.
   Taken together, we provide evidence that arterial calcification affects
   bone remodeling and pave the way for further mechanistic studies to
   identify the pathway(s) regulating this process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Mine tailings dams are geotechnical structures that are designed to
   provide adequate and safe storage of tailings materials both during and
   after the end of mine life. The design of such structures is thus of
   utmost importance not only to the success of the mining operation, but
   more importantly to the safety of the surrounding environment such as
   freshwater resources, wildlife and community developments. This paper
   presents a reliability-based approach for the geotechnical design of
   mine tailings dams through a real life case study of a water retention
   tailings dam. The stability analysis is conducted with a
   hydromechanical, elasto-plastic finite difference model. The reliability
   analysis is carried out for three stochastic parameters namely the
   cohesion and friction angle of the dam core material as well as its
   hydraulic conductivity. The results are presented in the form of
   probability distribution functions of the generated factor of safety.
   The generated reliability indices are compared to target reliability
   indices to help evaluate the geotechnical design of the dam.}},

Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, the geometrically non-linear dynamics of an
   axially moving plate is examined by constructing the bifurcation
   diagrams of Poincare maps for the system in the sub and supercritical
   regimes. The von Karman plate theory is employed to model the system by
   retaining in-plane displacements and inertia. The governing equations of
   motion of this gyroscopic system are obtained based on an energy method
   by means of the Lagrange equations which yields a set of second-order
   non-linear ordinary differential equations with coupled terms. A change
   of variables is employed to transform this set into a set of first-order
   non-linear ordinary differential equations. The resulting equations are
   solved using direct time integration, yielding time-varying generalized
   coordinates for the in-plane and out-of-plane motions. From these time
   histories, the bifurcation diagrams of Poincare maps, phase-plane
   portraits, and Poincare sections are constructed at points of interest
   in the parameter space for both the axial speed regimes. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The effect of hyperbaric treatments on major hydrophilic and lipophilic
   antioxidants and antioxidant activity in tomato fruit, using ORAC and
   TEAC assays, was studied. Early breaker stage greenhouse grown tomatoes
   were subjected to different pressure and temperature conditions,
   including 0.1 (ambient atmospheric pressure, control), 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and
   0.9 MPa at 20 degrees C, and 0.1 MPa at 13 degrees C (cold treatment)
   for 4 days, followed by ripening at 20 degrees C for Sand 10 days.
   Hyperbaric treatment significantly affected lycopene content by
   inhibiting, then enhancing its accumulation during treatment and
   ripening, respectively. In general, ascorbic acid and total phenolic
   contents increased as time progressed but generally were not affected by
   hyperbaric pressure treatment. All antioxidants were found in lower
   concentrations in tomatoes treated at 13 degrees C. The trend in
   antioxidant activity obtained from both ORAC and TEAC assays was
   generally similar. No significant effect of hyperbaric treatment on
   lipophilic antioxidant (LAA) and hydrophilic antioxidant (HAA) was
   observed compared with control tomatoes at 13 and 20 degrees C. However,
   the ORAC assay showed that hyperbaric treated tomatoes had significantly
   higher HAA than 13 degrees C treated tomatoes. Overall, hyperbaric
   treatment at 20 degrees C has potential to extend tomato shelf-life
   during short treatment durations without adverse impact on quality
   during ripening. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{240-248}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Previous work with hyperbaric treatment of tomato focused on application
   at lower temperature (13 degrees C). In this work, hyperbaric treatment
   at varying pressure levels (i.e., 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 MPa) at
   ambient temperature (20 degrees C) was tested as a potential alternative
   to conventional refrigerated storage (0.1 MPa at 13 degrees C) to
   preserve tomato quality. The experiments were divided into 3 phases: (1)
   4 day of hyperbaric treatment, (2) 5 day of post-treatment ripening, and
   (3) 10 day of post-treatment ripening. Respiration rate (RR) of the
   tomatoes was continuously monitored during the course of the hyperbaric
   treatments. Quality attributes were assessed immediately after removal
   from the hyperbaric treatments and after 5 and 10 day ripening at 20
   degrees C after removal from the treatments. Hyperbaric treatments at >=
   0.3 MPa resulted in RR equal or higher than the RR in control fruit (0.1
   MPa at 20 degrees C). The lowest RR was obtained from tomato stored at
   0.1 MPa at 13 degrees C. Hyperbaric treatment at 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 MPa
   significantly reduced weight loss, retained color, firmness, total
   soluble solid (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and TSS:TA ratio at similar
   levels as the tomato treated at 13 degrees C and 0.1 MPa. Firmness after
   treatment was highest for fruit from 0.1 MPa at 13 degrees C and from
   0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 MPa at 20 degrees C. The higher firmness advantage
   declined by 5 day of ripening after treatment, with higher firmness only
   being retained for fruit from the 0.9 MPa at 20 degrees C and the 0.1
   MPa at 13 degrees C treatments. After 10 day ripening, firmness was
   similar for all treatments. Lightness (L{*}) and hue angle were greater
   for all treatments compared with the 0.1 MPa at 20 degrees C treatment.
   However, only the greater hue angle difference was maintained after 5
   day of ripening. After 10 day ripening, no significant differences were
   found in color attributes. Only 0.1 MPa at 13 degrees C retained higher
   soluble solids, lower titratable acidity and higher TSS:TA ratios after
   treatment and after 5 day ripening. At 10 day of ripening none of the
   quality attribute differences noted were retained for any of the
   treatments. These results show that the only consistent effect of
   hyperbaric treatment at 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 MPa was to reduce weight loss
   and enhance firmness retention up to 5 day ripening after treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{A study is presented through simulation and experiment on the proposed
   forward error correction (FEC) codes for data centers using higher order
   pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). The results highlight the tradeoffs in
   the adopted FEC approach for a fixed transmission link. Reed-Solomon
   (RS) and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are considered in data
   center applications due to the low latency requirement budgeted for the
   encoding and decoding processes. Using Monte-Carlo and semi-analytical
   simulations, the signal to noise ratio requirement of PAM-N is obtained
   for a 500-m fiber transmission link at 100 Gb/s. For latency requirement
   under 100 ns, short-block RS codes offer possibly low complexity
   implementation with a pre-FEC bit error rate (BER) threshold at 8.8 x
   10(-5). On the other end, BCH codes provide higher coding gain up to 9.3
   dB with a BER threshold at 2.5 x 10(-3) at the expense of potentially
   longer decoding delay and complexity. An experimental investigation at
   25 Gb/s for PAM-4 signal is performed to measure the actual net coding
   gain of the system. Results show that the performance of RS(578 514)
   code is within 1 dB of both BCH(3456 3084) and BCH(2464 2056) with 15\%
   and 23\% reduction in complexity, respectively.}},

   Five improved varieties (FARO 52, FARO 57, FARO 44, FARO 60 and FARO 61)

   evaluated. There were significant differences in starch fractions among

   Rapidly digestible starch (RDS) was lowest in Jamila (27.70\%) and
   highest in FARO 61 (39.26\%). Generally, the local varieties had
   significant higher RS (2.71\%) with a lower RDS (32.82\%) compared with
   improved varieties (RS; 1.88\% and RDS; 36.07\%). RS was inversely
   related to RDS and starch digestion index (SDI). The SDI had a highly

   acrylainide (DEAAin) to form a block copolyiner of PPA-b-PDEAAm where
   the PDEAAm segment is therino-responsive, while the PPA block is
   potentially UV-active. The thermo-responsive behavior of the block

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{14-23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The natural convection of non-Fourier fluids is examined. These fluids
   possess a relaxation time that reflects the delay in the response of the
   heat flux with respect to the temperature gradient. Non-Fourier fluids
   span a wide range of applications, including low-temperature liquids,
   nanofluids, convection in nano-devices, and fluids subjected to fast
   heat transfer processes. The constitutive equation for heat flux is
   frame invariant. For small relaxation time, the neutral stability curve
   comprises a Fourier branch and an oscillatory branch, intersecting at
   some wavenumber. Both stationary and oscillatory convection become
   equally probable as the relaxation time increases, suggesting the
   existence of a bistable mode. With increasing relaxation time,
   oscillatory convection becomes increasingly the mode of preference, at
   the expense of both conduction and stationary convection, with
   increasing roll size. Although the oscillation frequency decreases
   monotonically with roll size, it exhibits a maximum against the
   relaxation time. Finally, the parallels between non-Fourier and
   non-Newtonian effects are emphasized at the formulation and
   phenomenological levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper the nonlinear planar dynamics of a fluid-conveying
   cantilevered pipe is investigated. The centreline of the pipe is
   considered to be extensible; i.e., coupled longitudinal and transverse
   displacements are considered. The extended version of the Lagrange
   equations for systems containing non-material volumes is employed to
   derive the equations of motion, resulting directly in a set of coupled
   nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The pseudo-arclength
   continuation technique along with direct time integration are used to
   solve these equations. Bifurcation diagrams of the system are
   constructed as the flow velocity is increased; these diagrams are
   supplemented by time traces, phase-plane portraits, and fast Fourier
   transforms for some sets of system parameters. As opposed to the case of
   an inextensible pipe, an extensible pipe elongates in the axial
   direction as the flow velocity is increased from zero; depending on the
   system parameters, this static elongation can be considerable. At the
   critical flow velocity, the system loses stability via a supercritical
   Hopf bifurcation, emerging from the trivial solution for the transverse
   displacement and leading to a flutter. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hydrogen production from the reaction of aluminum powder with liquid
   water is investigated for nano- and micron-sized spherical aluminum
   powders over the 20-200 degrees C temperature range. The maximum
   hydrogen production rate increases with increasing temperature and
   decreasing particle size, consistent with a surface reaction controlled
   by Arrhenius kinetics. The maximum hydrogen production rate normalized
   by surface area is universal, and an expression is proposed that
   predicts the maximum rate for variable powder sizes and temperatures.
   The hydrogen yield increases with increasing temperature and decreasing
   particle size. Ultrasonic agitation of the mixture increases the
   hydrogen production rate and total hydrogen yield, and appears to be a
   promising reaction-enhancing technique. The finite hydrogen yield
   observed for larger particles and lower temperatures suggests that the
   reaction is inhibited after it progresses a certain depth into the
   particles, here termed the penetration thickness. The penetration
   thickness increases with temperature and is independent of particle
   size. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published

Abstract = {{Surface curvature affects the shape, stability, and apparent contact

   investigate the effects of surface curvature on drop shape, pressure,
   and surface energy, ascertaining the energy-gradient force that drives
   lateral drop migration. By balancing this force with the viscous
   resistance/drag force, in the lubrication approximation, we predict
   velocities of the order of 0.1 mm s(-1) 1 mm diameter drops of water
   with a 30 degrees contact angle on a substrate with a curvature gradient

Abstract = {{The development of cartilage-specific imaging agents supports the
   improvement of tissue assessment by minimally invasive means. Techniques
   for highlighting cartilage surface damage in clinical images could
   provide for sensitive indications of posttraumatic injury and early
   stage osteoarthritis. Previous studies in our laboratory have
   demonstrated that fluorescent solutes interact with cartilage surfaces
   strongly enough to affect measurement of their partition coefficients
   within the tissue bulk. In this study, these findings were extended by
   examining solute adsorption and distribution near the articular surface
   of mechanically injured cartilage. Using viable cartilage explants
   injured by an established protocol, solute distributions near the
   articular surface of three commonly used fluorophores (fluorescein
   isothiocyanate (FITC), tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), and
   carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)) were observed after absorption and
   subsequent desorption to assess solute-specific matrix interactions and
   reversibility. Both absorption and desorption processes demonstrated a
   trend of significantly less solute adsorption at surfaces of fissures
   compared to adjacent intact surfaces of damaged explants or surfaces of
   uninjured explants. After adsorption, normalized mean surface
   intensities of fissured surfaces of injured explants were 6\%, 40\%, and
   32\% for FITC, TRITC, and TAMRA, respectively, compared to uninjured
   surfaces. Similar values were found for sliced explants and after a
   desorption process. After desorption, a trend of increased solute
   adsorption at the site of intact damaged surfaces was noted (316\% and
   238\% for injured and sliced explants exposed to FITC). Surface
   adsorption of solute was strongest for FITC and weakest for TAMRA; no
   solutes negatively affected cell viability. Results support the
   development of imaging agents that highlight distinct differences
   between fissured and intact cartilage surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The use of dielectric spectroscopy to carry out real time observations
   of cells and to extract a wealth of information about their
   physiological properties has expanded in recent years. This popularity
   is due to the simple, easy to use, non-invasive and real time nature of
   dielectric spectroscopy. The ease of integrating dielectric spectroscopy
   with microfluidic devices has allowed the technology to further expand
   into biomedical research. Dielectric spectra are obtained by applying an
   electrical signal to cells, which is swept over a frequency range. This
   review covers the different methods of interpreting dielectric spectra
   and progress made in applications of impedance spectroscopy for cell
   observations. First, methods of obtaining specific electrical properties
   of cells (cell membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity) are
   discussed. These electrical properties are obtained by fitting the
   dielectric spectra to different models and equations. Integrating models
   to reduce the effects of the electrical double layer are subsequently
   covered. Impedance platforms are then discussed including electrical
   cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Categories of ECIS systems are
   divided into microelectrode arrays, interdigitated electrodes and those
   that allow differential ECIS measurements. Platforms that allow single
   cell and sub-single cell measurements are then discussed. Finally,
   applications of impedance spectroscopy in a range of cell observations
   are elaborated. These applications include observing cell
   differentiation, mitosis and the cell cycle and cytotoxicity/cell death.
   Future applications such as drug screening and in point of care
   applications are then covered. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The binding of curcumin (CCM) to bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) was
   investigated by Fourier transform infrared and fluorescence. The effect
   of binding on antioxidant activity of CCM was determined by using ABTS
   and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity and total reducing ability. Our
   results showed that when CCM binds to beta-Lg, it lead to a partial
   change in protein structure. In fact, CCM was bound respectively to two
   different sites of protein at pH 6.0 and 7.0 via hydrophobic
   interaction. CCM-beta-Lg complex was formed by one molecule of protein
   combining with one molecule of CCM. Moreover, the average distance from
   one binding site to Trp residues in protein is similar with another.
   This result suggested that fluorescence resonance energy transfer cannot
   be used as unique method to study the characteristics of binding of
   ligands to proteins. The antioxidant activity of CCM might be improved
   by binding with beta-Lg. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Additional electrons injected into lithium peroxide become self-trapped
   to form polarons. While the final stage of this self-trapping phenomenon
   has been examined extensively, the electron-phonon interactions that
   drive this process remain largely unaddressed in the first-principles
   literature. In order to understand the dynamical process of polaron
   formation in lithium peroxide, we examine the initial embryonic stage of
   this process through first-principles calculations of the
   electron-phonon interaction between the lithium peroxide lattice and an
   extra electron injected into the crystal. It is shown that the
   electron-phonon interaction is perceivably strong with such phonons
   whose vibration patterns map directly onto the lattice distortions that
   occur when a polaron is actually formed. These patterns indicate the
   elongation of the bond length of the O-2(2-) ions and contraction of the
   surrounding Li+ ions.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, photoluminescence (PL) properties of nearly defect-free

   recombination, respectively. For the high-doped sample, the Mg-acceptor
   energy level related transition dominates. Detailed power dependent PL
   studies further indicate that the Mg-acceptor energy level related PL
   emission is due to the donor-acceptor pair recombination process, which

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of subsurface drainage flow is essential for
   effectively evaluating the performance of management strategies in
   tile-drained landscapes. The objectives of this study were to calibrate
   and validate MIKE SHE for simulating subsurface tile drainage flow in
   central Iowa and to evaluate the simulated impact of two specific
   management strategies on tile flow The model was calibrated and
   validated using the measured daily drainage in a 15.2 x 38 m row-cropped
   plot during 2006-2009 with a split-sample method. Drainage time constant
   and macropore flow were found to be important in predicting drainage
   flow. The calibrated drainage time constant of 5.6 h was outside the
   recommended range, which might be attributed to the shorter response
   time of subsurface flow at the plot scale used in this study. The
   calibrated model showed a satisfactory performance in simulating daily
   tile drainage flow with Nash-Sutcliffe model coefficient values of 0.78
   and 0.73 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. The
   measured and predicted total drainage from 2006-2009 were 865 and 958
   mm, respectively. The results suggest that MIKE SHE has potential for
   predicting tile drainage flows; guiding management decisions and for
   assessment of drainage design of water flow to downstream water bodies.}},

Abstract = {{For the explosion safety assessment in industrial setting, detonation
   dynamic parameters provide important information on the sensitivity and
   conditions whereby detonations can be favorably occurred. In this study,
   new measurement of the critical tube diameter and the critical energy
   for direct initiation of a detonation is reported for a number of
   hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures. The simultaneous experimental measurement
   carried out in this work allows the investigation of the direct scaling
   between these two dynamic parameter quantities of gaseous detonations.
   Using the new set of data, this paper also assesses the validity of an
   existing semi-empirical initiation model, namely, the surface energy
   model by Lee, and a simplified work done model. Both phenomenological
   models provide a general relationship between the two dynamic detonation
   parameters and comparison shows a good agreement between the theoretical
   results and the experimental measurement. The scaling of critical tube
   diameter with detonation cell size in this study also confirms the
   results in the previous literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Pedestrian violations of traffic signals and dangerous crossings at
   intersections are common. The objective of this study is to determine
   the impact of pedestrian waiting time at an intersection on the
   proportion and type of pedestrian violations and dangerous crossings.
   The amount of waiting depends on signal phasing, time of arrival, and
   the presence of a pedestrian signal. Thirteen intersections with similar
   geometry and traffic conditions but different maximum waiting times,
   seven of which had a pedestrian signal, were observed over at least 2 h
   to collect crossing information. Data was collected manually for the
   main analysis and complementary video data was used for validation.
   Several factors were identified as having an impact on the proportion of
   pedestrian violations. In accordance with the literature, age, sex,
   group size, pedestrian flow and pedestrian signals are associated to
   pedestrian violations. In addition, other factors were identified in
   this research, such as maximum waiting time (red phase). It was also
   determined that an intersection clearing time had an impact on
   violations and on the proportion of dangerous crossings committed. Also,
   pedestrians' speeds depended on the type of crossing. The results
   underline the importance of providing pedestrian signals including
   countdown displays, which is significantly and negatively linked to
   dangerous violations and crossings. The results also highlight the
   importance of pedestrian maximum waiting time as well as clearing time.
   When designing cycle and phase lengths, particular attention should be
   paid to pedestrian waiting times that are positively correlated to
   violations. Minimizing waiting times for pedestrians is expected to
   reduce dangerous pedestrian behaviors at signalized intersections. (C)

Abstract = {{The modification of the tip vortex generated by a rectangular NACA 0012

   with increasing HDW deflection, compared to the baseline wing, the

   of the HDW also caused an increased total drag. Fortunately, the
   lift-induced drag was found to be reduced compared to its baseline
   counterpart for 0 degrees and 5 degrees HDW deflections. The change in
   the lift-induced drag also translates into a virtually unchanged profile
   drag, regardless of HDW deflection. In short, the largest lift-induced
   drag reduction achieved by the zero-deflection HDW resulted in an
   improved lift-to-drag ratio, at high angle-of-attack range, compared to
   the baseline wing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse gas chromatography has great potential in allowing an enhanced
   understanding of mineral surfaces, and the interactions between
   particles and air and water in mineral processing separations, such as
   flotation. Two minerals of different degrees of natural hydrophobicity
   were investigated, namely galena and quartz. The surface energy was
   determined as a function of surface area, with the quartz sample
   displaying a higher work of adhesion, implying a higher degree of
   hydrophilicity. This was then compared to microflotation experiments.
   The higher work of adhesion to water for the quartz than galena (114.54

   unsaturated porous medium. This study provides a comparison between the
   analytical solution and computational estimates for a two-dimensional
   coupled infiltration problem in a transversely isotropic deformable
   porous region where there is recharge at the surface. The results

Abstract = {{Transmission electron forward scatter diffraction (t-EFSD) is a new
   technique providing crystallographic information with high resolution on
   thin specimens by using a conventional electron backscatter diffraction
   (EBSD) system in a scanning electron microscope. In this study, the
   impact of tilt angle, working distance, and detector distance on the
   Kikuchi pattern quality were investigated in a cold-field emission
   scanning electron microscope (CFE-SEM). We demonstrated that t-EFSD is
   applicable for tilt angles ranging from -20 degrees to -40 degrees.
   Working distance (WD) should be optimized for each material by choosing
   the WD for which the EBSD camera screen illumination is the highest, as
   the number of detected electrons on the screen is directly dependent on
   the scattering angle. To take advantage of the best performances of the
   CFE-SEM, the EBSD camera should be close to the sample and oriented
   towards the bottom to increase forward scattered electron collection
   efficiency. However, specimen chamber cluttering and beam/mechanical
   drift are important limitations in the CFE-SEM used in this work.
   Finally, the importance of t-EFSD in materials science characterization
   was illustrated through three examples of phase identification and
   orientation mapping. SCANNING 35:375-386, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a combined experimental and modeling approach for
   the study of NO formation in premixed stagnation flames. In the
   experiments, one-dimensional (1-D) Particle Image Velocimetry (Ply), 1-D
   spectrally resolved Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF), and 1-D
   NO-LIF thermometry are used to measure high resolution profiles, which
   are directly compared to numerical simulations. The simulations are
   performed with CANTERA using 1-D hydrodynamics, transport, and detailed
   thermochemical models. Accurate measurements of premixed gas
   composition, gas velocity, temperature, and spread rate yield all
   necessary inlet boundary conditions. Use of a temperature-controlled
   stagnation plate allows for first-order heat loss effects to be imposed
   on the numerical simulation, rather than relying on external temperature
   corrections. The experiments provide a sensitive test of NO formation,
   result in multiple validation targets which do not rely on
   extrapolations, and allow for accurate specification of measurement
   uncertainties when comparing experiments to simulations. This article
   provides a discussion of the diagnostic techniques and compares
   experimental results for methane air flames to numerical predictions
   using a number of natural gas thermochemical models (GRI-Mech 3.0,
   GDF-Kin 3.0, CRECK 1212, and Konnov 0.6) and their associated submodels
   for NOx formation. The reported results indicate that further
   adjustments to thermochemical combustion models are needed to accurately
   predict NOx pollutant formation in small hydrocarbons under
   atmospheric-pressure conditions.}},

   review}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{98-114}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Polyfluoroalkyl chemicals Containing perfluoroalkyl moieties have been
   widely used in numerous industrial and commercial applications. Many
   polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are potential perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA)
   precursors. When they are released to the environment, abiotic and
   microbial degradation of non-fluorinated functionalities,
   polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl moieties can result in perfluoroalkyl
   carboxylic (PFCAs) and sulfonic acids (PFSAs), such as perfluorooctanoic
   acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). These highly
   persistent and ubiquitously detected PFAAs are the subjects of many
   regulations and actions due to their toxic profiles. In order to
   confidently evaluate the environmental fate and effects of these
   precursors and their links to PFSAs and PFCAs, we present the review
   into the environmental biodegradability studies carried out with
   microbial culture, activated sludge, soil and sediment in the past
   decade. First, we propose that the knowledge gap caused by the lack of
   direct detection of precursor chemicals in environmental samples can be
   bridged by laboratory investigations of important precursors such as
   fluorotelomer-based compounds and perfluoroalkane sulfonamido
   derivatives. Then we evaluate the experimental setups and methodologies,
   sampling and sample preparation methods, and analytical techniques that
   have been successfully applied. Third, we provide the most updated
   knowledge on quantitative and qualitative relationships between
   precursors and PFSAs or PFCAs, microbial degradation pathways,
   half-lives of precursors, defluorination potential, and novel
   degradation intermediates and products. In the end, we identify
   knowledge gaps and suggest research directions with regard to future
   biodegradation studies, environmental monitoring and ecotoxicological
   assessment of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals. (C) 2013

Pages = {{864-876}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach for action recognition,
   localization and video matching based on a hierarchical codebook model
   of local spatio-temporal video volumes. Given a single example of an
   activity as a query video, the proposed method finds similar videos to
   the query in a target video dataset. The method is based on the bag of
   video words (BOV) representation and does not require prior knowledge
   about actions, background subtraction, motion estimation or tracking. It
   is also robust to spatial and temporal scale changes, as well as some
   deformations. The hierarchical algorithm codes a video as a compact set
   of spatio-temporal volumes, while considering their spatio-temporal
   compositions in order to account for spatial and temporal contextual
   information. This hierarchy is achieved by first constructing a codebook
   of spatio-temporal video volumes. Then a large contextual volume
   containing many spatio-temporal volumes (ensemble of volumes) is
   considered. These ensembles are used to construct a probabilistic model
   of video volumes and their spatio-temporal compositions. The algorithm
   was applied to three available video datasets for action recognition
   with different complexities (KTH. Weizmann, and MSR II) and the results
   were superior to other approaches, especially in the case of a single
   training example and cross-dataset(1) action recognition. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of drift-based and dual-parameter
   fragility curves for steel braces as part of concentrically braced
   frames designed in seismic regions. The experimental results from 24
   different research programs are compiled into a database for this

   states of steel braces subjected to cyclic loading associated with brace
   flexural buckling, local buckling and brace strength loss due to
   fracture. The effects of material variability, brace cross sectional
   shape and loading protocol on the drift-based fragility curves are
   investigated. The effect of global and local slenderness ratios on the
   fracture ductility of various shapes of steel braces is examined through
   dual-parameter fragility curves that relate these geometric ratios with
   the expected story drift ratios that each of the three pre-described
   damage states occur. The proposed fragility curves can be employed for
   rapid assessment of the seismic vulnerability of concentrically braced

Title = {{Forecasting Recoverable Ore Reserves and Their Uncertainty at Morila
   Gold Deposit, Mali: An Efficient Simulation Approach and Future Grade

Abstract = {{Forecasting of recoverable reserves aims to predict the tonnages and
   grades that will be recovered at the time of mining. The main concern in
   this forecasting is the imprecision in the selection of ore/waste
   resulting from both the so-called information effect or information that
   becomes available during grade control, and the support effect or mining
   selectivity during mining. Existing approaches to recoverable reserve
   estimation account for mining selectivity; however, they largely ignore
   the information effects from future data becoming available through
   grade control practices.
   An application at the Morila gold deposit, Mali, is utilized in this
   paper to document a new simulation-based approach for recoverable
   reserve forecasting that incorporates the potential effects of future
   grade control data. This accounts for the information effect as well as
   changes in data quantity and quality over time. In addition, the case
   study at the Morila mine elucidates the use of a newer, very efficient,
   and practical alternative to traditional simulation techniques. This
   direct block simulation method forecasts recoverable reserves directly
   into the selective mining unit (support) size under consideration. The
   case study demonstrates the practical uncertainty assessment of the
   recoverable reserves within the deposit, so that expected inaccuracies
   in the selection of ore /waste can be accounted for. This allows for
   fully informed mining decisions to be made that incorporate the effects
   of information and selectivity while quantifying the potential impact of
   uncertainty on the mine operation and its final economic outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Although ridesharing can provide a wealth of benefits, such as reduced
   travel costs, congestion, and consequently less pollution, there are a
   number of challenges that have restricted its widespread adoption. In
   fact, even at a time when improving communication systems provide
   real-time detailed information that could be used to facilitate
   ridesharing, the share of work trips that use ridesharing has decreased
   by almost 10\% in the past 30 years.
   In this paper we present a classification to understand the key aspects
   of existing ridesharing systems. The objective is to present a framework
   that can help identify key challenges in the widespread use of
   ridesharing and thus foster the development of effective formal
   ridesharing mechanisms that would overcome these challenges and promote

Abstract = {{Aluminum-lithium alloy AA2199 was rapidly solidified through the
   application of a laser re-melting process to determine the relationship
   between laser pulse energy and microsegregation during solidification.
   It was determined that laser pulse energies of the order of 0.125-0.5 J
   s resulted in a fine cellular solidification structure. Through
   comparison of the measured cell spacing with that predicted by the
   Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi (KGT) model it was possible to estimate that
   solidification front velocities (SPV) of between 3 and 25 cm s(-1)
   occurred during solidification. The SPV calculated from the KGT model
   was then input into the continuous growth model for solute trapping
   developed by Aziz to predict the deviation from equilibrium partitioning
   during solidification for all pulse energy levels employed. The chemical
   profile of lithium within the re-melted samples was measured using X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and compared with that expected for
   equilibrium segregation. Measurement of the lattice parameter via X-ray
   diffraction revealed that the solute trapping phenomenon resulted in the
   formation of a super-saturated solid solution, as is evident through a
   reduction of the lattice parameter from 4.0485 angstrom for the starting
   material to 4.0399 angstrom in the material re-melted with a pulse
   energy of 0.125 J. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study presents a method for surrogate safety analysis to
   investigate the safety of limited-access highway facilities. The
   proposed methodology is based on automated trajectory collection and
   behavioural analysis from surrogate safety measures (in particular,
   time-to-collision). The methodology is applied to a sample of urban
   highway sections at on-ramps and off-ramps to study the effectiveness of
   a lane-change ban treatment in Montreal, Canada. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the largest automated video-based surrogate safety
   analysis of real sites. The applicability of the methodology is explored
   using (i) a cross-sectional comparison and (ii) a before-after
   comparison. Video data is collected using the highway traffic
   surveillance system and a mobile video camera unit. Various methods of
   aggregating the data, spatially and temporally, are explored. Although
   the treatment does not have a statistically significant impact on the
   time-to-collision distributions, it is found empirically that lane
   changing interactions are less predominant than rear-end interactions at
   these highway ramps, lane changes across the protected side of the
   treatment (infractions) occur in great numbers regardless of the
   implementation of the treatment, and that the start of the treatment
   produces an artificial critical point in the highway stream causing
   increased lane-change interactions at this point.}},

Title = {{Determination of Strain Field on the Superior Surface of Excised Larynx
   Vocal Folds Using DIC}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VOICE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Objective/Hypothesis. The objective of the present study was to quantify
   the mechanical strain and stress in excised porcine larynges during
   self-oscillation using digital image correlation (DIC) method. The use
   of DIC in the excised larynx setup may yield accurate measurements of
   the vocal fold displacement field.
   Study Design. Ex vivo animal larynx.
   Methods. Measurements were performed using excised porcine larynges on a
   humidified flow bench, equipped with two high-speed cameras and a
   commercially available DIC software. Surface deformations were
   calculated from digital images recorded at 3000 frames per second during
   continuous self-oscillation for four excised porcine larynges. Larynx
   preparation consisted of removing the supraglottal wall and the false
   folds. DIC yielded the deformation field on the superior visible surface
   of the vocal folds. Measurement data for adducted and freely suspended
   vocal folds were also used to estimate the distribution of the initial
   prephonatory strain field. An isotropic constitutive law, the polymer
   eight-chain model, was used to estimate the surface distributions of
   planar stresses from the strain data.
   Results. The Lagrangian normal strain values were between similar to
   16\% and similar to 29\% along the anterior-posterior direction. The
   motion of material points on the vocal fold surface described an
   elliptical trajectory during oscillation. A phase difference was
   observed between the anterior-posterior and the medial-lateral component
   of the displacement. The strain data and eight-chain model yielded a
   maximum stress of similar to 4 kPa along the medial-lateral direction on
   the superior surface.
   Conclusion. DIC allowed the strain field over the superior surface of an
   excised porcine larynx to be quantified during self-oscillation. The
   approach allowed the determination of the trajectory of specific points
   on the vocal fold surface. The results for the excised larynx were found
   to be significantly different than previous results obtained using
   synthetic replicas. The present study provides suggestions for future
   studies in human subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) computer models of the human larynx are useful
   tools for research and for eventual clinical applications. Recently,
   computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   have been used to recreate realistic models of human larynx. In the
   present study, CT images were used to create computer models of vocal
   folds, vocal tract, and laryngeal cartilages, and the procedure to
   create solid models are explained in details. Vocal fold and vocal tract
   3D models of healthy and postsurgery larynges during phonation and
   respiration were created and morphometric parameters were quantified.
   The laryngeal framework of eight patients was also reconstructed from CT
   scan images. For each cartilage, morphometric landmarks were measured on
   the basis of their importance for biomechanical modeling. A quantitative
   comparison was made between measured values from the reconstructions and
   those from human excised larynges in literature. The good agreement
   between these measurements supports the accuracy of CT scan-based 3D
   models. Generic standard models of the laryngeal framework were created
   using known features in modeling softwares. They were created based on
   the morphometric landmark dimensions previously defined, preserving all
   biomechanically important dimensions. These models are accessible,
   subject independent, easy to use for computational simulations, and make
   the comparisons between different studies possible.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the carrier injection process of axial nanowire
   light-emitting diode (LED) structures and identified that poor carrier
   injection efficiency, due to the large surface recombination, is the
   primary cause for the extremely low output power of phosphor-free
   nanowire white LEDs. We have further developed InGaN/GaN/AlGaN
   dot-in-a-wire core-shell white LEDs on Si substrate, which can break the
   carrier injection efficiency bottleneck, leading to a massive
   enhancement in the output power. At room temperature, the devices can
   exhibit an output power of similar to 1.5 mW, which is more than 2
   orders of magnitude stronger than nanowire LEDs without shell coverage.
   Additionally, such phosphor-free nanowire white LEDs can deliver an
   unprecedentedly high color rendering index of similar to 92-98 in both
   the warm and cool white regions, with the color rendering capability
   approaching that of an ideal light source, i.e. a blackbody.}},

Abstract = {{In this Letter, we demonstrate that with the merit of nanowire structure
   and a self-catalytic growth process p-type InN can be realized for the
   first time by ``direct{''} magnesium (Mg) doping. The presence of Mg
   acceptor energy levels in InN is confirmed by photoluminescence
   experiments, and a direct evidence of p-type conduction is demonstrated
   unambiguously by studying the transfer characteristics of InN nanowire
   field effect transistors. Moreover, the near-urface Fermi-level of InN
   can be tuned from nearly intrinsic to p-type degenerate by controlling
   Mg dopant incorporation, which is in contrast to the commonly observed
   electron accumulation on the grown surfaces of Mg-doped InN films.
   First-principle calculation using the VASP electronic package further
   shows that the p-type surface formed on Mg-doped InN nanowires is highly
   stable energetically.}},

Abstract = {{In p-adaptive finite element analysis, the large, sparse matrix that
   arises can be block structured according to the hierarchical level of
   the unknowns. A multilevel preconditioner for the matrix is a V-cycle
   that starts by applying Gauss-Seidel to the highest level, then the next
   level down, and so on. On the other side of the V, Gauss-Seidel is
   applied in the reverse order. At the bottom of the V is the lowest order
   system, which typically is solved exactly with a direct solver. However,
   for a complex geometry even the lowest order system may be too large for
   direct factorization. Here an alternative is proposed: to continue the
   V-cycle downwards, first into a set of auxiliary, node-based spaces,
   then through a series of progressively smaller matrices generated by an
   algebraic multigrid method. The smallest matrix is solved by
   factorization. The method is applied to p-adaptive analysis of a
   five-resonator iris filter, a split-ring resonator loaded waveguide, a
   ``buckyball{''} metallic frame surrounding a conducting sphere, and a
   non-commensurate frequency selective surface. Tetrahedral elements up to
   fourth order are used. The largest matrix has over 12 million rows and
   0.6 billion nonzero entries.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadium doped titanium dioxide (V-TiO2) photocatalyst was synthesized
   by the sol-gel method using ammonium vanadate as vanadium source. The
   prepared samples were characterized by XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption
   method, UV-Vis DRS, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron
   microscope-energy dispersive X-ray and photoluminescence (PL) analysis.
   The results show that V5+ ions were successfully incorporated into the
   crystal lattice of TiO2 as a consequence, not only an obvious decrease
   in the band gap and a red shift of the absorption threshold into the
   visible light region was recorded for the V modified TiO2, but, also a
   decrease in photogenerated electrons and holes recombination rate was
   observed as demonstrated by PL analysis. FTIR study indicated that in
   undoped TiO2 sample the acetate group favored a bidentate bridging mode
   of binding with titanium atoms, whereas a bidentate chelating mode of
   linkage was observed in V-TiO2 powders. The crystallite size of the
   samples calcined at 300 and 500 A degrees C were decreased beyond the
   molar ratio of 200:1 (V:Ti), this may be due to dopant presence in the
   grain boundaries hindering the crystal growth. The photocatalytic
   activities for both pure and vanadium doped TiO2 powders were tested in
   the discoloration of a reactive dyestuff, methylene blue, under visible
   light. The 100:1 (V:Ti) doped photocatalyst, calcined at 300 A degrees C
   showed enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light with a rate
   constant (k(obs)) of 5.024 x 10(-3) min(-1) which is nearly five times
   higher than that of pure TiO2, as result of low band gap value, high
   specific surface area and a decrease in recombination rate.}},

Abstract = {{High speed serial interfaces (HSSI) are continually pushed toward
   operating at higher speed to meet the demand for higher bandwidth. As a
   result, the timing constraints for HSSI devices get tighter.
   Consequently, HSSI devices experience issues such as timing jitter and
   bit-errors. This paper investigates techniques to speed up HSSI
   bit-error rate and jitter testing. The proposed oversampling-based
   transmitter test scheme accelerates transmitter jitter and eye diagram
   testing by means of a multi-phase bit-error rate test circuit (BERT).
   The proposed scheme creates parallel BERT elements working in
   conjunction that are able to digitize the input signal jitter behavior
   in a multi-phase manner. The more phases we deploy the faster the test
   is completed. We accurately extract the transmitter jitter in time
   domain and finish the whole transmitter test within tens of
   milliseconds, exceeding the current norm of 100 ms.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, preclinical studies have shown that allogeneic adipose-derived
   stem cells (ASCs), like bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell
   (BMSCs) have significant clinical benefits in treating cardiovascular
   diseases, such as ischemic/infarcted heart. In this study, we tested
   whether ASCs are also immune tolerant, such that they can be used as
   universal donor cells for myocardial regenerative therapy. The study
   also focuses on investigating the potential therapeutic effects of human
   ASCs (hASCs) for myocardial infarction in xenotransplant model, and
   compares its effects with that of hBMSCs. The in vitro study confirms
   the superior proliferation potential and viability of hASCs under
   normoxic and stressed hypoxic conditions compared with hBMSCs. hASCs
   also show higher potential in adopting cardiomyocyte phenotype. The
   major findings of the in vivo study are that (1) both hASCs and hBMSCs
   implanted into immunocompetent rat hearts with acute myocardial
   infarction survived the extreme environment of xenogeneic mismatch for 6
   weeks; (2) both hASCs and hBMSCs showed significant improvement in
   myocardial pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine levels with no detectable
   inflammatory reaction, despite the lack of any immunosuppressive
   therapy; and (3) hASCs contributed to the remarkable improvement in
   cardiac function and reduced infarction which was significantly better
   than that of hBMSC and untreated control groups. Thus, our findings
   suggest the feasibility of using ASCs, instead of BMSCs, as universal
   donor cells for xenogeneic or allogeneic cell therapy.}},

   assigning proper nonlinear neural computations at the premotor level,
   the model is capable of replicating target-distance-dependent VOR
   responses that are in agreement with geometrical requirements. Central
   premotor responses in the model are also shown to be consistent with

Abstract = {{Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problems are essential
   tools to transmission system operators for long-term and operational
   planning and real-time operation. The general goal of SCOPF problems is
   to optimize electricity network operation while ensuring that
   operational and planning decisions are consistent with technical limits
   under both pre- and post-contingency states. The solution of SCOPF
   problems is challenging because of the inherent size and scope of modern
   grids. As empirical evidence and longstanding operator experience show,
   relatively few of the constraints of SCOPF problems actually serve to
   enclose their feasible region. Hence, all those constraints not
   contributing directly to set up the SCOPF feasible space are superfluous
   and could be discarded. In light of this observation, this paper
   proposes an optimization-based approach for identifying so-called
   umbrella constraints in SCOPF problems where the network operation is
   approximated by the dc power flow. Umbrella constraints are constraints
   which are necessary and sufficient to the description of the feasible
   set of an SCOPF problem. The resulting umbrella constraint discovery
   problem (UCD) is a convex optimization problem with a linear objective
   function. For SCOPF problems of practical importance, the UCD is also
   quite large and requires the use of a decomposition technique. In this
   paper, we concentrate on an SCOPF formulation for preventive security
   generation dispatch. We show that by removing superfluous constraints,
   the resulting sizes of SCOPF problems are much smaller and can be solved
   significantly faster.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper investigates the effective application of phasor
   measurement units (PMUs) with different technologies and filtering
   dynamics to the design of wide-area power system stabilizer (WAPSS). Two
   frequency-adaptive PMU algorithms shown to exceed the C37.118 class-M
   requirements based on FIR-and Kalman-bandpass filtering are selected for
   study. Their sharp dynamic differences are characterized using accurate
   fourth-order transfer functions derived from step responses using system
   identification techniques. While FIR-based PMUs have no overshoot in
   their phase and amplitude step responses, the adaptive Kalman filter
   allows for better out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a
   phase step response with overshoot and a higher computational burden.
   These PMUs are implemented in Simulink and then embedded in
   electro-magnetic transients (EMT) simulations to experiment the
   realistic WAPSS behavior with the discrete-time devices in the loop. It
   is shown that WAPSSs with optimized settings can improve the damping
   performance of EMT models of a test system and a simplified Hydro-Quebec
   network including PMU filtering dynamics and transmission delays.
   However, WAPSSs based on EKF-PMUs yielded better performances, thanks to
   their shorter group delay compared with FIR-PMUs. PMU devices and
   algorithms meeting standard C37-118 can thus behave quite differently
   under stressed dynamics.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{The discrete orthogonal wavelet-Galerkin method is illustrated as an
   effective method for solving partial differential equations (PDE's) with
   spatially varying parameters on a bounded interval. Daubechies scaling
   functions provide a concise but adaptable set of basis functions and
   allow for implementation of varied loading and boundary conditions.
   These basis functions can also effectively describe C-0 continuous
   parameter spatial dependence on bounded domains. Doing so allows the PDE
   to be discretized as a set of linear equations composed of known inner
   products which can be stored for efficient parametric analyses. Solution
   schemes for both free and forced PDE's are developed; natural
   frequencies, mode shapes, and frequency response functions for an
   Euler-Bernoulli beam with piecewise varying thickness are calculated.
   The wavelet-Galerkin approach is shown to converge to the first four
   natural frequencies at a rate greater than that of the linear finite
   element approach; mode shapes and frequency response functions converge
   similarly.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering adhesive joints are being increasingly used in industry
   because of the advantages they offer over other joining methods such as
   fastening or welding. The development and the use of adhesives in a
   design environment require accurate mechanical tests in order to measure
   their strength and toughness. Standard techniques such as the shear lap
   test are commonly used to measure shear strength, but the results they
   produce generally depend on geometry and on initial defects within the
   bond line. Fracture tests such as the double cantilever beam (DCB) tests
   overcome these limitations, but rely on elasticity models and
   assumptions to determine toughness. In this study, we present a novel
   technique to directly determine the mode I fracture toughness of
   engineering adhesive joints as well as their full cohesive law, without
   any initial assumption on its shape. Our new method is remarkably simple
   in terms of experimental setup, execution and analysis. It is similar to
   the standard double cantilever beam (DCB) test with the difference that
   the material and dimensions of the beams are chosen so that they are
   assumed to be rigid compared to the bond line. In this rigid DCB (RDCB)
   technique the crack opening is known everywhere along the interface,
   which we use to compute the cohesive law of the adhesive directly from
   the load-displacement data obtained from experiment and the geometry of
   the RDCB specimen. The RDCB method is validated and applied to three
   typical commercial adhesives (polyurethane, epoxy, and silicone), to
   determine their cohesive law and fracture toughness.}},

Abstract = {{Reasonable borehole spacing is one of important measures to reduce gas
   content of coal seam and number of drilling holes. Based on the gas
   geological data in Sihe mine, combined with the method of structure
   curvature, of distinguishing coal body structure by well logging and of
   testing stress-strain-permeability in experiment and so on, the
   corresponding relationships among the permeability of the coal seam,
   coal body structure and the structure curvature were gained.
   Based on these studies, according to the motherboard contour line in
   3304 working face, the permeability distribution law in working face was
   predicted. Based on the law of conservation of energy and Darcy's law,
   the mathematical model of influent radius under different extraction
   pressure, extraction time, permeability, gas pressure and aperture was
   established. According to the results of permeability prediction and the
   mathematical model of influent radius, the reasonable borehole spacing
   in different areas of the working face was determined. Field practice
   showed that this method determined the drilling holes spacing by size of
   the osmotic coefficient can reduce the amplitude of variation of the gas
   emission and reduce the number of drilling hole. It can be used as a
   theoretical guidance to determine borehole spacing in others similar

Abstract = {{Objectives: Oral health is influenced by the mouth's resident
   microorganisms. Dental caries and periodontitis are oral disorders
   caused by imbalances in the oral microbiota. Probiotics have potential
   for the prevention and treatment of oral disorders. Current
   formulations, including supplements and foods, have limitations for oral
   delivery including short storage time, low residence time in the mouth,
   effects on food consistency, and low patient compliance. Oral thin films
   (OTFs) may be efficient in delivering probiotics to the mouth. This
   research aims to develop a novel carboxymethyl cellulose
   (CMC)-probiotic-OTF to deliver probiotics for the treatment/prevention
   of oral disorders.
   Methods: CMC-OTFs were developed with varying CMC concentration (1.25 -
   10 mg/mL), weight (5 - 40 g), thickness (16 - 262 mu m), hygroscopicity
   (30.8 - 78.9 mg/cm(2) film), and dissolving time (135 - 600 s). The 10 g
   5 mg/mL CMC-OTF was selected and used to incorporate Lactobacillus
   fermentum NCIMB 5221 (6.75 x 10(8) cells/film), a probiotic with
   anti-inflammatory potential for periodontitis treatment and capable of
   inhibiting microorganisms responsible for dental caries and oral
   candidiasis.
   Results: The CMC-OTF maintained probiotic viability and antioxidant
   activity following 150 days of storage with a production of 549.52 -
   26.08 mu M Trolox equivalents.
   Conclusion: This research shows the successful development and
   characterization of a novel probiotic-CMC-OTF with potential as an oral
   health biotherapeutic.}},

Title = {{An experimental and reduced modeling study of the laminar flame speed of
   jet fuel surrogate components}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{586-597}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The laminar flame speed is an essential combustion parameter used in the
   validation of chemical kinetic mechanisms. In recent years, mechanisms
   tailored for jet fuel surrogate components have been partially validated
   using the laminar flame speeds of pure components, which were derived
   using both linear and non-linear extrapolation techniques. However,
   there remain significant deviations between the results from different
   studies that motivate further investigation. In this study, laminar,
   atmospheric pressure, premixed stagnation flames are investigated for
   the surrogate fuels n-decane, methylcyclohexane and toluene, which are
   representative of the alkane, cycloalkane and aromatic components of
   conventional aviation fuel, respectively. Numerical simulations are
   directly compared to velocity profile measurements to assess the
   predictive capabilities of the recently proposed JetSurF 2.0 chemical
   kinetic mechanism. Simulations of each experiment are carried out using
   the CHEMKIN-PRO software package together with the detailed mechanism,
   with accurate specification of the necessary boundary conditions from
   experimental measurements. Furthermore, a skeletal version of the
   detailed mechanism is deduced for improved computational speed using a
   species sensitivity reduction method, here referred to as Alternate
   Species Elimination (ASE). Toluene experimental data are further
   compared to a detailed toluene mechanism, termed the Stanford mechanism.
   The experimental and numerical reference flame speeds are used to infer
   the true laminar flame speed of the compounds following a recently
   proposed direct comparison technique that is similar to a non-linear
   extrapolation to zero flame stretch. JetSurF 2.0 and the skeletal ASE
   mechanisms demonstrate excellent overall agreement with experiment for
   n-decane and methylcyclohexane flames, for which the original model was
   optimized, but poor agreement for toluene, which was not an optimization
   target. Improved agreement for toluene is observed between the Stanford
   mechanism and experiment. Results confirm that the direct comparison
   method yields consistent laminar flame speed data irrespective of the
   reactivity accuracy of the chemical kinetic model employed. The laminar
   flame speed results from this study are essential for the further
   development of chemical kinetic mechanisms and contribute to the
   surrogate modeling of jet fuel combustion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-pole-type cavity
   structure to force single longitudinal mode (SLM) operation in fiber
   lasers. The proposed structure is based on the modified version of the
   Smith predictor, which compensates delay in a closed-loop feedback
   system. This structure is applicable to arbitrary wavelengths and gain
   media, does not limit the tunability range of the laser, and does not
   require few centimeters long loops or Fabry-Perot tunable filters to
   achieve SLM operation. Thus, the major drawbacks of the conventional SLM
   forcing mechanisms are alleviated. Therefore, this structure can be
   considered as a universal approach to SLM operation in fiber lasers. To
   exemplify this structure, an erbium-doped fiber ring laser in
   continuous-wave mode is implemented. The SLM operation is confirmed from
   the RF spectrum over a 10 GHz bandwidth, and the laser is tunable over
   62 nm from 1512 to 1574 nm}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural production is a significant contributor to the economy of
   Jamaica, which is situated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea; this
   production is heavily dependent on seasonal rainfall because only
   approximately 10\% of Jamaica's cultivated lands are irrigated. Drought
   is a disastrous natural phenomenon that has a significant impact on
   socioeconomics, agriculture, and the environment. In the 2000-2001
   drought experienced in Jamaica, there were crop losses amounting up to
   US\$6million. Hence, drought index information is essential for better
   planning for drought impacts and allows for the introduction of
   mitigation measures in the agricultural sector. Therefore, the objective
   of this paper is to evaluate the suitability of both the Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) in reflecting water stressed conditions and irrigation demand
   requirements for three agricultural sites: Savanna-la-Mar in the parish
   of Westmoreland, Beckford Kraal in the parish of Clarendon, and Serge
   Island in the parish of St. Thomas, all in Jamaica. These sites were
   selected based on soil characteristics, historical rainfall data, and
   farming practices. The results indicate that the NDVI provides a
   suitable representation of these areas for only the driest months of the
   year, and that either the one-month or three-month SPI was found to be
   more representative of soil moisture conditions. Furthermore, a
   correlation analysis was also conducted between the SPI and soil
   moisture for El Nino years only, because the El Nino/Southern
   Oscillation phenomenon has been responsible for many of the droughts
   Jamaica has experienced. In these years, good correlations between soil
   moisture and the one-month and three-month SPI were obtained in some wet
   months, in addition to the dry months. This paper provides soil moisture
   values for all of the different categories and values of the SPI
   relating to water scarcity. It also provides irrigation requirements for
   the moderately dry and severely dry SPI drought categories.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the nonlinear resonant behavior of a
   microbeam over its buckled (non-trivial) configuration. The system is
   assumed to be subjected to an axial load along with a distributed
   transverse harmonic load. The axial load is increased leading the system
   to lose the stability via a pitchfork bifurcation; the postbuckling
   configuration is obtained and the nonlinear resonant response of the
   system over the buckled state is examined. More specifically, the
   nonlinear equation of motion is obtained employing Hamilton's principle
   along with the modified couple stress theory. The continuous system is
   truncated into a system with finite degrees of freedom; the Galerkin
   scheme is employed to discretize the nonlinear partial differential
   equation of motion into a set of ordinary differential equations. This
   set of equations is solved numerically employing the pseudo-arclength
   continuation technique; first a nonlinear static analysis is performed
   upon this set of equations so as to obtain the onset of buckling
   (supercritical pitchfork bifurcation) and the buckled configuration of
   the microbeam. The frequency-response and force-response curves of the
   system are then constructed over the buckled configurations. A
   comparison is made between the frequency-response curves obtained by
   means of the modified couple stress and the classical theories. The
   effect of different system parameters on the frequency-response and
   force-response curves is also examined.}},

   behavior in the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium

Abstract = {{Accurate predictive models can support the exploitation of Polymer-Clay
   Nanocomposites (PCN) in their evergrowing applications. The purpose of
   this paper is to validate commonly used analytical micromechanical
   models for the prediction of PCN's elastic properties with the help of
   3D periodic Finite Element (FE) simulations of the same microstructures,
   considered as reference data. The effect of the interphase was taken
   into account in a two-step homogenization procedure that exploits the
   effective particle concept. The predictions of a range of procedures
   relying on the different micromechanical models (i.e. Mori-Tanaka,
   self-consistent and Lielens's) were tested. An elaborate series of FE
   simulations was performed to determine Representative Volume Elements
   (RVEs). In addition, a simplified procedure to guide the definition of
   the RVE based on statistical and transverse isotropy symmetry criteria
   was developed. The predicted elastic properties of PCN were studied as a
   function of the thickness and the elastic properties of the formed
   interphase around the nanoclay platelets. It was found that the
   Mori-Tanaka model was the most reliable method for the simulated cases.
   Furthermore, numerical model predictions were compared with experimental
   results extracted from the literature for aligned exfoliated Nylon-6
   Montmorillonite nanocomposites. Finally, a comparison between the
   parametric study results and the experimental data was used to estimate
   the properties and the thickness of the interphase. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{A matched asymptotic analysis is used to establish the correspondence
   between an appropriately scaled version of the governing equations of a
   phase-field model for fracture and the equations of the two-dimensional
   sharp-crack theory of Gurtin and Podio-Guidugli (1996) that arise on
   assuming that the bulk constitutive behavior is nonlinearly elastic,
   requiring that surface energy provides the only factor limiting crack
   propagation, and assuming that the fracture kinetics are isotropic.
   Consistent with the prominence of the configurational momentum balance
   at the crack tip in the latter theory, the approach capitalizes on the
   configurational momentum balance that arises naturally in the context of
   the phase-field model. The model developed and utilized here
   incorporates irreversibility of the phase-field evolution. This is
   achieved by introducing a suitable constraint and by carefully heeding
   the influence of that constraint on the kinetics underlying
   microstructural changes associated with fracture. The analysis is
   predicated on the assumption that the phase-field variable takes values
   in the closed interval between zero and unity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{284}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This work examines the fog-harvesting ability of patterned and
   non-patterned samples in spray chamber experiments. The samples were
   prepared from different materials and the patterns under investigation
   were channels, hydrophobic patches and hydrophilic patches of
   contrasting wettability to mimic and optimize the alleged natural
   fog-harvesting ability of the Stenocara beetle. Fog-harvesting results
   based on the amount of collected water showed no significant differences
   among all samples, as the influence of ``wind{''} was found to be the
   more dominant factor compared to the samples' wetting characteristics.
   Video analysis of the experiments, however, revealed differences in the
   water collection and water removal mechanisms and were concluded to be
   more helpful than water collection results in the assessment of the
   various competing mechanisms in fog-harvesting experiments. The analysis
   with regard to surface wettability is based on drop rolling on the
   surface and roll-off into air, respectively. All patterned and most
   non-patterned samples exhibited drop motion by coalescence rather than
   rolling. Larger coalesced drops of non-spherical shape with irregular
   triple line shapes span the surface pattern on all our surfaces, which
   suggests that the underlying pattern of the surface has no dominant
   effect on the behavior of the droplets on these surfaces. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The ignition characteristics of boron particle agglomerates prepared by
   drying 2-3 mm water slurry droplets of crystalline or amorphous boron
   powders were investigated by introducing suspended agglomerates into a
   flow of high temperature oxidizing gases (oxygen/nitrogen/water vapor)
   obtained by a combination of combustion and electrical heating.
   Monitoring of the agglomerate luminosity, spectra, and temperature
   revealed a dual-stage ignition process. The first stage ignition was
   observed at flow temperatures as low as 715 K and was followed by
   agglomerate quenching if the oxygen concentration in the flow was below
   some critical value. As the oxygen concentration of the flow was
   increased beyond this critical value, the second stage ignition leading
   to full-fledge combustion was observed. The ignition characteristics of
   boron particle agglomerates were theoretically investigated by
   developing a numerical model that considers the oxygen concentration
   gradient inside the agglomerate in order to simulate the ignition
   process. The model results accurately captured the qualitative behavior
   of the first stage ignition and quenching as well as the dual-stage
   ignition processes. The model identified the closure of pores in the
   agglomerate due to the build-up of the boron oxide layer, which
   effectively seals off the large interior surface area of the agglomerate
   from the oxidizer, as being the mechanism responsible for the two-stage
   ignition phenomenon. The critical flow conditions in terms of flow
   temperature and ambient oxygen concentration for the second stage
   ignition were determined by this model. The experimental result for the
   critical ambient oxygen concentration for the second stage ignition in
   dry flow was determined to be 70\%, which is fairly close to the model
   prediction of 79\%. (c) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published by

   equations and by using classical and higher-order shear deformation

   are expanded in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and a linear analysis is
   performed to obtain the natural frequencies and modes of vibration.
   Then, the energy functional is discretized by using the natural modes of
   vibration and a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with
   quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms is obtained. A code based on pseudo
   arc-length continuation and collocation scheme is used for bifurcation
   analysis and the near resonance nonlinear vibrations are studied. The

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a novel method for the design of oversampled
   perfect reconstruction (PR) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) modulated
   filter banks (FB) for application to multi-carrier modulation (MCM). The
   PR property is enforced by employing a parametric class of paraunitary
   matrices to form the transmit/receive polyphase filters of the
   transceiver system. Specifically, the polyphase filters are formed by
   cascading special types of paraunitary matrices characterized by a
   limited set of design parameters. To reduce the number of these
   parameters, three different factorization methods are employed and
   compared. Through the optimization of these design parameters, the
   stop-band energy of the subband filters can be minimized which leads to
   improved spectral containment. The performance of the proposed system is
   investigated in a multi-carrier transceiver application, where it is
   compared with OFDM and other recently proposed FB structures. Numerical
   results show that the proposed scheme leads to a clear advantage not
   only in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and frequency selective
   channels, but also in the presence of channel impairments such as narrow
   band interference or carrier frequency offset. In particular, it is
   found that a significant reduction in the bit error rate can be achieved
   by employing the proposed scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We analyze epitaxially grown InGaN/GaN dot-in-a-wire heterostructures to
   relate growth and design properties to trends seen in photoluminescence
   (PL) and resonance Raman spectra. Temperature-dependent PL measurement
   of these dot-in-a-wire heterostructures illustrate an expected decrease
   in integrated PL emission and an unusual narrowing of peak width with
   increasing temperature. Information extracted from Resonance Raman
   spectra was utilized in a time-dependent model to analyze and to
   simulate PL spectra. These spectra were found to be in good agreement
   with the experimental PL data and provided insight into the broadening
   mechanisms affecting the samples. PL measurements were taken as a
   function of position on the sample and radial variation of peak energies
   was observed. This variation was attributed to the radial temperature
   gradient present during nanowire growth. These additional
   characteristics of the nanowire heterostructures will allow for
   increased understanding of these systems potentials for applications in
   white light emitting diodes. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Important factors that can influence interpretation of the pulse tests
   include the compressibility and viscosity of the fluid that either
   saturates the pore space of the rock or is used to pressurize the
   chamber, which generates the pressure pulse. Fluid compressibility can
   be influenced by entrained air. This paper examines theoretically, the
   influence of compressibility and viscosity variations in both the
   interstitial pore water and within the pressurizing chamber, on the
   performance of the hydraulic pulse test. Convenient analytical results
   can be derived to account for variations in compressibility and
   viscosity resulting from entrained air. Theoretical results indicate
   that the entrained gas content can have an appreciable influence on the
   pressure decay curves, and particularly high volume fractions of the
   entrained air can influence the estimation of the permeability from
   hydraulic pulse tests. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of
   the influence of dissolved air on the performance of pulse tests. Crown

Abstract = {{The compression tests were carried out on AZ31 magnesium alloy samples
   at temperatures from 300 to 450 degrees C and strain rates of 0.03-0.3

   the volume fractions recrystallized were determined as a function of
   strain and temperature. The flow curves were analyzed using the double
   differentiation method and double minima were detected on all the
   curves. The first set of minima is shown to identify the critical strain
   for twinning, while the second set indicates the critical strain for the
   initiation of dynamic recrystallization. The texture analysis and EBSD
   results indicate that flow softening is mainly caused by the grain
   reorientations brought about by twinning. The remainder of the flow
   softening is associated with the volume fraction recrystallized. The
   microstructure analysis shows that the volume fraction recrystallized
   does not approach its asymptotic value of one even during steady state
   flow. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and mechanical properties of gold nanorods and their
   interactions with alkenthiolate self-assembled monolayers have been
   determined using a novel first-principle density functional theory
   simulation approach. The multifaceted, 1-dimensional, octagonal nanorod
   has alternate Au100 and Au110 surfaces. The structural optimization of
   the gold nanorods was performed with a mixed basis: the outer-most layer
   of gold atoms used double-zeta plus polarization (DZP), the layer below
   used double-zeta (DZ), and the inner layers used single-zeta (SZ). The
   final structure compares favorably with simulations using DZP for all
   atoms. Phonon dispersion calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics
   (AIMD) were used to establish the dynamic and thermal stability of the
   system. From the AIMD simulations it was found that the nanorod system
   will undergo significant surface reconstruction at 300 K. In addition,
   when subjected to mechanical stress in the axial direction, the nanorod
   responds as an orthotropic material, with uniform expansion along the
   radial direction. The Young's moduli are 207 kbar in the axial direction
   and 631 kbar in the radial direction. The binding of alkanethiolates,
   ranging from methanethiol to pentanethiol, caused formation of surface
   point defects on the Au110 surfaces. On the Au100 surfaces, the defects
   occurred in the inner layer, creating a small surface island. These
   defects make positive and negative concavities on the gold nanorod
   surface, which helps the ligand to achieve a more stable state. The
   simulation results narrowed significant knowledge gaps on the
   alkanethiolate adsorption process and on their mutual interactions on
   gold nanorods. The mechanical characterization offers a new dimension to
   understand the physical chemistry of these complex nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing use of quantum dots (QDs) makes it necessary to evaluate
   their toxicological impacts on aquatic organisms, since their
   contamination of surface water is inevitable. This study compares the
   genotoxic effects of ionic Cd versus CdTe nanocrystals in zebrafish
   hepatocytes. After 24 h of CdSO4 or CdTe QD exposure, zebrafish liver
   (ZFL) cells showed a decreased number of viable cells, an accumulation
   of Cd, an increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and an
   induction of DNA strand breaks. Measured levels of stress defense and
   DNA repair genes were elevated in both cases. However, removal of bulky
   DNA adducts by nucleotide excision repair (NER) was inhibited with CdSO4
   but not with CdTe QDs. The adverse effects caused by acute exposure of
   CdTe QDs might be mediated through differing mechanisms than those
   resulting from ionic cadmium toxicity, and studying the effects of
   metallic components may be not enough to explain QD toxicities in
   aquatic organisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotitania/metal oxide composite films are prepared via the coupling of
   low DC voltage Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD) of P25 TiO2
   nanoparticles with simultaneous electrolytic deposition of hydrous metal
   oxides, namely ZnO, MgO and Al2O3. The nanocomposite films are built
   into dye-sensitized solar cell photoanodes and their interfacial charge
   recombination and electronic resistances are investigated. The nano
   hydrous oxides were found to co-deposit (1-3 wt\%) uniformly within the
   TiO2 film (forming island-like nanodeposits) significantly increasing
   film adhesion. Analysis via Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and
   Open Circuit Voltage Decay techniques found, among the three composite
   films, the TiO2-Al2O3 electrode to exhibit the highest charge
   recombination resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface (R-rec) and
   as consequence an increase in V-oc. However, its conversion efficiency
   (4.14\%) was the lowest because it suffered from very high electron
   transport resistance (R-t) in the TiO2 network. By comparison, the
   TiO2-MgO film resulted in 5.40\% efficiency and the TiO2 ZnO film in
   5.85\% efficiency-both exhibiting significantly lower Re resistance. The
   obtained results point to the need for simultaneous optimization of the
   nanocomposite TiO2/metal oxide film structure in terms of high
   interfacial charge recombination resistance and low overall electron
   transport resistance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method is introduced for ultrahigh throughput and ultralow cost
   patterning of biomolecules with nanometer resolution and novel 2D
   digital nanodot gradients (DNGs) with mathematically defined slopes are

   using high-resolution photopolymer stamps that are rapidly produced at a
   low cost through double replication from Si originals. Printed patterns
   with 100 nm features are shown. DNGs with varying spacing between the
   dots and a record dynamic range of 4400 are produced; 64 unique DNGs,
   each with hundreds of thousands of dots, are inked and printed in 5.5
   min. The adhesive response and haptotaxis of C2C12 myoblast cells on
   DNGs demonstrated their biofunctionality. The great flexibility in
   pattern design, the massive parallel ability, the ultra low cost, and
   the extreme ease of polymer lift-off nanocontact printing will
   facilitate its use for various biological and medical applications.}},

Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{67-75}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Acoustic detection of pressure-induced spinodal phase separation is
   predicted using an integrated compressible polymer solution
   thermodynamic multi transport model and by calculating sound speed and
   attenuation under pressure conditions that gradually approach the
   pressure induced (PIPS) phase separation conditions from the stable
   state. The integrated model consists of the thermodynamic pressure
   concentration phase diagram computed using the Sanchez-Lacombe equation
   of state (polyethylene-hexane solution), momentum, mass and heat
   transport equations, and rheological constitutive equations for
   Newtonian and non Newtonian fluids. The linearized model results in two
   coupled density polymer concentration wave equations that describe the
   propagation of acoustic waves. Solving the set of equation leads to a
   six order polynomial that generalizes the Kirchhoff-Langevin biquadratic
   equation for an ideal single component gas, and that gives an expression
   for the attenuation and the phase velocity. For the Newtonian fluid, the
   behavior of the acoustic parameters, attenuation and phase velocity, is
   analyzed as a function of PIPS proximity and found to be sensitive at
   low frequency only. On the other hand for non Newtonian fluids
   viscoelastic relaxation leads to pressure sensitivity of acoustic
   properties at all frequencies and hence providing a robust method to
   detect PIPS. The results provide new insights On the coupling between
   acoustics and phase separation thermodynamics as well as provide useful
   scaling pressure-attenuation-speed relations of utility to polymer
   processing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   regime}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{129-138}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{The gas distribution between the dilute (bubble) and dense (emulsion)
   phases of a fluidized bed is studied locally and globally in the
   bubbling regime for mixtures composed of sand and different weight
   fractions of biomass (2-16\%). The dilute phase has been characterized
   by analyzing the pressure and voidage signals. A suite of pressure
   transducers was used to measure pressure fluctuations at different
   locations along the bed. A reflective optical probe measured local
   voidage signals and was placed at different radii (0 < r/R < 0.87) at a
   height of h=175 mm above the distributor plate. The mean voidage of the
   bed is increased with higher biomass loading, primarily because of
   dilution of the emulsion phase. Changing the quantity of biomass in the
   bed does not significantly affect the voidage of the bubble and emulsion
   phases. The void (bubble) fraction increases at the center of the bed,
   whereas it decreases and then increases at the wall region with
   increasing weight fraction of biomass. Higher quantities of biomass
   reduce the mean bubble size and boost the bubble frequency at the center
   of the bed. The core-annulus structure of the bed is intensified for
   mixtures with relatively low quantities of biomass, while increasing the
   biomass load leads to a more uniform distribution of small bubbles
   across the bed improving the fluidization quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{168}},

Pages = {{3920-3925}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the cumulative experience of a single operator
   using a strict set of deployment and release criteria for the Amplatzer
   Cardiac Plug T (ACP) and the impact of these criteria on procedural
   success and complications.
   Background: Following strong evidence that the left atrial appendage
   (LAA) is the site of the majority of thrombus formation within the left
   atriumin patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation,
   non-pharmacological approaches to LAA exclusion have been developed and
   shown to be effective.
   Methods: Procedural and in-hospital outcomes of LAA occlusion performed
   by or under the supervision of a single operator using the ACP T in 100
   anticoagulant ineligible patients with a high stroke risk were assessed.
   Results: One hundred patients with a mean CHADS(2) score of 3.21 +/-
   1.23 underwent catheterization for closure of LAA with the ACP T. The
   mean landing zone as assessed by TEE was 20.01 +/- 3.21 mm, and 20.8 +/-
   3.19 mm by fluoroscopy. The mean difference between the TEE and the
   fluoroscopic measurements was 0.8 +/- 1.13 mm. Device deployment was
   successful in 100/100 attempted cases with a mean deployed device size
   of 24.36 +/- 3.27 mm. Procedural complications were limited to a single
   case of pericardial tamponade and one post-procedural pulmonary edema
   both of which were adequately treated with no long-term sequelae.
   Conclusions: In this single operator report, LAA occlusion using the
   double element ACP T can be safely performed with excellent success
   rates. Using very specific deployment success, stability and release
   criteria, this device can achieve LAA occlusion with extremely low
   complication rates in an extremely frail oral anticoagulant ineligible
   population with multiple co-morbidities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The proteins involved in smooth muscle's molecular contractile mechanism
   - the anti-parallel motion of actin and myosin filaments driven by
   myosin heads interacting with actin - are found as different isoforms.
   While their expression levels are altered in disease states, their
   relevance to the mechanical interaction of myosin with actin is not
   sufficiently understood. Here, we analyzed in vitro actin filament
   propulsion by smooth muscle myosin for alpha-actin (alpha A),
   alpha-actin-tropomyosin-alpha beta (alpha A-Tm alpha beta),
   alpha-actin-tropomyosin-beta (alpha A-Tm beta), gamma-actin (gamma A),
   gamma-actin-tropomyosin-alpha beta (gamma A-Tm alpha beta), and
   gamma-actin-tropomoysin-beta (gamma A-Tm beta). Actin sliding analysis
   with our specifically developed video analysis software followed by
   statistical assessment (Bootstrapped Principal Component Analysis)
   indicated that the in vitro motility of alpha A, gamma A, and gamma A-Tm
   alpha beta is not distinguishable. Compared to these three `baseline
   conditions', statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were: alpha
   A-Tm alpha beta - actin sliding velocity increased 1.12-fold, gamma A-Tm
   beta - motile fraction decreased to 0.96-fold, stop time elevated
   1.6-fold, alpha A-Tm beta - run time elevated 1.7-fold. We constructed a
   mathematical model, simulated actin sliding data, and adjusted the
   kinetic parameters so as to mimic the experimentally observed
   differences: alpha A-Tm alpha beta - myosin binding to actin, the main,
   and the secondary myosin power stroke are accelerated, gamma A-Tm beta -
   mechanical coupling between myosins is stronger, alpha A-Tmb beta - the
   secondary power stroke is decelerated and mechanical coupling between
   myosins is weaker. In summary, our results explain the different
   regulatory effects that specific combinations of actin and smooth muscle
   tropomyosin have on smooth muscle actin-myosin interaction kinetics.}},

Title = {{Assessing regional groundwater stress for nations using multiple data
   sources with the groundwater footprint}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Groundwater is a critical resource for agricultural production,
   ecosystems, drinking water and industry, yet groundwater depletion is
   accelerating, especially in a number of agriculturally important
   regions. Assessing the stress of groundwater resources is crucial for
   science-based policy and management, yet water stress assessments have
   often neglected groundwater and used single data sources, which may
   underestimate the uncertainty of the assessment. We consistently analyze
   and interpret groundwater stress across whole nations using multiple
   data sources for the first time. We focus on two nations with the
   highest national groundwater abstraction rates in the world, the United
   States and India, and use the recently developed groundwater footprint
   and multiple datasets of groundwater recharge and withdrawal derived
   from hydrologic models and data synthesis. A minority of aquifers,
   mostly with known groundwater depletion, show groundwater stress
   regardless of the input dataset. The majority of aquifers are not
   stressed with any input data while less than a third are stressed for
   some input data. In both countries groundwater stress affects
   agriculturally important regions. In the United States, groundwater
   stress impacts a lower proportion of the national area and population,
   and is focused in regions with lower population and water well density
   compared to India. Importantly, the results indicate that the
   uncertainty is generally greater between datasets than within datasets
   and that much of the uncertainty is due to recharge estimates.
   Assessment of groundwater stress consistently across a nation and
   assessment of uncertainty using multiple datasets are critical for the
   development of a science-based rationale for policy and management,
   especially with regard to where and to what extent to focus limited
   research and management resources.}},

Abstract = {{A new hybrid wavelet-bootstrap-neural network (WBNN) model is proposed
   in this study for short term (1, 3, and 5 day; 1 and 2 week; and 1 and 2
   month) urban water demand forecasting. The new method was tested using
   data from the city of Montreal in Canada. The performance of the WBNN
   method was compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average
   (ARIMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average model with
   exogenous input variables (ARIMAX), traditional NNs, wavelet
   analysis-based NNs (WNN), bootstrap-based NNs (BNN), and a simple naive
   persistence index model. The WBNN model was developed as an ensemble of
   several NNs built using bootstrap resamples of wavelet subtime series
   instead of raw data sets. The results demonstrated that the hybrid WBNN
   and WNN models produced significantly more accurate forecasting results
   than the traditional NN, BNN, ARIMA, and ARIMAX models. It was also
   found that the WBNN model reduces the uncertainty associated with the
   forecasts, and the performance of WBNN forecasted confidence bands was
   found to be more accurate and reliable than BNN forecasted confidence
   bands. It was found in this study that maximum temperature and total
   precipitation improved the accuracy of water demand forecasts using
   wavelet analysis. The performance of WBNN models was also compared for
   different numbers of bootstrap resamples (i.e., 25, 50, 100, 200, and
   500) and it was found that WBNN models produced optimum results with
   different numbers of bootstrap resamples for different lead time
   forecasts with considerable variability.}},

   Bayesian modelling approach}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study proposes a two-equation Bayesian modelling approach to
   simultaneously study cyclist injury occurrence and bicycle activity at
   signalized intersections as joint outcomes. This approach deals with the
   potential presence of endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneities and is
   used to identify factors associated with both cyclist injuries and
   volumes. Its application to identify high-risk corridors is also
   illustrated. Montreal, Quebec, Canada is the application environment,
   using an extensive inventory of a large sample of signalized
   intersections containing disaggregate motor-vehicle traffic volumes and
   bicycle flows, geometric design, traffic control and built environment
   characteristics in the vicinity of the intersections. Cyclist injury
   data for the period of 2003-2008 is used in this study. Also, manual
   bicycle counts were standardized using temporal and weather adjustment
   factors to obtain average annual daily volumes. Results confirm and
   quantify the effects of both bicycle and motor-vehicle flows on cyclist
   injury occurrence. Accordingly, more cyclists at an intersection
   translate into more cyclist injuries but lower injury rates due to the
   non-linear association between bicycle volume and injury occurrence.
   Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of turning
   motor-vehicle movements. The presence of bus stops and total crosswalk
   length increase cyclist injury occurrence whereas the presence of a
   raised median has the opposite effect. Bicycle activity through
   intersections was found to increase as employment, number of metro
   stations, land use mix, area of commercial land use type, length of
   bicycle facilities and the presence of schools within 50-800 m of the
   intersection increase. Intersections with three approaches are expected
   to have fewer cyclists than those with four. Using Bayesian analysis,
   expected injury frequency and injury rates were estimated for each
   intersection and used to rank corridors. Corridors with high bicycle
   volumes, located mainly in the central neighbourhoods of Montreal, have
   lower risk of injury. These results may reflect the ``safety in
   numbers{''} hypothesis or cyclist preference towards safer intersections
   and corridors. Despite these corridors having a lower individual risk,
   they are nevertheless associated with a greater number of injuries. (C)

Title = {{Modeling vehicle operating speed on urban roads in Montreal: A panel
   mixed ordered probit fractional split model}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{125-134}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Vehicle operating speed measured on roadways is a critical component for
   a host of analysis in the transportation field including transportation
   safety, traffic flow modeling, roadway geometric design, vehicle
   emissions modeling, and road user route decisions. The current research
   effort contributes to the literature on examining vehicle speed on urban
   roads methodologically and substantively. In terms of methodology, we
   formulate a new econometric model framework for examining speed
   profiles. The proposed model is an ordered response formulation of a
   fractional split model. The ordered nature of the speed variable allows
   us to propose an ordered variant of the fractional split model in the
   literature. The proposed formulation allows us to model the proportion
   of vehicles traveling in each speed interval for the entire segment of
   roadway. We extend the model to allow the influence of exogenous
   variables to vary across the population. Further, we develop a panel
   mixed version of the fractional split model to account for the influence
   of site-specific unobserved effects. The paper contributes substantively
   by estimating the proposed model using a unique dataset from Montreal
   consisting of weekly speed data (collected in hourly intervals) for
   about 50 local roads and 70 arterial roads. We estimate separate models
   for local roads and arterial roads. The model estimation exercise
   considers a whole host of variables including geometric design
   attributes, roadway attributes, traffic characteristics and
   environmental factors. The model results highlight the role of various
   street characteristics including number of lanes, presence of parking,
   presence of sidewalks, vertical grade, and bicycle route on vehicle
   speed proportions. The results also highlight the presence of
   site-specific unobserved effects influencing the speed distribution. The
   parameters from the modeling exercise are validated using a hold-out
   sample not considered for model estimation. The results indicate that
   the proposed panel mixed ordered probit fractional split model offers
   promise for modeling such proportional ordinal variables. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the relevance of alternate discrete outcome
   frameworks for modeling driver injury severity. The study empirically
   compares the ordered response and unordered response models in the
   context of driver injury severity in traffic crashes. The alternative
   modeling approaches considered for the comparison exercise include: for
   the ordered response framework-ordered logit (OL), generalized ordered
   logit (GOL), mixed generalized ordered logit (MGOL) and for the
   unordered response framework-multinomial logit (MNL), nested logit (NL),
   ordered generalized extreme value logit (OGEV) and mixed multinomial
   logit (MMNL) model. A host of comparison metrics are computed to
   evaluate the performance of these alternative models. The study provides
   a comprehensive comparison exercise of the performance of ordered and
   unordered response models for examining the impact of exogenous factors
   on driver injury severity. The research also explores the effect of
   potential underreporting on alternative frameworks by artificially
   creating an underreported data sample from the driver injury severity
   sample. The empirical analysis is based on the 2010 General Estimates
   System (GES) data base-a nationally representative sample of road
   crashes collected and compiled from about 60 jurisdictions across the
   United States. The performance of the alternative frameworks are
   examined in the context of model estimation and validation (at the
   aggregate and disaggregate level). Further, the performance of the model
   frameworks in the presence of underreporting is explored, with and
   without corrections to the estimates. The results from these extensive
   analyses point toward the emergence of the GOL framework (MGOL) as a
   strong competitor to the MMNL model in modeling driver injury severity.

Title = {{Occurrence of scalp-fast oscillations among patients with different

Journal = {{EPILEPSY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{345-356}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: We aim to analyze the fast oscillations in the scalp EEG
   of focal epilepsy patients with low-to-high rates of interictal
   epileptiform discharges (IEDs), in order to determine how this
   neurophysiological feature influences fast oscillation occurrence and
   their significance as markers of the seizure onset zone (SOZ).
   Methods: Thirty-two patients were studied, subdivided in four categories
   based on IED frequency: groups A, B and C respectively with high,
   intermediate and low IED rate, and group D with no IED. Thirty minutes
   of slow-wave sleep EEG, low-pass filtered at 300 Hz and sampled at 1000
   Hz, were reviewed. IEDs and fast oscillations (gamma activity, 40-80 Hz;
   and ripples, >80 Hz) were marked. Each channel was classified as inside
   or outside the irritative zone and the SOZ. We calculated the number and
   rates of IEDs and fast oscillation, their co-occurrence, their frequency
   in the irritative zone and SOZ, and the specificity, sensitivity and
   accuracy to determine the SOZ in the overall population and separately
   for each group.
   Results: We analyzed 984 channels. Group A (high IED rate) showed the
   highest fast oscillation rate (gamma: 0.37 +/- 0.73; ripples: 0.17 +/-
   0.26), followed by group B (gamma: 0.08 +/- 0.06; ripples: 0.07 +/-
   0.05), group C (gamma: 0.06 +/- 0.06; ripples: 0.04 +/- 0.01), and
   finally group D, with very low values (gamma: 0.03 +/- 0; ripples: 0.03
   +/- 0). IEDs co-occurred with gamma in 9.5\% and with ripples in 3.2\%;
   and gamma and ripples co-occurred with IEDs in 46.2\% and 44.4\%,
   respectively. The fast oscillations were more frequent inside than
   outside the irritative zone and the SOZ (p < 0.001). Compared to the
   IEDs, the fast oscillations were less sensitive (sensitivity: IEDs 78\%,
   gamma 66\% and ripples 48\%) but more specific (specificity: IEDs 50\%,
   gamma 76\% and ripples 83\%) and accurate (accuracy: IEDs 54\%, gamma
   74\% and ripples 77\%) in identifying the SOZ; the same results were
   reproduced for the different groups separately.
   Conclusions: This study confirms that fast oscillations can be recorded
   from the scalp EEG. Gamma activity and ripples are more frequent in
   patients with frequent IEDs and, in general, inside the irritative zone.
   However, compared to IEDs, gamma and ripples are less sensitive but more
   specific and accurate in identifying the SOZ, and this remains in
   patients with low fast oscillation rates. These findings suggest that
   IEDs and fast oscillations could share some common neuronal network, but
   gamma activity and ripples are a better biomarker of epileptogenicity

Title = {{Modeling the Impacts of Spatial Heterogeneity in the Castor Watershed on
   Runoff, Sediment, and Phosphorus Loss Using SWAT: I. Impacts of Spatial
   Variability of Soil Properties}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{224}},

Abstract = {{Spatial accuracy of hydrologic modeling inputs influences the output
   from hydrologic models. A pertinent question is to know the optimal
   level of soil sampling or how many soil samples are needed for model
   input, in order to improve model predictions. In this study, measured
   soil properties were clustered into five different configurations as
   inputs to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulation of the
   Castor River watershed (11-km(2) area) in southern Quebec, Canada. SWAT
   is a process-based model that predicts the impacts of climate and land
   use management on water yield, sediment, and nutrient fluxes. SWAT
   requires geographical information system inputs such as the digital
   elevation model as well as soil and land use maps. Mean values of soil
   properties are used in soil polygons (soil series); thus, the spatial
   variability of these properties is neglected. The primary objective of
   this study was to quantify the impacts of spatial variability of soil
   properties on the prediction of runoff, sediment, and total phosphorus
   using SWAT. The spatial clustering of the measured soil properties was
   undertaken using the regionalized with dynamically constrained
   agglomerative clustering and partitioning method. Measured soil data
   were clustered into 5, 10, 15, 20, and 24 heterogeneous regions. Soil
   data from the Castor watershed which have been used in previous studies
   was also set up and termed ``Reference{''}. Overall, there was no
   significant difference in runoff simulation across the five
   configurations including the reference. This may be attributable to
   SWAT's use of the soil conservation service curve number method in flow
   simulation. Therefore having high spatial resolution inputs for soil
   data may not necessarily improve predictions when they are used in
   hydrologic modeling.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental and health risks posed by emerging engineered
   nanoparticles (ENPs) released into aquatic environments are largely
   dependent on their aggregation, transport, and deposition behavior.
   Herein, laboratory-scale columns were used to examine the mobility of
   polyacrylic acid (PAA)-coated cerium dioxide nanoparticles (nCeO(2)) and
   an analogous nanosized polymeric capsule (nCAP) in water saturated
   quartz sand or loamy sand. The influence of solution ionic strength (IS)
   and cation type (Na+, Ca2+, or Me2+) on the transport potential of these
   ENPs was examined in both granular matrices and results were also
   compared to measurements obtained using a natural groundwater. ENP
   suspensions were characterized using dynamic light scattering and
   nanoparticle tracking analysis to establish aggregate size, and laser
   Doppler electrophoresis to determine ENP electrophoretic mobility.
   Regardless of IS, virtually all nCeO(2) particles suspended in NaNO3
   eluted from the quartz sand-packed columns. In contrast, heightened
   nCeO(2) and nCAP particle retention and dynamic (time-dependent)
   transport behavior was observed with increasing concentrations of the
   divalent salts and in the presence of natural groundwater. Enhanced
   particle retention was also observed in loamy sand in comparison to the
   quartz sand, emphasizing the need to consider the nature of the aqueous
   matrix and granular medium in evaluating contamination risks associated
   with the release of ENPs in natural and engineered aquatic environments.

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study is to detect trends in the mean surface
   air temperature over the southern parts of Ontario and Quebec, Canada,
   for the period of 1967-2006. This is accomplished by determining the
   most dominant periodic components that affect trends in different
   temperature data categories (monthly, seasonally-based, seasonal, and
   annual), which were obtained from a total of five stations. The discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT) technique, the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, and
   sequential Mann-Kendall analysis were used in this study - co-utilizing
   these techniques in temperature trend studies has not been explored
   extensively. The mother wavelet, number of decomposition levels, and
   boundary condition were determined using a newly proposed criterion
   based on the relative error of the MK Z-values between the original data
   and the approximation component of the last decomposition level. This
   study found that all stations experienced positive trends: significant
   trends were observed in all of the monthly, seasonally-based, and annual
   data. For the different seasons, although the trend values were all
   positive, not all stations experienced significant trends. It was found
   that high-frequency components ranging from 2 to 12 months were more
   prominent for trends in the higher resolution data (i.e. monthly and
   seasonally based). The positive trends observed for the annual data are
   thought to be mostly attributable to warming during winter and summer
   seasons, which are manifested in the form of multiyear to decadal events
   (mostly between 8 and 16 years). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel probabilistic voxel selection strategy for
   medical image registration in time-sensitive contexts, where the goal is
   aggressive voxel sampling (e. g., using less than 1\% of the total
   number) while maintaining registration accuracy and low failure rate. We
   develop a Bayesian framework whereby, first, a voxel sampling
   probability field (VSPF) is built based on the uncertainty on the
   transformation parameters. We then describe a practical, multi-scale
   registration algorithm, where, at each optimization iteration, different
   voxel subsets are sampled based on the VSPF. The approach maximizes
   accuracy without committing to a particular fixed subset of voxels. The
   probabilistic sampling scheme developed is shown to manage the tradeoff
   between the robustness of traditional random voxel selection (by
   permitting more exploration) and the accuracy of fixed voxel selection
   (by permitting a greater proportion of informative voxels).}},

Abstract = {{In modern turbomachinery, abradable materials are implemented on casings
   to reduce operating tip clearances and mitigate direct unilateral
   contact occurrences between rotating and stationary components. However,
   both experimental and numerical investigations revealed that
   blade/abradable interactions may lead to blade failures. In order to
   comprehend the underlying mechanism, an accurate modeling of the
   abradable removal process is required. Time-marching strategies where
   the abradable removal is modeled through plasticity are available but
   another angle of attack is proposed in this work. It is assumed that the
   removal of abradable liners shares similarities with machine tool
   chatter encountered in manufacturing. Chatter is a self-excited
   vibration caused by the interaction between the machine and the
   workpiece through the cutting forces and the corresponding dynamics are
   efficiently captured by delay differential equations. These equations
   differ from ordinary differential equations in the sense that previous
   states of the system are involved in the formulation. This mathematical
   framework is employed here for the exploration of the blade stability
   during abradable removal. The proposed tool advantageously features a
   reduced computational cost and consistency with existing time-marching
   solution methods. Potentially dangerous interaction regimes are
   accurately predicted and instability lobes match both the flexural and
   torsional modal responses. Essentially, the regenerative nature of
   chatter in machining processes can also be attributed to abradable
   coating removal in turbomachinery.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aims at the free vibration analysis of double tapered

   beam models. Applying the power series method of Frobenius, the base
   solutions of the governing equations are obtained in the form of a power
   series via general recursive relations. Applying the boundary
   conditions, the natural frequencies of the beam/column are obtained
   using both models. The obtained results are compared with literature and
   a very good agreement is achieved. Subsequently, comprehensive studies
   are performed to provide an insight into the variation of the natural

Abstract = {{Transmission over channels impaired by impulsive noise, such as in power
   substations, calls for peculiar mitigation techniques at the receiver
   side in order to cope with signal deterioration. For these techniques to
   be effective, a reliable noise model is usually required. One of the
   widely accepted models is the Middleton Class A, which presents the
   twofold advantage to be canonical (i.e., invariant of the particular
   physical source mechanisms) and to exhibit a simple probability density
   function (PDF) that only depends on three physical parameters, making
   this model very attractive. However, such a model fails in replicating
   bursty impulsive noise, where each impulse spans over several
   consecutive noise samples, as usually observed (e. g., in power
   substations). Indeed, the Middleton Class A model only deals with
   amplitude or envelope statistics. On the other hand, for models based on
   Markov chains, although they reproduce the bursty nature of impulses,
   the determination of the suitable number of states and the noise
   distribution associated with each state can be challenging. In this
   paper, 1) we introduce a new impulsive noise model which is, in fact, a
   Hidden Markov Model, whose realizations exactly follow a Middleton Class
   A distribution and 2) we evaluate optimum and suboptimum detections for
   a coded transmission impaired by the proposed noise model.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach is proposed for the modeling of rigid-wheel and

   distributions in the contact area. The authors propose a velocity field

   computed by resorting to elastoplasticity theory and an appropriate
   already existing constitutive relation for soil. The proposed approach
   leads to results that agree well with those obtained using
   well-established terramechanics models, while addressing some of their
   shortcomings. In addition, the proposed approach uses generalized
   velocities of the wheel as inputs, which makes it compatible with
   dynamic models of multibody systems. The dynamic slip-sinkage behavior
   of the wheel and the semielliptical shape of the normal stress
   distribution under the wheel are natural outcomes of the proposed model.
   Experimental investigation under various ranges of wheel slippage shows
   good agreement with the data available in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Smooth muscle has the distinctive ability to maintain force
   for long periods of time and at low energy costs. While it is generally
   agreed that this property, called the latch-state, is due to the
   dephosphorylation of myosin while attached to actin,
   dephosphorylated-detached myosin can also attach to actin and may
   contribute to force maintenance. Thus, we investigated the role of
   calponin in regulating and enhancing the binding force of
   unphosphorylated tonic muscle myosin to actin.
   Methods: To measure the effect of calponin on the binding of
   unphosphorylated myosin to actin, we used the laser trap assay to
   quantify the average force of unbinding (F-unb) in the absence and
   presence of calponin or phosphorylated calponin.
   Results: F-unb from F-actin alone (0.12 +/- 0.01 pN; mean +/- SE) was
   significantly increased in the presence of calponin (0.20 +/- 0.02 pN).
   This enhancement was lost when calponin was phosphorylated (0.12 +/-
   0.01 pN). To further verify that this enhancement of F-unb was due to
   the cross-linking of actin to myosin by calponin, we repeated the
   measurements at high ionic strength. Indeed, the F-unb obtained at a
   {[}KCl] of 25 mM (0.21 +/- 0.02 pN; mean +/- SE) was significantly
   decreased at a {[}KCl] of 150 mM, (0.13 +/- 0.01 pN).
   Conclusions: This study provides direct molecular level-evidence that
   calponin enhances the binding force of unphosphorylated myosin to actin
   by cross-linking them and that this is reversed upon calponin
   phosphorylation. Thus, calponin might play an important role in the
   latch-state.
   General significance: This study suggests a new mechanism that likely
   contributes to the latch-state, a fundamental and important property of
   smooth muscle that remains unresolved. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We report that combining interferometry with Second Harmonic Generation
   (SHG) microscopy provides valuable information about the relative
   orientation of noncentrosymmetric structures composing tissues. This is
   confirmed through the imaging of rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. The
   inteferometric Second Harmonic Generation (ISHG) images reveal that each
   side of the myosin filaments composing the A band of the sarcomere
   generates pi phase shifted SHG signal which implies that the myosin
   proteins at each end of the filaments are oriented in opposite
   directions. This highlights the bipolar structural organization of the
   myosin filaments and shows that muscles can be considered as a
   periodically poled biological structure. (c) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{The results of a detailed laboratory study of rheological and mechanical
   properties of two reference Portland cements (ASTM Type I and Type III)
   and seven commercial microfine cement grouts are summarized. They were
   tested at five water-cement (W/C) ratios, by weight, ranging from 0.5 to
   1.2 and at three selected temperatures (4 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 20
   degrees C). The properties studied were: grain size distribution, three
   rheological properties (viscosity, bleeding and setting time), and five
   mechanical properties (modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio,
   compressive strength, bond strength and expansion/shrinkage). It was
   concluded that variation in the W/C has a substantial effect on
   viscosity, bleeding and setting time as well as on compressive strength
   and modulus of elasticity of the cement grouts. Only one rheological
   property, i.e., the setting time was influenced by the temperature
   variation whereas for mechanical properties, maximum compressive
   strength and modulus of elasticity were obtained for most of the cement
   grouts at 10 degrees C. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier
