Abstract = {{An optical biosensor based on long-range surface plasmon-polariton
   waveguides is applied to the detection of blood group antigen A on whole
   erythrocytes. The biosensor consists of straight gold waveguides
   embedded in CYTOP with an etched fluidic channel. The gold waveguides
   were functionalized with immunoglobulin G against blood group A (anti-A
   IgG) by forming a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of
   16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (16-MHA) and then conjugating the anti-A
   IgG through carbodiimide chemistry. In order to demonstrate anti-A
   surface selectivity, solutions of O-type, B-type, A-type and AB-type red
   blood cells (RBCs) were sequentially injected over an anti-A
   functionalized waveguide. Surfaces were regenerated by lysing attached
   cells with distilled/deionized water (DDI H2O). The efficiency of
   surface regeneration with DDI H2O was very high as determined by
   performing six sequential binding/regeneration cycles of A RBC capture
   on the same anti-A surface. Also, five solutions of different A RBC
   concentrations, ranging from 1.14 x 10(5) cells/ml to 1.83 x 10(6)
   cells/ml, were injected over an anti-A surface to determine the limit of
   detection (LOD), which was found to be less than 3 x 10(5) cells/ml.
   Finally, the response produced by a single cell bound to a waveguide was
   determined by relating the number of bound cells to the response
   produced, from which the signal-to-noise ratio for single cell detection
   was determined to be similar to 95. The waveguides are promising as
   simple, low-cost and compact transducers, functionalized using standard
   thiol-based chemistries, for the selective detection of cells. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Current medically relevant metals for prosthetic reconstructions enjoy a
   relatively good success rate, but their performance drops significantly
   in patients with compromised health status, and post-surgical infections
   still remain an important challenge. To address these problems,
   different nanotechnology-based strategies have been exploited to create
   implantable metals with an enhanced bioactivity and antibacterial
   capacities. Among these, oxidative nanopatterning has emerged as a very
   effective approach to engender nanoporous surfaces that stimulate and
   guide the activity of adhering cells. The resulting nanoporosity is also
   attractive because it offers nanoconfined volumes that can be exploited
   to load bioactive compounds and modulate their release over time. Such
   extended elution is needed since a single exposure to growth factors
   and/or antibiotics, for instance, may not be adequate to further sustain
   bone regeneration and/or to counteract bacterial colonization. In this
   article, we assessed the capacities of nanoporous titanium surfaces
   generated by oxidative nanopatterning to provide controlled and
   sustained elution of proteins and antibiotic molecules. To this end, we
   have selected bovine serum albumin (BSA) and vancomycin to reflect
   commonly used compounds, and investigated their adsorption and elution
   by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS)
   spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that while the elution of albumin
   is not significantly affected by the nanoporosity, in the case of
   vancomycin, nanoporous surfaces provided an extended release. These
   findings were successively correlated to the establishment of
   interactions with the surface and physical-entrapment effects exerted by
   the nanopores, ultimately highlighting their synergistic contribution to
   the release profiles and thus their importance in the design of
   nanostructured eluting platforms for applications in medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Nonsolvent Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) is among the most well-known
   methods for membrane fabrication in which the phase separation behavior
   of the polymer solution is one factor that governs the structure of the
   membrane ultimately obtained. In this study, phase separation behavior
   of the polyetherimide (PEI)-casting dope was investigated for different
   types of coagulants and nonsolvent additives. Cloud point data were
   obtained by the titration method on the ternary
   polyetherimide/solvent/coagulant diagram from a limited number of
   experiments. The whole cloud point curves were then drawn by calculation
   using the fitting parameters based on the linearized cloud point
   relation (LCP). In the first part, water, methanol, ethanol, glycerol,
   and acetic acid were used as the coagulants for the PEI/NMP solution.
   The cloud point curves obtained for the above coagulants indicated that
   water has the strongest coagulation power among them. In the second
   part, methanol, ethanol, glycerol, and acetic acid were used as
   nonsolvent additives to NMP in different (nonsolvent additive/NMP) mass
   ratios. The latter (NMP + nonsolvent additive) mixtures were then used
   as the solvents to prepare PEI/(NMP + nonsolvent additive) solutions.
   The cloud point data obtained for the above solutions using water as a
   coagulant indicated that the cloud point curves shift toward the
   polymer/solution axis as the (nonsolvent additive/NMP) mass ratio
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{Order tracking based on time frequency representation (TFR) is one of
   the most effective methods for gear fault detection under time-varying
   rotational speed without using a tachometer. However, for a rolling
   element bearing, the signal components related to rotational speed
   usually cannot be directly extracted from the TFR. As such, we propose a
   new method to solve this problem. This method consists of four main
   steps: (a) signal filtering via fast spectral kurtosis (SK) analysis -
   this together with the short time Fourier transform (STFT) leads to a
   TFR of the filtered signal with clear fault-revealing trend lines, (b)
   extraction of instantaneous fault characteristic frequency (IFCF) from
   the TFR using an amplitude-sum based spectral peak search algorithm, (c)
   signal resampling based on the extracted IFCF to convert the
   non-stationary time-domain signal into the stationary fault phase angle
   (FPA) domain signal, and (d) transform of the FPA domain signal into the
   domain of the fault characteristic order (FCO) and identification of
   fault type from the FCO spectrum. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method has been validated by both simulated and experimental bearing
   vibration signals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the conventional design of home security systems, only the property
   is typically monitored, without taking into consideration the physical
   control aspects of the house itself. Besides, the term security is not
   strictly well defined in view of the fact that there is usually a time
   delay between the alarm system going on and actual arrival of the
   security personnel. This paper presents the development of a home
   security and monitoring system that is suitable where the traditional
   security systems that are mostly concerned about curbing burglary,
   gathering evidence against trespassing and so on fail. The design and
   implementation details of this new home control and security system
   which is based on field programmable gate array has been discussed in
   the subject paper. The user here can interact directly with the system
   through a web-based interface over the Internet, while home appliances
   like air conditioners, lights, door locks, and gates are controlled
   remotely through a user-friendly web page. An additional feature that
   enhances the security aspect of the system is its capability to monitor
   entry points such as doors and windows so that in the event of any
   breach, an alerting email message could be sent to the home owner
   instantly.}},

Abstract = {{Cubic panoramas provide an efficient solution to the implementation of
   immersive and omnidirectional displays for image-based virtual
   navigation. To allow unrestricted navigation through the environment, a
   system must be capable of constructing novel views given the reference
   images, typically, cubic panoramas. This paper proposes a processing
   pipeline for cubic panorama synthesis based on 2D/3D triangular
   reprojection. This pipeline uses matching features to implement the
   triangular meshing on cubic panoramas, and introduces the matching line
   constraint, which significantly reduces the artifacts of straight-line
   features in the rendered image and accelerates the division process. The
   modules of this pipeline take the geometrical characteristics of cubic
   panorama into account. Thus, it can handle the discontinuities of the
   cube edges when the triangular mesh covers different faces. Furthermore,
   these modules could be reconfigured to compose customized pipelines and
   generate virtual cubic panoramas of different quality based on the
   amount of features. The performance and efficiency of the proposed
   pipeline is demonstrated with comparison experiments. Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, results are presented from a testing program focused on
   evaluating the performance of portal frame systems. A total of nine
   full-scale portal frame assemblies with six different configurations
   were tested under monotonic and reversed cyclic loading. The portal
   frames were 3.66m in length and 2.44m in height, with a 406-mm wall
   segment at each end of the portal frame. From the experimental results,
   it was observed that the corner joint between the header and narrow
   braced wall segment governs the lateral load-carrying capacity and
   ultimate displacement of the portal frame. Installation of metal straps
   considerably increased the lateral load-carrying capacity of the portal
   frame assemblies. Straps placed directly on the lumber framing showed
   increased resistance compared to those installed on the oriented strand
   board. Portal frames with hold-downs had a greater lateral load-carrying
   capacity those without hold-downs. A comparison was made between portal
   frames and conventional braced walls used in low-rise light-frame wood
   buildings. The portal frames in general have lower initial stiffness
   than the braced walls. A portal frame with sheathing on one side only
   and no hold-down has an ultimate load-carrying capacity equivalent to a
   2.44-m long braced wall with hold-down. A portal frame with hold-down
   can on average achieve a capacity similar to that of a 4.88-m long
   braced wall without hold-down.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun nanofiber membranes offer many advantages and their
   application in drug delivery and regenerative medicine is significant.
   Solvent based electrospinning processes typically use hazardous organic
   solvents that not only pose a health hazard to manufacturers and users
   of electrospinning but could also be trapped in trace amounts within the
   products that are delivered to the end users. Water-mediated green
   electrospinning of a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)
   blend and cross-linking of the nanofiber membrane was attempted by heat
   treatment. The resulting nanofiber membrane was a polyelectrolyte coated
   in a layer by layer (LBL) method using poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI)/PAA
   polymers. The polyelectrolyte coated and uncoated nanofibers were
   characterized with IR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and tensile
   strength measurements. The SEM images showed the swelling nature of the
   LBL polyelectrolyte nanofibers or the hydrogel nanofibers. The
   antimicrobial activity of the membranes was evaluated using the E. coli
   strain and compared with the polyelectrolyte untreated control. The
   polyelectrolyte membranes exhibited strong antimicrobial activity in
   comparison to the control and holds potential application in wound
   dressing materials or specific applications as wound dressing hydrogel
   nanofibers.}},

Abstract = {{The nonverbal transmission of information between social animals is a
   primary driving force behind their actions and, therefore, an important
   quantity to measure in animal behavior studies. Despite its key role in
   social behavior, the flow of information has only been inferred by
   correlating the actions of individuals with a simplifying assumption of
   linearity. In this paper, we leverage information-theoretic tools to
   relax this assumption. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach,
   we focus on a robotics-based experimental paradigm, which affords
   consistent and controllable delivery of visual stimuli to zebrafish.
   Specifically, we use a robotic arm to maneuver a life-sized replica of a
   zebrafish in a predetermined trajectory as it interacts with a focal
   subject in a test tank. We track the fish and the replica through time
   and use the resulting trajectory data to measure the transfer entropy
   between the replica and the focal subject, which, in turn, is used to
   quantify one-directional information flow from the robot to the fish. In
   agreement with our expectations, we find that the information flow from
   the replica to the zebrafish is significantly more than the other way
   around. Notably, such information is specifically related to the
   response of the fish to the replica, whereby we observe that the
   information flow is reduced significantly if the motion of the replica
   is randomly delayed in a surrogate dataset. In addition, comparison with
   a control experiment, where the replica is replaced by a conspecific,
   shows that the information flow toward the focal fish is significantly
   more for a robotic than a live stimulus. These findings support the
   reliability of using transfer entropy as a measure of information flow,
   while providing indirect evidence for the efficacy of a robotics-based
   platform in animal behavioral studies.}},

Abstract = {{Most RF beacons-based mobile robot navigation techniques rely on
   approximating line-of-sight (LOS) distances between the beacons and the
   robot. This is mostly performed using the robot's received signal
   strength (RSS) measurements from the beacons. However, accurate mapping
   between the RSS measurements and the LOS distance is almost impossible
   to achieve in reverberant environments. This paper presents a
   partially-observed feedback controller for a wheeled mobile robot where
   the feedback signal is in the form of noisy RSS measurements emitted
   from radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. The proposed controller
   requires neither an accurate mapping between the LOS distance and the
   RSS measurements, nor the linearization of the robot model. The
   controller performance is demonstrated through numerical simulations and
   real-time experiments. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the modeling and distributed control
   problems for the load frequency control (LFC) in a smart grid. In
   contrast with existing works, we consider more practical and real
   scenarios, where the communication topology of the smart grid changes
   because of either link failures or packet losses. These topology changes
   are modeled as a time-varying communication topology matrix. By using
   this matrix, a new closed-loop power system model is proposed to
   integrate the communication topology changes into the dynamics of a
   physical power system. The globally asymptotical stability of this
   closed-loop power system is analyzed. A distributed gain scheduling LFC
   strategy is proposed to compensate for the potential degradation of
   dynamic performance (mean square errors of state vectors) of the power
   system under communication topology changes. In comparison to
   conventional centralized control approaches, the proposed method can
   improve the robustness of the smart grid to the variation of the
   communication network as well as to reduce computation load. Simulation
   results show that the proposed distributed gain scheduling approach is
   capable to improve the robustness of the smart grid to communication
   topology changes. (C) 2013 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   nanopillars with different shapes and dimensions were successfully

   The fabricated nanopillar arrays had a typical period of similar to 500

   CH4/H-2/Cl-2 chemistry with optimized gas flows and plasma powers is
   shown to produce nanopillars with smooth sidewalls compared to those
   fabricated with the Ar/Cl-2 chemistry. The GaAs nanopillar arrays have
   appreciably lower reflectivities in the measured wavelength range from
   400 to 850 nm and are typically one order of magnitude lower compared to
   planar GaAs, which shows their potential for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a strength-based optimum signal detection scheme for
   binary concentration-encoded molecular communication (CEMC) system has
   been presented. In CEMC, a single type of information molecule is
   assumed to carry the information from the transmitting nanomachine (TN),
   through the propagation medium, to the receiving nanomachine (RN) in the
   form of received concentration of information molecules at the location
   of the RN. We consider a pair of nanomachines communicating by means of
   on off keying (OOK) transmission protocol in a three-dimensional ideal
   (i.e. free) diffusion-based unbounded propagation environment. First,
   based on stochastic chemical kinetics of the reaction events between
   ligand molecules and receptors, we develop a mathematical receiver model
   of strength-based detection scheme for OOK CEMC system. Using an
   analytical approach, we explain the receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curves of the receiver thus developed. Finally, we propose a
   variable threshold-based detection scheme and explain its communication
   range and rate dependent characteristics. We show that it provides an
   improvement in the communication ranges compared to fixed
   threshold-based detection scheme. (Part of this paper has been

Abstract = {{A multi-layered polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic device with an
   integrated suspended membrane has been fabricated that allows dynamic
   and multi-axial mechanical deformation and simultaneous live-cell
   microscopy imaging. The transparent membrane's strain field can be
   controlled independently along two orthogonal directions. Human foreskin
   fibroblasts were immobilized on the membrane's surface and stretched
   along two orthogonal directions sequentially while performing live-cell
   imaging. Cyclic deformation of the cells induced a reversible
   reorientation perpendicular to the direction of the applied strain.
   Cells remained viable in the microdevice for several days. As opposed to
   existing microfluidic or macroscale stretching devices, this device can
   impose changing, anisotropic and time-varying strain fields in order to
   more closely mimic the complexities of strains occurring in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonic Ag@AgCl-sensitized K2Ti4O9 composite photocatalysts (hereafter
   designated as Ag@AgCl/K2Ti4O9) were synthesized via a facile
   hydrothermal deposition-photoreduction method. The samples were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDX), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
   (UV-vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray fluorescence
   spectrometry (XRF), nitrogen adsorption (BET) and photoluminescence
   measurements (PL). The synthesized Ag@AgCl in the composite
   photocatalyst possessed cubic structure, while the K2Ti4O9 crystal was
   monoclinic. The size of Ag@AgCl nanoparticles, which were uniformly
   scattered on the surface of K2Ti4O9, was distributed in the range of
   100-200 nm. The prepared Ag@AgCl/K2Ti4O9 samples also exhibited superior
   visible light absorption compared to the pure K2Ti4O9. The
   photocatalytic activity of the prepared materials for organics
   degradation was examined under visible light irradiation, and the effect
   of Ag@AgCl loading amount was studied and was found to influence the
   absorption spectra observed. The Ag@AgCl(30 wt.\%)/K2Ti4O9 composite
   photocatalyst synthesized by hydrothermal deposition-photoreduction
   method exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, degrading 82.7\%
   of Rhodamine B dye after 2 h of irradiation. The catalyst stability was
   also investigated. The high photocatalytic activity of the prepared
   composite can be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance effect of
   Ag nanoparticles and synergy with the layered host material, and a
   mechanism of photocatalysis was discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   is also studied, as an example of model reduction, with identical
   results as those obtained with an existing model based on a simplifying
   premise. Good agreement between predicted profiles, our own experimental
   data, and data from other groups is obtained in most of the analyzed

Abstract = {{Thickened waste-activated sludge (TWAS) was subjected to microwave
   pretreatment and athermal irradiation. The soluble phase of each type of
   TWAS pretreatment was subject to ultrafiltration in series using
   progressively smaller pore-size membranes (300, 100, 10, and 1 kDa) and
   biodegradability tests. Microwave pretreatment solubilizes a
   considerable amount of the suspended organic substrate, but athermal
   irradiation also causes solubilization of organic matter, although at a
   smaller scale than microwave. Proteins are particularly sensitive to
   athermal irradiation, and both microwave and athermal irradiation are
   capable of changing the size distribution of dissolved organic matter.
   Athermal irradiation and microwave have a substantially different effect
   on thermophilic anaerobic biodegradability of the various size fractions
   obtained after ultrafiltration. Slight inhibition and decrease in total
   biogas production was measured in some microwave tests. Athermal
   irradiation does not cause a decrease in maximum biogas production rate
   in any test and increases slightly biogas production.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon photodetectors are of vigorous current interest. Such
   detectors typically combine a metallic structure that supports surface
   plasmons with a photodetection structure based on internal photoemission
   or electron-hole pair creation. Detector architectures are highly
   varied, involving surface plasmons on planar metal waveguides, on metal
   gratings, on nano-particles, -islands, or -antennas, or involving
   plasmon-mediated transmission through one or many sub-wavelength holes
   in a metal film. Properties inherent to surface plasmons, such as
   sub-wavelength confinement and their ability to resonate on tiny
   metallic structures, are exploited to convey useful characteristics to
   detectors in addressing applications such as low-noise high-speed
   detection, single-plasmon detection, near- and mid-infrared imaging,
   photovoltaic solar energy conversion, and (bio)chemical sensing. The
   operating principles behind surface plasmon detectors are reviewed, the
   literature on the topic is surveyed, and avenues that appear promising

   the investigation of their thermal and electrical conductivities is also
   immensely important. The material shows a significant enhancement of
   both thermal and electrical conductivities in comparison to the base

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Charged System Search (ACSS)
   algorithm for the optimal tuning of Takagi-Sugeno proportional-integral
   fuzzy controllers (T-S PI-FCs). The five stages of this algorithm,
   namely the engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration and
   evaluation, involve the adaptation of the acceleration, velocity, and
   separation distance parameters to the iteration index, and the
   substitution of the worst charged particles' fitness function values and
   positions with the best performing particle data. The ACSS algorithm
   solves the optimization problems aiming to minimize the objective
   functions expressed as the sum of absolute control error plus squared
   output sensitivity function, resulting in optimal fuzzy control systems
   with reduced parametric sensitivity. The ACSS-based tuning of T-S PI-FCs
   is applied to second-order servo systems with an integral component. The
   ACSS algorithm is validated by an experimental case study dealing with
   the optimal tuning of a T-S PI-FC for the position control of a
   nonlinear servo system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lower-back injury from snow shovelling may be related to excessive joint
   loading. Bent-shaft snow shovels are commonly available for purchase;
   however, their influence on lower back-joint loading is currently not
   known. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare L5/S1
   extension angular impulses between a bent-shaft and a standard
   straight-shaft snow shovel. Eight healthy subjects participated in this
   study. Each completed a simulated snow-lifting task in a biomechanics
   laboratory with each shovel design. A standard motion analysis procedure
   was used to determine L5/S1 angular impulses during each trial, as well
   as peak L5/S1 extension moments and peak upper body flexion angle.
   Paired-samples t-tests (alpha = 0.05) were used to compare variables
   between shovel designs. Correlation was used to determine the
   relationship between peak flexion and peak moments. Results of this
   study show that the bent-shaft snow shovel reduced L5/S1 extension
   angular impulses by 16.5\% (p = 0.022), decreased peak moments by 11.8\%
   (p = 0.044), and peak flexion by 13.0\% (p = 0.002) compared to the
   straight-shaft shovel. Peak L5/S1 extension moment magnitude was
   correlated with peak upper body flexion angle (r, = 0.70). Based on
   these results, it is concluded that the bent-shaft snow shovel can
   likely reduce lower-back joint loading during snow shovelling, and thus
   may have a role in snow shovelling injury prevention. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We prove tight crossing number inequalities for geometric graphs whose
   vertex sets are taken from a d-dimensional grid of volume N and give
   applications of these inequalities to counting the number of
   crossing-free geometric graphs that can be drawn on such grids.
   In particular, we show that any geometric graph with m >= 8N edges and
   with vertices on a 3D integer grid of volume N, has Omega((m(2)/N)
   log(m/N)) crossings. In d-dimensions, with d >= 4, this bound becomes
   Omega(m(2)/N). We provide matching upper bounds for all d. Finally, for
   d >= 4 the upper bound implies that the maximum number of crossing-free
   geometric graphs with vertices on some d-dimensional grid of volume N is
   N-Theta(N). In 3 dimensions it remains open to improve the trivial
   bounds, namely, the 2(Omega(N)) lower bound and the N-O(N) upper bound.}},

Abstract = {{A triple-output Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) operating with
   long-range surface plasmon-polariton waves, consisting of a MZI in
   cascade with a triple coupler, is demonstrated at a wavelength of
   similar to 1370 nm, using the thermo-optic effect to produce phase
   shifting. A theoretical model for three-waveguide coupling is also
   proposed and was applied to compute the transfer characteristic of
   various designs. Dimensions for the device were selected to optimize
   performance, experiments were performed, and the results were compared
   to theory. The outputs were sinusoidally related to the
   thermally-induced phase shift and separated by similar to 2 pi/3 rad, as
   expected theoretically. Four detection schemes that take advantage of
   the 3 times larger dynamic range and suppress time-varying common
   perturbations are proposed and analyzed in order to improve the
   detection limit of the device. A minimum detectable phase shift similar
   to 2/3 that of a single output was obtained from a power difference
   scheme and a normalization scheme. The smallest minimum detectable phase
   shift was 7.3 mrad. The device is promising for sensing applications,
   including (bio)chemical sensing. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of coupled thermal (T), hydraulic (H), mechanical (M) and
   chemical (C) (THMC) properties of underground cemented paste backfill
   (CPB) has been studied by means of experiments with insulated-undrained
   high columns. This paper which compliments Part I (Ghirian and Fall,
   2013), presents the mechanical, chemical and microstructural processes
   and characteristics. Two columns have been built and filled with a
   specific CPB mix and equipped with different sensors. The vertical
   deformation and drying shrinkage for a period of 150 days are measured.
   Also, four other columns are cured for 7, 28, 90 and 150 days and then
   small samples are taken out from the columns to investigate the
   evolution of unconfined compressive strength (UCS), shear strength
   parameters, microstructural properties, and pore fluid chemistry. The
   combined results of the two part experiment show that strongly coupled
   THMC processes control CPB behavior. This study has demonstrated that
   mechanical properties are coupled to chemical reactions due to cement
   hydration and temperature changes inside the columns. Also, suction
   development due to self-desiccation can significantly increase the
   uniaxial compressive strength values with time. Chemical analysis
   including ion concentration measurements with time has revealed that
   change in pore fluid concentration affects the refinement of pore voids,
   and thereby results in improvement in hydro-mechanical performance as
   well as microstructural evolution of the CPB. External environmental
   loading, such as surface evaporation, can affect the durability
   performance of CPB structures. The results show that there is
   degradation of strength following surface shrinkage as well as an
   increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity due to existence of
   micro-cracks. The obtained results support that coupled THMC effects
   should be taken into account in field conditions to understand CPB
   behavior where stronger interplay reactions take place. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Hydrous manganese dioxide (HMO) nanoparticles were synthesized and

   matrix membranes (MMMs) for ultrafiltration (UF). The resulting
   membranes were characterized by XRD, FTIR, contact angle goniometer, SEM
   and AFM before further subjected to water permeation test and UF of
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution. It was found that contact angle of
   membrane decreased remarkably while porosity increased with an increase
   in HMO nanoparticle loading. The pore size at the skin layer however
   decreased as observed both by SEM and AFM. As for the UF experiments,
   pure water permeation rate increased remarkably with increasing
   nanoparticle loading but the permeation rate of BSA did not increase
   very much. Interestingly, the membrane flux recovery by washing with DI
   water was considerably enhanced by an increase in nanoparticle loading,
   indicating the improvement in membrane anti-fouling property upon HMO
   nanoparticle addition. The observed phenomena can be explained by the
   increase in membrane hydrophilicity and the formation of patterned
   surface with an increase in nanoparticle loading. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A simple photonic approach to implementing an ultra-wideband microwave
   phase shifter based on an erbium-ytterbium (Er/Yb) co-doped linearly
   chirped fiber Bragg grating (LCFBG) is proposed and experimentally
   demonstrated. The LCFBG is designed to have a constant magnitude
   response over a reflection band, and a phase response that is linear and
   nonlinear in two sections in the reflection band. When an optical
   single-sideband with carrier (OSSB + C) signal is sent to the LCFBG, by
   locating the optical carrier at the section corresponding to the
   nonlinear phase response and the sideband at the section corresponding
   to the linear phase response, a phase shift is introduced to the optical
   carrier, which is then translated to the microwave signal by beating the
   optical carrier and the sideband at a photodetector. The tuning of the
   phase shift is realized by optically pumping the Er/Yb co-doped LCFBG by
   a 980-nm laser diode. The proposed ultra-wideband microwave photonic
   phase shifter is experimentally demonstrated. A phase shifter with a

Abstract = {{A wideband and continuously tunable optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)
   incorporating a single passband microwave photonic filter (MPF) is

   implemented using a broadband light source, a Mach-Zehnder
   interferometer (MZI) in which a phase modulator is incorporated in one
   arm, a dispersion compensating fiber (DCF), and a photodetector (PD).
   The light wave from the broadband light source is sent to the MZI, and
   the output signal from the MZI is sent to the DCF and then detected at
   the PD. The overall operation is equivalent to a single passband MPF
   with the central frequency of the passband tunable by tuning the length
   difference between the two arms of the MZI. By incorporating the MPF
   into an OEO, a microwave signal with a tunable frequency is generated.
   The proposed OEO is experimentally evaluated. A microwave signal with a
   tunable frequency from 1 to 12 GHz and a tuning step of 0.5 GHz is
   generated. The phase noise performance of the generated microwave signal

Abstract = {{Arsenic contamination in natural water has received a great attention
   due to its high toxicity, ease in accumulation in human body, and high
   carcinogenicity. A novel Zr-based nano-particle (NP) PSF blend hollow
   fiber membrane (HFM) was successfully fabricated for removal of arsenate
   from the aqueous solution. The NP-embedded HFM was characterized by
   morphology, hydrophilicity, porosity, water flux, mechanical strength
   and arsenic adsorption capacity, It was shown that the addition of NP
   changed the structure of the membranes and increased hydrophilicity, by
   which the water flux of the HFM was enhanced. The batch adsorption
   experiments indicated that the membrane could effectively remove
   arsenate at pH ranging from 2 to 9 and the maximum adsorption capacity
   was as high as 131.78 mg/g that was much higher than many commercialized
   materials. The adsorption equilibrium could be established in 48 h. Such
   co-existing anions as carbonate, fluoride, silicate and phosphate
   species had less significant effect on the adsorption. The membrane
   could remove arsenate efficiently via the continuous filtration, even in
   the presence of humic acid. A good performance for regeneration with a
   high recovery rate of 90.1\% was achieved. The cytotoxicity analysis
   through the breast cancer stern cell line (MCF7) indicated that the
   water treated by the HFM was safe for human consumption. Finally, the
   XPS study showed that the hydroxyl and sulfate groups were associated
   with the uptake of arsenic. The sulfate played a key role in the
   arsenate removal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   catalysts, which were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on
   high-aspect-ratio nanoporous alumina templates are investigated with
   regard to the electrooxidation of formic acid in an acidic medium (0.5 M
   H2SO4). Both deposition processes, Ni and Pd, with various mass content
   ratios have been continuously monitored by using a quartz crystal
   microbalance. The morphology of the Pd/Ni systems has been studied by
   electron microscopy and shows a homogeneous deposition of granularly
   structured Pd onto the Ni substrate. X-ray diffraction analysis
   performed on Ni and NiO substrates revealed an amorphous structure,
   while the Pd coating crystallized into a fcc lattice with a preferential
   orientation along the {[}220]-direction. Surface chemistry analysis by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed both metallic and oxide
   contributions for the Ni and Pd deposits. Cyclic voltammetry of the
   Pd/Ni nanocatalysts revealed that the electrooxidation of HCOOH proceeds
   through the direct dehydrogenation mechanism with the formation of
   active intermediates. High catalytic activities are measured for low
   masses of Pd coatings that were generated by a low number of ALD cycles,
   probably because of the cluster size effect, electronic interactions
   between Pd and Ni, or diffusion effects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method to assess the overall fatigue of human body
   movement. First of all, according to previous research regarding
   localized muscular fatigue, a linear relation is assumed between the
   mean frequency and the muscular working time when the muscle is
   experiencing fatigue. This assumption is verified with a rigorous
   statistical analysis. Based on this proven linearity, localized muscular
   fatigue is simplified as a linear model. Furthermore, localized muscular
   fatigue is considered a dynamic process and, hence, the localized
   fatigue levels are tracked by updating the parameters with the most
   current surface electromyogram (sEMG) measurements. Finally, an overall
   fatigue level is computed by fusing localized muscular fatigue levels.
   The developed fatigue-tracking system is evaluated with two fatigue
   experiments (in which 10 male subjects and seven female subjects
   participated), including holding self-weight (dip start position
   training) and lifting weight with one arm (arm curl training).}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) are characterized by a possible absence
   of end-to-end communication routes at any instant. Yet, connectivity can
   be achieved over time and space, leading to evaluate a given route both
   in terms of topological length or temporal length. The problem of
   measuring temporal distances in a social network was recently addressed
   through postprocessing contact traces like email data sets, in which all
   contacts are punctual in time (i.e., they have no duration). We focus on
   the distributed version of this problem and address the more general
   case that contacts can have arbitrary durations (i.e., be nonpunctual).
   Precisely, we ask whether each node in a network can track in real time
   how ``out-of-date{''} it is with respect to every other. Although
   relatively straightforward with punctual contacts, this problem is
   substantially more complex with arbitrarily long contacts: consecutive
   hops of an optimal route may either be disconnected (intermittent
   connectedness of DTNs) or connected (i.e., the presence of links
   overlaps in time, implying a continuum of path opportunities). The
   problem is further complicated (and yet, more realistic) by the fact
   that we address continuous-time systems and nonnegligible message
   latencies (time to propagate a single message over a single link);
   however, this latency is assumed fixed and known. We demonstrate the
   problem is solvable in this general context by generalizing a
   time-measurement vector clock construct to the case of ``nonpunctual{''}
   causality, which results in a tool we call T-CLOCKS, of independent
   interest. The remainder of the paper shows how T-CLOCKS can be leveraged
   to solve concrete problems such as learning foremost broadcast trees
   (BTs), network backbones, or fastest broadcast trees in periodic DTNs.}},

Abstract = {{Vortex methods increasingly receive attention from the computer graphics
   community for simple and direct modeling of complex flow phenomena such
   as turbulence. The coupling between free-form solids, represented by
   arbitrary surface meshes, and fluids simulated with vortex methods,
   leads to visually rich simulations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
   approach for simulating the interaction between solids and inviscid
   fluids for high-quality simulations using Lagrangian vortex particles.
   The key aspect of our method is simulating the creation of vorticity at
   a solid's surface. While previous vortex simulators only focus on
   modeling the solid as a boundary for the fluid, our approach allows the
   accurate simulation of two processes of visual interest. The first is
   the introduction of surface vorticity in the main flow as turbulence
   (vortex shedding). The second is the motion of the solid induced by
   fluid forces. We also introduce to computer graphics the concept of
   source panels to model nonturbulent flow around objects. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is the first work on two-way coupling of 3D solids
   and fluids using Lagrangian vortex methods in computer graphics.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out to validate the use of spheres in lieu of
   cylinders when investigating the global hydrodynamic features of a
   co-current gas-liquid-solid fluidized bed. Two sizes of glass spheres
   with diameters of 4 and 1.5 mm were compared to aluminum cylinders with
   equivalent volume/surface area ratios (i.e., matching Sauter mean
   diameters). Lengths/diameters of the larger and smaller cylinders were
   7.5/3.2 mm and 3.1/1.2 mm, respectively, which resulted in equal
   particle sphericity of 0.8 for both sizes. The particle properties of
   the larger particles led to the inertial settling flow regime (Re-LT
   infinity > 500) in water while the smaller particles were in the
   intermediate regime (0.2 < Re-LT infinity < 500). High gas holdup
   conditions were obtained by increasing the system pressure to 6.5 MPa
   and/or adding a surfactant. Atmospheric conditions were also studied for
   comparison. Experiments were conducted in a 101.6 mm diameter column
   with tap water or a 0.5 wt.\% aqueous ethanol solution as the liquid
   phase while the gas phase was a combination of air and nitrogen. Global
   phase holdups measured from the dynamic pressure profiles characterized
   the hydrodynamic behavior of the fluidized bed and studied the impact of
   particle shape. Standard deviations of the mean holdups aided the
   comparison and also examined the fluctuations of the bed interface.
   Liquid-solid fluidized bed experiments demonstrated that equivalent
   Sauter mean diameters resulted in comparable bed porosities.
   Gas-liquid-solid fluidized bed dynamics of equivalent size spherical and
   cylindrical particles were similar in the dispersed bubble flow regime
   whereas differences were observed in the presence of larger coalescing
   bubbles. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{SU-8-based photonic-microfluidic integrated devices with on-chip beam
   shaping and collection capabilities were demonstrated in a scattering

   12.5\%, respectively, coupled with a simple free-space optical detection
   scheme. The performance of these devices was found dependent on the
   combination of on-chip, lens-shaped beam geometry and bead size. While
   very low CVs were obtained when the combination was ideal, a nonideal
   combination could still result in acceptable CVs for flow cytometry; the
   reliability was confirmed via devices being able to resolve separate
   populations of 2.0 and 5.0 m beads from their mixture with low CV values
   of 15.9 and 18.5\%, respectively. On-chip collection using integrated
   on-chip optical waveguides was shown to be very reliable in comparison

Abstract = {{Implementation of supplemental heat addition as a means of improving
   bioreactor landfill performance was investigated. The experimental work
   was conducted with two pilot-scale bioreactor setups (control cell and
   heated cell) operated for 280 days. Supplemental heat was introduced by
   recirculating leachate heated up to 35 A degrees C compared to the
   control which used similar quantities of leachate at room temperature
   (21 +/- A 1 A degrees C). The temporal and spatial effects of
   recirculating heated leachate on the landfill internal temperature were
   determined, and performance was assessed in terms of leachate parameters
   and biogas production. Recirculation of heated leachate helped establish
   balanced anaerobic microbial consortia that led to earlier (70 days) and
   greater (1.4-fold) organic matter degradation rates, as well as
   threefold higher methane production compared to the non-heated control.
   Despite the significant enhancements in performance resulting from
   supplemental heat addition, heated leachate recirculation did not
   significantly impact waste temperatures, and the effects were mainly
   restricted to short periods after recirculation and mostly at the upper
   layers of the waste. These findings suggest that improvements in
   bioreactor landfill performance may be achieved without increasing the
   temperature of the whole in-place waste, but rather more economically by
   raising the temperature at the leachate/waste interface which is also
   exposed to the maximum moisture levels within the waste matrix.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A dual-passband microwave photonic filter (MPF) implemented based on
   phase-modulation to intensity-modulation (PM-IM) conversion using a
   phase modulator and an equivalent phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating
   (EPS-FBG) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The key component
   in the system is the EPS-FBG, which is designed and fabricated based on
   the equivalent phase-shift technique. The unique feature of the EPS-FBG
   is that equivalent phase shifts are introduced to both of the 1
   channels, leading to a notch in each of the two channels. Thus, by
   implementing PM-IM conversion in the two channels, two passbands are
   produced. The central frequency of each passband is determined by the
   wavelength different between the notch and the optical carrier. In the
   design and fabrication, two phase shifts are introduced to the EPS-FBG
   to decrease the shape factor, which is defined as the ratio between the
   20- and 3-dB bandwidths. In addition, a stimulated Brillouin scattering
   (SBS) assisted filter is incorporated in the system for carrier
   suppression to increase the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and
   decrease the noise figure (NF) of the MPF. An experiment is performed. A
   dual passband filter with a 3-dB bandwidth and a shape factor of 167.3
   MHz and 3.8, and 143.3 MHz and 3.3 for the 1 and 2 passband is achieved.
   The frequency tunable ranges of the 1 and 2 passbands are 5.4 and 7.4
   GHz, respectively, with the magnitude variations of about +/- 0.5 dB
   during the turning. Due to the SBS-assisted filter, the SFDRs are
   increased by 7 dB and the NFs are decreased by 10 dB.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of work hardening on void growth and coalescence was studied
   by pulling samples of aluminum alloy 5052 in tension to various amounts
   of pre-strains. To mimic voids forming during fracture, artificial
   micron-size voids were created in the pre-strained samples with an
   ultrafast laser. Void growth and coalescence was then followed in-situ
   under an optical microscope until failure. The effect of pre-strain on
   void growth rate and coalescence strains was extracted from the
   experiments. Comparison was made with the McClintock model for void
   growth which is only able to predict void growth in the samples without
   pre-strains. A finite element model without any adjustable parameters
   was able to capture the effect of pre-strain on both void growth and
   fracture provided that the proper material properties were used. We
   finally propose a simple model based on the local state of hardening
   between voids which is able to capture the change in failure strains due
   to pre-strain as well as void growth and coalescence. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR)
   nitrification rates, nitrifying biofilm morphology, biomass viability as
   well as bacterial community shifts during long-term exposure to 1
   degrees C. Long-term exposure to 1 degrees C is the key operational
   condition for potential ammonia removal upgrade units to numerous
   northern region treatment systems. The average laboratory MBBR ammonia
   removal rate after long-term exposure to 1 degrees C was measured to be
   18 5.1\% as compared to the average removal rate at 20 degrees C.
   Biofilm morphology and specifically the thickness along with biomass
   viability at various depths in the biofilm were investigated using
   variable pressure electron scanning microscope (VPSEM) imaging and
   confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging in combination with
   viability live/dead staining. The biofilm thickness along with the
   number of viable cells showed significant increases after long-term
   exposure to 1 degrees C. Hence, this study observed nitrifying bacteria
   with higher activities at warm temperatures and a slightly greater
   quantity of nitrifying bacteria with lower activities at cold
   temperatures in nitrifying MBBR biofilms. Using DNA sequencing analysis,
   Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira (ammonia oxidizers) as well as Nitrospira
   (nitrite oxidizer) were identified and no population shift was observed
   between 20 degrees C and after long-term exposure to 1 degrees C. (C)

Abstract = {{Image quality evaluation is very important. In applications involving
   signal transmission, the Reduced- or No-Reference quality metrics are
   generally more practical than the Full-Reference metrics. In this study,
   we propose a quality estimation method based on a novel semi-fragile and
   adaptive watermarking scheme. The proposed scheme uses the embedded
   watermark to estimate the degradation of cover image under different
   distortions. The watermarking process is implemented in DWT domain of
   the cover image. The correlated DWT coefficients across the DWT
   sub-bands are categorized into Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees
   (SPIHT). Those SPHIT trees are further decomposed into a set of
   bitplanes. The watermark is embedded into the selected bitplanes of the
   selected DWT coefficients of the selected tree without causing
   significant fidelity loss to the cover image. The accuracy of the
   quality estimation is made to approach that of Full-Reference metrics by
   referring to an ``Ideal Mapping Curve{''} computed a priori. The
   experimental results show that the proposed scheme can estimate image
   quality in terms of PSNR, wPSNR, JND and SSIM with high accuracy under
   JPEG compression, JPEG2000 compression, Gaussian low-pass filtering and
   Gaussian noise distortion. The results also show that the proposed
   scheme has good computational efficiency for practical applications.}},

   substrates were prepared by incorporating different amounts of TiO2
   nanoparticles (ranging from zero to 1 wt\%) into PSf matrix. The
   nanocomposite substrates so prepared were then characterized with
   respect to hydrophilicity, overall porosity, surface roughness and
   cross-sectional morphology. It was found that both hydrophilicity and
   porosity of the substrate were increased upon addition of TiO2. In
   addition, long finger-like structures were developed by increasing the
   TiO2 loading, leading to water permeability enhancement. In order to
   fabricate thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes for forward osmosis
   (FO) application, a thin polyamide layer was formed by interfacial
   polymerization of 1,3-phenylendiamine and 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl
   trichloride on the top surface of PSf-TiO2 nanocomposite substrates.
   Under the conditions for FO performance evaluation (10 mM NaCl
   concentration in feed solution, 0.5 and 2.0 M NaCl concentration in draw
   solution, and both active layer facing the feed solution (AL-FS) and
   active layer facing the draw solution (AL-DS) orientations), the TFN
   membrane prepared using PSf substrate embedded with 0.5 wt\% TiO2
   nanoparticles (denoted as TFN0.5) exhibited the most promising results
   by showing high water permeability and low reverse solute flux. In
   comparison with control TFC membrane, the water flux of TFN0.5 membrane
   was improved by 86-93\%, depending on the membrane orientation and draw
   solution concentration. The increase in water permeability can be
   attributed to decrease in structural parameter which resulted in
   decreased internal concentration polarization (ICP). Although further
   increase in TiO2 nanoparticles loading to 0.75 and 1 wt\% could result
   in higher water permeability, their FO performances were compromised by
   a significant increase in reverse solute flux. Based on the results
   obtained in this work, it can be concluded that adding an appropriate
   amount of TiO2 nanoparticles into PSf substrate could potentially
   improve the performance of TFC membrane during FO applications. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Many ad hoc network applications rely on nodes having accurate knowledge
   of their geographic locations. However, inherent in all localization
   systems is a degree of error in computed positions, which can compromise
   the accuracy and efficiency of location dependent applications and
   protocols. We propose a scheme in which nodes estimate the amount of
   error present in their derived positions with a certain probability.
   Localization error variance is modeled with a function based on the
   calculated theoretical lower bound on estimator variance, given by the
   Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Probabilistic methods then use this
   variance model to estimate upper bounds on localization error, which are
   computed locally by wireless devices. Best fits between the model and
   the actual location error variance using both time of arrival (TOA) and
   received signal strength (RSS) distance measurements were determined by
   a least squares estimator over repeated localization simulations. The
   proposed method was used to accurately estimate location error at given
   probabilities in a multitude of randomly generated network topologies
   within +/- 10\% of the actual localization error. Once known, estimates
   can be integrated into location dependent schemes to improve on their
   robustness to localization error. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study is the first of a three-part research program which involves
   fuel characterization, testing in a 1 MWth gasifier, and computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling for entrained-flow slagging gasification.
   Focus is on the behaviour of inorganic fuel components since the end
   goal is to develop a CFD model which includes inorganic matter
   transformations. Initially, four coals were selected for this program
   and one limestone was also chosen to act as a fluxing agent. Fuel
   properties related to ash particle formation, gas-particle transport,
   particle sticking, slag flow and slag-refractory interaction are
   provided with prioritization based on their potential application for
   screening of potential fuels, ensuring proper gasifier operation,
   gasifier design and/or CFD modeling. The selection of one or multiple
   experimental and/or modeling techniques is justified and applied to
   determine each relevant property. Of the four coals tested, one was
   deemed unsuitable based on initial screening tests. Two of the three
   remaining coals require fluxing for proper gasifier operation. Design
   tests showed that alumina is preferred over silicon carbide and
   alumina-chromia (with 30 wt.\% chromia) for use as refractory material
   with the selected fuels. Characterization for CFD modeling is also
   discussed with results provided as supplementary data. (C) 2012 Crown

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{A novel computational measurement-based control strategy (CMCS) was
   developed to manage leachate recirculation based on monitoring of key
   system parameters. The proposed framework identifies the operational
   phase of the controlled bioreactor, and accordingly determines
   quantities of leachate, buffer, supplemental water, and nutritional
   amendments required to provide the temporally changing landfill
   microbial consortia with their growth requirements. The CMCS was tested
   in a pilot-scale bioreactor cell (0.5 m(3)) for a period of nine months,
   and compared to a conventional open-loop leachate control scheme (fixed
   recirculation rate of produced leachate) in an identical cell. Overall,
   positive results confirmed the applicability and benefits of the control
   strategy to optimize the leachate recirculation and manipulation
   processes. Throughout the 21 operational cycles of the controlled
   bioreactor cell, the maximum specific daily recirculation volume (24
   L/t/d) was sixfold the minimum volume determined. The amounts of
   inoculum/nutrient, buffer, and supplemental water were also computed
   cyclically, and ranged between 2\% and 11\%, 1\% and 9\%, and 3\% and
   16\% of the total volume recycled, respectively. The recirculated
   volumes of leachate and other amendments were highly variable, and did
   not follow any predictable trends. In general, CMCS achieved proper
   control with a minimal use of resources, e.g. it utilized about 55\%
   less buffer compared with the leachate neutralization practice commonly
   used in lab- and pilot-scale studies. The greater degradation rates of
   organic matter combined with relative increases in biogas production
   (1.7-fold greater) demonstrate that calculation-based recirculation
   stimulated the methanogenic activity and accelerated the bioreactor
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Techniques to pattern cells on biocompatible hydrogels allow for the
   creation of highly controlled cell microenvironments within materials
   that mimic the physicochemical properties of native tissues. Such
   technology has the potential to further enhance our knowledge of cell
   biology and to play a role in the development of novel tissue
   engineering devices. Light is an ideal stimulus to catalyze pattern
   formation since it can be controlled spatially as well as temporally.
   Herein, we have developed and enhanced a hydrogel cell patterning
   strategy. It is based on photoactive caged RGDS peptides incorporated
   into a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel, which can be subsequently
   activated with near-UV light to create cell-adhesive regions within an
   otherwise non-adhesive hydrogel. With this strategy, we have been able
   to pattern multiple cell populationseither in contact with one another
   or held aparton an underlying chemically patterned HA hydrogel.
   Furthermore, the hydrogel cell pattern could be altered with time, even
   2 weeks after initial seeding, to create additional adhesive regions to
   regulate the direction of cell growth and migration. These dynamic
   hydrogel cell patterns, created with a standard fluorescence microscope,
   were shown to be robust and lasted at least 3 weeks in vitro. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Wavelength reuse in a symmetric ultra-wideband (UWB) over
   wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network based on
   injection locking of a Fabry-Perot laser diode (FP-LD) and polarization
   multiplexing is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In the
   proposed scheme, the downstream UWB signal and baseband signal are
   generated and polarization multiplexed in the central station and sent
   to a base station (BS) over an optical fiber. At the BS, one of the
   downstream signals is selected to injection lock the FP-LD. It is
   demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that the upstream service
   performance is less sensitive to the modulation depth of the downstream
   UWB signal than the baseband signal, and the use of the downstream UWB
   signal as the injection signal would contribute to a better transmission
   performance for both the downstream and upstream services. Thus, the
   downstream UWB signal is selected as the injection signal. An experiment
   is performed. When the FP-LD is injection locked by a downstream UWB
   signal, a clear optical carrier is generated which is reused for
   upstream UWB and baseband transmission. A bidirectional point-to-point
   transmission of 1.25 Gb/s UWB signal and 10 Gb/s baseband signal over
   25-km single-mode fiber using a single wavelength is demonstrated. The
   bit error rate performances and the eye diagrams for both downstream and

Abstract = {{Small amounts of Pd served as a reducing agent to produce sub-100 nm
   polygonally-shaped Ni98Pd2 materials in ethylene glycol. As-synthesized
   particles were crystallized into fcc Ni with a fraction of
   beta-Ni(OH)(2), and exhibited very low to no activity towards ammonia
   electrooxidation. Their catalytic activity has been significantly
   improved by building up a layer of Ni(OH)2 by cyclic voltammetry between
   -0.95 and 1.35 V vs. HgO/Hg in NaNO3 at pH 9. XPS analysis before and
   after the electrochemical treatment confirmed the transformation of Ni
   to higher state of oxidation. Ammonia electrooxidation on Ni(OH)(2)/NiPd
   occurred at around 1.28 V vs. HgO/Hg and was highly pH-dependent. At
   concentrations less than 100 mM, the direct electron transfer took
   place, whereas at higher ammonia concentrations it was the indirect
   electron transfer mechanism. A 9-h galvanostatic electrolysis at 20 mA
   cm(-2) showed that 64\% of the initial ammonia was degraded at 38\%
   average current efficiency. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Hard target penetration is a very complex dynamic problem, and the
   measured signals contain axial de-acceleration, vibration, and other
   weakly interference signals, so it belongs to the non-stationaty random
   vibration process. The filtering method based on threshold is one of the
   effective methods on some extend to eliminate useless signals. However,
   the high-g acceleration signal components which related to vibration and
   interference in penetration processing usually cannot be completely
   filtering by using the Hard Threshold and Soft Threshold method As such,
   we propose a new method to establish a unified adaptive cognitive
   wavelet decomposition filtering model base on the situation of the
   wavelet multi-scale transform. Further we establish similar signals with
   penetration processing and compare the filtering effects among LMS
   algorithms and Hard/Soft Threshold in mat lab simulation software.
   Finally we get the best choice for the type of signal filtering, which
   provide the best treatment for the measured penetration signals.}},

Abstract = {{Gesture-based human-computer interaction is presently an important area
   of research that aims to make reliable touch-free user interfaces a
   reality. More recent gesture detection technologies use cameras that
   rely on near-infrared (NIR) illumination to obtain 3D depth information
   for objects within the camera's field-of-view. These cameras use either
   structured light, time-of-flight (ToF), or stereoscopy. Depth images
   allow a person's body and hands to be separated from the background,
   thereby permitting modern image processing algorithms to be used for
   greatly improved gesture detection. This paper presents a new depth
   generation principle that uses a monotonic increasing and decreasing
   function to control NIR illumination pulses. Reflected light pulses are
   captured as a series of images and the depth map of the visible objects
   is calculated in real-time using reconfigurable hardware. Measurements
   and results are given to explain how the depth map is built and how the
   camera allows gestures to be used to control a video game console.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses inter-robot and human-robot communication by bare
   hand dynamic gestures. We use a Bag-of-Features and a local part model
   approach for bare hand dynamic hand gesture recognition from video. We
   used dense sampling to extract local 3D multiscale whole-part features.
   We adopted three dimensional histograms of a gradient orientation (3D
   HOG) descriptor to represent features. The K-means++ method was applied
   to cluster the visual words. Dynamic hand gesture classification was
   completed by using a Bag-of-features (BOF) and non-linear support vector
   machine (SVM) method. A BOF does not track the order of events. To
   counter the unordered events of the BOF approach, we used a multiscale
   local part model to preserve temporal context. Initial experimental
   results on the newly collected complex dataset show a higher level of
   recognition. We used the same above mentioned approach for inter-robot
   communication by using two sample hand models.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is a
   sophisticated task that determines the accuracy of thought pattern
   recognition performed by computer-brain interface (BCI) which, in turn,
   determines the degree of naturalness of the interaction provided by that
   system. However, classifying the EEG signals is not a trivial task due
   to their non-stationary characteristics. In this paper, we introduce and
   utilize incremental quantum particle swarm optimization (IQPSO)
   algorithm for incremental classification of EEG data stream. IQPSO
   builds the classification model as a set of explicit rules which
   benefits from semantic symbolic knowledge representation and enhanced
   comprehensibility. We compared the performance of IQPSO against ten
   other classifiers on two EEG datasets. The results suggest that IQPSO
   outperforms other classifiers in terms of classification accuracy,
   precision and recall.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently use of sensors to collect sensitive parameters had only
   few risk factors such as sensor malfunction, uncertainty of data
   collection, or missing data coverage. Some issues in these categories
   were addressed by multi-sensor application or sensor fusion. However,
   advancement in technology and advent of wireless sensors in a networked
   environment, brought along a new risk factor related to the security in
   wireless sensor network.
   Therefore security in Wireless Sensor Network WSNs is challenging and
   critical to the functionality of the networked sensors. This is very
   important in cases of highly secure environment, especially in
   industrial, military, and medical domains. The standard WSN protocols
   focus on energy efficiency; transmission efficiency, and routing. WSN is
   known for limitations on hardware and software and for
   resources-constrained in general. An adaptive model of security that
   meets requirements and constraints in WSN is Intrusion Detections. This
   article investigates security in WSN and presents a design process for
   achieving optimum security based on requirements and constraints in
   WSNs. Further, comparative results between a proposed technique and

Abstract = {{Non-rigid shapes are generally known as objects where the three
   dimensional geometry may deform by internal and/or external forces.
   Deformable shapes are all around us, ranging from macromolecules, to
   natural objects such as the trees in the forest or the fruits in our
   gardens, and even human bodies. The development of measurements to
   accurately describe such non-rigid shapes has wide application. It
   follows that, when aiming to perform measurement of non-rigid shapes,
   one need to ensure that the intrinsic geometries are preserved in the
   presence of deformations. This paper introduces physics-based techniques
   for the measurements of such deformable shapes. Our work is based on the
   idea of heat propagation through a surface. Specifically, we introduce
   so-called multi-measurements to measure the distance between two points
   on an object and reflective measurements that allows for the exploration
   of a region around a point. Further, we introduce two novel
   meta-measurements that extend the bag of features concept. We illustrate
   our methodology in the context of structural proteomics and molecular
   docking.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the optimal tuning of
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for a pancake direct
   current (DC) torque motor system that belongs to a Diesel engine exhaust

   Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithms solve an optimization problem
   which targets the minimization of an objective function expressed as the
   weighted sum of overshoot plus the integral of squared control error,
   and the parameters of the PID controllers are the variables of the
   objective function. Our BFO algorithms are characterized by the
   validation of the position of bacteria only if the PID control system
   response is in a valid range. A digitally simulated case study which
   deals with the shaft angle control of a DC torque motor system is
   considered. The impact of four parameters of one BFO algorithm on the

Abstract = {{we propose a distributed Relative Cooperative Positioning algorithm
   (ReCoP) that computes the position in relation to other vehicles in the
   network. ReCoP does not depend on fixed reference node/s or
   infrastructure, and it is independent of Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS) reading. Instead one node in each group of one-hop
   connected neighbours establishes relative map for group members. Then
   when messages (e.g., warning messages) arrive to the vehicle with
   gateway responsibility, the coordinates transform to be recognized by
   different relative maps. This approach can be utilized in data
   dissemination to reduce broadcast storm problem due to redundant
   retransmissions. It has been compared with the Local Self Positioning
   (LSP) in which each vehicle individually builds its own local relative
   map. The performance of the proposed algorithm, ReCoP, has been
   evaluated with respect to different traffic density, transmission range,
   and speed. The simulation results illustrate that ReCoP computes the
   relative position with more precision than LSP. It also demonstrates the
   scalability, robustness, and flexibility of the proposed ReCoP compared
   to LSP.}},

Abstract = {{Discovery Services refer to a suite of network services enabling
   efficient track-and-trace capabilities of objects in the Internet of
   Things (IoT). Deployment of such services may be performed in the form
   of simple queries originating from the corresponding stakeholders either
   to store/retrieve data in/from the Cloud. An example of such services is
   the EPCglobal Discovery Services. The extremely sensitive nature and the
   expected large scale of the exchanged data in the IoT (e.g. the
   EPCglobal Network) highlight the importance of a security scheme capable
   of distinguishing safe queries from risky ones, based both on a vector
   of observed real values extracted from the current query, and on a
   pattern inferred from the past queries. In this paper, we propose a
   probabilistic security scheme enhancing the accuracy of detecting risky
   queries in the EPCglobal Network. Our proposed scheme is based on a
   Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is first trained, then used to infer the
   state of the query at hand. We assume that the observed real values,
   extracted from the queries, follow Gaussian distributions, depending on
   the inherent nature of the query at hand; i.e. safe or risky. We
   conducted extensive experiments. The results show that our HMM-based
   security scheme enhances the accuracy of detecting risky queries.}},

   efficiency. At the same time, the network coverage and links quality are
   taken into account. Furthermore, the effect of using realistic network
   and energy consumption model in cluster-based communication for WSN was

Abstract = {{A reliable and time-efficient communication system between vehicles and
   infrastructure is an indispensable issue in the development of a smart
   city. The vehicles must have the ability to transmit and receive urgent
   messages with low latency. Infrastructures such as hospitals and police
   stations should be equipped with base stations capable of communicating
   in near real-time fashion with vehicles. In addition to that, in a smart
   grid scenario, this is especially important between the power charging
   station and the Electric Vehicles (EVs). Nowadays the best standard that
   is designed to operate in a vehicular environment is the IEEE 802.11p
   standard. It is a contention-based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol
   that provides Quality of Service (QoS) for Wireless Access in the
   Vehicular Environment (WAVE). In this paper we propose a low-latency
   version of this protocol by introducing a finite buffer at the MAC level
   that momentarily stocks the packets coming from the application layer.
   Our proposed architecture is modeled with a Markov chain analytical
   method. Our results show an enhancement in the performance in terms of
   the end-to-end delay and an improvement in the throughput.}},

Abstract = {{A creep Deformation Mechanism Map (DMM) of an engineering alloy can be
   an effective tool for developing physics based prognostics systems. Many
   classical diffusion based rate equations have been developed for time
   dependent plastic flow where dislocation glide, dislocation
   glide-plus-climb and vacancy diffusion driven grain boundary migration
   (diffusion creep) are rate controlling. Long term creep testing and
   analysis of complex engineering alloys has shown that power law
   breakdown phenomenon is related to the dominance of Grain Boundary
   Sliding (GBS) as opposed to diffusion creep. Rate equations are now
   available for GBS in complex alloys and, in this paper, a DMM is
   constructed for Waspaloy (a Nickel-Based Superalloy) and validated by
   comparison with a collection of experimental data obtained from the
   literature. The GBS accommodated by wedge type cracking is considered
   dominant at low homologous temperatures (0.3 to 0.5Tm - temperature in
   Kelvin) whereas GBS accommodated by power-law or cavitations creep
   dominates above 0.55Tm.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic Routing (OR) is a new class of routing protocols that
   selects the next-hop forwarder on-the-fly. It takes advantage of the
   broadcast nature of the wireless medium. By selecting a set of
   candidates for the purpose of forwarding the packet toward the
   destination, OR improves the reliability of wireless transmissions. In
   this paper, we propose a new heuristic and a quick candidate selection
   algorithm based on the link delivery probability from one node to a
   candidate node. We shall refer to it as Heuristic Candidate selection
   algorithm based on Optimum delivery Probability (HU-COP). HU-COP finds
   candidates through links that offer delivery probabilities that are
   close to optimum. We compare HU-COP with the two other wellknown
   candidate selection algorithms proposed in the literature. The numerical
   results in terms of the expected number of transmissions show that
   HU-COP outperforms the well-known ExOR. In addition, the performance of
   HU-COP is very close to the results of the most efficient algorithm in
   various scenarios. Furthermore, HU-COP identifies the sets of candidates
   much faster than the other algorithms under study.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new protocol for EPC discovery services,
   namely Delay Tolerant EPC-BGP (DT-EPC-BGP), which is an extension of the
   previously proposed EPC-BGP. By inheriting all features of EPC-BGP
   features, DT-EPC-BGP introduces a new mechanism that allows information
   about the status of the mesh nodes to be exchanged along with other
   routing information. This new extension sets update sessions with only
   active nodes, and drops any update request that is destined to an
   inactive node. We have evaluated DT-EPC-BGP in terms of blocking
   probability, similarities among routing tables and number of updates in
   comparison to EPC-BGP. We have shown that DT-EPC-BGP outperforms its
   predecessor, EPC-BGP by introducing lower blocking probability, lower
   inconsistency in routing tables among different nodes, and lower number
   of updates which leads to less control overhead messages.}},

Abstract = {{We address nonuniform coverage with networked multi-agent systems and a
   nonuniform, time varying risk density function throughout the spatial

   different from existing ones in that the evolution of the density is
   described by a conservation law with time-varying boundary conditions.
   By adopting a first gradient constitutive relation between the flux and
   the density we obtain a simple diffusion equation. The diffused density
   is then employed by a platoon of autonomous agents for spatially
   configuring themselves in optimum locations so that the coverage metric
   is maximized or minimized. We exploit the generalized centroidal Voronoi
   tessellation technique for generating the motion control of autonomous
   agents. By assuming that the risk density evolves much faster than the
   boundary conditions, we prove that the generalized Voronoi centroids are
   equilibrium points for the coverage metric. A set of numerical
   simulations illustrate the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{The connectivity of multi-band cognitive radio ad hoc networks is
   studied using a new natural connectivity based metric and compared to
   the traditional probability of finding a route metric. The analysis is
   developed based on a generalized cognitive radio networks model where
   multiple primary users with independent activity factors operating in
   multiple frequency bands are considered. The adjacent graph matrix
   elements, representing the weights associated to the network graph
   edges, are set proportional to the activity factors of the primary
   users. It is shown that the proposed connectivity metric is convex with
   the primary users activity factors and can efficiently capture the
   behaviour of the probability of finding a route metric with a
   significant computational complexity reduction. Finally, the proposed
   metric presents a solid analytical tool for planning and studying the
   effect of different network parameters on the connectivity of cognitive
   radio networks.}},

   on the design of WSNs; all algorithms and protocols should be
   lightweight and conservative in their power consumption. In this paper
   we aim at researching the opportunity of building a hybrid MAC protocol
   for beacon-enabled 802.15.4-based WSNs that incorporates some aspects of
   802.11 MAC into the operation of 802.15.4 MAC. We will study the impact
   of increasing the number of Clear Channel Assessments (CCAs) on the
   performance, and control this increase adaptively to better enhance the
   efficiency of the network. The main goal is to design a MAC protocol
   that can respond to the changes in the network (in terms of the size of
   the network, the intensity of the traffic, or the urgency of the
   traffic).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new threshold-based discovery service for
   the EPCglobal network to be used by the Electronic Product Code-Border
   Gateway Protocol (EPC-BGP)-based discovery service. Our proposal employs
   hybrid threshold-based triggering and enables status updates in the
   routing tables based on either elapsed time or number of changes in the
   status of the EPC whereas the term threshold denotes the upper bound on
   the ratio of changes in the EPC status table of a supply chain. We
   evaluate our hybrid technique with respect to update blocking
   probability and define three types of blocking, namely the Justified
   Update Blocking (JUB), Unjustified Update Acceptance (UUA), and
   Unjustified Update Blocking (UUB). We investigate the impact of the
   frequency of update advertisements on the blocking probability. Through
   numerical results we show that the hybrid threshold-based update
   outperforms its counterparts in terms of all types of blocking
   probability. We further show that the proposed hybrid threshold-based
   update technique can control blocking probability under frequent product
   recall arrivals. Moreover, numerical results confirm that our proposal
   can adapt to traffic change and reduce the blocking probability
   significantly compared to its counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has become more popular
   recently. It has been shown to be an effective optimization tool in most
   of the applications. In this paper, we have applied the PSO algorithm to
   a sample Artificial Neural Network (ANN) application, measured the
   improvement, and optimized the PSO parameters to improve results as much
   as possible. The application is character recognition of English
   numbers. Two indicators of accuracy of the results and processing time
   are taken in to account. The objective of this paper is to show that we
   can empirically adjust the PSO parameters to optimize PSO for the best
   results. Through several iterative processes of extracting improvements
   and adjusting the PSO parameters, we have recorded optimized PSO
   parameters and respective variances for similar applications. Indeed,
   the method can also be extended to alphabetic characters by just
   providing the input training patterns of each character. The details of
   the proposed approach and the simulation results are recorded in this
   paper.}},

   broadcast the congestion information to the drivers in order to detour
   for avoiding congestion. Matlab simulation of this proposed model was
   performed with traffic generated following Poisson Distribution for
   twelve selected important intersections of a city and cost function was
   estimated for the generated traffic. Simulation results show that this

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel mechanism for automatically matting

   mechanism simulates the process of human perception on isolating
   foreground elements in a given scene. The perceptual analysis is
   performed on optimized hue, saturation, lightness and chroma from
   CIECAM02 color appearance model, which has the best overall performance
   across the tested data sets. The foreground and background sample-pairs
   for alpha estimation are adaptively predicted based on the prior
   analysis rather than direct sampling. To achieve real-time performance,
   the entire procedures are optimized for parallel processing on the GPUs
   (Graphics Processing Units). The qualitative evaluation shows that our
   determined alpha mattes and foreground colors especially in large
   seemingly translucent areas are more acceptable by human eyes. And the
   quantitative comparison between our mechanism and other existing
   approaches also validates the advantage in speed and quality.}},

Abstract = {{Requirements are artefacts often described with text and models. It is
   important to manage traceability between requirements and other software
   artefacts, including designs and test cases, also often captured with

   the RMS and model artefacts created outside the RMS, through complex
   standards or proprietary solutions. This paper proposes a new
   Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for describing the concepts of a modeling
   language intended to be traced using an RMS, with tool support handling
   the import and re-import of models and of their traceability links. The
   Model Import DSL (MI-DSL) is supported by an Xtext-based editor and the
   automatic generation of an import library targeting a leading RMS,
   namely IBM Rational DOORS. The language and the tools are demonstrated
   for model import and evolution scenarios with two different modeling
   languages. This work contributes a simple yet reliable mechanism to
   define and support traceability between requirements and models from

Abstract = {{Fault-tolerance is becoming an increasingly crucial aspect of the design
   of Networked Control Systems (NCSs) in order to mitigate system
   downtime. However, the introduction of fault-tolerance is typically
   associated with significant traffic overhead. In this paper, an
   optimization to an Ethernet-based network fabric fault-tolerant NCS is
   proposed. The proposed optimization halves the amount of overhead
   traffic necessary for fault-tolerance while maintaining the same level
   of robustness. Moreover, based on the same optimization methodology, an
   expanded model with two in-line cells is presented and subsequently
   tested. The expanded two-cell model is designed to provide
   controller-level in addition to fabric-level fault-tolerance.
   Simulations using OPNET followed the traffic analysis, and proved the
   models to be fully reliable in the case of a single failure at a time,
   for both the single-cell model and the expanded two-cell network.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, multi-view/3D video applications, such as
   three-dimensional television (3DTV) and free-viewpoint television (FTV),
   have drawn increasing attention. Since the amount of data that has to be
   stored or transmitted increases proportionally with the number of
   cameras, efficient compression of multi-view/3D video is crucial.
   Scalable multi-view video coding is one of the methods to address this
   challenge. But, in streaming multi-view/3D video over a network to
   heterogeneous receivers, efficient video compression while maintaining a
   high quality of received video is very challenging. This paper presents
   a novel method for rate-distortion optimization in scalable multi-view
   video. We apply the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in minimizing
   the perceptual distortion of decoded video under the conditions that the
   sum of bits generated from different views is constrained within a given
   bit budget. Since the constraint-based optimization problem is usually
   computational intensive, our proposed approach considers the concept of
   disparity between layers and disparity between views to reduce this
   computational complexity. Simulation results indicate that the proposed
   approach is able to meet network bandwidth limitations with acceptable
   overall video quality.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with inter-UAV communication
   capabilities can be used to extend the communication range with the
   ground control station (GCS). Researchers from the Mechanical and
   Electrical Engineering at the University of Ottawa have developed a new
   dirigible autonomous UAV with a flight duration of 24+ hrs, a limitied
   payload of 1 kg for electronics, and requiring a communication range of
   1-10 kilometres. To support this requirement a new communication
   framework was introduced and implemented based on the ad hoc network
   concepts. With one radio module per dirigible the designed and developed
   wireless interface allows any UAV or the GCS to exchange flight control
   commands, telemetry data, and aerial photos. We made use of the advanced
   networking tools of the Digi's 9XTend (TM) radio modules to develop
   route tracing, traffic prioritization, and minimizing self-interference
   between simultaneous transmissions. Initial test results showed that
   without any data flow control in the network, packets can be received in
   the wrong order following different routes and cause errors in the
   transmission of photos or recorded video. This issue was resolved

Abstract = {{Gauging the similarity among objects is a fairly common and important
   task that underpins many popular machine learning endeavours such as
   classification or clustering. Uncertainty representation mechanisms,
   such as rough set theory, or information processing paradigms like
   granular computing also lean upon well-defined similarity measures to
   better model the objects in the universe of discourse. In this
   information-laden world, the responsibility of designing these crucial
   granular constructs is shifting from domain experts to intelligent
   systems that automatically learn from data. An approach that hybridizes
   particle swarm optimization with elements from rough set theory has been
   recently proposed {[}1] to build these similarity measures from scratch.
   However, this scheme still remains fairly sensitive to the values of the
   similarity thresholds both in the input attribute space and the decision
   space. In this paper, we tackle this limitation by employing fuzzy sets
   to categorize the domain of both similarity thresholds. The efficacy of
   the proposed methodology is illustrated with the K-nearest neighbor
   classifier. Empirical results over several well-known repositories
   confirm that this approach preserves the classification accuracy while
   reducing the number of system parameters and enhancing its
   interpretability.}},

Abstract = {{Electrification is foremost actor in superseding internal combustion
   engine vehicles with electric vehicles (EV). The EV technology will lead
   to fundamental shift in existing power grid as well as transportation
   systems. In Smart grid, EVs play vital roles to reduce dependence on
   fossil fuel, in turn, minimize green house gas emissions. In
   Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network, EVs communicate with power grid operators
   to trade demand response services by delivering stored electricity into
   the electric power grid. Communication between aggregator and EVs is
   central for such an approach. Viewing security and privacy requirements
   for V2G communications, privacy-preserving technique is central for
   efficacious V2G network implementation. In this paper, we have proposed
   effective security and privacy-preserving mechanism for aggregator based
   V2G network, which is built on ECC-based restrictive partially blind
   signature. We have provided security analysis and shown that the
   proposed mechanism is efficient than existing ones in terms of
   computational overheads.}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption is one of the most fundamental constraints in
   wireless sensor network (WSN) design. While data transmission is usually
   the most energy consuming event, minimizing the transmit power under the
   condition of satisfying the required packet transmission quality would
   be an important and effective strategy for reducing energy consumption.
   In this paper, a novel Adaptive Transmit Power Adjustment technique
   (ATPA) for ZigBee network under Wi-Fi interference is proposed and
   implemented in the Crossbow MICAz motes of our testbed. The proposed
   ATPA technique dynamically and rapidly adapts to the varying
   interference from the collocated wireless local area network (WLAN) and
   selects optimal transmit power level that not only decreases the energy
   consumption of packet transmissions, but also maintains the required
   packet loss rate (PLR). The effectiveness of ATPA has been validated
   through the comprehensive performance evaluation experiments conducted
   on our testbed.}},

   experiments with nonclassical light sources: (1) single-photon sources
   exhibiting antibunching (separation of all photons in time), which are
   key components for secure quantum communication systems and (2)
   entangled photon source with photons exhibiting quantum interference in
   a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. In the first part, both nematic and
   cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) hosts were used to create definite
   linear or circular polarization of antibunched photons emitted by
   different types of single emitters (dye molecules, nanocrystal quantum
   dots (NQDs), nanodiamonds with color centers, etc.). If the photon has
   unknown polarization, filtering it through a polarizer to produce the
   desired polarization for quantum key distribution with bits based on
   polarization states of photons will reduce by half the efficiency of a
   quantum cryptography system. In the first part, we also provide our
   results on observation of a circular polarized microcavity resonance in
   NQD fluorescence in a 1-D chiral photonic bandgap CLC microcavity. In
   the second part of this paper with indistinguishable, time-entangled
   photons, we demonstrate our experimental results on simulating quantum
   mechanical barrier tunneling phenomena. A Hong-Ou-Mandel dip (quantum
   interference effect) is shifted when a phase change was introduced on
   the way of one of entangled photons in pair (one arm of the
   interferometer) by inserting in this arm an electrically controlled
   planar-aligned nematic LC layer between two prisms in the conditions
   close to a frustrated total internal reflection. By applying different
   AC-voltages to the planar-aligned nematic layer and changing its
   refractive index, we can obtain various conditions for incident photon
   propagation-from total reflection to total transmission. Measuring
   changes of tunneling times of photon through this structure with
   femtosecond resolution permitted us to answer some unresolved questions
   in quantum mechanical barrier tunneling phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Personality plays an important role in the personalized experience of
   ambient environments. Several aspects of ambient environments, such as
   advertisement and marketing, can adapt according to individual user's

   various personality traits by analyzing Internet usage statistics.
   Researchers have used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and various other
   nostalgic websites to collect usage statistics. However, we are still
   far from a successful outcome. In this paper, we use a range of
   divergent features of the Facebook and LinkedIn social networks, both
   separately and collectively, in order to achieve better results. Our
   experimental results show that the accuracy of personality detection
   improves with the use of complementary features of multiple social
   networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on
   detecting personality from multiple social networks. Furthermore, this
   is also the first attempt to detect personality from the LinkedIn social

   cup (reaching game) in the horizontal plane. In addition, accurate
   performance measures are provided for each exercise to quantitatively
   evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment plan for each patient. The

Abstract = {{Ambient intelligence environments are technologically augmented
   surroundings that aim to provide personalized services to the users
   based on their context. Identifying these services for the users has
   become an increasingly challenging task. The overwhelming number of
   services in the ambient environment has made the selection and
   management of services even more challenging. To address this problem,
   researchers have proposed several techniques, such as creating a user
   model and selecting services based on that model; applying rule-based
   approach to match the relevant services; utilizing a combination of
   user's profile, context, interaction history and service reputation to
   select the best services for the user, and so on. Most of these
   techniques obtain the preference of a user based on his/her own
   interaction and profile and do not consider the power of collaborative
   selection approach. In this paper, we propose to use the collaborative
   recommendation technique to select services for a user based on multiple
   users' interactions and profile. Accordingly, we demonstrate the
   potential of the proposed approach through preliminary experiment.}},

   has at most k slaves (outdegree-limited scatternets). MS-freeness and
   outdegree-limitation are two properties that significantly improve the
   quality of the scatternets. Contrary to existing BSF algorithms, our
   algorithms consider these properties under pessimistic environments
   modeled as arbitrary networks (i.e. no assumptions are made on the
   underlying network topology). The optimality of our algorithms are
   proven. Future directions are proposed to further improve the empirical

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to greatly reduce the carbon
   emissions from surface transport if they are widely used and efficiently
   charged. One of the main limitations of EVs is their limited range and
   relatively long recharging times. This limitation is closely associated
   with the current battery technologies used in the EVs. In order
   efficiently utilize the EVs, their charging schedules and locations must
   be effectively integrated within the smart grid. Real-time and reliable
   integration of EVs with the smart grid could solve problems related to
   demand response, cost and time of charging. In this paper, we propose a
   Quality of Service (QoS) scheme for Charging EVs (QCEV) in a smart grid
   environment. The proposed scheme provides centralized QoS
   differentiation to EVs that are communicating with an Access Point (AP)
   in situations where immediate EV battery charging is required. Our
   simulation results show that QCEV could significantly improve the
   performance of the wireless communication network especially in dense
   deployments.}},

Abstract = {{Motion capture technology has been widely adopted by computer gaming and
   the movie making industries. The technology also found a suitable niche
   in some areas of medicine. However, while sports and arts also present
   important opportunities for analysis of the human gesture, whether to
   improve performance or prevent injuries, the potential of motion capture
   was not yet fully exploited in these fields. This paper examines the
   potential of markerless motion capture in the context of piano pedagogy
   and performance evaluation when somatic training methods are used. An
   affordable motion capture platform based on Kinect sensor is designed to
   suit the specific requirements of piano playing, and an early
   experimental investigation of the suitability of the technology for this
   application is reported.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of Public Safety Network(PSN) is critical for saving lives
   in tragic incidents. Within PSN, privacy preservation becomes vital
   since the information being transferred may be personally identifiable
   (or private for short). Long Term Evolution(LTE) has been chosen to be
   the suitable technology for PSN because of its unique characteristics
   such as higher capacity, higher spectral efficiency, enhanced security
   and reliability and so on. In spite of those features, several issues
   related to privacy within LTE have been detected by the experts.
   However, a study of privacy challenges and requirements in PSN has not
   yet emerged. This study aims to highlight privacy issues of the LTE
   related to PSN. Thus, a comprehensive review of the relevant works
   proposed to improve privacy of the LTE security architecture is
   provided. Furthermore, the feasibility of those efforts for PSN is
   discussed. Finally, an efficient solution is proposed to enhance the
   privacy of the LTE-based PSN. The idea is to hide the real International
   Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) within a random bit stream of certain
   size where only the subscriber and HSS could extract the respective
   IMSI. Furthermore, performance evaluation and security analysis of the
   proposed protocol are explored.}},

Abstract = {{The 2 and 6-minute walk tests (2-6MWT) are used by rehabilitation

   produced a new 2-6MWT BlackBerry smartphone application (app) that can

   person moves during the test.
   The smartphone is worn on a belt at the lower back to record phone
   sensor data while walking. This data is used to identify foot strikes,
   calculate the total distance walked and step timing, and analyze pelvis
   accelerations. Information on symmetry, walking changes over time, and
   poor walking patterns is not available from a typical 2-6MWT and could
   help with clinical decision-making.
   The 2-6MWT app was evaluated in a pilot test using data from five
   able-bodied participants. Foot strike time was within 0.07 seconds when
   compared to gold standard video recordings. The total distance
   calculated by the app was within 1m of the measured distance.}},

   solves a reference trajectory tracking problem expressed as an

   an experiment-based stochastic search algorithm formulated in the
   framework of Iterative Learning Control (ILC) in order to combine the
   advantages of data-driven control and of ILC. The iterative tuning is
   model-free in the sense it does not use control system models. A set of
   simulation results tests and validates the IRIT algorithm in a case
   study related to a representative mechatronics application that deals
   with the position control of a nonlinear aero-dynamical system. The IRIT
   algorithm offers the performance improvement by few iterations and

Abstract = {{We focus on generating consistent reconstructions of indoor spaces from
   a freely moving handheld RGB-D sensor, with the aim of creating virtual
   models that can be used for measuring and remodeling. We propose a novel
   6D RGB-D odometry approach that finds the relative camera pose between
   consecutive RGB-D frames by keypoint extraction and feature matching
   both on the RGB and depth image planes. Furthermore, we feed the
   estimated pose to the highly accurate KinectFusion algorithm, which uses
   a fast ICP (Iterative-Closest-Point) to fine-tune the frame-to-frame
   relative pose and fuse the Depth data into a global implicit surface. We
   evaluate our method on a publicly available RGB-D SLAM benchmark dataset
   by Sturm et al. The experimental results show that our proposed
   reconstruction method solely based on visual odometry and KinectFusion
   outperforms the state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM system accuracy. Our
   algorithm outputs a ready-to-use polygon mesh (highly suitable for
   creating 3D virtual worlds) without any post-processing steps.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-empirical model for predicting the variation of the modulus of
   elasticity with respect to matric suction for soils with plasticity
   index I-p values lower than 16\% was proposed by Vanapalli \& Oh (2010).
   This model has been extended in this paper to predict the modulus of
   elasticity of unsaturated expansive soils. Information required for
   using the model include the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) and
   the modulus of elasticity of the soil under saturated condition along
   with two fitting parameters. Experimental data of triaxial tests for
   three different expansive soils from the literature were used to examine
   the validity of the model. The results of the study suggest that the
   model can reasonably predict the modulus of elasticity of unsaturated
   expansive soils. The study results are encouraging in using modulus of
   elasticity as a tool in the estimation of the heave of expansive soils
   with respect to time.}},

Abstract = {{The key parameter required in the rational design of pavements is the
   resilient modulus (MR). Experimental determination of the variation of
   the MR with respect to the soil suction for compacted fine-grained soils
   is time consuming, cumbersome and expensive. Several investigators in
   recent years have highlighted the strong relationship between the MR and
   the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC). A semi-empirical model is
   proposed in this paper for predicting the variation of the MR with
   respect to the soil suction for unsaturated fine-grained soils using the
   SWCC as a tool. Comparisons are provided between the predicted and
   measured variations of the MR with respect to the soil suction for two
   compacted fine-grained soils. The results of the studies presented in
   this paper are promising for predicting the MR of unsaturated

Abstract = {{The instability of the natural slopes in Champlain sea clay deposits of
   Eastern Canada can be attributed to the loss in the contribution of
   suction (i.e. wetting-induced collapse) towards the shear strength
   associated with subsequent increases in positive pore-water pressures in
   the weathered upper crust. The primary objective of this study is to
   propose an approach that can be used to estimate pore-water pressure
   distribution profiles and determine the safety factors of slopes in
   Champlain sea clay deposits extending the mechanics of unsaturated
   soils. To address this objective, seepage and slope stability were
   undertaken respectively using commercial finite element software, SEEP/W
   and SLOPE/W (Geo-Slope 2007) for a natural Champlain sea clay slope. The
   focus of the analysis was to show how the factor of safety of the slope
   decreases with time for a certain rainfall infiltration. The factor of
   safety versus time relationship derived from the study can be used to
   estimate critical pore-water pressure distribution profiles in a natural
   slope in Champlain sea clay deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Vanapalli and Oh (2010) proposed a semi-empirical model (i.e. VO model)
   to predict the variation of modulus of elasticity (E) with respect to
   the matric suction for unsaturated soils with the aid of two fitting
   parameters, alpha and beta. This model has been successfully used in
   recent years to estimate the settlement and heave behavior of
   unsaturated soils. In this paper, extensive isotropic compression and
   K-0 compression tests were conducted to investigate the volumetric
   change behaviour of a compacted expansive soil from Nanyang, China. The
   two key parameters, modulus of elasticity (E) and suction modulus (H)
   were derived from the volumetric strain constitutive relationship for
   unsaturated soils in terms of two independent stress state variables;
   namely, net mean stress and matric suction. In addition, comparisons are
   provided between the experimental results of the modulus of elasticity
   with respect to suction and predicted values using the VO model. The

   using the commercial software SIGMA/W. A modulus of elasticity model and
   a modified Mohr-Coulomb yield surface function that consider the
   contribution of the matric suction are jointly used in the FEA to
   formulate an elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive model. There is a
   reasonable agreement between the p-d relationships modeled from the FEA
   and measured from model pile tests. Both measured and modeled results

Abstract = {{Privacy concerns exist whenever sensitive data relating to people is
   collected. Finding a way to preserve and guarantee an individual's
   privacy has always been of high importance. Some may decide not to
   reveal their data to protect their privacy. It has become impossible to
   take advantage of many essential customized services without disclosing
   any identifying or sensitive data. The challenge is that each data item
   may have a different value for different individuals. These values can
   be defined by applying weights that describe the importance of data
   items for individuals if that particular private data item is exposed.
   We propose a generic framework to capture these weights from data
   providers, which can be considered as a mediator to quantify privacy
   compromisation. This framework also helps us to identify what portion of
   a targeted population is vulnerable to compromise their privacy in
   return for receiving certain incentives. Conversely, the model could
   assist researchers to offer appropriate incentives to a targeted
   population to facilitate collecting useful data. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Rising infection rates in healthcare is a global issue that causes
   complications for the patient, extended hospital stay, financial
   difficulties, and even death. One of the crucial factors that reduce
   those infections is better hand hygiene. Due to the lack of automated
   systems that could help monitoring hand hygiene compliance and reporting
   on collected data, some hospitals use direct observations, surveys,
   dispensers usage measurements and other such methods to monitor the
   compliance of care providers. This paper proposes an alternative system
   that takes advantage of emerging off-the-shelf infrastructures in
   hospitals, and in particular of Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) and
   intelligent hand sanitizer dispensers. Our RTLS-based approach improves
   upon the current methods by enabling interactions with care providers
   through notifications when they do not execute expected hand hygiene
   actions during care processes, even for fine-grained location

Abstract = {{Electronic associations between a medical device, a patient, and a care
   provider (e.g., a nurse) are new problems in hospitals. As today's
   devices transmit data to electronic health records, correct associations
   are necessary. Moreover, the unknown location of required mobile devices
   (e.g., cardiac monitors) represents additional issues such as
   unnecessary search effort, delays, and equipment underuse. To mitigate
   such issues, a patient-device connectivity management system that
   monitors and tracks patients and their assigned devices becomes an
   interesting option. Popular approaches for managing associations often
   involve bar-coding systems, which still require scanning time and which
   do not solve equipment location issues. This paper proposes a new system
   that exploits existing Real-Time Location System (RTLS) technology to
   track patients and devices and support simpler association by a nurse,
   until disassociation (intended or not) happens, at which point the nurse
   is notified. The system interacts with nurses through their mobile
   device (e.g., a tablet). A prototype version of this system was
   developed as a proof of concept, with correct behaviour. We expect this
   system to help avoid the above issues while increasing patient care
   quality and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Protection of patient's privacy is an obligation enforced by laws and
   regulations in the US, Canada, and other jurisdictions. With exponential
   growth of exchange of personal health information (PHI) brought about by
   e-health, there is a need for smart algorithms that help the data
   publisher to protect PHI. Within exiting privacy models, differential
   privacy is considered one of the strongest privacy protection techniques
   that does not make any assumption about the attacker's background
   knowledge. One way to achieve differential privacy in the
   non-interactive mode is to derive a contingency table of the raw data
   over the database domain, to add noise to each count, and to publish the
   resulting noisy table of counts. This approach, however, is not suitable
   for high-dimensional data with large domains as the added noise
   substantially destroys the utility of the data. In this work, we show
   that when the K-anonymity is preceded by feature selection, it is
   possible to obtain a contingency table with higher counts. As a result,
   when noise is added to satisfy differential privacy, its distorting
   effect is minimized and high utility of the data is preserved. We
   propose the TOP\_Diff algorithm which offers a trade-off between
   anonymization level K and the privacy budget e, and enables us to
   publish privacy preserving datasets with high utility. Our approach is
   capable of handling both numerical and categorical features. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider workflows (called collaborations) involving
   several system components (or roles) where different components may
   independently start their participation in the collaboration, or
   terminate their participation. We consider a global workflow that is
   composed out of several sub-collaborations which should be executed in a
   specified order. For sequential execution, strict and weak sequencing
   have been defined. With strict sequencing all actions of the first
   sub-collaboration must be completed before the second sub-activity may
   start. Weak sequencing was introduced for sequencing distributed
   activities, in particular sequence diagrams, and implies only local
   sequencing at each system component, but no global sequencing rule. We
   define the semantics of a collaboration in terms of the partial order
   among its internal actions, and we also use partial orders to define the
   semantics of strict and weak sequencing of sub-collaborations. Then we
   concentrate on the associativity between weak and strict sequencing.
   Based on the given definitions, it is shown that such associativity is
   satisfied in most situations, however, its validity depends on certain
   conditions about the participation of the different system components in
   the sequenced sub-collaborations and on the question whether they play
   an initiating or terminating role in these activities. The lack of
   associativity may lead to ambiguities when the dynamic behavior of
   complex workflows is developed and specified. These difficulties can be
   avoided by conventions for priorities between weak or strict sequencing,
   and/or some appropriate bracketing structure in the workflow notation.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity-achieving signaling strategies for the Gaussian wiretap MIMO
   channel are investigated without the degradedness assumption. In
   addition to known solutions, a number of new rank-deficient solutions
   for the optimal transmit covariance matrix are obtained. The case of
   weak eavesdropper is considered in details and the optimal covariance is
   established in an explicit, closed-form with no extra assumptions.
   The conditions for optimality of zero-forcing signaling are established,
   and the standard water-filling is shown to be optimal under those
   conditions. No wiretap codes are needed in this case.
   The case of identical right singular vectors for the required and
   eavesdropper channels is studied and the optimal covariance is
   established in an explicit closed form. As a by-product of this
   analysis, we establish a generalization of celebrated Hadamard
   determinantal inequality using information-theoretic tools.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider the problem of designing efficient
   feedback-based scheduling policies for chunked codes (CC) over
   single-path (line) networks with stochastic (queuing) delay. The state
   of the art in such policies are random push (RP) and local-rarest-first
   (LRF), which outperform the original policy of CC, namely the
   uniformly-at-random policy, in terms of the expected throughput even
   without any knowledge about the delay model. To our knowledge, however,
   this work is the first attempt to discover how much better one policy
   can do in an ideal case with perfect feedback when the model of delay is
   perfectly known. Towards this goal, we propose a new policy, referred to
   as transmitted-innovation-maximizer (TIM), based on the expected number
   of innovative packet transmissions at each transmitting node of the
   network by the next transmission time given the feedback information
   from the receiving node about the received packets. Our simulations show
   that TIM provides significantly larger (tighter) lower bounds on the
   maximum expected throughput (compared to the tightest existing bounds
   provided by LRF and RP), and thus it can be considered as the newest
   benchmark in this emerging line of research.}},

Abstract = {{The environments in which businesses currently operate are dynamic and
   constantly changing, with influence from external and internal factors.
   When businesses evolve, leading to changes in business objectives, it is
   hard to determine and visualize what direct Information System responses
   are needed to respond to these changes. This paper introduces an
   enterprise architecture framework which allows for anticipating and
   supporting proactively, adaptation in enterprise architectures as and
   when the business evolves. This adaptive framework exploits and models
   relationships between business objectives of important stakeholders,
   decisions related to these objectives, and Information Systems that
   support these decisions. This framework exploits goal modeling in a
   Business Intelligence context. The tool-supported framework was assessed
   against different levels and types of changes in a real enterprise
   architecture of a Canadian government department, with encouraging
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Submerged groynes (low-profile linear rock structures, also called
   stream barbs) were installed in a reach of Sawmill Creek in Ottawa,
   Canada in order to mitigate outer bank erosion in two consecutive bends.
   The presence of these structures has had an effect on channel bathymetry
   and thusly on flow structure in the area. Changes in both the flow field
   and bathymetry have been recorded over five years (including two years
   prior to implementation of the groynes) using an Acoustic Doppler
   Current Profiler (ADCP), and a total station, respectively.
   Additionally, three-dimensional flow field data were collected using
   Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADV) near the apex of the first bend.
   Measurements were collected prior to implementation of the groynes as
   well as at the end of the study term in order to compare the long term
   effects on flow structure and turbulence in the area. Over the study
   period, it was observed that the thalweg shifted toward the center of
   the channel (away from the outer bank) along with the higher velocity
   flows. This change in flow, as well as the change in apparent turbulence
   at the bend apex, can be attributed to the presence of the submerged
   groynes.}},

Abstract = {{Most rivers in high latitudes of the northern hemisphere are covered by
   ice during the winter period, and this cover can influence hydraulic and
   morphologic characteristics of these rivers. Ice cover development
   introduces an additional boundarylayer on top of the river, and affects
   water velocity magnitude and distribution, water stage and conveyance
   capacity. These variations can influence sediment transport and channel
   morphodynamics, particularly during extreme conditions when ice-jamming
   and break-up can locally accelerate the flow and change velocity
   distribution as well as average velocity magnitude. Although the
   influence of ice on rivers is tremendous and clear, it is not yet well
   studied largely due to the difficulty and danger of river ice field
   studies, especially during the unstable break-up period. In the present
   study, we utilized acoustic instruments to measure a continuous velocity
   profile time series under ice cover, including during the dynamic stage
   of breakup. Specifically, a 1200 kHz Teledyne RD Instruments Acoustic
   Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and a 546 kHz ASL Multi Functional
   Acoustic Water Column Profiler (MF-AWCP) were deployed simultaneously on
   the same bottom mount in the regulated Nelson River, northern Manitoba
   for a four-month period (March-June 2012). The ADCP measured water
   velocity magnitudes over the water column. The (MF-AWCP) measured
   variation of the ice cover thickness and helped to distinguish different
   ice stages from each other. We assessed temporal variation in the
   vertical distribution of velocity and the average velocity magnitude.
   The consequences of this variation on sediment transport are also
   evaluated based on the concentration of suspended particles estimated
   from the backscatter intensity of emitted sound. The results demonstrate
   the influence of the break-up period on average velocity magnitudes and
   velocity distribution in rivers. The significant increase in water
   velocity due to break-up occurrence is followed by high flux of
   suspended sediment that indicates the importance of the role of river
   ice in important river characteristics such as discharge, velocity and
   sediment transport.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D numerical model (Delft3D) was used for morphodynamic modelling of a
   tributary of Stillwater creek, a clay bed urban stream in the city of
   Ottawa, Canada. A main focus of this project was predicting changes in
   river morphology as a result of a proposed culvert realignment and
   meander cut-off for river channel stabilization and habitat creation.
   Design criteria were principally based on the goals of reducing local
   velocities, bed and bank shear stress, and consequent erosion throughout
   the reach. The standard hydrostatic version of Delft3D was used, which
   employs the 2D shallow water equations in layers, thus vertical velocity
   is calculated only from flow continuity. Momentum corrections are
   employed to estimate secondary circulation in bends. Despite these
   limitations, the results of this study suggest that the developed 3D
   numerical model produced a reasonable 3D flow field as well as the
   corresponding patterns of soil erosion and deposition in the studied
   creek. It was also demonstrated that the proposed restoration design
   could be useful for creek protection.}},

Abstract = {{Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the first bio-signal physicians use to
   diagnose cardiovascular diseases, since any kind of heart abnormality
   reflects on it. ECG electrodes play an important role in collecting this
   signal. One type of ECG electrodes which is recently getting more
   popular, especially due to its user friendly features compared to
   traditional Ag/AgCl electrodes, is conductive textile. Similar to any
   other type of electrode, conductive textile is associated with
   skin-electrode interface impedance located between the body (source of
   signal) and ECG monitoring device, thus affecting the recorded ECG
   quality. In this paper, we measure the skin-electrode impedance of
   conductive textile electrodes under various pressure levels, because in
   some applications ECG electrode is located under a blood pressure cuff
   and therefore it is under pressure when the cuff is inflated. We show
   that in fact under pressure the impedance decreases, resulting in a
   higher quality ECG measurement.}},

Abstract = {{There is a large amount of sustained research activity in the area of
   Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Gesture control is one of hottest in
   this field. Although gesture control research began with terminals
   attached to computers in combination with a pointing device, the large
   scale implementation and utilization of gesture control continues to be
   infeasible today. As machine vision, image processing, and artificial
   intelligence algorithms are error prone, gestures will never be
   interpreted in the same way for all instances of the gesture's
   appearance, especially due to changes of the ambient light. This latter
   condition led to the use of near infrared (NIR) illumination such that
   the recorded scene is not affected by light variations. Since the
   posture of a gesture may require the processing of overlapping features,
   reliability is greatly improved through the use of images that contain a
   third dimension. In this paper, a smart and real-time depth camera based
   on a new depth generation principle is introduced. A monotonic
   increasing and decreasing function is used to control the frequency and
   duty-cycle of the NIR illumination pulses. The adjusted light pulses
   reflect off of the object of interest and are captured as a series of
   images. A reconfigurable hardware architecture calculates the depth-map
   of the visible face of the object in real-time from a number of images.
   The final depth map is then used for gesture detection, tracking and
   recognition. A series of tests and measurements will explain how the
   camera builds the depth map and how it can operate in both near and far
   ranges. Results on controlling video game consoles and Smart TVs using
   the above camera will be given.}},

   bacteria only if the control system response is in a valid range is
   inserted in the BFO algorithm. PID and sliding mode controllers are
   optimally tuned by the BFO algorithm focused on solving an optimization
   problem that minimizes an objective function expressed as the weighted
   sum of overshoot plus the integral of squared error. The parameters of
   these two controllers belong to the vector variables of the objective
   function. A case study that deals with the shaft angle control of an

Abstract = {{This paper suggests a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach to the

   set of ten local state-space models of the ABS is first obtained by the
   linearization of the nonlinear state-space model of the ABS process at
   ten operating points. The initial Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models are
   next obtained by the modal equivalence principle, namely by placing the
   local state-space models of the process in the rule consequents. The
   optimization problem targets the minimization of the objective function
   (OF) expressed as the mean squared modeling error, and the vector
   variable of the OF consists of the feet of the triangular input
   membership functions. A PSO algorithm solves the optimization problem
   and gives the optimal T-S fuzzy models. A set of real-time experimental

Abstract = {{Finding correspondences between deformable objects has wide application
   in many domains. In information retrieval, researchers may be interested
   in finding similar objects, while computer animation experts may be
   considering ways to morph shapes. The correspondence problem is
   especially challenging when the objects under consideration are suspect
   to non-rigid deformations, noise and/or distortions. In this paper, a
   novel method using Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) and
   Genetic Algorithms (GA) is presented to address this issue. In our
   QPSO-GA algorithm we formulate the problem of correspondence detection
   as an optimization problem over all possible mapping in between the
   geodesic distance matrices associated with two sets of point clouds. We
   proceed to identify the optimal mapping, by first applying Quantum
   Particle Swarm Optimization to the permutation matrices associated with
   their geodesic distance matrices and then employing Genetic Algorithms
   in order to guide the search. Experimental results suggest that our
   QPSO-GA algorithm is fast, scalable, and robust. Our method accurately
   identifies the correspondences between objects, even in the presence of
   noise and distortion.}},

   are without physiological and theoretical foundation. Moreover, most of
   the existing oscillometric algorithms estimate the BP from the envelope
   of the oscillometric pulses and ignore the wealth of information that
   the oscillometric pulses contain. More information could be obtained
   from the amplitude and time characteristics of the oscillometric pulses
   at different cuff pressures if an accurate mathematical model is
   developed. This paper reviews three novel model-based oscillometric BP
   estimation methods developed by our research group. These methods
   include (i) mathematical modeling of the oscillometric waveform envelope
   and BP estimation using neural networks, (ii) mathematical modeling of
   the oscillometric waveform and parameter estimation using extended
   Kalman filter, and (iii) mathematical modeling of the pulse transit time
   (PTT) and estimation of BP based on PTT-cuff pressure dependency. The
   performance of the proposed methods was evaluated on simulated and
   actual data in terms of mean error, mean absolute error, and standard
   deviation of error.}},

Abstract = {{Optical networks have been shown to be the most viable solution for
   inter-data-center network implementation. Furthermore, elastic optical
   networks incorporating virtualization technology can significantly
   introduce agile delivery of cloud services. In this paper, we present
   resilient design of an inter-data-center network over an elastic optical
   network backbone aiming at minimum outage probability for the demands
   submitted to the Cloud and handled in one or more data centers in the
   network where a data center can have any of the following four

   employment of optical network as the transport medium introduces the
   high availability advantage of the optical network components over the
   lightpaths/light-trees towards data centers. We illustrate the
   advantages of manycast-based provisioning of the upstream data center
   requests over anycast-based provisioning and minimum-cost provisioning
   in terms of outage probability. Furthermore, we show the impact of

Abstract = {{Workloads submitted to the Cloud are handled within the data centers in
   a distributed manner. Reducing the operational expenses is a fundamental
   concern for the operators which can be addressed by efficient design of
   the inter-data-center network. Optical networks have been reported to be
   the best transport media to accommodate the high capacity
   inter-data-center traffic. Furthermore, employment of elastic optical
   networks can further improve bandwidth utilization over the backbone. In
   this paper, we present our solution to minimize the operational expenses
   of the operators through resilient design of an inter-data-center
   network in the presence of dynamic electricity pricing, namely
   Time-of-Use tariffs. The proposed solution periodically virtualizes the
   inter-data-center network topology based on previously forecasted demand
   intensities with the joint objective of minimum outage probability and
   minimized electric bill for the data center and network operators.
   Through simulations, we compare our solution to a naive resilient design
   solution and another design approach aiming at minimum energy
   consumption. We discuss the benefits of our proposal in terms of both
   objectives and provide insights towards challenges and opportunities in
   this field.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method for stand-off detection and localization of human targets
   behind the wall using a monostatic ultra wideband (UWB) radar is
   proposed. In this method, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and
   skewness are employed to achieve detection and localization.
   Identification of possible bins that may contain the target is done
   using the SVD while decision about the presence of the target in the
   identified bin is made using skewness. After preprocessing of the
   signal, skewness of the radar returns over the scans at every bin is
   calculated before applying this methodology. In this method, the
   contributions of the clutter is removed to enhance the returns from the
   target, by removing the dominant singular values iteratively and the
   range profiles over scans are reconstructed at each iteration. After
   each iteration, the energy in the bin over the scans is compared and the
   bin with maximum energy is identified as a potential target location and
   the previously determined skewness at this bin is compared against a
   precomputed data-dependent threshold. A target is declared detected if
   the skewness at the selected bin is lower than the threshold. The
   proposed method is applied on 46 measurements with a single target
   behind 20 cm thick gypsum wall. This method produced a 0\% probability
   of error type I (False detection) and 4.34\% error type II (missed
   detection) while detecting single targets. Using the same approach, it
   was also possible to discriminate between two targets standing 0.3 m
   away from each other and 3.5 m behind a 20 cm thick gypsum wall.}},

Abstract = {{XACML is a powerful and flexible access control (AC) policy language. It
   is an OASIS standard that is now widely used in a variety of
   applications, particularly those that require interoperability between
   AC systems. The language definition includes a precise grammar, syntax,
   and semantics, and it is both expressive and verbose. This combination
   of expressive power and verbosity can lead to difficulty in
   understanding the language's syntax and semantics for both technical and
   nontechnical users alike. As a result, reducing the difficulty of
   editing XACML policies has become an intense area of research. In our
   own work in this area, we previously showed how to render complex XACML
   conditions using a non-technical display notation and showed that it is
   easy to use this notation with interactive plain text editors that do
   not require any technical coding. Although XACML conditions are
   expressive and flexible, XACML targets are actually the most commonly
   used XACML language construct. They have an additional level of
   complexity, especially in version 3.0, due to the fact that the form and
   kinds of XACML constructs allowed in targets is much more limited. This
   paper extends our previous work, showing how the same powerful and
   flexible interactive editing principles can be applied to targets in
   order to allow users to use natural logic rather than implementation
   logic. We extend these principles and fully integrate them into our
   editing tool, easyXACML. This tool is usable by users with no technical
   knowledge of XACML, thus making XACML totally transparent to the user,
   while still retaining all of its functionalities and semantics. Our tool
   thus allows users to focus on policy logic rather than on details of
   syntax. As a result, the risk of errors in policies is greatly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Shocks in granular media have been shown to develop instabilities. We
   address the role that early stages of shock development have on this
   type of instability. We look at the evolution of shock waves driven by a
   piston in a dilute system of smooth inelastic disks, using both discrete
   particle and continuum modelling. To mimic a realistic granular gas,
   viscoelastic collisions are approximated with an impact velocity
   threshold re needed for inelastic collisions to occur. We show that
   behaviour of the shock evolution is dependent on the ratio of piston
   velocity to impact velocity threshold u(p)/u{*}, and the coefficient of
   restitution epsilon For u(p)/u{*} = 2.0, we recover shock evolution
   behaving similar to that observed in purely inelastic media. This is
   characterized by a short period where the shock front pulls towards the
   piston before attaining a developed structure. No pullback is seen for
   u(p)/u{*} = 1.0. Results show the onset of instability for these
   stronger shocks during this evolving stage. These results suggest that
   the early stages of shock evolution play an important role in the shock
   instability.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a dual antenna technique to lessen the phase
   cancellation effect in an augmented ultra high frequency (UHF) radio
   frequency identification (RFID) system. In the augmented RFID system, a
   recently developed semi-passive RFID component (sensatag) has the
   functionality to sense the backscattering communication between a reader
   and a passive tag being within its proximity. This unique functionality
   of sensatag allows for the development of proximity-based indoor
   localization solutions with high localization accuracy. However, due to
   the phase difference between RFID reader's continuous carrier wave (CW)
   and tag's backscattering signal, the backscattered signal from the tag
   received by the sensatag could be significantly attenuated. We call this
   destructive effect as phase cancellation. This problem exists in passive
   RFID system because the RFID reader transmits CW during tag's
   communication. Taking advantage of the spatial diversity of dual antenna
   technique, the probability of phase cancellation effect could be
   reduced. In addition, we present an UHF RFID system simulation
   framework, that includes the model of the sensatag. Then we demonstrate
   the performance of the dual antenna technique with data obtained from
   computer simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Lexicalised concepts are represented in wordnets by word-sense pairs.
   The strength of markedness is one of the factors which influence word
   use. Stylistically unmarked words are largely context-neutral. Technical
   terms, obsolete words, ``officialese{''}, slangs, obscenities and so on
   are all marked, often strongly, and that limits their use considerably.
   We discuss the position of register and markedness in wordnets with
   respect to semantic relations, and we list typical values of register.
   We illustrate the discussion with the system of registers in plWordNet,
   the largest Polish wordnet. We present a decision tree for the
   assignment of marking labels, and examine the consistency of the editing
   decisions based on that tree.}},

Abstract = {{Surface Modifying Macromolecule (SMM) blended PSf hollow fibers were
   spun at different air-gaps to evaluate CO2 stripping from aqueous DEA
   solution and water. The fabricated membranes were firstly subjected to
   different characterization methods such as contact angle and liquid
   entry pressure measurement to evaluate the membrane's hydrophobicity and
   wetting resistance, respectively. To determine pore size and effective
   porosity of the membranes, a pure helium permeation test was performed.
   Morphological study of the membranes was conducted by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A CO2 stripping test
   was carried out to investigate the effects of operating variables such
   as liquid and gas velocity, temperature and DEA concentration on the CO2
   stripping flux. It was found that the increase of liquid velocity
   resulted in enhanced CO2 stripping flux. On the other hand, the increase
   in gas velocity did not exert significant influence on the stripping
   flux. The increase in temperature and DEA concentration both enhanced
   the stripping flux. Lastly, it was concluded that the hollow fibers spun
   in this work at a 15 cm air-gap could achieve the best stripping flux
   among all the membranes fabricated so far for CO2 stripping.}},

Abstract = {{Femoro-Acetabular Impingement (FAI) is a hip joint disease which affects
   and impairs the range of hip motion during performing activities of
   daily living, jogging, walking, or climbing stairs due to bony
   abnormalities of the joint. In this research we introduce a motion
   simulation and visualization system which helps surgeons to analyze
   range of hip motions as well as to have a better communication with
   patients. We evaluate the maximum motion that the joint can achieve from
   its bony structure if the muscle and other connective tissues are
   perfectly trained. These goals are achieved by presenting three
   dimensional (3D) visualizations of motions envelopes by examining
   maximum possible rotation of the digital hip bones through
   computer-based simulation. Our computer-based simulation system
   estimates, analyzes and visualizes the maximum hip range of motion (ROM)
   for the constructed 3D bone models (femur and pelvis) that are extracted
   from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) after segmenting the bones. These
   tasks are accomplished first by calculating Hip Joint Center (HJC) which
   is center of rotation of femoral head followed by simulating hip motions
   with examining impingement between the femur and the acetabulum using a
   collision detection system. Six primary plane motions
   (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation)
   as well as various combinations of these motions and six successive
   movements are simulated and analyzed along with 3D visualization of
   estimated range of these motions. Our system by 3D visualization of
   motions envelopes will provide a platform to understand quicker and
   better the effect of bony morphology of the hip joint on the possible
   ROM.}},

Abstract = {{Recent premature failures of metal total hip replacements have raised
   concerns about their load bearing capacity, safety, reliability, and
   survival rates. Specifically, femoral stem fracture is one of the most
   acute complications of total hip replacement (THR) and results in
   greater morbidity and higher cost of revision hip surgery. Femoral stem
   fracture incidence varies from 0.23\% to 10.7\% depending on geometric
   design and prosthetic materials. This study reports an unusual case of
   late fatigue failure of a cobalt-chromium alloy cementless femoral stem
   which functioned well for 24 years. The failure occurred at the
   stem/neck transition radius remote from any modular interface. The crack
   initiated at the top tensile side at the implant surface following a
   minor traumatic event. It then propagated transgranularly up to about
   half of the neck cross-section before final fracture occurred, which
   illustrates the high toughness of the implant. Fractography analysis
   found no intrinsic defects in the failed component. Scanning electron
   microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed a
   chemical composition in agreement with the wrought CoCrMo alloy ASTM
   F1537 used in such implants. A grain size of between 6 and 70 mu m was
   measured, which is also in agreement with the standard. Precipitates
   were found at grain boundaries, consistent with M26C6 and M7C3, which
   are often reported in cobalt-chromium alloys used in bone replacement
   applications. This late failure illustrates the importance of proper
   long-term testing of implants in regards to cyclic loading, as patients
   undergoing total joint replacement are increasingly younger and more
   active, putting implants at greater risk of long-term fatigue failure.}},

Abstract = {{Ideal prostheses are artificial limbs that permit physically impaired
   individuals freedom of movement and independence. Transfemoral
   prostheses have been drastically improved in the last two decades;
   however, despite advancements in technology and medicine, they are
   incapable of generating net power about joints to allow patients to
   regain their original mobility and improve their quality of life. From a
   biomechanics perspective, currently available devices assist patients by
   absorbing and dissipating energy and thus hinder them from achieving
   daily activities. Historically, one of the main challenges for powered
   medical assistive devices has been the actuation system that mimics the
   characteristics of the biological musculoskeletal system. A medical
   device must be light, small, and cosmetically appealing, but it must
   also generate forces and torques that are proportional to the
   individual's weight. For industrial applications, many forms of
   actuators have been developed, such as electrical motors and hydraulic
   and pneumatic cylinders. However, none of these actuators have been
   shown to be optimal for powered transfemoral prostheses. Pneumatic
   artificial muscles (PAMs) are candidates for powering medical assistive
   devices. This study first conducts a comprehensive investigation of knee
   biomechanics The failure of existing PAMs to meet the actuation
   requirements for powered transfemoral prostheses is then demonstrated.
   Based on the determined size, weight, kinetic, and kinematic
   requirements of knee articulation, a PAM design is proposed and
   evaluated. The proposed PAM is experimentally validated to meet the
   biomechanical requirements of a human knee during walking, stair ascent,
   and sit-to-stand movement.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to develop a method for quantitatively analyzing red
   blood cell (RBC) aggregates under controlled flow conditions. Images of
   experiments are captured and processed in order to quantify aggregation.
   The experimental setup consists of RBC suspensions in blood plasma
   entrained by a phosphate-buffered saline solution in a 110 x 60 mu m
   polydimethylsiloxane microchannel The experiments are performed by
   varying the hematocrit (5, 10, and 15\%) and the flow rate (Q = 5 and 10
   mu l/hr) in order to observe the effect of shear rate on RBC
   aggregation. Microchannel dimensions as well as fluid flow rates are
   determined using numerical simulations. The flow is visualized using a
   high-speed camera coupled to a micro particle image velocimetry system.
   Videos obtained with the high-speed camera are processed using a MATLAB
   program, with each frame analyzed separately. RBC aggregates are
   detected based on the image intensities and the connectivity between
   RBCs, using image processing techniques. The average aggregate size and
   distribution of RBCs for various aggregate sizes are determined for each
   of the shear rates and hematocrits. These aggregates are shown to be
   larger at low flow rates where the shear rate is small. Results from
   tests performed at high hematocrits also show larger RBC aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{Robots with lights is a model of autonomous mobile computational entties
   operating in the plane in Look-Compute-Move cycles: each agent has an
   externally visible light which can assume colors from a fixed set; the
   lights are persistent (i.e., the color is not erased at the end of a
   cycle), but otherwise the agents are oblivious. The investigation of
   computability in this model is under way, and several results have been
   recently established. In these investigations, however, an agent is
   assumed to be capable to see through another agent.
   In this paper we start the study of computing when visibility is
   obstructable, and investigate the most basic problem for this setting,
   Complete Visibility: The agents must reach within finite time a
   configuration where they can all see each other and terminate. We do not
   make any assumption on a-priori knowledge of the number of agents, on
   rigidity of movements nor on chirality. The local coordinate system of
   an agent may change at each activation. Also, by definition of lights,
   an agent can communicate and remember only a constant number of bits in
   each cycle. In spite of these weak conditions, we prove that COMPLETE
   VISIBILITY is always solvable, even in the asynchronous setting, without
   collisions and using a small constant number of colors. The proof is
   constructive. We also show how to extend our protocol for COMPLETE
   VISIBILITY so that, with the same number of colors, the agents solve the
   (non-uniform) CIRCLE FORMATION problem with obstructed visibility.}},

Abstract = {{Crawling Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) is important to ensure their
   security, accessibility and to index them for searching. To crawl a RIA,
   the crawler has to reach every application state and execute every
   application event. On a large RIA, this operation takes a long time.
   Previously published GDist-RIA Crawler proposes a distributed
   architecture to parallelize the task of crawling RIAs, and run the crawl
   over multiple computers to reduce time. In GDist-RIA Crawler, a
   centralized unit calculates the next task to execute, and tasks are
   dispatched to worker nodes for execution. This architecture is not
   scalable due to the centralized unit which is bound to become a
   bottleneck as the number of nodes increases. This paper extends
   GDist-RIA Crawler and proposes a fully peer-to-peer and scalable
   architecture to crawl RIAs, called PDist-RIA Crawler. PDist-RIA doesn't
   have the same limitations in terms scalability while matching the
   performance of GDist-RIA. We describe a prototype showing the
   scalability and performance of the proposed solution.}},

   their dynamic behaviour. To illustrate our methodology, we consider a
   model of the P53/Mdm2 DNA-damage repair mechanism. We prove several
   properties that are important for such a model to satisfy and serve to
   illustrate the promise of our approach. We formalize the proofs of these
   properties in the Coq Proof Assistant, with the help of a Lambda Prolog
   prover for partial automation of the proofs.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic nanostructures can be designed to operate effectively as a
   coupling structure for incident beams to surface plasmon polaritons
   (SPPs). On a semiconductor, metal nanostructures can act simultaneously
   as a device electrode while ensuring strong optical field overlap with
   the active region. Additionally, SPP fields can be confined to
   sub-wavelength dimensions and significantly enhanced relative to the
   exciting field. These features are very attractive for nano-scale
   optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors as the excitation of SPPs
   alters conventional trade-offs between responsivity and speed
   respectively. This is due to the facts that sub-wavelength confinement
   enables the active region to be shrunk to nano-scale dimensions yet good
   optoelectronic performance can be maintained due to the SPP field
   enhancement. In this paper we discuss recent progress on surface plasmon
   enhanced photodetectors.}},

Abstract = {{The suitability and use of long-range surface plasmon-polaritons for
   leukemic biomarker detection is discussed. A novel optical biosensor
   comprised of gold straight waveguides embedded in CYTOP with an etched
   microfluidic channel was tested for detecting leukemia in patient serum.
   Gold surface functionalization involved the interaction of protein G
   (PG) with antibodies by first adsorbing PG on bare gold and then
   antibodies (Immunoglobulin G, IgG). Differentiation between healthy and
   leukemia patients was based on the difference in ratios of Ig kappa (Ig
   kappa) and Ig lambda (Ig lambda) light chains in both serums. The ratio
   for a normal patient is similar to 14 - 2, whereas for a leukemia
   patient this ratio is altered. As a receptor (primary antibodies), goat
   anti-human anti-IgG kappa and anti-IgG lambda were used to functionalize
   the surface. Diluted normal and leukemia patient serums were tested over
   the aforementioned surfaces. The ratios of mass surface densities of IgG
   kappa:IgG lambda for normal serum (NS) and patient serum (PS) were found
   to be 1.55 and 1.92 respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A reduced graphene oxide/cuprous oxide (RGO/Cu2O) nanocomposite has been
   successfully synthesized applying a simple in situ reduction method
   using an aqueous solution of lactulose which is used simultaneously as a
   reducing and stabilizing agent. Lactulose, a disaccharide, has the
   ability to reduce both GO and CuSO4 in situ under alkaline conditions.
   The GO and RGO/Cu2O nanocomposites are characterized using transmission
   electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field
   emission scanning electron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and UV-vis absorption
   spectroscopy. The surface charge as well as stability is established by
   analyzing the zeta potential value. The results confirm the synthesis of
   the RGO/Cu2O nanocomposite and the existence of interactions between
   Cu2O and RGO. It is also observed that Cu2O nanoparticles with an
   average size of 5 nm are uniformly dispersed throughout the RGO sheets.
   The catalytic activity of the RGO/Cu2O nanocomposite is excellent for
   the `click' reaction and remains the same for six cycles.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In this study, zeolitic imidazole framework 8 (ZIF-8) particles of
   different sizes were synthesized in aqueous media by varying the
   concentration of the base-type additive, triethylamine (TEA). ZIF-8 with
   particle sizes of similar to 134 nm and similar to 288 nm with surface
   areas of 418.44 m(2) g(-1) and 491.54 m(2) g(-1) were obtained without
   altering the crystalline structure. Synthesized ZIF-8 was further heat
   treated at 100 degrees C for a minimum of 12 hours, which led to an
   enhancement of its phase crystallinity and a surface area of 981.1 m(2)
   g(-1). Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were prepared via the dry-wet phase
   inversion method by dispersing assynthesized ZIF-8s, heat-treated ZIF-8s
   and commercial ZIF-8 (similar to 493 nm) into a polysulfone (PSf)
   matrix. The thermal stability and mechanical strength of the membranes
   showed significant improvement after the incorporation of ZIF-8s. The
   MMMs were further subjected to the permeation experiments of CO2 and
   CH4. Although the majority of MMMs showed less selectivity than the neat
   PSf membrane, the incorporation of heat-treated ZIF-8 of the smallest
   size, exhibited CO2/CH4 selectivity of 28.5, which is significantly
   higher than the 19.43 obtained for the neat PSf membrane. Therefore,
   different ZIF-8 treatment protocols and particle sizes affect the MMMs
   performance significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Location privacy is an important issue in location-based services. A
   large number of location cloaking algorithms have been proposed for
   protecting location privacy of users. However, these algorithms cannot
   be used in vehicular networks due to constrained vehicular mobility. In
   this paper, we propose a new method named Protecting Location Privacy
   with Clustering Anonymization (PLPCA) for location-based services in
   vehicular networks. This PLPCA algorithm starts with a road network
   transforming to an edge-cluster graph in order to conceal road
   information and traffic information, and then provides a cloaking
   algorithm based on k-anonymity and l-diversity as privacy metrics to
   further enclose a target vehicle's location. Simulation analysis shows
   our PLPCA has good performances like the strength of hiding of road
   information \& traffic information.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the dynamic model and analysis of a fixed geometry
   tracked robot while traversing stairs. The motor torque and angular
   acceleration of the centre of mass of the robot are examined during
   three critical stages in the stair ascent and three critical stages in
   the stair descent. The dynamic model demonstrates that the dynamic
   stability is directly related to the robot's structure, the grouser
   geometry, and the location of its centre of mass. The results of the
   numerical simulations quantify the high angular accelerations
   experienced at the onset of the descent. The results also illustrate
   that the motor torque peaks as the robot crosses the second step in the
   ascent of the stairs.}},

Abstract = {{To improve customer satisfaction in innovative product design, a
   topology structure of customer requirements is established and an
   innovative product approach is proposed. The topology structure provides
   designers with reasonable guidance to capture the customer requirements
   comprehensively. With the aid of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the
   importance of the customer requirements is evaluated. Quality function
   deployment (QFD) is used to translate customer requirements into product
   and process design demands and pick out the technical requirements which
   need urgent improvement. In this way, the product is developed in a more
   targeted way to satisfy the customers. the theory of innovative problems
   solving (TRIZ) is used to help designers to produce innovative
   solutions. Finally, a case study of automobile steering system is used
   to illustrate the application of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel text representation method to be applied on corpora
   containing short / medium length textual documents. The method applies
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a corpus to infer its major topics,
   which will be used for document representation. The representation that
   we propose has multiple levels (granularities) by using different
   numbers of topics. We postulate that interpreting data in a more general
   space, with fewer dimensions, can improve the representation quality.
   Experimental results support the informative power of our multi-level
   representation vectors. We show that choosing the correct granularity of
   representation is an important aspect of text classification. We propose
   a multi-level representation, at different topical granularities, rather
   than choosing one level. The documents are represented by topical
   relevancy weights, in a low-dimensional vector representation. Finally,
   the proposed representation is applied to a text classification task
   using several well-known classification algorithms. We show that it
   leads to very good classification performance. Another advantage is
   that, with a small compromise on accuracy, our low-dimensional
   representation can be fed into many supervised or unsupervised machine
   learning algorithms that empirically cannot be applied on the
   conventional high-dimensional text representation methods.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic reviews are considered fundamental tools for Evidence-Based
   Medicine. Such reviews require frequent and time-consuming updating.
   This study aims to compare the performance of combining relatively
   simple Bayesian classifiers using a fixed rule, to the relatively
   complex linear Support Vector Machine for medical systematic reviews. A
   collection of four systematic drug reviews is used to compare the
   performance of the classifiers in this study. Cross-validation
   experiments were performed to evaluate performance. We found that
   combining Discriminative Multinomial Naive Bayes and Complement Naive
   Bayes performs equally well or better than SVM while being about 25\%
   faster than SVM in training time. The results support the usefulness of
   using an ensemble of Bayesian classifiers for machine learning-based
   automation of systematic reviews of medical topics, especially when
   datasets have a large number of abstracts. Further work is needed to
   integrate the powerful features of such Bayesian classifiers together.}},

   control system (SMCS) structure dedicated to servo systems. The new SMCS

   the process model. The sliding mode control signal augments the control
   signal specific to a model-free PI control system (CS) structure in
   order to compensate for the estimation errors which affect the
   systematic design and performance. The derivatives in the local
   approximation of the process model are estimated numerically using a
   Savitzky-Golay filter to carry out both differentiation and smoothing. A
   simple design approach is proposed for the SMCS structure. The real-time
   experimental results concerning the speed control of a laboratory

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural
   Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational
   awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential
   asset human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated
   decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by
   electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or
   in the maritime command-and-control centers.
   For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve
   months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports
   repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
   (NGA). We considered the maritime incident reports written by human
   operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source
   in which a span of text! is called ``risk{''} if it expresses one of the
   following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked,
   attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted,
   suspiciously approached or clashed with.
   Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful
   features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions
   denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime
   geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are
   captured and used to anchor the span of ``risks{''} as they are
   described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that
   include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech
   tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence
   classification algorithms, e. g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional
   Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk
   classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based
   system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports
   with about 90 \% correctness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an adaptive contour following method for robot
   manipulators that originally combines low accuracy RGB-D sensing with
   eye-in-hand visual servoing. The main objective is to allow for the
   detection and following of freely shaped 3D object contours under visual
   guidance that is initially provided by a fixed Kinect sensor and refined
   by a single eye-in-hand camera. A path planning algorithm is developed
   that constrains the end effector to maintain close proximity to the
   surface of the object while following its contour. To achieve this goal,
   a RGB-D sensing is used to rapidly acquire information about the 3D
   location and profile of an object. However, because of the low
   resolution and noisy information provided by such sensors, accurate
   contour following is achieved with an extra eye-in-hand camera that is
   mounted on the robot's end-effector to locally refine the contour
   definition and to plan an accurate trajectory for the robot.,
   Experiments carried out with a 7-DOF manipulator and the dual sensory
   stage are reported to validate the reliability of the proposed contour
   following method.}},

Abstract = {{Life support devices, specifically vacuum desiccant cooling devices
   require hydrophobic micro-porous membranes with high liquid entry
   pressure of water (LEPw), high mechanical strength and large vacuum
   distillation flux in the temperature range of 10-30 degrees C. To
   achieve this goal, membranes were prepared by casting polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) on various non-woven fabric (NWF) materials using the
   immersion precipitation technique at ambient temperature. Four porous
   polyester NWF materials were tested as the membrane support materials
   which were characterized by SEM analysis and by measuring the contact
   angle and porosity. The PVDF coated membranes were also characterized by
   SEM image analysis and LEPw. Finally, the coated membranes were tested
   for vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) performance at a relatively low
   feed temperature of 30 degrees C. The results of this study revealed a
   significant impact of the NWF materials on VMD performance. A suitable
   NWF material leads to a much enhanced VMD flux of the PVDF coated
   membrane that was approximately 15 times that of the unsupported PVDF
   membrane. These results suggest that the spongy-like layer may have
   strong impacts on the flux of membrane distillation. The studies provide
   understanding of the VMD phenomenon and provide new insights for the
   development of coated membranes used for life support devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-8) was prepared, and
   physico-chemical characterizations were performed to investigate the
   influences of triethylamine (TEA) on the crystallinity, particle size,
   morphology, and defects of ZIF-8 synthesized via an aqueous room
   temperature approach with a relatively low molar ratio of ligands to
   metal salts. Increasing the concentration of TEA by raising the
   TEA/total molar ratio from 0.004 to 0.007 prompted the formation of pure
   phase ZIF-8, whereas a TEA/total molar ratio below 0.004 did not result
   in a yield of ZIF-8. The particle size of ZIF-8 decreased from
   approximately 288 to 133 nm with increasing TEA/total molar ratio,
   except at a TEA/total molar ratio of 0.007. However, an excessive
   TEA/total molar ratio alters the 2-MeIM chemistry, and partially forms
   hydroxylated 2-MeIM. Thus, this study shows that at relatively low molar
   ratios of ligands to metal salts, up to a maximum TEA/total molar ratio
   of 0.006, the TEA concentration plays an important role in assisting
   crystal formation and in controlling the particle size of ZIF-8. The
   proposed procedure enables pure phase nanoscale ZIF-8 to be synthesized
   with a high product yield and with minimal chemical usage.}},

Abstract = {{Green synthesis of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) using Abelmoschus
   esculentus (L.) pulp extract has been elaborately studied and reported
   here. The Au NPs have been characterized using several techniques.
   Optical analysis indicates adequate stability of the synthesized Au NPs,
   while FTIR analyses the fact that phytochemicals present in the
   Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) pulp extract play the key role in
   stabilizing the Au NPs. Morphological study shows that the nanoparticles
   are mostly spherical in shape with an average particle size of similar
   to 14 nm, and these results are comparable with the particle size
   obtained from XRD. The selected area electron diffraction pattern
   indicates the crystalline nature of the Au NPs, which is further
   confirmed from XRD studies. The present study also demonstrates the in
   vitro efficacy of Au NPs against Jurkat cells. Results show that the
   IC50 dose of Au NPs is capable of significantly elevating intracellular
   reactive oxygen species and diminishing mitochondrial membrane
   potential, indicating the effective involvement of apoptosis in cell
   death. Furthermore, the synthesized Au NPs show a sufficient degree of
   antimicrobial activity against different types of bacteria. These
   results clearly show that the Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) pulp
   synthesized Au NPs have excellent medicinal applications.}},

Abstract = {{IEEE 802.15.4 is the de facto standard for Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs) that outlines the specifications of the PHY layer and MAC
   sub-layer in these networks. The MAC protocol is needed to orchestrate
   sensor nodes access to the wireless communication medium. Although
   distinguished by a set of strengths that contributed to its popularity
   in various WSNs, IEEE 802.15.4 MAC suffers from several limitations that
   play a role in deteriorating its performance. Also, from a practical
   perspective, 80.15.4-based networks are usually deployed in the vicinity
   of other wireless networks that operate in the same ISM band. This means
   that 802.15.4 MAC should be ready to cope with interference from other
   networks. These facts have motivated efforts to devise improved IEEE
   802.15.4 MAC protocols for WSNs. In this paper we provide a survey for
   these protocols and highlight the methodologies they follow to enhance
   the performance of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol.}},

Abstract = {{An improved design for a catalytic reactor for electrochemical promotion
   of highly dispersed catalysts was presented and compared to that of a
   plug flow-type reactor for the model reaction of ethylene oxidation.
   Electrochemical cells were prepared with low particle size (1.1 nm) Ru
   nanoparticles (RuNPs) which were supported on a mixed ionic-electronic
   conductor, CeO2, with a low metal loading (1 wt\%), interfaced with a
   YSZ electrolyte. Comparable catalytic performance between the two
   reactors was observed for both open-circuits measurements. However, the
   rate enhancement ratio in the single-chamber capsule (SCC) reactor was
   found to be 1.6 compared to 1.4 for the plug flow-type reactor for an
   applied current of -5 mu A. These results were attributed to better
   electrical contact to the isolated RuNPs. Furthermore, the SCC reactor
   is simple to assemble and provides an intimate contact between the
   RuNPs/CeO2 catalyst and the current collector (i.e., gold mesh).}},

   structural response of six two-way slab-column specimens with details

   results demonstrate that a reduction in reinforcing bar cross-sectional
   area (simulated corrosion) leads to a significant drop in punching shear
   resistance and results in increased crack widths. In addition, the study
   demonstrates that a critical degree of delamination can lead to a
   reduction in punching shear capacity, greater crack widths, and loss of

Abstract = {{Body sensor networks (BSNs) represent an emerging technology which has
   attracted much attention recently due to its enormous potential to
   enable remote, real-time, continuous and non-invasive monitoring of
   people in health-care, entertainment, fitness, sport, and social
   interaction. At present, the semantic expressions of BSNs data depend on
   the specific application scenarios, then have no unified standard. Such
   a lack of compatibility in the standard will lead to a subsequent
   bottleneck in data sharing of BSNs. This paper presents a model that
   addresses the issue, from low-layer data encapsulation to higher layer
   data storage, to top-layer application scenarios in BSNs. The
   physiological data from BSNs are encapsulated with some metadata,
   including BSNs context, sensor position, time and human health state in
   the model. The proposed model is cross-platform in terms of sharing
   physiological data. The results of experiments validate the
   effectiveness of data sharing in BSNs under the proposed model.}},

   ball-milled powders with a fine-scale nano-structure. A planetary mill
   was used to refine reactant powders from micron-to nano-scale
   dimensions. The dynamics of the pressure wave and high-pressure gas

Abstract = {{Shocks in granular media, such as vertically oscillated beds, have been
   shown to develop instabilities. Similar jet formation has been observed
   in explosively dispersed granular media. Our previous work addressed
   this instability by performing discrete-particle simulations of
   inelastic media undergoing shock compression. By allowing finite
   dissipation within the shock wave, instability manifests itself as
   distinctive high density non-uniformities and convective rolls within
   the shock structure. In the present study we have extended this work to
   investigate this instability at the continuum level. We modeled the
   Euler equations for granular gases with a modified cooling rate to
   include an impact velocity threshold necessary for inelastic collisions.
   Our results showed a fair agreement between the continuum and
   discrete-particle models. Discrepancies, such as higher frequency
   instabilities in our continuum results may be attributed to the absence
   of higher order effects.}},

Abstract = {{The dependence of the filtering bandwidth on the mode locking technique
   was studied in details in two types of mode locked fiber laser cavities;
   one utilizes SESAM, while the other employs NPE. The results show that
   for the two cases, below certain value of filtering bandwidth, no mode
   locking can be observed and the cavities will be in a lossy region.
   Moreover, NPE-based all fiber cavities can support narrower spectral
   bandwidth compared to SESAM-based cavities. Hence, NPE-based cavities
   produce shorter pulse width than SESAM-based ones. Experimental
   investigation was carried out to verify our simulation results and good
   agreement was achieved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{2319-2325}},
Abstract = {{Mesoporous surfaces generated by oxidative nanopatterning have the
   capacity to selectively regulate cell behavior, but their impact on
   microorganisms has not yet been explored. The main objective of this
   study was to test the effects of such surfaces on the adherence of two
   common bacteria and one yeast strain that are responsible for nosocomial
   infections in clinical settings and biomedical applications. In
   addition, because surface characteristics are known to affect bacterial
   adhesion, we further characterized the physicochemical properties of the
   mesoporous surfaces. Focused ion beam (FIB) was used to generate
   ultrathin sections for elemental analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS), nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED), and high-angle
   annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy
   (STEM) imaging. The adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli
   and Candida albicans onto titanium disks with mesoporous and polished
   surfaces was compared. Disks with the two surfaces side-by-side were
   also used for direct visual comparison. Qualitative and quantitative
   results from this study indicate that bacterial adhesion is
   significantly hindered by the mesoporous surface. In addition, we
   provide evidence that it alters structural parameters of C. albicans
   that determine its invasiveness potential, suggesting that
   microorganisms can sense and respond to the mesoporous surface. Our
   findings demonstrate the efficiency of a simple chemical oxidative
   treatment in generating nanotextured surfaces with antimicrobial
   capacity with potential applications in the implant manufacturing
   industry and hospital setting.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, hydrophilic hydrous manganese dioxide (HMO) nanoparticles
   were synthesized and used as the inorganic filler for the preparation of
   mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). The aim of adding HMO nanoparticles into
   the polyethersulfone (PES) membrane matrix is to improve membrane
   hydrophilicity and anti-fouling resistance against oil deposition and/or
   adsorption. The resulting membranes were characterized by SEM, AFM,
   FTIR, contact angle measurements and ultrafiltration (UF) of synthetic
   oily wastewater. Experimental results showed that the hydrophilicity of
   the PES/HMO membrane was significantly improved to a low value of
   contact angle (16.4 degrees) by HMO loading, which as a consequence led
   to a promising pure water permeability (573.2 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)). In
   comparison, the pristine PES membrane only demonstrated 69.5 degrees and
   39 L m(-2) h (-1) bar(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the PES/HMO
   membrane exhibited an excellent oil rejection (almost 100\%) and a
   promising water flux recovery (75.4\%) when it was used to treat a
   synthetic oily solution containing 1000 ppm oil. The promising
   anti-fouling properties of the PES/HMO membrane could be attributed to
   the presence of hydrophilic -OH groups on the membrane surface resulting
   from HMO addition, making this membrane less susceptible to fouling when
   challenged with oil-in-water emulsions.}},

Title = {{From Smart Camera to SmartHub: Embracing Cloud for Video Surveillance}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Smart cameras were conceived to provide scalable solutions to automatic
   video analysis applications, such as surveillance and monitoring. Since
   then, many algorithms and system architectures have been proposed, which
   use smart cameras to distribute functionality and save bandwidth. Still,
   smart cameras are rarely used in commercial systems and real
   installations. In this paper, we investigate the reason behind the
   scarce commercial usage of smart cameras. We found that, in order to
   achieve scalability, smart cameras put additional constraints on the
   quality of input data to the vision algorithms, making it an
   unfavourable choice for future multicamera systems. We recognized that
   these constraints can be relaxed by following a cloud based hub
   architecture and propose a cloud entity, SmartHub, which provides a
   scalable solution with reduced constraints on the quality. A framework
   is proposed for designing SmartHub system for a given camera placement.
   Experiments show the efficacy of SmartHub based systems in multicamera
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet is entering an era of cloud computing to provide more cost
   effective, eco-friendly and reliable services to consumer and business
   users. As a consequence, the nature of the Internet traffic has been
   fundamentally transformed from a pure packet-based pattern to today's
   predominantly flow-based pattern. Cloud computing has also brought about
   an unprecedented growth in the Internet traffic. In this paper, a hybrid
   optical switch architecture is presented to deal with the flow-based
   Internet traffic, aiming to offer flexible and intelligent bandwidth on
   demand to improve fiber capacity utilization. The hybrid optical switch
   is capable of integrating IP into optical networks for cloud-based
   traffic with predictable performance, for which the delay performance of
   the electronic module in the hybrid optical switch architecture is
   evaluated through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of natural image matting in which the
   goal is to softly-segment a foreground from a background. Given an input
   image and some known foreground (FG) and background (BG) pixels, an
   alpha value indicating a partial foreground coverage is calculated for
   every other pixel in the image. The proposed algorithm is affiliated to
   the sampling-based matting techniques where the alpha of every unknown
   pixel is calculated using some FG/BG pairs that are sampled according to
   certain criteria. Current sampling-based matting techniques suffer from
   critical disadvantages, leaving the problem open for further
   development. By adopting a novel FG/BG pair-selection strategy, we
   propose a technique that overcomes critical pitfalls in the
   state-of-the-art methods with a performance that is comparable (and
   superior in certain cases) to them. Our results were evaluated according

Abstract = {{In recent years, the problem of acquiring omnidirectional stereoscopic
   imagery of dynamic scenes has gained commercial interest, and
   consequently, new techniques have been proposed to address this problem.
   The goal of many of these new panoramic methods is to provide practical
   solutions for acquiring real-time omnidirectional stereoscopic imagery
   for human viewing. However, there are problems related to mosaicking
   partially overlapped stereoscopic snapshots of the scene that need to be
   addressed. Among these issues are the conditions to provide a consistent
   depth illusion over the whole scene and the appearance of undesired
   vertical disparities. We develop an acquisition model capable of
   describing a variety of omnistereoscopic imaging systems and suitable to
   study the design constraints of these systems. Based on this acquisition
   model, we compare different acquisition approaches based on mosaicking
   partial stereoscopic views of the scene in terms of their depth
   continuity constraints and the appearance of vertical disparities. This
   work complements and extends our previous work in omnistereoscopic
   imaging systems by proposing a mathematical framework to contrast
   different acquisition strategies to create stereoscopic panoramas using
   a small number of stereoscopic images. (C) 2014 SPIE and IS\&T}},

Abstract = {{Biological treatment is the most common and economical means of ammonia
   removal in wastewater; however, nitrification rates can become
   completely impeded at cold temperatures. Attached growth processes and,
   specifically, moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) have shown promise
   with respect to low-temperature nitrification. In this study, two
   laboratory MBBRs were used to investigate MBBR nitrification rates at
   20, 5, and 1 degrees C. Furthermore, the solids detached by the MBBR
   reactors were investigated and Arrhenius temperature correction models
   used to predict nitrification rates after long-term low-temperature
   exposure was evaluated. The nitrification rate at 5 degrees C was 66 +/-
   3.9\% and 64 +/- 3.7\% compared to the rate measured at 20 degrees C for
   reactors 1 and 2, respectively. The nitrification rates at 1 degrees C
   over a 4-month exposure period compared to the rate at 20 degrees C were
   18.7 +/- 5.5\% and 15.7 +/- 4.7\% for the two reactors. The quantity of
   solids detached from the MBBR biocarriers was low and the mass of
   biofilm per carrier did not vary significantly at 20 degrees C compared
   to that after long-term exposure at 1 degrees C. Lastly, a temperature
   correction model based on exposure time to cold temperatures showed a
   strong correlation to the calculated ammonia removal rates relative to
   20 degrees C following a gradual acclimatization period to cold
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption separation of carbon dioxide from nitrogen at different
   system total pressures with silicalite as the adsorbent was studied by
   using concentration pulse chromatography. Improving the methodology for
   determining binary adsorption isotherms by concentration pulse method
   (CPM) was also the goal of this study. Binary adsorption isotherms, x-y
   phase diagrams and separation factor plots have been determined at 26 A
   degrees C to look at the influence of pressure on the separation using
   concentration pulse chromatography. Available methods for determining
   binary adsorption isotherms using CPM have been reviewed and shown to be
   incapable of interpreting this particular binary system. An improved
   novel model has been proposed to interpret the data in this study. It
   has been referred to as the Kennedy-Tezel concentration pulse method
   (KT-CPM) and has been shown to be superior to other methods used in the
   literature. Results using this data were found to be consistent with the
   previous results in the literature. The binary isotherms for the CO2-N-2
   system show a decrease in CO2 selectivity as total system pressure
   increases. The optimal separation factor for silicalite was found to
   increase with decreasing system pressure and decreasing mole fraction of
   CO2 in the feed mixture.}},

Abstract = {{The rising cost of crude oil combined with the depletion of the
   resources, political instability in oil producing countries, and the
   desire to reduce the current dependence on imported oil are some of the
   reasons that have motivated the different waves of interest for
   renewable and sustainable fuels. In addition to bioethanol and
   biodiesel, biobutanol is attracting significant interest as a biofuel
   mainly due to the recent advances in biotechnology for its production.
   Biobutanol has lower water miscibility, flammability, and corrosiveness
   than ethanol, and has the enviable advantage to be able to directly
   replace gasoline in car engines without requiring modifications. Butanol
   can be produced from a wide variety of waste biomass feedstock which
   does not compete with food. In butanol bioproduction, the most widely
   used microorganisms for acetonebutanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation are
   anaerobic bacteria such as the solventogenic Clostridia including
   Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium beijerinchii. However, the
   production of biobutanol via fermentation is facing significant
   engineering challenges due to the very low final concentration and low
   yield due to the severe butanol toxicity to microorganisms. It is
   therefore important to find an efficient separation technique to recover
   butanol at the end of fermentation or during the fermentation to reduce
   the level of toxicity and prolong the fermentation. In this article, the
   main butanol separation techniques such as adsorption, gas stripping,
   liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), perstraction, reverse osmosis (RO) and
   pervaporation were discussed. It was concluded that adsorption and
   pervaporation are the separation techniques that offer the most
   potential for butanol separation from dilute solutions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Optimum ordering strategies for the coded Vertical Bell Labs Layered
   Space-Time (V-BLAST) architecture with capacity achieving temporal codes
   on each stream are analytically studied, including 4 different
   power/rate allocation strategies among data streams. Compact closed-form
   solutions are obtained for the case of zero-forcing (ZF) V-BLAST with
   two transmit antennas and necessary optimality conditions are found for
   the general case. The optimal rate allocation is shown to have a major
   impact (stronger streams are detected last) while the optimal power
   allocation does not alter the original Foschini ordering (stronger
   streams are detected first). Sufficient conditions for the optimality of
   the greedy ordering are established: it is optimal for the ZF V-BLAST
   under an optimal rate allocation with two transmit antennas at any SNR
   and with any number of antennas in the low and high SNR regimes. It
   satisfies the necessary optimality conditions for larger systems at any
   SNR and is nearly-optimal in many cases. An SNR gain of ordering is
   introduced and studied, including closed-form expressions as well as
   lower and upper bounds and the conditions for their achievability. For
   the minimum mean square error (MMSE) V-BLAST under an optimal rate
   allocation, any ordering is shown to deliver the same system capacity.
   All the results also apply to a multiple-access channel with the
   successive interference cancelation receiver.}},

Abstract = {{The actual source of the ``feed image lobe{''} in fixed-beam

Abstract = {{This paper introduces our proposed Split- and Aggregated-TCP (SA-TCP)
   scheme's enhanced TCP performance in a smart metering infrastructure
   (SMI). The scheme is based on upgrading intermediate devices (e.g.,
   regional collectors) to aggregate TCP connections. An SA-TCP aggregator
   collects data packets from smart meters in a certain region over
   separate TCP connections, then reliably aggregates them in one TCP
   connection to the management server of the utility. Our proposed scheme
   responds better to data traffic dynamics of smart meters and makes TCP
   congestion control effective.
   A full mathematical model of SA-TCP is provided. Validated by extensive
   ns-2 simulations, the model accurately and flexibly predicts the SA-TCP
   scheme's throughput, packet loss rate and packet delay. Furthermore, we
   formulate an optimization problem to find the optimal number of SA-TCP
   aggregators that ensures acceptable packet loss rate and delay.}},

Abstract = {{Calcific aortic valve disease is the most common heart valve disease. It
   is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular morbidity
   and mortality and independently increases the cardiovascular risk. It is
   then important to develop parameters that can estimate the stiffness of
   the valve. Such parameters may contribute to early detection of the
   disease or track its progression and optimize the timing for therapy. In
   this study, we introduce a metric representing the stiffness of the
   native aortic calcified valve over a wide range of stenosis severities.
   Our approach is based on three-dimensional structural finite-element
   simulations and in vitro measurements. The proposed method is developed
   first in a pulse duplicator; its clinical applicability is then
   evaluated in three patients with severe aortic stenosis. Our results
   indicate that the value of the proposed metric varies considerably
   between healthy valves and valves with very severe aortic stenosis, from
   0.001 to 7.38 MPa, respectively. The method introduced in this study
   could give useful information regarding the stiffness of the valve
   leaflets with potential application to the evaluation of aortic
   sclerosis and aortic stenosis.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional intelligence is the ability to process information about one's
   own emotions and the emotions of others. It involves perceiving
   emotions, understanding emotions, managing emotions and using emotions
   in thought processes and in other activities. Emotion understanding is
   the cognitive activity of using emotions to infer why an agent is in an
   emotional state and which actions are associated with the emotional
   state. For humans, knowledge about emotions includes, in part, emotional
   experiences (episodic memory) and abstract knowledge about emotions
   (semantic memory). In accordance with the need for more sophisticated
   agents, the current research aims to increase the emotional intelligence
   of software agents by introducing and evaluating an emotion
   understanding framework for intelligent agents. The framework organizes
   the knowledge about emotions using episodic memory and semantic memory.
   Its episodic memory learns by storing specific details of emotional
   events experienced firsthand or observed. Its semantic memory is a
   lookup table of emotion-related facts combined with semantic graphs that
   learn through abstraction of additional relationships among emotions and
   actions from episodic memory. The framework is simulated in a
   multi-agent system in which agents attempt to elicit target emotions in
   other agents. They learn what events elicit emotions in other agents
   through interaction and observation. To evaluate the importance of
   different memory components, we run simulations with components
   ``lesioned{''}. We show that our framework outperformed Q-learning, a
   standard method for machine learning.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of high strain-rate loading on the flexural response of
   typical light-frame wood construction has been investigated. A total of
   30 stud grade 38 mm x 140 mm x 2440 mm (2 `' x 6 `' x 8')
   spruce-pine-fir (S-P-F) lumber specimens were tested within a range of
   low and high strain-rates between 6 x 10(-6) s(-1) and 0.4 s(-1). A
   single-degree-of-freedom iterative solution procedure was used to
   compute the high strain-rate modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of
   elasticity (MOE). The MOR was statistically enhanced by high
   strain-rates, while the MOE and strain at rupture were not. Since
   equilibrium of the dynamic stress-strain relationship requires that one
   or both of the MOE and strain at rupture must be sensitive to
   strain-rate effects, the lack of observed rate enhancement on these
   material properties was attributed to large scatter within a small
   sample set. Based on the results, material dynamic increase factors and
   a stress-strain relationship suitable for blast resistant design of
   timber structures were also proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing resources for
   downlink transmission in a macro-femtocell network under non-dense
   femtocell deployment. In the literature, some approaches perform
   bandwidth or power optimization depending on the air interface
   technology and others optimize both types of resources, but only in
   femtocell network. However, the following limitations can be noticed:
   (1) Equal distribution of transmitted power among all subcarriers, even
   if they are not used, leads to resource underutilization, (2) femtocell
   data rates are reduced in order to minimize the interference from femto
   base stations to macro users, and (3) the impact of noise has not been
   evaluated. Moreover, there is lack of optimal selection of users that
   can be served by femtocells. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
   model that finds a tradeoff between bandwidth and power to reduce the
   bandwidth usage per user and to minimize the impact of noise. By means
   of Linear Programming, our solution maximizes user satisfaction and
   provides optimal: serving base station, power and bandwidth for each
   mobile user taking into account its location and demand. Furthermore, we
   present a performance analysis under changes of signal to noise ratio.
   Simulations were conducted and a comparison with a modified version of
   Weighted Water Filling algorithm is presented.}},

Abstract = {{For multiple heterogeneous multicore server processors across clouds and
   data centers, the aggregated performance of the cloud of clouds can be
   optimized by load distribution and balancing. Energy efficiency is one
   of the most important issues for large-scale server systems in current
   and future data centers. The multicore processor technology provides new
   levels of performance and energy efficiency. The present paper aims to
   develop power and performance constrained load distribution methods for
   cloud computing in current and future large-scale data centers. In
   particular, we address the problem of optimal power allocation and load
   distribution for multiple heterogeneous multicore server processors
   across clouds and data centers. Our strategy is to formulate optimal
   power allocation and load distribution for multiple servers in a cloud
   of clouds as optimization problems, i.e., power constrained performance
   optimization and performance constrained power optimization. Our
   research problems in large-scale data centers are well-defined
   multivariable optimization problems, which explore the power-performance
   tradeoff by fixing one factor and minimizing the other, from the
   perspective of optimal load distribution. It is clear that such power
   and performance optimization is important for a cloud computing provider
   to efficiently utilize all the available resources. We model a multicore
   server processor as a queuing system with multiple servers. Our
   optimization problems are solved for two different models of core speed,
   where one model assumes that a core runs at zero speed when it is idle,
   and the other model assumes that a core runs at a constant speed. Our
   results in this paper provide new theoretical insights into power
   management and performance optimization in data centers.}},

Abstract = {{Haptic image exploration is intriguing because of the need to find an
   effective method to transfer image content from the visual to the haptic
   sensing modality. While in the past, the research community has been
   primarily focused on the exploration of restricted types of images, e.
   g., maps or mathematical curves, we address the challenging problem of
   haptic rendering of general photographs. We represent the photographs as
   3-D grooves on a 2-D image plane as haptic contours. We discuss our
   interactive image segmentation tool to extract these contours from an
   image in an object-level hierarchy, i.e., the contours have a
   hierarchical relationship that represents how image objects consist of
   parts. Our haptic image exploration instrument allows a user interact
   with the image by zooming and panning but our major contribution is the
   support for browsing multiple levels-of-detail (LODs) of the contour
   image. We show that multiple LODs help a user to understand an image
   more readily. We also investigate if ambient encoding of the spatial
   surrounding of the haptic cursor in the image is beneficial during
   exploration. We present the results of a user study to evaluate the
   efficacy of multiple LODs and of ambient encoding of the spatial
   surrounding through textures.}},

Abstract = {{A group of nickel-coated carbon fiber reinforced Stellite 25 composites

   this research is on obviating the problems related to the presence of
   carbides in Stellite alloys by substituting carbides as the main
   strengthening agent in Stellite alloys with nickel-coated carbon fibers.
   The principal reason for selecting Stellite 25 is because of its low
   carbon content and thereby relatively carbide free microstructure. The
   nickel coating is intended to eliminate any chance of carbide formation
   due to the possible reaction between carbon fibers and the matrix
   alloying additions. The tribomechanical and corrosion properties of the
   composites are characterized. The results show that the composites
   exhibit better corrosion resistance than medium-carbon Stellite alloys.
   The addition of carbon fibers into Stellite 25 improves its hardness and
   tribological properties. The wear rates of the composites are lower than
   that of medium-carbon Stellite alloys and comparable with that of
   high-carbon Stellites.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, major tsunami events have resulted in considerable damage to
   low-lying coastal developments as well as significant loss of life. This
   is owing to the fact that coastal communities and associated
   infrastructure are not able to withstand the extreme hydrodynamic forces
   induced by the overland progression of large tsunami waves. This paper
   reports the findings of a study, which is part of an ongoing
   comprehensive (hydraulic-structural engineering) research program
   initiated at the University of Ottawa in Canada. The goals of the latter
   are to contribute to the understanding and quantification of extreme
   hydrodynamic impacts on structural elements, and to the development of
   design guidelines for structures located in tsunami-prone areas. In this
   study, a single-phase three-dimensional (3D) weakly compressible
   smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH) model is used to investigate the
   hydrodynamic forces, induced by the impact of rapidly advancing
   tsunami-like hydraulic bores, on a freestanding column of a square cross
   section. Numerical time histories of the water surface elevation and net
   base horizontal force acting on the column are compared with the results
   of large-scale physical experiments, conducted by the authors as part of
   an experimental component of this research program. The experiments were
   performed on the basis of analogies between tsunami bores and dam-break
   waves. The bore-structure interaction is analyzed in detail as the
   validated numerical model is subsequently applied to additionally
   investigate the influence of laboratory channel geometry on the results.

   in vitro. J774.A1 macrophages were cultured with either 60 nm or 700 nm
   commercially available Cr2O3 particles at different concentrations. Two
   different particle sizes were analyzed to evaluate potential volume
   effects. Cell mortality was analyzed by light microscopy, flow cytometry
   (annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide assay), and
   using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA).
   Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), monocyte chemotactic protein-1
   (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1) release was
   measured by ELISA, and gene expression was analyzed by quantitative
   real-time PCR. Results showed that, at high concentrations, Cr2O3
   particles of both sizes can be cytotoxic, inducing significant decreases
   in total cell numbers and increases in necrosis. Results also suggested
   that these effects were dependent on particle volume. However, TNF-,
   MCP-1, and MIP-1 cytokine release and gene expression remained low.
   Overall, this study demonstrates that nanometer-size particles of Cr2O3,
   a stable form of chromium oxide ceramic, have rather low cytotoxic
   effects on macrophages. Therefore, these particles may not be the main
   culprit in the initiation of the inflammatory reaction in MM
   periprosthetic tissues. However, other parameters (e.g., potential
   intracellular damage) remain to be investigated. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{In this paper we address a practical application of Van Dijk somewhat
   homomorphic encryption over the integers scheme. This application
   consists of giving a client the opportunity to choose a video to watch
   without letting the server or any third party know which video it is;
   thus preserving the privacy of the client. In a prior work we have
   already discussed this application using a fully homomorphic encryption
   scheme. Our contribution in this paper is to carefully choose the
   encryption parameters so that decryption can work without the need of
   the expensive bootstrapping mechanism. We also implemented a simulation
   program of the used protocol to confirm our theoretical results and give
   an idea of the processing time needed for streaming depending on the
   various parameters.}},

Abstract = {{With the acceleration of mobile applications, mobile cloud computing is
   envisioned to be the best fit solution to make a compromise between
   users' and service providers' benefits. An extension of mobile cloud
   computing, vehicular cloud computing, provides another viable solution,
   by consolidating the benefits of mobile cloud computing and vehicular
   communications. Among several challenges in this environment, privacy,
   service price and provision delay are the most important. In this paper,
   we propose a framework to address these challenges in a vehicular cloud
   based on a quality-of-experience (QoE) approach, discuss the drawbacks
   of existing architectures, and propose and validate a new architecture.
   This architecture is an extension of a system {[}I] we proposed in
   previous work. QoE is obtained via other mobile nodes in the vehicular
   cloud, and re-formulated according to a weighted combination of the
   three key factors: privacy, price and delay. Privacy is defined as a
   function of the information revealed to the service provider. We
   evaluate our proposal via simulations, and based on the numerical
   results, we show that QoE-based service provisioning in a vehicular
   cloud improves upon a naive service provision approach, as well as other
   approaches that address only one of the factors.}},

Abstract = {{3D Hair reconstruction based on real-life hair capture is an important
   and challenging work in hair modeling field. Most of existing hair
   capture methods use 2D images to reconstruct 3D hair, and these methods
   usually adopt 3D polygons to present hair wisp. In this paper, we
   introduce an approach to capture real-life hair using Kinect sensor and
   digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera and to reconstruct 3D hair
   model using particle system. First, our method collects four views of
   point clouds and high resolution image for real-life hair. We register
   DSLR image and point cloud to build the mapping relationship between 2D
   and 3D and the alignment techniques are utilized to merge the point
   clouds. With the manually extracted 2D hair strands from the DSLR image,
   the system used control points to represent hair strands as spline
   curve. Furthermore, these control points are projected on the point
   cloud to find the corresponding 3D control points. Finally the system
   reconstructs 3D hair model where the strands are represented in particle
   system. We also present a hidden hair pieces recovery algorithm to
   generate final well-connected 3D hair strands. Our method is novel and
   has many advantages: (i) hardware setting is simple and affordable (ii)
   combination of high quality image of DSLR and depth of Kinect taking
   advantage of each of them (iii) the 2D and 3D combined method allows us
   to repair and improve the quality of 3D depth (iv) Hair representation
   is spline based which is a particle system and most common hair
   animation is based on particle system.}},

Abstract = {{Recently the lack of geo-location assurance of data in cloud storage has
   been identified as one of the main reasons why organizations that deal
   with sensitive data (e.g., financial data, health related data) cannot
   adopt a cloud storage solution even if they want to. In this paper, we
   present a Hardware-based Data geo-Location Assurance Solution (HDLAS),
   which is suitable for almost all cloud storage applications available
   today. Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and a cryptographic scheme called
   Provable Data Possession (PDP) are the basis of our solution. We define
   a new attack model for HDLAS which seems to be a realistic attack model
   for the existing cloud storage applications. With the combination of a
   GPS receiver and TPM, HDLAS is able to offer its clients not only the
   accurate geo-location of their data but also a hardware-based root of
   trust for that. Unlike many existing solutions, HDLAS works even if a
   piece of data is replicated into different storage servers. Furthermore
   we also illustrate how easily HDLAS can be adopted in existing Cloud
   Storage Providers such as Microsoft Azure.}},

   and channel distribution are studied. Closed-form solutions are obtained
   in the asymptotic regimes of small and large uncertainty, and an error
   floor effect is established in the latter case. The known results for

   fading are shown to hold under the channel distribution uncertainty as

   channels is obtained. Earlier results established for isotropic
   uncertainty sets are extended to broader class of (non-isotropic) sets,
   which bound not only the gain but also the eigendirections of the
   eavesdropper channel. When a maximum element exists in the uncertainty
   set, a saddle-point exists so that the compound and worst-case channel
   capacities coincide and signaling on the worst-case channel also works
   for the whole class of channels. The case of additive uncertainty in the
   legitimate channel, in addition to the unknown eavesdropper channel of a
   bounded spectral norm, is also studied. Its compound secrecy capacity
   and the optimal signaling are established in a closed-form, revealing
   the saddle-point property. The optimal signaling is Gaussian and on the
   eigenvectors of the legitimate channel and the worst-case eavesdropper
   is isotropic. The eigen-mode power allocation somewhat resembles the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new application model and a novel execution
   path-based algorithm for offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)
   environments. Application offloading is the mechanism by which parts or
   modules of the application are executed in cloud remote computational
   services. Such operation saves resources in the mobile device but also
   incurs costs of accessing the cloud and using the communication network
   connecting the mobile device and cloud. The offloading problem is to
   find an offloading decision that minimizes the total cost of executing
   the application. Previous solutions find a single offloading decision
   per module. However, the total cost of executing a module also depends
   on the sequence of module calls leading to its execution. We present a
   fine grained application model and a fast optimal offloading decision
   algorithm where multiple offloading decisions are made per module based
   on the execution paths leading to the module. We evaluate our solution
   for a face detection mobile applications in multiple network scenarios.
   We show that our model and algorithm offer offloading decisions that are
   significant faster than offloading decision by traditional offloading

Abstract = {{In Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Clustering sensor nodes is an
   efficient topology control method to reduce energy consumption of the
   sensor nodes. Many link quality-based clustering techniques have been
   proposed in the literature. However, they assumed that each sensor node
   is equipped with a self-locating hardware such as GPS. Though this is a
   simple solution, the resulting cost renders that solution inefficient
   and unrealistic. Furthermore, several studies has shown that link
   quality in WSN is not correlated with distance. In addition to that,
   they used an energy model that is fundamentally flawed for modelling
   radio power consumption in sensor networks. They ignore the listening
   energy consumption, which is known to be the largest contributor to
   expended energy in WSN. Clustering is a Non-deterministic Polynomial
   (NP)-hard problem for a WSN. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a
   swarm intelligent approach that can be applied for finding fast and
   efficient solutions of such problem.
   In this paper, a PSO-based protocol is used to find the optimal set of
   cluster heads that maximize the network coverage, energy efficiency and
   link quality. The effect of using a realistic network and energy
   consumption model in cluster-based communication for WSN was
   investigated. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Chroma-keying is an important technique for image/video background
   replacement, which is heavily used in film production, video game
   industry and newscasting. In chroma-keying system, the foreground
   objects are shot in front of solid color background. In conventional
   chroma-keying systems, difference and clustering based algorithms are
   mainly used to separate foreground from background. However, regions
   cannot be reliably segmented if transparency or blurring exists, and if
   foreground and background region are not completely separable in color
   space. This paper proposes a new method to automatically remove the
   background color and to accurately extract the foreground objects along
   with their transparency properties, especially for tiny objects and
   large transparent area. First, a threshold based method in both HSV
   color space and spatial gradient space is used to roughly segment the
   foreground/background regions. The background color is then propagated
   from known background region to unknown region. Finally, the foreground
   color and the transparency factor are estimated based on weighted global
   sampling. The experimental results show that the foreground objects can
   be accurately extracted even if large transparent regions exist.}},

Abstract = {{Communication technologies are striving to provide ubiquitous and
   cable-free communication services to users while user devices are still
   limited with their batteries and need wires to recharge their batteries.
   The recent advances in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) are promising to
   charge wireless sensor networks and on-body medical devices without the
   need of wires or battery replacement. One natural way of scavenging
   energy from the environment and providing ubiquitous power is
   electromagnetic radiation based WPT. Recently powering up Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSNs) or REID tags via omnidirectional radiation and
   beamforming has been studied in several studies. Yet, the potential of
   exploiting wireless networks to power User Equipment (UE) such as mobile
   phones or PDAs has been less explored. Long distances between wireless
   towers and UEs as well as their relatively low transmit power are among
   the major bottlenecks for WPT in wireless networks. In this paper, we
   consider dedicated energy transmission units (DETUs) to provide power to
   UEs. We show that although certain amount of power can be harvested by
   UEs, the cost of deploying DETUs dominates the design decision. As a
   transitional solution, power from relays, small cell towers and WiFi
   hotspots can be exploited. However when WPT is in-band with information
   transfer there may be interruption in connectivity. We discuss the
   challenges of WPT in wireless networks and propose several future
   directions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present two methods for decentralized optimization of
   continuous and discrete-time stochastic dynamic decision systems, with
   multiple decision makers having nonclassical information structures. For
   both methods we apply Girsanov's change of measure to transform such
   problems into equivalent optimization problems, under a reference
   probability measure, with corresponding observations and information
   structures available for decisions, which are not affected by any of the
   decisions.
   The first method, when applied to continuous-time Ito Stochastic
   Differential Equations (SDEs), involves function space integration with
   respect to the Wiener measure. Its corresponding discrete-time analog
   generalizes Witsenhausen's {[}1] ``Common Denominator Condition{''} and
   ``Change of Variables{''}, and relates them to the Radon-Nikodym
   Derivative and Bayes' theorem associated with Girsanov's theorem.
   The second method is based on stochastic Pontryagin's maximum principle,
   and applies to continuous and discrete-time stochastic dynamic systems.
   The decentralized optimality conditions are given by a ``Hamiltonian
   System{''} consisting of forward and backward SDEs, and conditional
   variational Hamiltonians, conditioned on the information structure of
   each of the decision makers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we derive team and Person-by-Person (PbP) optimality
   conditions for Ito SDEs with nonclassical information structures. The
   optimality conditions are given in terms of a Hamiltonian System
   described by coupled backward and forward SDEs and conditional
   Hamiltonians, conditioned on the information structures, for regular
   (measurable functions) and relaxed strategies (conditional
   distributions).
   The sufficient conditions are given in terms of a convexity condition of
   the Hamiltonian, and it is shown that PbP optimality implies team
   optimality. We also show existence of relaxed team optimal strategies.
   Throughout the presentation we discuss similarities to problems of
   centralized stochastic optimal control and to mean field stochastic
   optimal control.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient authentication in the vehicular networks has been studied by
   several researchers in the past. However, there are still several issues
   to be addressed like high communication/computation overhead, security
   problems, etc. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Authentication
   Protocol (EAP) for secure vehicular communication. This protocol employs
   smart cards based on users(vehicles)' passwords and identities to
   provide strong user authentication, and uses dynamic login identities to
   provide the anonymity of authentication. Performance analysis shows that
   this protocol does not only provide high efficient authentication, but
   also can resist attacks like offline password guessing attack, smart
   card loss attack, impersonation attack and so on.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been proposed for various
   monitoring applications including environmental, industrial, military
   and health care. The use of WSNs with cluster-tree topologies for such
   applications solves the limited coverage issue of the wireless sensor
   devices and allows them to be deployed in wider area. WSNs with
   cluster-tree topologies suffer from various problems including accurate
   synchronization of beacons used in the beacon enabled mode in the IEEE
   802.15.4 standard and providing Quality of Service (QoS) to delay-aware
   applications. In this paper, we present a Time Slot Control (TSC) scheme
   that can adaptively manage the allocation of time slots in the beacon
   enabled mode of operation to provide QoS grantees to delay critical
   traffic. Our proposed scheme can improve the end-to-end delay and
   throughput of selected traffic types by managing the time slots between
   sensor devices in an optimum way.}},

   sensors are seeking efficient ways to send the collected data during
   relatively rare transmission opportunities. Aggregation is one of the
   major ways to improve the data throughput while consuming less energy
   consumption. This paper proposes an adaptive aggregation scheme for MAC
   802.11 to improve the transmission efficiency in unstable wireless
   delay-tolerant environments. The aggregation scheme not only considers
   the upper layer separation of quality of service (QoS) requirements into
   different queues, but also adapts the wireless channel status to the
   aggregation procedure. The simulation results show that the scheme
   improves the transmission efficiency and reduces the number of
   transmission times by aggregating data; thus saving sensor energy
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Use of social network services has been more widespread as mobile social
   network applications have been developed for smart phones. Besides,
   smart phone sensing, namely Sensing-as-a-Service (S-2 aaS) provides the
   front-edge access to the cloud-centric Internet of Things. S-2 aaS can
   provide crowdsourced data for several purposes such as public safety,
   crowd management and environment monitoring. Trustworthiness of
   crowdsourced data is an important challenge in S-2 aaS as maliciously
   altered data can be misleading for the S-2 aaS customer.
   Reputation-aware crowdsourcing schemes can address trustworthiness
   problem however smart phone users moving based on a social network
   mobility (SNM) model introduce further challenges. In this paper, we
   propose reputation-and-SNM-aware crowdsourcing scheme which is based on
   an auction executed at a cloud platform. The cloud platform aims at
   maximum utility by estimating users' future locations based on their
   interactions over the social network service so that efficient
   user-sensing task matching can be done. Furthermore, past and current
   reputation of the users are taken into account while recruiting smart
   phone users for given sensing tasks. Our simulations show that
   reputation-awareness accompanied with SNM-awareness can significantly
   increase the platform utility by up to 55\%. Furthermore, incorporation
   of reputation-awareness can degrade disinformation probability by more
   than 70\%.}},

Abstract = {{Learning with class imbalance is always a challenging task in many real
   world applications such as the Internet, surveillance, security, and
   finance. Like many other successful machine learning algorithms, the
   success of the support vector machine (SVM) is limited when it is
   applied to the problem of learning from imbalanced datasets. SVM with
   different error costs has been widely used to deal with the class
   imbalanced problem. In this paper, we are trying to apply an
   instance-weighted variant of the SVM with both 1-norm and 2-norm format
   to deal with the class imbalance problem. We develop an asymmetric
   boosting method on the weights of the trade-off parameters to optimize
   the instance-weighted SVM. The experimental results on the benchmark
   datasets show that the proposed algorithm is effective on the class
   imbalanced problem.}},

   novel multi-view, two-level classification framework to address the

   unsupervised learning methods to transform a MI dataset into a
   multi-view, single meta-instance dataset. Then we develop a multi-view
   learning approach that can integrate the information acquired by
   individual view learners on the meta-instance dataset from the previous
   step, and construct a final model. Our empirical studies show that the

   paper, we study S(2)aaS over social networking services for crowd
   management problem where malicious users report false sensor readings
   leading to severe disinformation at the crowd control platform. To this
   end, we propose Trustworthy Sensing for Crowd Management (TSCM) which is
   a reputation-based crowd management scheme over the cloud platform where
   sensing data is collected from smart phones based on an auction
   mechanism. TSCM periodically runs an auction in order to assign
   dynamically arriving sensing task requests to the smart phone users
   forming a crowd connected through a social network. User bids, task
   values and user reputation values are taken as the inputs whereas the
   outputs are the utility of the crowd management platform and the average
   utility per user while reputation of a user is a function of the
   accuracy of the sensed data. Through simulations, we show that TSCM
   significantly improves the platform utility while degrading the ratio of
   the maliciously crowdsourced task by 75\%. Furthermore, we also show
   that under TSCM, reputation of malicious users converge to a low value
   at the order of 40\% following a few auctions.}},

Abstract = {{In a wireless delay-tolerant sensor network, the sensors must carry the
   data and wait for the delivery opportunity to forward the data. The
   probability of delivery largely depends on the current wireless channel
   connections. The sensors can optimally use the delivery opportunities to
   transmit the data while considering the data and nodes attributes. In
   this paper, we propose a transmission strategy in MAC 802.11 to
   efficiently transmit different types of data with energy saving
   considerations in one contact interval. The transmission power
   consumption and data throughput are the main measurements in our
   strategy to evaluate the transmission performance. We also consider the
   node buffer and data types as elements that impact the transmission
   throughput and power consumption. The simulation results show that the
   strategy efficiently transmits different data in an energy-saving and
   data-throughput-balanced way in one contact interval.}},

Abstract = {{Digital cameras reconstruct a full color image using the information
   captured by different color sensors (RGB) through a Color Filter Array
   (CFA). A demosaicking algorithm uses the information of the CFA data to
   restore a full color array. Demosaicking algorithms reconstruct two
   unknown color components for a pixel at each spatial location. During
   this stage, the values of other components will be measured mostly by
   neighboring pixels' information. Since the Fujifilm X-Trans pattern is
   one of the more successful CFAs, we attempt to model the demosaicking
   steps using this pattern and simulate both non-adaptive and adaptive
   demosaicking schemes. Kodak sample images are used in order to validate
   and compare different approaches with related previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Gender recognition and age classification are important applications of
   face analysis. The vast majority of the existing solutions focus on a
   single visual descriptor which often encodes only a certain
   characteristic of the image regions (e.g., shape, or texture, or color,
   etc.). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for gender and age
   classification, which facilitates the integration of multiple feature
   types and therefore allows for taking advantage of various sources of
   visual information. Furthermore, in the proposed method, only the
   regions that can best separate face images of different demographic
   classes (with respect to age and gender) contribute to the face
   representations, which in turn, improves the classification and
   recognition accuracies. Experiments performed on a challenging publicly
   available database validate the effectiveness of our proposed solution
   and show its superiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods.}},

   multiple discrete levels of detail for virtual reality applications. The
   method combines classical discrete level of detail approaches with a
   novel solution for the creation of selectively-densified object meshes.
   A neural gas network is used to capture regions of interest over a
   sparse point cloud representing a 3D object. Meshes at different
   resolutions that preserve these regions are then constructed by adapting
   a classical simplification algorithm to allow the simplification process
   to affect only the regions of lower interest. Different interest point
   detectors are incorporated in a similar manner and compared with the
   proposed approach. A novel solution based on learning is proposed to
   select the number of faces for the discrete models of an object at

Abstract = {{Among the current clustering algorithms of complex networks,
   Laplacian-based spectral clustering algorithms have the advantage of
   rigorous mathematical basis and high accuracy. However, their
   applications are limited due to their dependence on prior knowledge,
   such as the number of clusters. For most of application scenarios, it is
   hard to obtain the number of clusters beforehand. To address this
   problem, we propose a novel clustering algorithm-Jordan-Form of
   Laplacian-Matrix based Clustering algorithm (JLMC). In JLMC, we propose
   a model to calculate the number (eta) of clusters in a complex network
   based on the Jordan-Form of its corresponding Laplacian matrix. JLMC
   clusters the network into eta clusters by using our proposed modularity
   density function (P function). We conduct extensive experiments over
   real and synthetic data, and the experimental results reveal that JLMC
   can accurately obtain the number of clusters in a complex network, and
   outperforms Fast-Newman algorithm and Girvan-Newman algorithm in terms
   of clustering accuracy and time complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is used in many applications

   samples, one must trade-off estimation accuracy against frequency

   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that provides both high
   frequency resolution and low estimation error variance. First a high
   resolution PSD estimate with high estimation error variance is produced.
   Then, from the same set of samples, we produce a low frequency
   resolution PSD estimate with low estimation error variance. Using
   information from the first PSD estimate, the EM algorithm is used to
   estimate the missing frequency bins of the PSD with low frequency
   resolution. It is shown by analysis and simulation that the proposed
   method improves both the resolution and estimation error variance

   the widely used two-ring hexagonal network layout in the absence or

   The proposed model, in contrast to the fluid model, takes the radial
   direction into account. This makes our proposed model more accurate than
   the fluid model as is validated by computer simulations. Using the
   proposed model, the conditional probability of outage in the presence of
   shadowing is derived and its accuracy is shown to be within a fraction
   of a dB for most scenarios and no worse than 2 dB for few exceptional
   ones. The analysis presented in this paper gives useful insight with

   paper, we implement and compare different ranges of OR protocols
   (simple, complex and optimum ones) in terms of different performance
   parameters using NS-2. The obtained results through extensive
   simulations show that OR improves the performance of network in
   different terms. Furthermore, our results provide insights to the use of
   each opportunistic routing protocols in different scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Video dissemination over vehicular networks is an attractive technology
   which supports many novel applications. However, it is a great challenge
   to analyse the performance of video dissemination protocols due to
   highly dynamic topology and stringent requirements of applications. In
   this paper, we evaluate five existing robust video dissemination
   protocols in urban scenarios. We evaluate three routing protocols and
   two error resilience protocols. We also modify the frame coding
   technique for better performance. The results, more specifically, show
   that only one of the three routing protocols fulfils the general quality
   requirements. As for the error resilient techniques, we find that our
   modified frame coding approach performs better than the original one in
   four aspects. The results also indicate that the video coding scheme
   guarantees reliable video qualities.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are anticipated to become the preferred
   tools of choice for monitoring and controlling power utility assets in
   the smart grid due to their versatility. However, in some smart grid
   monitoring applications, data generation rates could fluctuate rapidly
   due to the sudden occurrence of critical faults or failures in the
   monitored equipment. As a consequence, critical data could experience
   excessive delays because of this increase in the packet arrival rates.
   In this paper, we present an Adaptive Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS)
   allocation scheme (AGTS) for IEEE 802.15.4-based WSNs used in high
   traffic intensity smart grid monitoring applications. AGTS scheme can
   adaptively reduce the end-to-end delay and flexibly tune the GTS to
   provide the required Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation to delay
   critical smart grid monitoring applications. The proposed scheme can

Abstract = {{Clustering is an efficient topology control approach for maximizing the
   lifetime and scalability of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Many
   cluster-based routing techniques have been proposed in the literature.
   However, in most of the proposed protocols, the communication between a
   sensor node and its designated cluster head (CH) is assumed to be
   single-hop. Multi-hop communication can be used when the communication
   range of the sensor nodes is limited or the number of sensor nodes is
   very large in a network. Moreover, they used a predetermined percentage
   of CHs regardless of the network density or the number of live nodes.
   Clustering is known to be non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard
   problems for a WSN. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm
   intelligent approach that can be applied for finding fast and efficient
   solutions of such problems. In this paper, we propose a novel
   centralized PSO protocol for Hierarchical Clustering (PSO-HC) in WSNs.
   Our objective is to maximize the network lifetime by minimizing the
   number of active CHs and to maximize the network scalability by using
   two-hop communication between the sensor nodes and their respective CHs.
   The effect of using a realistic network and energy consumption model in
   cluster-based communication for WSN was investigated. Extensive
   simulations show that PSO-HC outperforms the well-known cluster-based
   sensor network protocols in terms of average consumed energy and
   throughput.}},

   the TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) and SDMA (Space Division
   Multiple Access) algorithms, the proposed approach takes into account
   the characteristics of the tag position in the reading area of the
   reader. Knowing that the SDMA method is based on the principle of
   Digital Beam Forming (DBF), we used the FFT and IFFT blocks to form the
   different beams and the OFDM technique to meet the orthogonality
   condition. We then divided the space into two subsets of beams and
   applied the TDMA method to detect any collision. The developed RFID
   anti-collision SDMA system has been coded by VHDL and simulated using

   performance of our algorithm when the initial search space is specified

   automated system for this purpose is complex due to, amongst other
   factors, the noisy nature of the data. The method described herein
   consists of preprocessing the data by applying a smoothing method
   tailored to gamma ray spectra, hoping that this should decrease their
   variance. Given that the number of counts at a given energy level in a
   spectrum should follow a Poisson distribution, smoothing may allow us to
   estimate the true photon arrival rate. Our experiments suggest that the

Abstract = {{The convergence of a security aware environment with the proliferation
   of inexpensive high quality video imaging devices has led to the
   deployment of cameras at a high number of critical infrastructure sites.
   As many cameras are needed to keep all key access points under
   continuous observation, an operator of the surveillance system may
   become distracted from the many video feeds, possibly missing key
   events, such as suspicious individuals leaving an object behind or
   approaching a door. By providing an automated system for monitoring
   these types of events within a video feed, some of the burden placed on
   the operator is alleviated, thereby increasing the overall reliability
   and performance of the monitoring system, as well as providing archival
   capability for future investigations. In this paper, we propose a
   solution that uses a background subtraction based segmentation method to
   determine objects within the scene. An artificial neural network
   classifier is then employed to determine the class of each object
   detected in each frame, which is then temporally filtered using Bayesian
   inference to minimize the effect of occasional misclassifications. The
   behavior of the object is then determined based on its classification
   and spatio-temporal properties, and if the object is considered of
   interest, feedback is provided to the background subtraction
   segmentation technique for background fading prevention reasons.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced situational awareness is integral to risk management and
   response evaluation. Dynamic systems that incorporate both hard and soft
   data sources allow for comprehensive situational frameworks which can
   supplement physical models with conceptual notions of risk. The
   processing of widely available semi-structured textual data sources can
   produce soft information that is readily consumable by such a framework.
   In this paper, we augment the situational awareness capabilities of a
   recently proposed risk management framework (RMF) with the incorporation
   of soft data. We illustrate the beneficial role of the hard-soft data
   fusion in the characterization and evaluation of potential vessels in
   distress within Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) scenarios. Risk features
   pertaining to maritime vessels are defined a priori and then quantified
   in real time using both hard (e.g., Automatic Identification System,
   Douglas Sea Scale) as well as soft (e.g., historical records of
   worldwide maritime incidents) data sources. A risk-aware metric to
   quantify the effectiveness of the hard-soft fusion process is also
   proposed. Though illustrated with MDA scenarios, the proposed hard-soft
   fusion methodology within the RMF can be readily applied to other
   domains.}},

Abstract = {{A typical firing doctrine is the Shoot-Look-Shoot tactic. In this
   tactic, the defence launches a salvo of interceptors against the targets
   (Shoot), assesses the outcomes of the engagements (Shoot-Look), and
   launches another salvo (Shoot-Look-Shoot) if time and the inventory of
   interceptors permit. In the open literature, it is often assumed that
   the targets are identical. This is not always true as targets come in
   with different ranges, speeds, sizes, cross sections etc. In this paper,
   we consider two types of targets. Each type of target has a different
   number engagement opportunities due to their ranges and speeds. Through
   the use of dynamic programming, a genetic algorithm, and a recursive
   generating function, we determine the probability of raid annihilation
   (the probability of neutralizing all of the targets) for two different
   Shoot-Look-Shoot (SLS) tactics. The first SLS tactic is based on
   variable size salvos and maximizes the probability of raid annihilation
   (PRA) for heterogeneous targets. The second SLS tactic is based on
   fixed-size salvos and is robust as it is independent of the number and
   types of targets. Theoretical results are validated through some
   computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The RFID technology has opened a new world of possibilities for
   development of novel devices that can identify objects, monitor the
   status of objects, and take actions. These devices make further inroads
   towards the concept known as the Internet of Things. Recently, we have
   introduced a novel device called Sense-a-Tag (ST), which when added to
   standard RFID systems increases their capabilities. In this paper, we
   explore the potential of an ST-based RFID system for proximity
   detection. We first survey potential solutions for proximity detection
   and point out to their problems. Then we discuss several applications of
   ST-based RFID systems. Finally, we experimentally characterize the
   proximity detection performance of these systems.}},

   neural networks and genetic algorithms to learn the wind turbine's
   nonlinear dynamic model and achieve accurate tracking. As such,

Abstract = {{There has been a marked increase in the number of older drivers across

   causes in the FTA are constantly under influence from each other, their
   effects affect proportionally and accumulatively on the total level of
   workload imposed on drivers. This characteristic has been mathematically
   modelled and integrated into the developed FTA. The transportation

Abstract = {{There has been a marked increase in the number of young drivers across
   the globe. This age category comes with deficiencies resulting from
   their inexperience and age-related characteristics. Mobility is a
   fundamental right of living by everyone whether young or old, and
   learning to drive is considered as a significant achievement in youth's
   life. However, the mobility of a younger driver by his or her own
   vehicles demands special considerations. The number and types of crashes
   caused by younger drivers indicate that they are considered as
   vulnerable users on roads and a risk to others (i.e., other motorists,
   pedestrians, and passengers). In this study, the authors identified and
   illustrated the potential causes of crashes by younger drivers and
   introduced the available measures to mitigate the crash risk. The risk
   of crash by younger drivers is systematically and logically modelled
   using fault tree analysis. Subsequently, the risk state of driving by
   younger drivers at a given time is mathematically modelled. Furthermore,
   the authors proposed the concept of ``riskometer{''} as an interactive

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel learning method is introduced that borrows
   simultaneously from the principles of kernel methods and multi-layer
   perceptron. Specifically, the method implements the feature mapping idea
   of kernel methods into a multi-layer perceptron. Unlike in kernel
   learning where the feature space is usually invisible and inaccessible,
   the multi-layer perceptron based mapping is explicit. Therefore, the
   proposed model can be learned directly in feature space. Together with
   the inherent sparse representation, the proposed approach will thus be
   much faster and easier to train even in the event of a large network
   size. The proposed approach is applied in the context of an Autonomous
   Underwater Vehicle Mine-Like Objects detection task. The results show
   that the proposed approach is able to improve upon the generalization
   performance of neural network based methods. Its prediction results are
   also close to or better than those obtained by kernel machines. Its
   learning and classification speed is shown to far surpass those of
   kernel machines. These results are confirmed on a number of experiments
   involving benchmarking UCI domains.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrocracking and hydrotreating are bitumen upgrading technologies
   designed to enhance fuel quality by decreasing its density, viscosity,
   boiling point and heteroatom content via hydrogen addition. The aim of
   this study is to evaluate the feasibility of integrating slurry
   hydrocracking, trickle-bed hydrotreating and residue gasification using
   the Aspen HYSYS (R) simulation software. Close-coupling the bitumen
   upgrading facilities with gasification allows one to achieve a hydrogen
   and power self-sufficient upgrading facility with CO2 capture.
   Hydrocracker residue is first withdrawn from a 100,000 BPD Athabasca
   bitumen upgrading facility, characterized via ultimate analysis and then
   fed to a gasification unit where it produces hydrogen that is partially
   recycled to the hydrocracker and hydrotreaters and partially burned for
   power production in a high hydrogen combined cycle unit. The integrated
   design is simulated for a base case of 90\% carbon capture utilizing a
   monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent, and compared to 65\% and no carbon
   capture scenarios. The calculated net plant efficiency on a HHV basis is
   between 29\% and 41\%. The gasification of 320 tonne/h of carbonaceous
   fuel is required in order to obtain a process that is self-sufficient in
   hydrogen, power and heating requirements. For this system, co-feeding of
   petroleum coke is necessary in order to produce 983 MW of power and meet
   the steam demand of the purification units that keep the heteroatom
   content in the flue gas below environmental regulatory limits while
   capturing 7.88 million tonne of CO2 per year. The carbon emission rate
   is controlled in the simulation by varying the water-gas shift steam
   consumption and the lean amine circulation rate. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel economic model to regulate capacity sharing
   in a federation of hybrid cloud providers (CPs). The proposed work
   models the interactions among the CPs as a repeated game among selfish
   players that aim at maximizing their profit by selling their unused
   capacity in the spot market but are uncertain of future workload
   fluctuations. The proposed work first establishes that the uncertainty
   in future revenue can act as a participation incentive to sharing in the
   repeated game. We, then, demonstrate how an efficient sharing strategy
   can be obtained via solving a simple dynamic programming problem. The
   obtained strategy is a simple update rule that depends only on the
   current workloads and a single variable summarizing past interactions.
   In contrast to existing approaches, the model incorporates historical
   and expected future revenue as part of the virtual machine (VM) sharing
   decision. Moreover, these decisions are not enforced neither by a
   centralized broker nor by predefined agreements. Rather, the proposed
   model employs a simple grim trigger strategy where a CP is threatened by
   the elimination of future VM hosting by other CPs. Simulation results
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed model in terms of the
   increased profit and the reduction in the variance in the spot market VM
   availability and prices.}},

Title = {{Prior and contextual emotion of words in sentential context}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-92}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A set of words labeled with their prior emotion is an obvious place to
   start on the automatic discovery of the emotion of a sentence, but it is
   clear that context must also be considered. It may be that no simple
   function of the labels on the individual words captures the overall
   emotion of the sentence; words are interrelated and they mutually
   influence their affect-related interpretation. It happens quite often
   that a word which invokes emotion appears in a neutral sentence, or that
   a sentence with no emotional word carries an emotion. This could also
   happen among different emotion classes. The goal of this work is to
   distinguish automatically between prior and contextual emotion, with a
   focus on exploring features important in this task. We present a set of
   features which enable us to take the contextual emotion of a word and
   the syntactic structure of the sentence into account to put sentences
   into emotion classes. The evaluation includes assessing the performance
   of different feature sets across multiple classification methods. We
   show the features and a promising learning method which significantly
   outperforms two reasonable baselines. We group our features by the
   similarity of their nature. That is why another facet of our evaluation
   is to consider each group of the features separately and investigate how
   well they contribute to the result. The experiments show that all
   features contribute to the result, but it is the combination of all the
   features that gives the best performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   internal concentration polarization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{449}},

Abstract = {{Realizing that one of the most important challenges in the forward
   osmosis (FO) membrane is internal concentration polarization (ICP), thin
   film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes were prepared by incorporating
   different loadings of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (ranging
   from 0 to 0.90 wt\%) into the polysulfone (PSI) substrate in order to
   reduce ICP. The nanocomposite substrates prepared were characterized
   with respect to hyclrophilicity, overall porosity, surface roughness and
   cross-sectional morphology by different methods. Results revealed that
   both hydrophilicity and porosity of the substrate were increased upon
   addition of TiO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, a large number of finger-like
   macrovoids were developed by increasing the loading of TiO2
   nanoparticles, leading to enhancement in water permeability. As for the
   FO performance tested at AL-FS orientation and with Dl water as feed and
   0.5 M NaCl as draw solution, the TFN membrane prepared using PSI
   substrate embedded with 0.60 wt\% TiO2 nanoparticles (designated as
   TFN0.60) exhibited the most promising result by showing water flux of
   18.81 L/m(2) h, Le. 97\% higher than the control TFC membrane prepared
   by substrate without TiO2 incorporation (designated as TFC), with no
   significant change in reverse solute flux. Compared to the control TFC
   membrane, the FO water flux of TFN0.60 was also reported to increase
   significantly from 4.2 to 8.1 L/m(2) h (AL-FS orientation) and from 6.9
   to 13.8 L/m(2)h (AL-DS orientation) when seawater was used as feed
   solution and 2 M NaCl was used as draw solution. The increase in water
   flux can be attributed W the decrease in structural parameter (S value =
   0.39 mm), mainly due to the formation of finger-liked macrovoids that
   connect the Lop and bottom layer of the substrate and reduce the
   tortuosity, resulting in decreased ICP. Although further increasing TiO2
   nanoparticles loading to 0.90 wt\% could increase membrane water
   permeability, the FO performance was compromised by a significant
   increase in reverse solute flux. To the best knowledge of the authors,
   this is the first report on TFN membrane using PSf-TiO2 nanocomposite
   substrate for FO applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new upwind finite volume method using
   unstructured grids for large-scale shallow flows. This method uses a
   high-order upwind scheme for the calculation of the numerical flux, and
   the fourth-order Adams method with a splitting approach for time
   integration. The process includes three stages: in the first and third
   steps the Coriolis term is integrated analytically, and in the second
   step the flux term is integrated numerically. Most upwind schemes
   perform well for gravity waves but they lead to a high level of damping
   or numerical oscillations for Rossby waves. The proposed method presents
   the advantage that it performs well for both gravity and Rossby waves.
   The use of fourth-order Adams method without any iteration on the
   corrector is enough to suppress the short-wave numerical noise without
   damping the long waves that are essential in the transport of energy
   Rossby waves, in large-scale oceanic and atmospheric flows. (C) 2013

   ultrafiltration mixed matrix membrane}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{59-68}},

Abstract = {{In this work, novel polyethersulfone (PES)/hydrous manganese dioxide
   (HMO) ultrafiltration (UF) mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were prepared
   for adsorptive removal of Pb(II) by varying the weight ratio of HMO:PES
   in the membrane from 0 to 2.0. The membranes prepared were characterized
   with respect to chemistry, surface roughness and structural morphology
   using FTIR, AFM and SEM, respectively. The effects of HMO loadings on
   the membrane pure water flux, hydrophilicity, porosity and Pb(II)
   adsorption capacity were also studied. The results showed that although
   the membrane pore size tended to decrease with increasing HMO:PES weight
   ratio, the membrane water flux was not negatively affected. Instead the
   membrane water flux was increased with increasing HMO loadings which was
   attributable to the decreased contact angle value (more hydrophilic),
   increased porosity and greater surface roughness. Of all the membranes
   studied, it is found that the MMM prepared from the highest HMO:PES
   ratio demonstrated the highest Pb(II) uptake capacity (i.e. 204.1 mg/g)
   and this uptake capacity is comparable to most of the promising
   composite adsorbents reported in literature. Besides, the continuous UF
   experiments showed that the PES/HMO MMM can be potentially used for
   effective Pb(II) removal by producing permeate of high quality (<15 mu
   g/L lead in water). By subjecting the Pb(II)-adsorbed MMM to a simple
   desorption process using HCl solution, it is reported that as high as
   97.5\% of the original adsorption capacity of membrane was able to be
   recovered, showing the reusability of the membrane for Pb(II) removal.

   Optoelectronic Oscillator}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Photonic generation of a phase-coded or frequency-chirped microwave
   waveform with a tunable microwave carrier frequency using a
   frequency-tunable optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated, for the first time to the best of our
   knowledge. In the proposed system, the tunable OEO has functions to
   generate a frequency-tunable microwave signal and to output an optical
   sideband. The optical sideband and a portion of the light wave from the
   OEO laser source are sent to a polarization modulator (PolM), with their
   polarization directions aligned with the two principal axes of the PolM.
   An electrical signal is applied to the PolM, and two complementary
   phase-coded or frequency-chirped light waves are generated which are
   converted to an electrical signal by beating the light waves at a
   high-speed photodetector. The key significance of the technique is that
   a phase-coded or frequency-chirped microwave waveform with a tunable
   microwave carrier frequency and a re-configurable phase-coding or
   frequency-chirping pattern can be generated without using a separate
   microwave source. The technique is experimentally verified. The
   generation of a binary-and a polyphase-coded microwave waveform with a
   microwave carrier frequency at 10 and 15 GHz is demonstrated. The
   generation of a linearly frequency-chirped microwave waveform with a
   chip rate of 20.98 GHz/ns at a 10-GHz carrier frequency and 22.5 GHz/ns
   at a 15-GHz carrier frequency is also achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are emerging as a promising approach
   to improving traffic safety and providing a wide range of wireless
   applications for all road users. This paper addresses an improved
   authentication scheme for Radio frequency identification (RFID) applied
   in VANETs. As often being considered as a precondition for the
   realization of IoT, RFID can be utilized in the vehicles, so as to make
   the vehicles identifiable and inventoriable by computers as long as they
   are fitted out with radio tags. One of the public concerns is likely to
   focus on a certain large number of security and privacy issues. A few
   light symmetric key management schemes have been proposed for RFID
   scenarios. However, as we mentioned already, the authentication
   methodologies of those light symmetric key management schemes,

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
   (PVP) and sodium monunorillonite (Na+MMT) were prepared by solution
   mixing and then cast into films. X-ray diffraction analysis and images
   of transmission electron microscopy establish the formation of
   PVA/Na+MMT intercalated nanocomposite. Exfoliated and highly
   intercalated PVA/PVP/Na+MMT nanocomposite formed in the presence of PVP.
   Inclusion of PVP in PVA/Na+MMT matrix enhances the hydrogen bonding
   interactions between PVA and Na+MMT and thus increases the mechanical
   properties and thermal stability of PVA/PVP/Na+MMT nanocomposites
   compared to PVA/Na+MMT nanocomposite. The interactions between PVA, PVP
   and NI(CMMT were established by the Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. The moisture absorption tendency of both the PVA and
   PVA/PVP films reduced after the incorporation of Na+MMT at 75\% constant
   relative humidity. Differential scanning calorimetry studies show that
   the presence of PVP and Na+MMT both are responsible for reducing the
   heat of fusion, and crystallinity of PVA. The flow behavior of the PVA,
   PVA/PVP and its nanocomposite solutions has been also studied. Water
   vapor permeability of PVA/PVP/Na+MMT composite films decreased in the
   presence of nanoclay due to increasing tortuous paths for diffusion. (C)

Abstract = {{Water hyacinth, i.e., Eichhornia crassipes Solms can remove a large
   variety of different pollutants from water and are considered an
   excellent candidate for phytoremediation of contaminated waters.
   Nevertheless, exploitation of water hyacinth for phytoremediation has so
   far been limited to tropical or subtropical regions. In this study, the
   influence of temperature on the morphology, growth, and nutrient removal
   of water hyacinths was studied in a relatively low temperature range,
   12-25 degrees C, in the form of three night/day temperature cycles,
   i.e., 12/15 degrees C, 15/20 degrees C, and 15/25 degrees C. It was
   shown that water hyacinth is very sensitive to temperature in the tested
   range and 15/25 degrees C is the most favorable condition among the
   tested. A biomass productivity of 10.7 tons DW/ha/yr, total nitrogen
   removal rate of 400 kg N/ha/yr and total phosphorous removal rate of 65
   kg P/ha/yr were estimated according to the experimental results on the
   basis of five operational months per year. No visible morphological
   changes were observed when the plants were cultivated at 15/20 degrees C
   or 15/25 degrees C but significant morphological changes were observed
   when the plants were transferred from a rooftop greenhouse to a growth
   chamber controlled at 12/15 degrees C with plant size shrinking
   significantly. Nevertheless, substantial plant growth and nutrient
   removal were observed at 12/15 degrees C, although with a prolonged
   adaptation phase of 2 weeks. Results of this research suggest good
   potential of water hyacinths for water phytoremediation in relatively
   cold regions such as Canada. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{Large quantity of oxygen evolves as a byproduct of photosynthesis in

Abstract = {{Real-time ultrahigh-resolution microwave frequency identification is
   paramount for widespread applications, such as communications, radar,
   and electronic warfare. Photonics-assisted microwave frequency
   identification can be achieved using an optical channelizer. While this
   technique enables simultaneous measurement of multiple frequencies, it
   has poor measurement resolution due to the large channel spacing, which
   is usually greater than 1 GHz. Here, we introduce a new
   channelizer-based microwave frequency measurement technique that offers
   nearly 500 times higher spectral resolution. This method employs largely
   dispersed broadband optical pulses to encode the time-domain
   characteristics of the modulating signal to the optical spectral domain.
   An optical channelizer is employed to slice the spectrum, which is
   equivalent to performing temporal sampling of the time-domain waveform.
   The unknown microwave signal is then reconstructed and its spectral
   distribution is analyzed by a digital processor. To evaluate the
   proposed technique, frequency measurements of a single-tone, a
   multiple-tone, and a frequency-hopping microwave signal are
   demonstrated. A measurement resolution as high as 55 MHz is achieved
   using an optical channelizer with a channel spacing of 25 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{A stable and reliable routing mechanism for vehicular ad hoc networks
   (VANETs) is an important step toward the provision of long data
   transmission applications, such as file sharing and music download.
   Traditional mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocols are not
   suitable for VANET because the mobility model and environment of VANET
   are different from those of traditional MANET. To solve this problem, we
   proposed a new stable routing algorithm, called stable directional
   forward routing. The novelty of the proposed routing protocol is its
   combining direction broadcast and path duration prediction into ad hoc
   on-demand distance vector routing protocols, which including: (1) Nodes
   in VANET are grouped based on the position, only nodes in a given
   direction range participating in the route discovery process to reduce
   the frequency of flood requests, (2) Route selection is based on the
   link duration while not the hops or other metrics to increase the path
   duration, (3) Route discovery is executed before the path expiration in
   order to decrease the end to end delay. The performance of the new
   scheme is evaluated through extensive simulations with Qualnet.
   Simulation results indicate the benefits of the proposed routing
   strategy in terms of decreasing routing control packet, reducing the
   number of link-breakage events, improving the packet delivery ratio and
   decreasing the end-to-end delay.}},

   the minimalist design of an RFID system, a lightweight authentication

   scheme that counters the relay attack in RFID systems. Our scheme is the
   first solution based on the chaos suppression theory. We have exploited
   the chaotic characteristics of a dynamic Lorenz controller to
   distinguish a legitimate RFID reader from a proxy reader in the relay

   solutions with the following results: an increase of influent
   temperature from 10 degrees C to 25 degrees C decreases the annual cost
   by about 8.5\%, an increase of influent flow from 500 to 2500 m(3)/h
   triples the annual cost, the A(2)O BNR system is more sensitive to
   variations in influent ammonia than phosphorus concentration and the
   maximum growth rate of autotrophic biomass was the most sensitive
   kinetic parameter in the optimization model.}},

Abstract = {{Beaconless or contention-based geographic routing algorithms forward
   packets toward a geographical destination reactively without the
   knowledge of the neighborhood. Such algorithms allow greedy forwarding,
   where only the next hop neighbor responds after a timer-based contention
   using only three messages (RTS, CTS, and DATA) per forwarding step.
   However, existing contention-based schemes for recovery from greedy
   failures do not have this property. In this paper, we show that recovery
   is possible within this 3-message scheme: the Rotational Sweep (RS)
   algorithm directly identifies the next hop after timer-based contention
   and constructs a traversal path that ensures progress after a greedy
   failure. It uses a traversal scheme (called Sweep Circle) that forwards
   a message along the alpha-shape of the network and provides recovery
   paths shorter or equal to the prominent face routing with Gabriel graph
   planarization. An alternative traversal scheme (called Twisting
   Triangle) provides even shorter routes on average, as shown by
   simulations. They both also reduce per-node overall network contention
   delays. We prove that both traversal schemes guarantee delivery in unit
   disk graphs. Our traversal schemes avoid planarization and are easy to
   implement, based merely on the evaluation of a function of a neighbor
   node's relative position. They can also be used for boundary detection
   and improve path-length in conventional beacon-based routing.}},

Abstract = {{The bearing capacity of unsaturated soils is commonly estimated using
   the conventional shear-strength parameters determined from drained
   loading conditions regardless of soil type and drainage condition.
   However, the use of drained shear-strength parameters to interpret the
   bearing capacity of unsaturated fine-grained soils is not reliable
   because there are uncertainties with respect to the drainage conditions
   of both the pore-air and pore-water pressures. In the current study, a
   series of model footing tests is conducted in statically compacted
   unsaturated fine-grained soils. The model footing test results are
   interpreted using the modified effective-stress and total stress
   approaches considering the influence of matric suction. In addition, the
   validity of the modified total stress approach is tested using in situ
   plate-load test results in unsaturated fine-grained soils. The
   advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of using the modified
   effective-stress and modified total-stress approaches for engineering
   practice applications are discussed in this paper.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) coupled processes that have
   resulted from long term past climate changes and glaciation cycles in
   the sedimentry rocks of southern Ontario are investigated. A conceptual
   numerical model has been developed to solve four coupled partial
   differential equations (PDEs), which represent hydraulic, thermal,
   mechanical and chemical processes. The finite element method is used to
   solve the PDEs under transient surface boundary conditions imposed by
   past glaciation cycles to predict the hydraulic, mechanical, thermal and
   geochemical responses of the geological system. The results show that
   past glaciations have a significant impact on the hydraulic gradient and
   pressure, vertical effective stress and salinity profiles, and a limited
   effect on the permafrost depth. The predicted results show good
   agreement when compared with the field data for the total dissolved
   solid, rock strength and quality. The results show relatively good
   agreement with the anomalous pore water pressure profile in the field.
   The modeling results indicate that the infiltration depth of glacial
   melted water is less than 300 m, and are consistent with the field
   observation of total dissolved solids. At the level of a deep geological
   repository (DGR) for low and intermediate level radioactive wastes being
   planned in these rock formations, a safety factor of 6.9 is predicted
   against failure by using Hoek-Brown failure envelopes, while a low
   safety factor of 0.83 is predicted at the shallower level of the
   Silurian (Salina) formation It is found that solute transport at the
   middle and upper Ordovician formations are diffusion dominated at depths
   of 300 in or more, and controlled by diffusion-advection above 300 m.
   Based on the results obtained, the modeling of a past glaciation can be
   used with reasonable confidence in predicting the impact of future
   glaciations related to the long term safety and stability of the
   proposed DGR in the sedimentry formation. However, for site specific
   conditions, THMC modeling is very sensitive to material properties, and
   sensitivity analysis is required for future model development. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Delay tolerant networks (DTN) are characterized by a lack of continuous
   end-to-end connections due to node mobility, constrained power sources,
   and limited data storage space of some or all of its nodes. To overcome
   the frequent disconnections, DTN nodes are required to store data
   packets for long periods of time until they come near other nodes.
   Moreover, to increase the delivery probability, they spread multiple
   copies of the same packet on the network so that one of them reaches the
   destination. Given the limited storage and energy resources of many DTN
   nodes, there is a tradeoff between maximizing delivery and minimizing
   storage and energy consumption. In this paper, we study the routing
   problem in DTN with limited resources. We formulate a mathematical model
   for optimal routing, assuming the presence of a global observer that can
   collect information about all the nodes in the network. Next, we propose
   a new protocol based on social grouping among the nodes to maximize data
   delivery while minimizing network overhead by efficiently spreading the
   packet copies in the network. We compare the new protocol with the
   optimal results and the existing well-known routing protocols using real
   life simulations. Results show that the proposed protocol achieves
   higher delivery ratio and less average delay compared to other protocols
   with significant reduction in network overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Butanol, considered as one of the best renewable alternatives for
   gasoline, has attracted significant attention in recent years. However,
   biobutanol production via fermentation is plagued by the low final
   product concentration due to product inhibition. It is possible to
   enhance productivity by selectively removing biobutanol from the
   fermentation broth. Adsorption is one of the most promising and
   energy-efficient techniques for butanol separation and recovery. In the
   present study, different adsorbents were tested by performing kinetic
   and equilibrium experiments to find the best adsorbent for butanol
   separation. Activated carbon (AC) F-400 showed the fastest adsorption
   rate and the highest adsorption capacity amongst ACs and zeolites
   tested. AC F-400 also showed the highest affinity toward butanol and to
   a lesser extent for butyric acid whereas its adsorption capacity for the
   other main components present in acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation
   broths was very low. In addition, the butanol adsorption capacity was
   not affected by the presence of ethanol, glucose and xylose while the
   presence of acetone led to a slight decrease in adsorption capacity at
   low butanol concentrations. On the other hand, the presence of acids
   (acetic acid and butyric acid) showed a significant effect on the
   butanol adsorption capacity over a wide range of butanol concentration
   and this effect was more pronounced for butyric acid.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the support pore size on the membrane morphology was
   investigated for zeolite silicalite-1 membranes synthesized by pore
   plugging method on supports with zirconium oxide and/or titanium oxide
   active layer. Parameters including surface coverage, zeolite layer
   thickness, crystal size and shape, zeolite penetration depth were used
   to quantify the membrane morphology. Five supports with different pore
   sizes for their active layer in the range of 0.14-1.4 mu m were
   investigated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed a typical
   silicalite-1 zeolite structure with a high internal crystalline order
   grown inside the pores as well as on top of all supports. The XRD
   results also showed that the silicalite-1 crystals in the synthesized
   membranes are not randomly oriented. The crystallographic preferred
   orientation (CPO) analysis revealed that the degree of orientation
   toward either the a-axis or b-axis perpendicular to the support surface,
   increased by decreasing the pore size of the support. The 0.45 mu m
   support had the most preferably oriented zeolite layer for access of
   molecules entering into the membrane structure with the highest number
   of crystals oriented with the b-axis (the one with straight channels)
   perpendicular to the support surface. The scanning electron micrographs
   (SEM) analysis of the membranes revealed a dense and continuous surface
   morphology with the highest crystal size of silicalite-1 around 1.5 mu m
   on the surface of the support with the 0.45 mu m pore size. SEM
   micrographs also showed a continuous layer grown over four supports out
   of five supports with different pore sizes that were investigated, with
   no layer observed on the 1.4 mu m pore size support. The average
   thickness of the zeolite layer was in the range of 0.7-1.4 mu m,
   depending on the pore size of the support. The supports with 0.2 and
   0.45 mu m pore sizes had the most uniform zeolite layer thickness while
   the support with 0.8 mu m pore size active layer had the least uniform
   zeolite layer thickness. The electron diffraction spectrometer (EDS)
   analysis confirmed the formation of pure silicalite-1 layer at the
   surface as well as inside the pores of all supports. The highest
   silicalite-1 crystal penetration was for the supports with 0.45 and 1.4
   mu m pore sizes. Single gas permeation experiments with He and N-2 gases
   at 293 K illustrated that regardless of the pore size of the support,
   the He and N-2 permeances were constant despite the change of the
   pressure across the membranes. The highest permeances were observed for
   the membrane prepared using the 0.45 mu m pore size support, while the
   lowest permeances were for the membrane prepared using the 1.4 mu m pore
   size support. These results confirmed the selective properties of the
   prepared membranes. No matter what is the pore size of the support or
   the feed pressure, N-2 permeances were around three times higher than
   those for He.}},

Title = {{Assessment of limestone treatment with organic acids for CO2 capture in
   Ca-looping cycles}},
Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The main challenge for CO2 capture in calcium looping cycles is the
   decay of CO2 carrying capacity of the CaO-based sorbents with increasing
   number of cycles. In this work, limestone was treated with organic acids
   and tested for CO2 capture in calcium looping cycles to understand how
   practical and reliable the treatment is for CO2 looping capture. The
   results showed that after 20 cycles the carbonation conversions of
   limestone treated with acetic acid, vinegar, formic acid, and oxalic
   acid were 33.1\%, 21.1\%, 31\%, and 35.2\%, respectively, compared to
   18.9\% for untreated limestone. The treatment with organic acids clearly
   improves the sintering-resistance properties of the modified sorbent
   However, the activity of these sorbents was found to decline in similar
   fashion to that of untreated limestone. It was concluded that although
   limestone treatment with organic acids enhances CO2 capture capacity,
   the enhancement is marginal in most cases while the treatment increases
   the cost of CO2 capture significantly. Accordingly, the treatment may
   not be an adequate approach if the goal is to maintain lowcost capture
   of CO2; moreover, treated sorbents which perform well for CO2 capture do
   also perform well for SO2 capture, causing their capacity to decline at
   least as rapidly as a natural untreated sorbent and often more so. (C)

Pages = {{38-43}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Slag viscosity models are applied in many industries. However, the
   models are only applicable to a limited range of slag compositions and
   conditions, and their performance is not easily assessed. The present
   study describes tools that have been developed to assist slag viscosity
   model users in the selection of the best model for given slag
   compositions and conditions, and to help users determine how well the
   model will perform. The tools, which are in the form of several publicly
   available files and programs, include a slag viscosity prediction
   calculator with 24 slag viscosity models, and a database of 4124 slag
   viscosity measurements. The database includes over 750 compositions from
   53 published studies. New slag viscosity models, integrated into the
   tools, include an artificial neural network for fully molten slags, and
   a viscosity prediction modifier for slags containing solid particles.
   Glass forming, entrained flow gasification and blast furnace case
   studies are provided to demonstrate how the slag viscosity modeling
   tools can be applied and to highlight certain features that should be
   considered when using slag viscosity models and experimental data. (C)

Title = {{Integrating building information modelling with sustainability to design

Journal = {{BUILDING SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Lately the construction industry has become more interested in designing
   and constructing environmentally friendly buildings (e.g. sustainable
   buildings) that can provide both high performance and monetary savings.
   In general, sustainability integrates the following three related
   components: (1) environmental, (2) economic, (3) social well-being.
   Incorporating these components at the conceptual stage is achieved by
   using sustainable design, through which designers must identify
   associated materials and systems based on any selected certification
   (rating) system. The use of building information modelling (BIM)
   concepts helps engineers design digital models that allow owners to
   visualize the building before the physical implementation takes place.
   To apply BIM concepts, designers use tools to create 3D models of
   buildings where the design materials and systems are selected from the
   built-in database of these tools. Designers will not be able to quantify
   the environmental impacts of these materials to support the decisions
   needed to design sustainable buildings due to the following reasons: (1)
   a lack of information about the sustainable materials that are stored in
   the database, (2) a lack of interoperability between the design and
   analysis tools that enable full life cycle assessments (LCAs) of
   buildings. This paper presents a methodology that integrates BIM and LCA
   tools with a database for designing sustainable building projects. The
   methodology describes the development and implementation of a model that
   incorporates a database in which information about sustainable materials
   is stored and linked to a BIM (3D) module along with an LCA module and a
   certification and cost module. The goal of this model is to simplify the
   process of creating sustainable designs and to evaluate the
   environmental impacts (EI) of newly designed buildings at the conceptual
   stage of their life. An actual building project is presented in order to
   illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the developed model.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure evolution from center to edge of the as-forged and heat

   characterization of these microstructure features is essential for
   models predicting the creep and fatigue lives of the alloy. Accurate and
   reliable revealing of the grain boundaries in as-forged and heat treated
   Inconel-718 was made possible in this study by development of a new
   method. From microstructure investigations, nonuniformities in grain
   size, volume fraction, size and inter particle spacing of precipitates
   from center to edge were observed in both as-forged and heat treated
   disks. The microstructure nonuniformities resulted in significant
   variation in hardness from center to edge of the disks. (C) 2013

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{505}},
Pages = {{326-334}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Precipitation regime is the number one factor in food productivity in
   the Sahel region. Recurrent droughts have caused several food crises in
   the region during the three last decades. The situation may not improve
   as a recent special IPCC report states that West Africa will likely
   experience longer and more intense droughts (IPCC, 2012) in the near
   future. As drought adversely affects food security, Sahelian
   decision-makers need to understand past and current trends in Sahelian
   precipitation to have some insight in what can be expected for the next
   five years. In this paper, time series of selected precipitation indices
   were calculated using 1950-2007 daily precipitation data from 31
   stations across Senegal and analyzed for changes in temporal trends
   using a Bayesian multiple change point detection procedure. The selected
   indices are the mean (M) and the standard deviation (SD) of
   precipitation, the frequency of wet days (precipitation using threshold
   of >= 1 mm, Prcpl), the maximum number of consecutive dry days
   (precipitation < 1 mm, CDD), the greatest maximum amount accumulated
   over the 3 day (R3d), the mean intensity per wet day (SDII) and the 90th
   percentile of daily rainfall (Prec90p). They were calculated and
   averaged over four different regions: the entire country (R0), the
   Southern Sahelian Region (R1), the Northern Sudanian Region (R2), and
   finally the Southern Sudanian Region (R3).The Bayesian change-point
   detection procedure detects whenever a trend in the data is inverted,
   from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. Results show that
   significant changes in trend were almost always consistent across
   Senegalese regions, with a few years' differences in the dates of
   occurrence of the changes. A decreasing trend followed by an increasing
   trend was found for M, SD, Prcpl, R3d, SDII and Prec90p. An increasing
   trend followed by a decreasing trend was observed for CDD in regions R0,
   R1 and R2, but not for R3 where the trend is increasing during the study
   period. Changes in Prec90p were not consistent across regions,
   presumably because it is very sensitive to noise in the data. Most
   changes at the national scale occurred in the 1980s, except for SDII for
   which the changes occurred in the 1970s. Prec90p displayed a trend
   change (from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend) in the
   mid-1990s. Modest to significant increases in SDII were observed for
   almost all regions while Prcpl was stable during the last two decades.
   These results suggest that the continuous rainfall deficit that was
   observed since 1950 in this part of the Sahel has (at least temporarily)
   come to an end and that the next few years will be wet. Crown Copyright

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a turbo receiver for MIMO-CDMA systems employing parity
   bit selected and permutation spreading is proposed. In such systems,
   spreading codes used by transmit antennas are dependent on the
   transmitted data. In the proposed system, convolutional coding is used
   as an outer code, while the parity bit selected scheme is used as the
   inner code. Detection and decoding are performed iteratively for each
   detected bit. When parity bit selected spreading is used, the parity
   bits generated by a linear block encoder are used to select a spreading
   code from a set of orthogonal spreading sequences. The selected
   spreading code is then used to spread the signals in all transmit
   antennas. In contrast, in permutation spreading, a permutation of
   orthogonal spreading sequences is used in each transmit antenna. In the
   proposed receiver, soft information passes between the detector and the
   decoder on multiple iterations. Detection is performed using the
   received signal from all receive antennas in combination with the
   extrinsic likelihood provided by a SISO decoder. The turbo receiver is
   further extended to a multiple user system, where the MAI is estimated
   in each iteration and subtracted out from the received signal.
   Simulations show a significant improvement in BER when a turbo receiver
   is used in these systems.}},

Abstract = {{An exceptional hierarchical nanostructured MnO2/carbon hybrid was in
   situ generated by a mild wet chemical pre-treatment and then
   hydrothermal method. The thickness of the representative petal-like
   nanosheet was measured below 5 nm. Growth mechanism of the achieved
   hierarchical hybrid is associated with simultaneously occurred redox and
   oxidation-intercalation reactions. The surface layers of carbon black
   (XC-72) were partly exfoliated, and redox reaction between KMnO4 and
   hydroxyl group occurred on the both side of these layers, resulting in
   the hierarchical hybrid of MnO2/carbon. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Characterization of electrospun polystyrene membrane for treatment of

Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{329}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) for characterization of
   electrospun microporous membranes was assessed. The surface roughness,
   pore size and its distribution, nodule size as well as fiber diameter
   were analyzed for an electrospun polystyrene membrane before (M1) and
   after surface modification via contact-heating (CH) method (M2). It was
   found that thermal modification has improved the overall surface
   morphology and topography, exhibiting a decrease in mean pore size and
   nodule size, lowering roughness parameters, which led to more uniform
   and circular pore geometry, and higher hydrophobicity. As a result,
   separation performance was improved when the membranes were used for the
   treatment of biodiesel's wash water effluent. It was also observed that
   both membranes were effective in treating the highly polluting
   saponified wastewater. In particular, the application of M1 resulted in
   the reduction rates of 58, 26, 92, 95 and 50\%, respectively, for COD,
   BOD, TS, TDS and TSS. More promising reduction rates were achieved with
   M2, where those of COD, BOD, TS, TDS and TSS were at 75\%, 55\%, 92\%,
   96\% and 30\%, respectively. The multi-objective separation mechanism of
   electrospun membranes (screening, depth filtration and adsorption),
   could be the cause of their superior separation performance. (C) 2013

Journal = {{DESALINATION}},

Volume = {{329}},
Pages = {{9-18}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this work, polysulfone (PSf) substrates with different properties
   were made by varying the polymer concentration in the dope solution in
   the range 12-20 wt.\%. Polyamide (PA) thin layers were then formed via
   interfacial polymerization between piperazine and trimethylchloride over
   the PSf substrates. Both top PA thin layers and bottom PSf substrates
   were characterized with respect to physicochemical properties,
   structural morphology, and water flux/salt rejection to investigate the
   influence of substrate properties on the characteristics of PA thin
   layers. Physical properties of the PA layers were reported to be altered
   using different PSf substrate properties and were in good agreement with
   the change in water flux. From the FESEM pictures, it is found that the
   thickness of PA layer increased as the surface pore size of support
   membrane decreased. The change in the membrane structural properties in
   particular pore size is found to portray significant contribution to the
   changes of formed PA layer. Interestingly, only slight changes on Na2SO4
   and MgSO4 salt rejection were reported on any TFC membranes. Considering
   both water permeability and salt rejection rate, the best performing TFC
   membrane produced in this work was the membrane made over substrate of
   15 wt.\% PSf concentration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A continuously tunable fractional Hilbert transformer (FHT) using a
   pi-phase shifted fiber Bragg grating (pi-PSFBG) is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. An FHT has an output that is a weighted sum
   of the original input signal and its classical Hilbert-transformed
   signal. The classical Hilbert transform is implemented using a pi-PSFBG.
   The output from the classical HT and the original input signal are
   controlled to be orthogonally polarized. The combination of the two
   signals at a polarizer would generate a weighted sum with the weighting
   coefficients determined by the angle between the principle axis of the
   polarizer and the polarization direction of the original input signal. A
   pi-PSFBG is fabricated. The performance of the pi-PSFBG as a classical
   HT is evaluated. The incorporation of the pi-PSFBG into the proposed
   system to implement an FHT is studied. A continuously tunable FHT with a
   tunable fractional order of rho = 0.7, 0.86, 0.92, 1, 1.06, 1.17, and
   1.24 to perform Hilbert transformation of a Gaussian pulse with a
   temporal width of 80 ps is experimentally demonstrated.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{410}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Using self-assembly of block copolymer micelle loaded metal precursors,
   combined with a seeding growth route, we have developed a novel approach
   to create ordered metal nanoparticle (NP) arrays of controllable size
   over large areas (similar to 80 mm(2)) on solid substrates. Atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), UV-Vis extinction spectrophotometry, and theoretical
   simulations were systematically carried out to determine the size and
   pattern of NP arrays, and locate the localized surface plasmon resonance
   (LSPR) peak. By tuning the molar ratios of precursors, hexagonal arrays
   of AuNPs of mean heights of 5.2 +/- 0.6 nm, 8.3 +/- 1.7 nm, and 10.0 +/-
   2.1 nm were obtained by self-assembly of poly(styrene-b-2-vinyl
   pyridine) micelle-loaded gold salt on glass. Further seeding growth was
   then used to enlarge the AuNPs to heights of 25.7 and 33 nm and decrease
   the edge-to-edge inter-particle spacing. The optical response of AuNP
   arrays was determined by measuring and computing their absorbance
   spectra as a function of the cover medium refractive index over the
   range from 1 to 1.55; the measured spectra agree very well with the
   computations. The resonance wavelength red-shifts as the medium
   refractive index increases and the bulk sensitivity of the arrays
   increases with increasing AuNP size. When the edge-to-edge
   inter-particle spacing decreased to similar to 50 nm, coupling of
   adjacent AuNPs became apparent, as a shoulder which developed in the
   spectra. Also, the AuNPs were found to be embedded in the substrate
   glass by about similar to 20-30\%, as determined by comparing the
   experimental and computed bulk sensitivities. The fabrication technique
   devised is suitable for low-cost mass-manufacturing of large area arrays
   of ordered high-quality AuNPs on a substrate for biosensor or other
   applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this investigation was to develop a novel in situ gelling
   formulation based on poloxamer-407 (PM) for the sustained release of an
   ophthalmic drug. In an attempt to reduce the concentration of PM without
   compromising the in situ gelling capability and also to increase the
   drug release time, xanthan gum (XG) and guar gum (GG) were added into PM
   to develop different formulations. At concentrations of 18\% and above,
   the PM was able to undergo sol-gel transition below body temperature. It
   was found that XG and GG at a weight ratio of 3:7 were able to convert
   PM solution into gel below body temperature at PM concentrations below
   18\%. Both the in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that the PM with
   an XG-GG combination had a better ability to retain the drug than PM
   itself. The results indicated that the developed in situ gelling
   formulations containing PM with XG-GG may be a better alternative than a
   conventional eye drop. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of Pd atomic content in NixPd1-x (x = 0.98, 0.93 and 0.58)
   nanometer-sized catalysts synthesized with modified polyol method is
   investigated for the electrooxidation of ammonia in alkaline media.
   Physicochemical characterization by transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), inductively coupled
   plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and Xray diffraction
   (XRD) are carried out to identify the sizes, shapes, chemical and
   structural features of the catalysts. Both synthesized Ni98Pd2 and
   Ni93Pd2 are composed of large 50-100 nm Ni particles coated with finer
   Pd ones in the 5-20 nm range. The Ni58Pd42 catalyst has smaller and
   narrower size distribution in the 20 nm size range, indicating that Pd
   stabilizes the particle size of Ni. According to XRD, Ni and Pd form two
   separate face-centred cubic phases with traces of beta-Ni(OH)(2). Before
   ammonia electrooxidation reaction, the catalysts were subjected to an
   electrochemical treatment that consisted of 200 potential cycles in
   NaNO3 at pH 10.5 to build a layer of Ni(OH)(2). Ammonia electrooxidation
   proceeds on NiOOH phase and follows the direct pathway at low
   concentrations and indirect pathway at higher concentrations where NiOOH
   is reducing and NH3 is oxidizing. It was found that the Ni-rich
   compositions have higher activity towards the degradation of ammonia.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. Objective acoustic measures used to analyze phonatory
   dysfunction include shimmer and jitter. These measures are limited in
   that they do not take into account auditory processing. However,
   previous studies have indicated that shimmer may be processed
   differently along the tonotopic axis of the ear and, in particular, may
   be perceptually and physiologically significant around the third and
   fourth formants.
   Methods. This study investigated the relationship between shimmer around
   the first four formants (F1-F4) and in the broadband unfiltered speech
   waveform for 18 normal speakers from the voice disorders database of
   KayPENTAX. The voice samples were filtered around each formant with a
   bandwidth of 400 Hz and then shimmer was assessed using five built-in
   different measures from Praat software.
   Results. Comparisons of means tests revealed that shimmer increases
   significantly with formant frequency from F1 to F4, for all shimmer
   measures. Furthermore, for all shimmer measures, shimmer in the
   unfiltered speech was significantly and more strongly correlated with
   shimmer around F1 (r = 0.45-0.61) and F2 (r = 0.69-0.74), significantly
   but more weakly correlated with F4 (r = 0.42-0.47), and not
   significantly correlated with F3.
   Conclusions. The findings indicate that there are differences in the
   shimmer found around the different formants and that shimmer information
   around F3 and F4 is not well captured in standard shimmer measurements
   based on the broadband unfiltered waveform.}},

Abstract = {{Modification of sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membrane
   was conducted by incorporating Cloisite 15A (R) clay and
   2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP) via solution intercalation method. The
   effect of the Closite and TAP introduction was evaluated in terms of the
   membrane's physicochemical and hydration properties. The membrane's
   properties were compared among the SPEEK based membranes, including
   parent SPEEK, SPEEK/Cloisite and SPEEK/Cloisite 15A (R)/TAP. The uniform
   dispersion of Cloisite 15A (R) particles in SPEEK polymer matrices was
   confirmed by SEM analysis. The stability in water; in terms of
   dimensional change and dissolution, of the modified membrane was
   investigated and compared to the parent SPEEK membrane. SPEEK/Cloisite
   15A (R)/TAP nanocomposite membrane exhibited the highest selectivity by
   means of the ratio of proton conductivity to methanol permeability.
   Owing to its higher proton conductivity and significantly lower methanol
   permeabilities and high stability in water environment, SPEEK/Cloisite
   15A (R)/TAP nanocomposite membrane was found to be a potential
   alternative polymer electrolyte membrane for DMFC applications.}},

Title = {{Field scale ex-situ bioremediation of petroleum contaminated soil under
   cold climate conditions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION \& BIODEGRADATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Assessment and development of strategies for ex-situ bioremediation in
   cold climates, such as in Canada, is of great importance for
   decontamination of contaminated soils. The purpose of this paper was to
   evaluate and compare the use of microbial consortia inoculant and mature
   organic compost as bioaugmentation and biostimulation strategies to
   enhance ex-situ bioremediation of a soil contaminated with heating oil
   under cold weather conditions. The soil was impacted as a result of
   leakage from an above-ground storage tank and had an initial TPH
   concentration was 940+ 127 mu g g(-1) (dry weight). Aerobic biopiles of
   16 m(3) each were constructed and subjected at a field scale to
   microbial consortia inoculant and 10:1 ratio of mature organic compost.
   Two biopiles (S) contained only soil as control, two biopiles (S + C)
   contained soil and compost to assess the individual effect of compost
   addition, two biopiles (S + M) contained soil and microbial consortium
   to assess the individual effect of microbial consortium addition, and
   three biopiles (S + C + M) contained soil plus compost and microbial
   consortium to assess the combined effect of compost and microbial
   consortium addition. Over a 94 days period, composite soil samples for
   each biopile were collected and analysed for total petroleum
   hydrocarbons (TPHs), volatiles (F1), semi volatiles (F2) and
   non-volatiles (F3) fractions, microbial counting, and pH. Additionally,
   field measurements including soil temperature, moisture content, carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (02) were carried out. Although the ambient
   temperature varied from -3.5 degrees C to -24.1 degrees C, the internal
   soil temperatures for the different experimental setups maintained above
   freezing conditions. Results showed that biocell inoculated with
   microbial consortia and amended with 10:1 soil to compost ratio under
   aerobic conditions performed the best, degrading 82\% of total petroleum
   hydrocarbons (TPHs) with a first-order kinetic degradation rate of 0.016
   d(-1), in cold weather conditions. The average removal efficiencies for
   TPHs after 94 days for S, S + M, S + C treatments were 48\%, 55\%, and
   52\%, respectively. Statistical analysis indicated significant
   difference (p < 0.05) within and between the final measurements for TPHs
   and significant difference between the treatment with combined effect (S
   + C + M) and the control (S) as well as individual treatments of S + C
   and S + M. The study concluded that the combination of microbial
   consortia inoculation and mature compost as a bio-stimulant in a 10:1
   soil to compost ratio would be an appropriate bioremediation approach
   for this type of soil matrix, reaching values below provincial standard
   regulations in just 40 days after construction. This research aimed to
   provide valuable knowledge to practitioners about cost-effective and
   existing strategies for ex-situ bioremediation during cold weather
   conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photonic-assisted microwave frequency multiplication with a tunable
   multiplication factor (MF) based on an optical comb generator and an
   embedded single-passband microwave photonic filter (MPF) is proposed and
   demonstrated. The optical comb is generated using two cascaded
   modulators which are driven by a microwave reference signal. By applying
   the optical comb to a photodetector, a fundamental frequency
   corresponding to the comb spacing and its harmonics is generated. Thanks
   to the embedded single-passband MPF, only one harmonic is selected by
   the single-passband MPF. Thus, a single-frequency frequency-multiplied
   microwave signal is generated. In the proposed system, the embedded
   single-passband MPF is formed by using a sliced broadband optical source
   and a section of dispersion-compensating fiber (DCF). By tuning the
   central frequency of the passband at a frequency corresponding to that
   of a specific harmonic, a microwave signal at that specific frequency is
   generated. The proposed system is experimentally demonstrated. A
   frequency-multiplied microwave signal with an MF from 1 to 5 is
   generated. The phase noise and frequency tunability of the generated
   microwave signal are also investigated. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{A Smart Grid is the modernization of the electricity grid using
   communication technology with the prime goals of reducing energy
   consumption as well as cost increasing reliability and creating new
   services for all participants. It comprises key components such as the
   Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which includes Neighborhood area
   network (NAN). When multi-hopping is considered in wireless
   communication, especially in WiFi and ZigBee, the range of the
   communication can be extended to communicate with the gateway collector
   in AMI network. Wireless mesh AMI network may have smart meters, a NAN
   gateway, and fixed as well as mobile repeaters. Though many techniques
   have been developed to secure on-demand routing protocols in wireless
   multi-hop ad-hoc networks, these protocols have shortcomings. In this
   paper, we propose two robust and secure multipath routing protocols for

Abstract = {{With the rapid popularity of smart devices, users are easily and
   conveniently accessing rich multimedia content. Consequentially, the
   increasing need for recommender services, from both individual users and
   groups of users, has arisen. In this paper, we present a new graph-based
   approach to a recommender system, called Folkommender, that can make
   recommendations most notably to groups of users. From rating
   information, we first model a signed graph that contains both positive
   and negative links between users and items. On this graph we examine two
   distinct random walks to separately quantify the degree to which a group
   of users would like or dislike items. We then employ a differential
   ranking approach for tailoring recommendations to the group. Our
   empirical evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the
   proposed group recommendation method performs better than existing
   alternatives. We also demonstrate the feasibility of Folkommender for
   smartphones.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology of cells and expression status of specific surface
   markers {[}cluster of differentiation (CD)], such as CD5, CD19, CD20,
   CD38, and CD45, have long been considered as the essential indicators
   for the diagnosis and prognosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
   (B-CLL). Clinically, it is difficult to simultaneously obtain cell
   morphology and distribution of surface markers with flow cytometry,
   especially for some surrogate markers such as CD38. Here, as an
   alternative and complementary prognostic method, fluorescence microscopy
   and image processing method are introduced to directly visualize the
   cells from patients and to quantitatively determine the expression
   status of surface markers. In this study, the morphological parameters
   of B-CLL cells were measured to establish the correlation between the
   cellular morphology and the surface marker expression. It was clear that
   the CD38+ and CD38- B-CLL cells from the same CD38+ patients had hardly
   any size differences; however, an increase in perimeter was observed for
   CD38- patients. Moreover, the expression level of the receptors on the
   cell was independent of the cell size. There was no evidence showing
   that the expression intensities of CD19 and CD38 were related to each
   other for the CD38+ B-CLL cells. On the same cells, CD5 was more
   selectively expressed on the cell membrane; however, the expression
   patterns suggested that the cell membrane of CD38- B-CLL cells contained
   the least expression level of CD19. Microsc. Res. Tech. 76:1147-1153,

Abstract = {{The present study addresses the self-similar problem of unsteady shock
   reflection on an inclined wedge. The start-up conditions are studied by
   modifying the wedge corner and allowing for a finite radius of

   from the corner, namely regular or Mach reflection, depends intimately
   on the start-up condition, as the flow ``remembers{''} how it was
   started. Substantial differences were found. For example, the type of
   shock reflection for an incident shock Mach number and an isentropic
   exponent changes from regular to Mach reflection between and when a
   straight wedge tip is used, while the transition for an initially curved
   wedge occurs between 57 degrees and 58 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach to the generation of an optical frequency comb with a
   widely tunable center wavelength and comb spacing based on an
   optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is proposed and experimentally
   demonstrated. The OEO is implemented using a polarization modulator
   (PolM), a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG), and a
   photodetector (PD). The PolM is a special phase modulator that supports
   phase modulation along the two principal axes with opposite modulation
   indexes. The joint operation of the PolM, the PS-FBG, and the PD
   corresponds to a frequency-tunable microwave photonic bandpass filter.
   When the output from the PD is fed back to the PolM, the OEO starts to
   oscillate and the oscillation frequency can be tuned by tuning the
   center frequency of the microwave photonic bandpass filter through
   tuning the optical wavelength. The optical comb is then generated by
   tapping part of the optical signal from the PolM and sending it to a
   second PolM. The joint operation of the two PolMs generates an optical
   comb with the comb spacing tunable by tuning the center frequency of the
   microwave photonic filter. Through introducing a second wavelength into
   the OEO, a duplicated optical comb at the second wavelength is
   generated. An experiment is performed. An optical frequency comb with
   tunable frequency spacing from 6.6 to 15.3 GHz and a tunable center
   wavelength from 1500 to 1580 nm is generated.}},

Abstract = {{The design of soil nail systems used in engineering practice is either
   based on conventional soil mechanics or empirical procedures, and
   generally ignores the influence of matric suction. An experimental
   program was conducted to investigate the influence of matric suction on
   the pullout capacity of soil nails installed in compacted sand under
   both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Pullout tests were performed
   on soil nails installed vertically, horizontally, and at an inclination
   of 15 degrees to the vertical in a specially designed test box. A strong
   relationship was observed between the pullout capacity and matric
   suction. A semiempirical method is proposed for the estimation of the
   pullout capacity of soil nails by using the average matric suction value
   and the saturated soil strength parameters, c(a)' and delta. There is a
   reasonably good agreement between the measured and estimated pullout
   capacity of soil nails using the results of the present research program

Abstract = {{We address pairwise and (for the first time) triple key establishment
   problems in wireless sensor networks (WSN). Several types of
   combinatorial designs have already been applied in key establishment. A
   BIBD(v, b, r, k, lambda) (or t - (v, b, r, k, lambda) design) can be
   mapped to a sensor network, where v represents the size of the key pool,
   b represents the maximum number of nodes that the network can support,
   and k represents the size of the key chain. Any pair (or t-subset) of
   keys occurs together uniquely in exactly lambda nodes; lambda = 2 and
   lambda = 3 are used to establish unique pairwise or triple keys. We use
   several known constructions of designs with lambda = 2, to predistribute
   keys in sensors. We also describe a new construction of a design called
   strong Steiner trade and use it for pairwise key establishment. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first paper on application of trades
   to key distribution. Our scheme is highly resilient against node capture
   attacks (achieved by key refreshing) and is applicable for mobile sensor
   networks (as key distribution is independent on the connectivity graph),
   while preserving low storage, computation and communication
   requirements. We introduce a novel concept of triple key distribution,
   in which three nodes share common keys, and discuss its application in
   secure forwarding, detecting malicious nodes and key management in
   clustered sensor networks. We present a polynomial-based and a
   combinatorial approach (using trades) for triple key distribution. We
   also extend our construction to simultaneously provide pairwise and
   triple key distribution scheme, and apply it to secure data aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to pattern cells using photochemistry and self-assembled
   monolayer (SAM) was described in this study. Photocleavable
   4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl chloroformate (NVOC) protected amine on an
   alkanethiol-gold SAM was developed for cell patterning. The cleavage of
   NVOC and the deprotection of amines on the SAM were controlled spatially
   by two sequential UV exposures with a photomask. Biomolecule patterning
   was achieved by introducing cell nonadhesive poly(ethylene glycol) after
   the first exposure and subsequently cell adhesive protein laminin after
   the second exposure to create surface cell adhesiveness differential for
   cell patterning. UV-Vis spectrophotometry was used to determine the
   photolysis of caged self-assembled molecules; in addition, water contact
   angle, atomic force microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize properties of
   different surfaces. To test the efficacy of resulting surfaces in
   patterning cells, a neuron-like cell line, PC12 cell line, was used. The
   in vitro cell studies showed successful PC12 cell patterns on the
   photoactive SAM surfaces. This patterning technique is unique in that it
   does not rely on cell adhesive or nonadhesive properties of the starting
   base material as both cell adhesive and cell nonadhesive molecules were
   individually introduced onto the base material surface through
   photo-uncaging at preselected regions for the ultimate cell patterning.

Abstract = {{Cellular organization, migration and proliferation in three-dimensions
   play a critical role in numerous physiological and pathological
   processes. Nano- and micro-fabrication approaches have demonstrated that
   nano- and micro-scale topographies of the cellular microenvironment
   directly impact organization, migration and proliferation. In this
   study, we investigated these dynamics of two cell types (NIH3T3
   fibroblast and MOCK epithelial cells) in response to microscale grooves
   whose dimensions exceed typical cell sizes. Our results demonstrate that
   fibroblasts display a clear preference for proliferating along groove
   ridges whereas epithelial cells preferentially proliferate in the
   grooves. Importantly, these cell-type dependent behaviours were also
   maintained when in co-culture. We show that it is possible to spatially
   separate a mixed suspension of two cell types by allowing them to
   migrate and proliferate on a substrate with engineered
   microtopographies. This ability may have important implications for
   investigating the mechanisms that facilitate cellular topographic
   sensing. Moreover, our results may provide insights towards the
   controlled development of complex three-dimensional multi-cellular
   constructs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{In this work, novel ultrafiltration (UF) mixed matrix membranes (MMMs)
   composed of organic polyethersulfone (PES) and inorganic Fe-Mn binary
   oxide (FMBO) particles were prepared through a phase inversion process
   for adsorptive elimination of As(III) from the contaminated water. The
   membranes were prepared by casting solutions that consisted of different
   weight ratios of FMBO to PES, in the range of 0-1.5. The membranes were
   then characterized with respect to crystallinity, surface roughness and
   morphology, using XRD, AFM and SEM, respectively. The pure water flux,
   hydrophilicity, porosity and As(III) adsorption capacity of the
   membranes were also investigated. The increase in FMBO/PES ratio
   resulted in an increase in membrane water flux which was attributable to
   the decreased contact angle, increased number of pores and greater
   surface roughness. Although skin layer thickness increased while pore
   size decreased with an increase of FMBO particles loading, the number of
   pores increased, which overrode the effects of the pore size and the
   skin layer thickness, contributing to increased water flux. The best
   performing membranes prepared from the FMBO/PES ratio of 1.5:1
   demonstrated the pure water flux as high as 94.6 L/m(2) h at operating
   pressure of 1 bar and maximum As(III) uptake capacity of around 73.5
   mg/g. The continuous UF experiment showed that the PES/FMBO mixed matrix
   membrane can be potentially utilized for effective removal of As(III)
   from contaminated groundwater by producing permeate containing <10 mu
   g/L As(III). As high as 87.5\% of the membrane adsorption capacity could
   be regenerated using NaOH and NaOCl solution, showing the practicability
   and reusability of the membrane for As(III) removal. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Volume = {{247}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the design of fuzzy control systems with a reduced
   parametric sensitivity making use of Gravitational Search Algorithms
   (GSAs). The parametric variations of the processes lead to sensitivity
   models. Objective functions expressed as integral quadratic performance
   indices, which depend on the control error and squared output
   sensitivity functions are suggested. GSAs are employed to minimize the
   objective functions in the appropriately defined optimization problems.
   This paper also suggests a GSA with improved search accuracy. The new
   GSA is characterized by the modification of the denominator in the
   expression of the force acting on an agent from the other agent; the
   denominator depends not only on the Euclidian distance between the two
   agents but also on the position of the latter: A design method for
   Takagi-Sugeno proportional-integral fuzzy controllers (PI-FCs) is
   proposed. The PI-FCs are dedicated to a class of processes characterized
   by second-order linear or linearized models with an integral component.
   Two discrete-time sensitivity models of the fuzzy control systems are
   derived. An example dealing with the angular position control of direct
   current (DC) servo system laboratory equipment validates the new
   controller design. A set of real-time experimental results illustrates
   the fuzzy control system performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Islet transplantation to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D) has shown varied
   long-term success, due in part to insufficient blood supply to maintain
   the islets. In the current study, collagen and collagen: chitosan (10:
   1) hydrogels, +/-circulating angiogenic cells (CACs), were compared for
   their ability to produce a pro-angiogenic environment in a
   streptozotocin-induced mouse model of T1D. Initial characterization
   showed that collagen-chitosan gels were mechanically stronger than the
   collagen gels (0.7kPa vs. 0.4kPa elastic modulus, respectively), had
   more cross-links (9.2 vs. 7.4/mu m(2)), and were degraded more slowly by
   collagenase. After gelation with CACs, live/dead staining showed greater
   CAC viability in the collagen-chitosan gels after 18h compared to
   collagen (79\% vs. 69\%). In vivo, collagen-chitosan gels,
   subcutaneously implanted for up to 6 weeks in a T1D mouse, showed
   increased levels of pro-angiogenic cytokines over time. By 6 weeks,
   anti-islet cytokine levels were decreased in all matrix formulations +/-
   CACs. The 6-week implants demonstrated increased expression of VCAM-1 in
   collagen-chitosan implants. Despite this, infiltrating vWF(+) and
   CXCR4(+) angiogenic cell numbers were not different between the implant
   types, which may be due to a delayed and reduced cytokine response in a
   T1D versus non-diabetic setting. The mechanical, degradation and
   cytokine data all suggest that the collagen-chitosan gel may be a
   suitable candidate for use as a pro-angiogenic ectopic islet transplant

Abstract = {{A scheme for photonic generation of pulsed microwave signals with
   tunable frequency and phase based on optical spectral-shaping and
   frequency-to-time mapping is proposed and experimentally demonstrated.
   The spectral shaping is realized by a tunable optical comb filter
   consisting of a differential group delay (DGD) element, a polarization
   modulator (PolM), and a polarizer. By passing a short optical pulse
   through the tunable comb filter and a dispersive element (DE), a pulsed
   microwave signal is generated after optical-to-electrical conversion.
   The phase of the generated microwave signal can be continuously tuned by
   tuning the voltage applied to the PolM. The frequency of the microwave
   signal can be tuned by changing the DGD and/or the dispersion of the DE.
   An experiment is performed. The generation of a pulsed microwave signal
   with tunable frequency and phase is demonstrated. (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{A novel plasmonic photocatalyst, Ag@AgCl-intercalated layered niobate
   (denoted K4Nb6O17/Ag@AgCl), was synthesized via a microwave-assisted
   ion-exchange method. The composite materials were characterized using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectra (UV-vis),
   photoluminescence measurements (PL), X-ray fluorescence spectrometer
   (XRF) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared
   plasmonic photocatalyst exhibited an enhanced and stable photoactivity
   for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light
   irradiation. The high activity was attributed to the surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) exhibited by Ag nanoparticles on the surface of AgCl.
   The detection of reactive species by radical scavengers displays that
   center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH- are the main reactive species for
   the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. The mechanism of
   separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes at the
   K4Nb6O17/Ag@AgCl composite was discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A reasonably less permeable compacted clay liner (CCL,) is critical to
   the long-term safety of waste containment facilities. This study
   experimentally investigates a variety of factors, including salinity,
   pH, fluctuation in permeant, permeation duration and presence of
   microorganisms, that are found to influence the hydraulic conductivity
   (k) of consolidated kaolin and the fabrics of suspended kaolin. Amongst
   these factors, a reduction in hydraulic conductivity of up to 4 orders
   of magnitude is obtained from the modification of the microfabrics of
   kaolin; a reduction of 2 orders of magnitude is brought about by
   bioclogging; a reduction of I order of magnitude is related to the
   concentrated Ca solution > 10 mM). The hydraulic conductivity of
   consolidated kaolin can obviously be changed by adjusting the fabrics of
   the kaolin panicles, e.g., clogging the pore spaces with bioslurry,
   permeating them with alkaline solution, or transforming the kaolin into
   metakaolin. An effluent p11 larger than the isoelectric point (pH(IEP))
   leads to a rapid reduction in k until 1 x 10(-11) m/s. A 3-dimensional
   fabric map was established for kaolin suspension in contact with a wide
   range of Ca concentrations and pH levels. The fabrics of kaolin
   suspension are predominated by a salt concentration (C > 2.0 mM) and a
   pH solution (C < 2.0 mM), respectively. (C) 2013 The Japanese

Abstract = {{Self-crosslinkable acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs)
   functionalized with 3-isopropenyl-,-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate (TMI) are
   prepared by starved, seeded semi-batch emulsion polymerization.
   n-Dodecanethiol is used as a chain transfer agent (CTA) and EF-800 as an
   anionic surfactant. A three-level factorial design (3(2)) is performed
   by varying the TMI and CTA concentrations. Increasing the TMI decreases
   the rate of polymerization. Nonetheless, high monomer conversions and
   zero coagulum are observed at the end of all reactions. The latexes are
   used to prepare PSA films for the evaluation of tack, peel strength, and
   shear strength. Crosslinking reactions caused by the isocyanate groups
   of TMI lead to films with very high gel content, even in cases where the
   CTA concentration is high. As a result, shear strength is greatly
   improved. The same films preserve sufficient tack but display low peel
   strength. Empirical models of the tack and peel strength data indicate
   that TMI has a significant effect on these properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a bearing fault detection method based on
   kurtosis-based adaptive bandstop filtering (KABS) and iterative
   autocorrelation (IAC). The interferences in the bearing signal can be
   removed by KABS filtering, whereas IAC is employed for noise reduction
   and signal enhancement. In the KABS method, two window-merging schemes
   are proposed to identify the frequency bands potentially containing
   interferences and to preserve those covering fault frequencies. Issues
   related to the selection of the number of autocorrection iterations are
   also discussed. The proposed method can be used for bearing fault
   detection in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) environment. The implementation of
   the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the
   fault-excited resonant frequency. The performance of the proposed method
   has been examined by simulation analysis, with favorable comparisons to
   the Hilbert enveloping, energy operator, and spectrum kurtosis methods.
   Its effectiveness in bearing fault detection has also been demonstrated
   using experimental data.}},

   that nanoparticles supported on YSZ, tested as a support for the first
   time for toluene oxidation, have greater catalytic activity compared to
   a conventional gamma-Al2O3 support in spite of a lower specific area and
   Pt dispersion. This could be explained by the stronger metal-support
   interactions between Pt and YSZ due to the ionic conductivity of YSZ and
   presence of oxygen vacancies.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled hydrology and water quality models are an important tool today,
   used in the understanding and management of surface water and watershed
   areas. Such problems are generally subject to substantial uncertainty in
   parameters, process understanding, and data. Component models, drawing
   on different data, concepts, and structures, are affected differently by
   each of these uncertain elements. This paper proposes a framework
   wherein the response of component models to their respective uncertain
   elements can be quantified and assessed, using a hydrological model and
   water quality model as two exemplars. The resulting assessments can be
   used to identify model coupling strategies that permit more appropriate
   use and calibration of individual models, and a better overall coupled
   model response. One key finding was that an approximate balance of water
   quality and hydrological model responses can be obtained using both the
   QUAL2E and Mike11 water quality models. The balance point, however, does
   not support a particularly narrow surface response (or stringent
   calibration criteria) with respect to the water quality calibration
   data, at least in the case examined here. Additionally, it is clear from
   the results presented that the structural source of uncertainty is at
   least as significant as parameter-based uncertainties in areal models.

Abstract = {{Many applications would require fast data transfer in Wireless Local
   Area Networks (WLANs) nowadays. A representative example is the EAST
   (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) project where physics
   researchers need to transport massive experiment data using the TCP
   (Transmission Control Protocol). However, the high contention level and
   the high error rate in wireless networks have a great impact on the TCP
   performance. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a MAC layer
   congestion control method to deal with wireless packet loss due to
   errors (as opposed to congestion). Our mechanism is implemented at the
   end wireless nodes based on the IEEE 802.11 DCF mechanism but without
   any modification to the TCP layer. We first propose the concept of the
   MAC layer congestion window in which the MAC layer will send all the
   packets in a window when it obtains access to the wireless channel
   (unlike the traditional DCF mechanism that just sends only one packet).
   Then we allow our congestion control mechanism to adjust its MAC
   congestion window based on the contention degree and the packet loss
   rate at the MAC layer. By performing wireless congestion control at the
   MAC layer, our mechanism can mitigate the effect of wireless packet loss
   on TCP, and therefore improve the TCP performance. The simulation and
   experiment results show that our mechanism can achieve better
   performance than the traditional MAC layer mechanisms in WLANs.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction of mobile sinks into a wireless sensor network can largely
   improve the network performance. However, sink mobility can cause
   unexpected changes of network topology, which may bring excessive
   protocol overhead for route maintenance and may offset the benefit from
   using mobile sinks. In this paper, we propose an efficient data-driven
   routing protocol (DDRP) to address this problem. The design objective is
   to effectively reduce the protocol overhead for data gathering in
   wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks. DDRP exploits the broadcast
   feature of wireless medium for route learning. Specifically, each data
   packet carries an additional option recording the known distance from
   the sender of the packet to target mobile sink. The overhearing of
   transmission of such a data packet will gratuitously provide each
   listener a route to a mobile sink. Continuous such route-learning among
   nodes will provide fresh route information to more and more nodes in the
   network. When no route to mobile sink is known, random walk routing
   simply is adopted for data packet forwarding. Simulation results show
   that DDRP can achieve much lower protocol overhead and longer network
   lifetime as compared with existing work while preserving high packet
   delivery ratio. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{A non-parametric non-filtering approach to bearing fault detection in
   the presence of multiple interference}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Reliable fault detection of bearing faults is crucial to avoid costly
   machine failures. To this end, many methods have been proposed over the
   years. However, most of them are dependent on properly selected
   parameters, such as the center frequency and the bandwidth of the
   bandpass filter for the pass band in the high-frequency resonance
   method. Such parameters may also have to be updated in a variable
   operating environment which may not always be possible without the
   involvement of domain experts. As such, we propose a new non-parametric
   and non-filtering method which can perform reasonably well in the
   presence of vibration interference and noise. This method is based on
   the derivation of amplitude demodulation of a signal to suppress
   unwanted periodic interference components in the acquired signal. It has
   been shown that the proposed method can boost the signal-to-interference
   ratio by up to 2-12 times compared with the energy operator approach and
   can handle signals tinted by both noise and multiple interference. It
   compares favorably with other non-parameter methods, such as the plain
   envelope method and energy operator method. Its effectiveness has
   further been demonstrated using both simulated and experimental data.}},

Pages = {{380-394}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Repetitive vertical hopping is a simple and relatively controlled task
   useful for studying basic neuromuscular properties and tissue mechanics.
   However, several biomechanical and physiological factors are involved.
   This article provides an overview of muscle and tendon properties and
   how these interact during vertical hopping. Muscle properties discussed
   are force-velocity and force-length relationships, electromechanical
   delay, muscle fiber type, stretch induced contraction amplification, and
   muscle spindle afferent feedback. Tendon properties include storage and
   reuse of elastic energy, tendon stiffness, afferent information from
   Golgi tendon organs, and failure points. These muscle and tendon
   properties interact to generate vertical hopping force and power. In
   addition to these basic properties, there are other more complicated
   factors to consider when analyzing vertical hopping such as balance and
   coordination. A wealth of information can be gathered by studying
   vertical hopping. Caution should be taken, however, to prevent
   inappropriate conclusions being drawn about hop performance due to
   oversimplification.}},

   the filter taps; 2) to provide nonuniform time delays; and 3) to control
   the weights of the filter taps. Since negative or complex coefficients
   are equivalently generated based on the nonuniform sampling, a filter
   with an arbitrary spectra response is achieved. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, a flat-top bandpass microwave
   filter with seven all-positive nonuniformly spaced taps at 12 GHz is
   experimentally demonstrated. The proposed method offers a cost-effective
   and easy-to-implement solution for photonic microwave filters having
   arbitrary frequency responses.}},

Abstract = {{Convexity properties of error rates of a class of decoders, including
   the maximum-likelihood/min-distance one as a special case, are studied
   for arbitrary constellations, bit mapping, and coding. Earlier results
   obtained for the additive white Gaussian noise channel are extended to a
   wide class of noise densities, including unimodal and spherically
   invariant noise. Under these broad conditions, symbol and bit error
   rates are shown to be convex functions of the signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) in the high-SNR regime with an explicitly determined threshold,
   which depends only on the constellation dimensionality and minimum
   distance, thus enabling an application of the powerful tools of convex
   optimization to such digital communication systems in a rigorous way. It
   is the decreasing nature of the noise power density around the decision
   region boundaries that ensures the convexity of symbol error rates in
   the general case. The known high/low-SNR bounds of the
   convexity/concavity regions are tightened and no further improvement is
   shown to be possible in general. The high-SNR bound fits closely into
   the channel coding theorem: all codes, including capacity-achieving
   ones, whose decision regions include the hardened noise spheres (from
   the noise sphere hardening argument in the channel coding theorem),
   satisfy this high-SNR requirement and thus has convex error rates in
   both SNR and noise power. We conjecture that all capacity-achieving
   codes have convex error rates. Convexity properties in signal amplitude
   and noise power are also investigated. Some applications of the results
   are discussed. In particular, it is shown that fading is
   convexity-preserving and is never good in low dimensions under
   spherically invariant noise, which may also include any linear diversity
   combining.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep apnea is a common condition that poses serious health risks.
   Current state-of-the-art technology for diagnosing and assessing sleep
   apnea is obtrusive, expensive, and lacks integration/analysis of
   important cardiovascular and respiratory parameters. This paper
   evaluates a novel unobtrusive multiparameter sleep apnea monitor,
   namely, the Biopeak chest belt monitor, and describes a collection of
   associated algorithms for the detection of sleep apnea and assessment of
   the extent of the resulting physiological disturbance. The system uses
   dry electrodes to acquire electrocardiogram, respiratory, and stroke
   volume data and analyzes multiple physiological parameters from it. In a
   pilot investigation on eight healthy subjects simulating a total of 66
   obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) events with Mueller maneuvers, the
   proposed system achieves an accuracy of 95.6\%, a specificity of 97.2\%,
   and a sensitivity of 93.8\% for identifying these events. Moreover, the
   response of the simulated OSA events on the multiple physiological
   parameters conforms to earlier published work. We thus conclude that the
   proposed chest belt system has potential to be used for reliable sleep
   apnea detection and comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular and
   respiratory parameters in sleep apnea.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-state nanopores have emerged as a versatile tool for the
   characterization of single biomolecules such as nucleic acids and
   proteins(1). However, the creation of a nanopore in a thin insulating
   membrane remains challenging. Fabrication methods involving specialized
   focused electron beam systems can produce well-defined nanopores, but
   yield of reliable and low-noise nanopores in commercially available
   membranes remains low(2,3) and size control is nontrivial(4,5). Here,
   the application of high electric fields to fine-tune the size of the
   nanopore while ensuring optimal low-noise performance is demonstrated.
   These short pulses of high electric field are used to produce a pristine
   electrical signal and allow for enlarging of nanopores with subnanometer
   precision upon prolonged exposure. This method is performed in situ in
   an aqueous environment using standard laboratory equipment, improving
   the yield and reproducibility of solid-state nanopore fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{A novel Tribaloy alloy, designated as T-400C (R), has been developed for
   enhanced high-temperature oxidation resistance. This new alloy has been
   used as surface coating for environmental protection. One of the popular
   coating techniques, slurry coating, which is applied on T-400C, includes
   a sintering process at the temperature of solution treatment. This
   article presents a study of the influence of solution treatment on the
   microstructure and tribological properties of T-400C. The wear test is
   conducted on a temperature-controlled pin-on-disc tribometer at room
   temperature and elevated temperatures. The SEM/EDX analysis reveals that
   this treatment process promotes Laves phase precipitates within the
   solid solution matrix of this alloy. The sliding wear test demonstrates
   that the Laves phase precipitates enhance the wear resistance of this
   alloy. At high temperatures material oxidation affects the wear behavior
   of this alloy significantly. The worn surfaces are analyzed using
   SEM/EDX to help investigate the wear mechanisms of T-400C at high
   temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave photonics (MWP) is an emerging filed in which photonic
   technologies are employed to enable and enhance functionalities in
   microwave systems which are usually very challenging to fulfill directly
   in the microwave domain. Various photonic devices have been used to
   achieve the functions. A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is one of the key
   components in microwave photonics systems due to its unique features
   such as flexible spectral characteristics, low loss, light weight,
   compact footprint, and inherent compatibility with other fiber-optic
   devices. In this paper, we discuss the recent development in employing
   FBGs for various microwave photonics subsystems, with an emphasis on
   subsystems for microwave photonic signal processing and microwave
   arbitrary waveform generation. The limitations and potential solutions
   are also discussed. (c) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Cemented paste backfill (CPB) technology has been widely used to fill
   underground mine voids for underground mine support and/or tailings
   disposal. Once placed, the CPB structure is subjected to strong coupled
   thermal (T), hydraulic (H), mechanical (M) and chemical (C) processes.
   In this paper, an experiment with insulated-undrained high columns has
   been carried out to understand these THMC processes. A CPB mixture is
   loaded into two columns and instrumented with various sensors to monitor
   the evolution of temperature, pore water pressure and suction for a
   period of 150 days. In addition, four other CPB columns are cured at 7,
   28, 90 and 150 days, and then extensive laboratory testing is carried
   out on the CPB samples with regards to their thermal conductivity,
   saturated hydraulic conductivity, water retention properties, and
   mechanical and physical properties. Also, the rate of evaporation is
   monitored in a cylindrical CPB sample for the entire period of study.
   The results obtained show that a higher temperature can result in faster
   microstructural refinement and hence lower fluid transport ability.
   Reduction in the degree of saturation decreases thermal conductivity.
   The hydraulic properties are strongly coupled to chemical and mechanical
   factors. Mechanical deterioration following surface shrinkage and cracks
   can increase the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Also, changes in pore
   fluid chemistry affect microstructural evolution and can influence
   physical properties, such as void ratio and degree of saturation.
   Moreover, the obtained results support that the THMC properties of CPB
   are strongly coupled due to several internal mechanisms, such as heat of
   hydration, self-desiccation, suction development and cement hydration.
   The findings can contribute to a better understanding on the behaviour
   of CPB and thus towards the designing of more cost-effective and durable
   CPB structures. The results of the evolution of the mechanical, chemical
   and microstructural processes are discussed in a companion paper (see
   Part II, this issue). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wavelength reuse in a bidirectional radio-over-fiber link is proposed
   and demonstrated based on the cross-gain modulation (XGM) and the
   cross-polarization modulation in a semiconductor optical amplifier
   (SOA). With a polarization beam splitter placed at the remote antenna
   unit, the polarization-modulated signal generated at the SOA is
   converted into noninverted and inverted intensity-modulated signals. The
   noninverted signal is used to cancel the inverted XGM-induced
   intensity-modulated signal to form a clean optical carrier for
   wavelength reuse in upstream signal transmission, while the inverted
   intensity-modulated signal is combined constructively to enhance the
   XGM-induced signal, providing robust downlink service. A bidirectional
   transmission of 5 GHz RF signal carrying a 50 MBaud 16 quadrature
   amplitude modulation baseband signal is experimentally implemented. The
   error vector magnitude degradation due to the fiber transmission for
   both the downlink and uplink signal is about 0.2\%. (C) 2013 Optical

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{67-72}},

Abstract = {{Surface modified polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes
   were fabricated via a dry-wet phased inversion process. Surface
   modifying macromolecules (SMMs) (0, 2, 4 and 6 wt.\%) were used as
   additives in the spinning dope. During phase inversion SMM migrates to
   the membrane surface, resulting in different surface morphology and
   surface chemistry. The surface modified PVDF membranes showed the larger
   pore size, higher gas permeance, effective surface porosity, contact
   angle and overall porosity but lower critical water entry pressure
   compared to the PVDF hollow fiber membrane without SMM. The performance
   of the surface modified membrane in contactor application for physical
   CO2 absorption was investigated by the fabricated gas-liquid membrane
   contactor module, where distilled water was used to dissolve CO2. It was
   found that the liquid phase resistance was dominant in the absorption
   experiment. The results show that the surface modified PVDF membrane has
   a higher performance compared to control PVDF membrane. By increasing
   SMM concentration in the spinning dope, the CO2 absorption flux
   increased significantly. With the membrane prepared from 6 wt.\% of SMM
   in the spinning dope, a maximum CO2 absorption flux of 5.4 x 10(-3)
   mol/m(2) s was achieved at 300 ml min(-1) of absorbent flow rate, which
   was almost 650\% more than the fabricated membrane without SMM. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare the muscle-sparing anterior

   obtained for 40 patients (20 anterior and 20 lateral) and 20 control
   participants. Participants were assessed six to twelve months
   postoperatively. It was hypothesized that the anterior group would have
   closer-to-normal range of motion, moments, and powers than the lateral
   group. Both surgical groups had gait anomalies, such as significantly
   lower peak hip abduction moments. It is therefore thought that other
   variables such as preoperative gait adaptations, trauma from the
   surgery, or postoperative protection mechanisms for avoiding loading the
   prosthesis might be more influential factors than surgical approach when
   determining function after surgery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Gravel-bed braided rivers are characterized by shallow, branching flow
   across low relief, complex, and mobile bed topography. These conditions
   present a major challenge for the application of higher dimensional
   hydraulic models, the predictions of which are nevertheless vital to
   inform flood risk and ecosystem management. This paper demonstrates how
   high-resolution topographic survey and hydraulic monitoring at a density
   commensurate with model discretization can be used to advance
   hydrodynamic simulations in braided rivers. Specifically, we detail
   applications of the shallow water model, Delft3d, to the Rees River, New
   Zealand, at two nested scales: a 300 m braid bar unit and a 2.5 km
   reach. In each case, terrestrial laser scanning was used to parameterize
   the topographic boundary condition at hitherto unprecedented resolution
   and accuracy. Dense observations of depth and velocity acquired from a
   mobile acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp), along with low-altitude
   aerial photography, were then used to create a data-rich framework for
   model calibration and testing at a range of discharges. Calibration
   focused on the estimation of spatially uniform roughness and horizontal
   eddy viscosity, (H), through comparison of predictions with distributed
   hydraulic data. Results revealed strong sensitivity to (H), which
   influenced cross-channel velocity and localization of high shear zones.
   The high-resolution bed topography partially accounts for form
   resistance, and the recovered roughness was found to scale by 1.2-1.4
   D-84 grain diameter. Model performance was good for a range of flows,
   with minimal bias and tight error distributions, suggesting that
   acceptable predictions can be achieved with spatially uniform roughness
   and (H).}},

Abstract = {{A photonic-assisted microwave channelizer with improved channel
   characteristics based on spectrum-controlled stimulated Brillouin
   scattering (SBS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In the
   proposed system, N lightwaves from a laser array are multiplexed and
   then split into two paths. In the upper path, the lightwaves are
   modulated by a microwave signal with its frequency to be measured. In
   the lower path, for each lightwave, the wavelength is shifted to a
   specific shorter wavelength via carrier-suppressed single-sideband
   modulation and the spectrum is then shaped. The wavelength-shifted and
   spectrum-shaped lightwaves are used to pump a single-mode fiber to
   trigger SBS. Thanks to the SBS effect, multiple gain channels at the N
   wavelengths are generated. The channel profile of each channel,
   determined by the designed spectral shape of the pump source, is
   improved with a flat top and a reduced shape factor. The characteristics
   including the bandwidth, channel spacing, and channel profile can be
   controlled by adjusting the spectral shape of the pump source.
   Aproof-of-concept experiment is performed. A microwave channelizer with
   a shape factor less than 2, a tunable channel bandwidth of 40, 60, or 90
   MHz, and a tunable channel spacing of 50, 70, or 80 MHz, is
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{A frequency-multiplying optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) with a tunable
   multiplication factor to generate a frequency-quadrupled, sextupled, or
   octupled microwave signal without using an optical filter is proposed
   and experimentally demonstrated, for the first time to the best of our
   knowledge. In the proposed OEO, a polarization modulator (PolM), a
   polarization controller (PC), and an optical polarizer (Pol) function
   jointly as a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM). Microwave oscillation is
   achieved in the OEO by feedbacking the intensity-modulated signal to the
   PolM after photodetection, and the oscillation frequency is determined
   by the center frequency of an electrical bandpass filter (EBPF) in the
   loop. A frequency-multiplied microwave signal is generated by a joint
   use of the PolM and a second modulator to generate two sidebands at the
   +/- second, +/- third, or +/- fourth orders with the sidebands at other
   orders fully suppressed. By beating the two sidebands at a second
   photodetector (PD), a frequency-quadrupled, sextupled, or octupled
   microwave signal is generated. An experiment is performed. A fundamental
   microwave signal at 9.957 GHz is generated in the OEO loop, which is
   multiplied to generate a frequency-quadrupled, sextupled, or octupled
   microwave signal at 39.828, 59.742, or 79.656 GHz, respectively. The
   phase-noise performance of the frequency-multiplying microwave signal is

Abstract = {{A novel scheme to simultaneously generate an on-off keying (OOK) impulse
   radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) signal, a 60-GHz millimeter-wave (mmW)
   signal, and a baseband signal in the optical domain using a Sagnac loop
   is proposed and demonstrated. In the proposed system, a polarization
   beam splitter (PBS), a fiber Bragg grating (FBG), and two back-to-back
   connected polarization modulators (PolMs) are incorporated in the Sagnac
   loop. An OOK Gaussian pulse signal is modulated on a clockwise
   transmitted optical carrier by the first PolM and then converted to an
   OOK UWB impulse signal at the FBG serving as an edge filter, and the
   counterclockwise transmitted optical carrier is simultaneously modulated
   by a baseband signal and a 30-GHz mmW signal at the second PolM. By
   introducing a p phase shift between the clockwise and counterclockwise
   optical carriers, the optical carrier of the 30-GHz signal is suppressed
   when applied to a polarizer. As a result, a frequency-doubled mmW signal
   at 60 GHz is generated by beating the two first order sidebands at a
   photodetector. Due to the velocity mismatch between the counterclockwise
   light wave and the clockwise microwave carrier, the OOK signal and the
   baseband signal can travel through the other PolM with negligible
   modulation; thus no interference from another signal would be
   introduced. Error-free transmission of a UWB signal at 2.5 Gbps and a
   wired baseband signal at 2.5 and 5 Gbps over a 25-km single-mode fiber
   is achieved. A frequency-doubled mmW signal at 60 GHz is also obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The Canadian oil sands resources present one of the world's most vast
   hydrocarbon deposits. The processing of oil sands to extract bitumen
   generates large volumes of mature fine tailings (MFT). The large volume,
   poor consolidation and water release ability of MFT have been causing
   significant economic and environmental concerns. Therefore, significant
   research efforts have been devoted to finding methods for the dewatering
   and densification of MFT. In the present paper, a novel approach which
   consists of the rapid dewatering of MET by using a super absorbent
   polymer (SAP) to produce dense MFT is proposed. A comprehensive
   laboratory investigation on the shear strength testing of MFT specimens
   dewatered with SAP by using a vane shear apparatus is conducted.
   Furthermore, the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the undrained shear
   strength of the dewatered MET is studied. Finally, the ability of
   recycled SAP to dewater and densify MFT is also assessed. Promising
   results have been obtained. The results indicate that SAP has the
   ability to significantly dewater, densify and increase the undrained
   shear strength of MFT. Furthermore, when subjected to freeze-thaw
   cycles, the MFT dewatered with SAP shows an additional increase in
   strength and solid content. It is also found that it is possible to
   regenerate the polymer (still within sachets) through light thermal
   drying, and the regenerated SAP can still significantly dewater and thus
   increase the shear strength and solid content of MFT. Therefore, SAP
   regeneration and the use of regenerated SAP to dewater MFT in a
   cost-effective way should be assessed in further studies. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A wireless sensor network (WSN) is an effective surveillance tool for
   various applications. One of its functional bases is coverage.
   Stochastic node dropping and node failure greatly impair coverage,
   creating sensing holes, while redundant sensors may exist in other areas
   in the network. This problem was not considered before and we propose
   first solutions to it. We propose a family of localized robot-assisted
   sensor relocation algorithms including R3S2, G-R3S2, C-R3S2 and
   C-G-R3S2. Robots move within the network to discover sensing holes and
   redundant sensors by local communication and transfer the discovered
   redundant sensors to the encountered sensing hole positions. In R3S2,
   robots move at random; in G-R3S2, robots random movement is restricted
   on a virtual grid and biased toward least recently visited grid points.
   C-R3S2 and C-G-R3S2 are respectively the variants of R3S2 and G-R3S2
   where clustering and virtual force techniques are adopted to merge local
   sensing holes. Through extensive simulation we show the effectiveness
   and practicality of these algorithms and evaluate their performance. The
   simulation results indicate that grid-based variants outperforms
   non-grid counterparts across all measured metrics and cluster-based
   variants offer noticeable improvement to those that use no clusters. (C)

Abstract = {{A study of changes in hydro-climatology of the Great Lakes was performed
   incorporating the nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend detection test and a
   recently developed Bayesian multiple change point detection model. The
   Component Net Basin Supply (C-NBS) and its components (runoff,
   precipitation, evaporation) as well as water levels of Great Lakes were
   analyzed for gradual (i.e. trend type) and abrupt (i.e. shift type)
   nonstationary behaviors at seasonal and annual scales. It was found that
   the C-NBS experienced significant upward trends only in the lower Great
   Lakes (Erie, Ontario) during the summer portion of the year. At an
   annual scale upward trends were observed only in Lake Ontario. Change
   point analysis suggested an upward shift in Great Lakes C-NBS in the
   late 1960s and early 1970s. A combination of gradual and abrupt change
   analysis of Great Lakes water levels indicated a common upward shift
   along with a change in trend direction around the early 1970s. It was
   also found that precipitation and runoff are on a plateau and in some
   cases on a decreasing course following an increasing trend in the early
   twentieth century. Results obtained from this study show that the
   hydro-climatology of Great Lakes is characterized by nonstationaiy
   behavior. Changes in this behavior have caused the Great Lakes water
   levels to decrease during the last few decades. This study provides
   valuable insights into the nature of the nonstationary behavior of
   hydro-climatic variables of Great Lakes and contributes useful
   information to the future water management planning. (C) 2013

Title = {{Pelletized CaO-based sorbents treated with organic acids for enhanced
   CO2 capture in Ca-looping cycles}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{357-365}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Many potential treatments for improving CO2 capture produce mechanically
   fragile sorbents therefore pelletization is often a solution to improve
   the performance of a sorbent for a practical Ca-looping system when a
   sorbent is first enhanced by some treatment step. However, as
   pelletization is inherently expensive, the final sorbent should be as
   reactive as possible and so it may make sense to use a pre-treated
   sorbent. Here we explore the possible use of acetification, combined
   with pelletization using a calcium aluminate cement binder to produce
   pellets. Acetic acid solution (10 vol.\%) and commercial vinegar were
   used for limestone treatment both in the form of aqueous solution and
   vapor and this is as far as we know the first time such vapor phase
   treatments have been explored. The binder content was 10-1 4 wt\%, and
   both acetified and untreated limestones were used to prepare pellets.
   This work demonstrated that pellets prepared from acetified limestone
   with binder are superior to natural limestones. For instance acetified
   pellets captured 41\% more CO2 than un-acetified pellets after 20 cycles
   under severe calcination condition at 920 degrees C in CO2. An important
   caveat is that the acetification treatment widened pores, resulting in
   enhanced pellet reactivity with SO2; therefore, SO2 must be removed from
   the flue gas if the aim is to capture CO2. There are however a number of
   additional important caveats, first given that acetic acid costs about
   \$900/ton, it is likely that the gains seen here cannot justify such
   treatments, and second, because Ca acetate is very soluble, it is
   probably more practical to start with industrial grade Ca acetate
   (costing about \$500/ton) than treating limestone with any grade of
   acetic acid and then drying and precipitating the resulting product. (C)

Title = {{Privacy preserving broadcast message authentication protocol for VANETs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1352-1364}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) will start becoming deployed within
   the next decade. Among other benefits, it is expected that VANETs will
   support applications and services targeting the increase of safety on
   the road, and assist in improving the efficiency of the road
   transportation network. However, several serious challenges remain to be
   solved before efficient and secure VANET technology becomes available,
   one of them been efficient authentication of messages in a VANET. There
   is a significant body of research work addressing this issue, however,
   while progress has been made, the challenge is still far from having
   been resolved and reliable and secure systems ready for deployment
   becoming available. In this paper, we propose the Privacy Preserving
   Broadcast Message Authentication (PPBMA) scheme, which, instead of
   performing asymmetric verification, uses Message Authentication Code
   (MAC) functionality and HASH operations to authenticate messages.
   Moreover, we use two-level key hash chain, which assists avoiding
   message losses. Simulation results demonstrate that PPBMA has superior
   performances in terms of packet loss rate and message delivery latency
   when compared to existing solutions. Due to this advantage, it can
   support emergency and routine messages alike, while existing solutions
   can only support routine messages. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wordnets are built of synsets, not of words. A synset consists of words.
   Synonymy is a relation between words. Words go into a synset because
   they are synonyms. Later, a wordnet treats words as synonymous because
   they belong in the same synset Such circularity, a well-known problem,
   poses a practical difficulty in wordnet construction, notably when it
   comes to maintaining consistency. We propose to make a wordnet a net of
   words or, to be more precise, lexical units. We discuss our assumptions
   and present their implementation in a steadily growing Polish wordnet. A
   small set of constitutive relations allows us to construct synsets
   automatically out of groups of lexical units with the same connectivity.
   Our analysis includes a thorough comparative overview of systems of
   relations in several influential wordnets. The additional synset-forming
   mechanisms include stylistic registers and verb aspect.}},

   using a polarization modulator (PolM) and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) in
   an ultra-wideband (UWB) over fiber (UWBoF) system is proposed and

   in the central station (CS) are used to generate intensity-modulated
   impulse UWB signal based on PM-IM conversion. The downstream UWB signal
   is sent to a base station (BS) over an optical fiber. At the BS, when
   the principle axis of the polarizer is aligned with one of the two
   orthogonal states of polarization (SOPs), the downstream UWB signal is
   received and detected. When the principle axis of the polarizer is
   oriented at a special angle to one of the two orthogonal SOPs, a clear
   optical carrier without intensity modulation is generated, which is then
   reused for upstream UWB data transmission. A theoretical analysis is
   performed which is verified by an experiment. A bidirectional
   point-to-point transmission of 1.25 Gb/s UWB signal over 25-km
   single-mode fiber (SMF) using a single light source from the CS is
   demonstrated. The receiver sensitivity and the BER performance for both
   downstream and upstream transmissions are measured.}},

   binary cellular automata, with periodic boundary conditions: if the
   initial configuration contains an odd number of 1s, the lattice should
   converge to all 1s; otherwise, it should converge to all 0s. Since the
   problem is ill-defined for even-sized lattices (which, by definition,
   would never be able to converge to 1), it suffices to account for
   odd-sized lattices only. We are interested in determining the minimal
   neighbourhood size that allows the problem to be solvable for any
   arbitrary initial configuration. On the one hand, we show that radius 2
   is not sufficient, proving that there exists no radius 2 rule that can
   solve the parity problem, even in the simpler case of prime-sized
   lattices. On the other hand, we design a radius 4 rule that converges
   correctly for any initial configuration and formally prove its
   correctness. Whether or not there exists a radius 3 rule that solves the
   parity problem remains an open problem; however, we review recent data
   against a solution in radius 3, thus providing strong empirical evidence
   that there may not exist a radius 3 solution even for prime-sized
   lattices only, contrary to a recent conjecture in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{To make good policy decisions, knowledge of the trends and patterns in
   regional and local fluctuations in water resources and the influence of
   regional meteorological conditions are required. This study quantified
   the spatial-temporal variability of annual streamflow variations and
   meteorological changes in parts of eastern Canada. Time series and
   Geographic Information System (GIS) methods were used to evaluate the
   potential influence of low frequency climate change on annual spring
   flood onset and streamflow amplitude over a 24 year period. Continuous
   wavelet (CWT) and cross-wavelet transforms (XWT) were used to detect and
   extract temporal changes in the annual streamflow cycle amplitude, and
   to determine its relative phase shift to a standing 1-year sine wave
   through time. This was done to determine spatial-temporal differences
   and trends in the annual flood onset, and to determine the differences
   in the range between flood and background levels in 23 hydrological
   stations in eastern Canada. The study was carried out in the eastern
   Ontario/southwestern Quebec region of Canada because of the relatively
   high spatial density of hydrological stations from generally pristine
   waterways, as well as the high density of meteorological stations with
   uninterrupted recordings for a 24 year period from 1/1969 to 12/1992.
   This research indicates that over this 24 year period, the southwestern
   part of the region, along the US border, experienced an increase in
   temperature of up to 0.05 degrees C/year, and a decrease in
   precipitation of similar to 0.5 mm/month; the predominantly rural
   northwest region warmed only <0.02 degrees C/year and became <0.2
   mm/year wetter. During the same time interval, the annual streamflow
   shifted on average to a similar to 20 days earlier flood onset,
   following the similar northwest-southeast trend of the meteorological
   records. In the northwest, along the Ottawa River, flooding occurred
   approximately 50 days earlier in the early 1990s than in the late 1960s,
   while it was less than 10 days earlier in the southeastern streams. The
   streamflows of the Ottawa and Rideau River, the main waterways that were
   studied, have generally lower annual streamflow amplitudes than the
   smaller and more pristine waterways that experience more seasonality,
   while the annual streamflow amplitude does not show any significant
   trend in time and space. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, synthesized (raw) multi-walled carbon nanotubes (rMWCNTs)
   were functionalized with beta-cyclodextrin (bC) using Chen's soft
   cutting technique. Raw multi-walled carbon nanotubes (rMWCNTs) and
   beta-cyclodextrin functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes
   (bCfMWCNTs) were characterized by transmission electron microscope
   (TEM). Neat polyimide (PI) and polyimide/bCfMWCNTs mixed matrix
   membranes were fabricated by immersion precipitation method. Pure
   methane and carbon dioxide were used as test gases to measure the
   permeances of membrane samples. Thermal properties of membranes and
   MWCNTs were characterized by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC)
   and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The TEM results
   showed that beta-cyclodextrin cannot only attach to the inner and outer
   surface of the MWCNT walls but also fill the open-ended tips of the
   MWCNTs. TGA thermograms showed that bCfMWCNTs are thermally less stable
   than rMWCNTs due to the decomposition of beta-cyclodextrin layer, which
   occurred before the decomposition of rMWCNTs. According to the DSC
   experiment, the glass transition temperature (T-g) increased as
   bCfMWCNTs increases in the polymer matrix. The increase in glass
   transition was attributed to good dispersion of the bCfMWCNTs in the
   polymer matrix as a result of improved attachment of bCfMWCNTs to the
   polymer segments. Separation properties and morphology (and distribution
   of bCfMWCNTs within the polymer matrix) of the fabricated membranes were
   analyzed by using permeation test and cross sectional FESEM micrographs
   respectively. Permeation test results revealed that the ideal CO2/CH4
   selectivity increased considerably from neat polyimide membrane to
   polyimide/bCfMWCNTs mixed matrix membranes. Cross sectional FESEM
   results showed that well dispersed bCfMWCNTs within the polymer matrix
   are observable especially in case of PI/6 wt.\% BFBM MMM. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Effect of Pt particle size on the catalytic activity of complete

   fuel-lean conditions is investigated. Carbon black is used as a support
   for platinum nanoparticles of well-defined average sizes between 1.5 and

   toward ethylene oxidation reaching 50\% conversion at 88 degrees C

   nanocatalysts. XPS shows that particle size decrease results in
   noticeable binding energy increase and Pt4f peak broadenings. This
   indicates that the electronic effect induced by small Pt nanoparticles

   in conjunction with a polarization controller (PC) and a polarization
   beam splitter (PBS) as an equivalent Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM). For
   60-GHz and IR-UWB signal transmission, the equivalent MZM is biased at
   the minimum transmission point to generate two sidebands that are
   separated at a frequency in the 60-GHz band, and the wireless signals
   (60 GHz and IR-UWB) are carried by the two sidebands. For the wireline
   baseband transmission, the equivalent MZM is biased at the maximum
   transmission point to generate only the optical carrier, and the
   wireline signal is carried by the optical carrier. The wireline signal
   and the wireless signals are orthogonally polarized and sent over a
   single-mode fiber (SMF) to a base station (BS). For each WDM channel in
   the central station (CS) and the BS, since no optical filters are
   employed, colorless operation is supported. Point-to-point error-free
   transmission of a 1.25-Gbps mmW signal, a 1.25-Gbps IR-UWB signal and a
   10-Gbps wireline signal over a 25-km SMF is experimentally demonstrated.

Abstract = {{Effects of single and dual stage (acidogenic methanogenic) mesophilic
   anaerobic digestion (AD) of kitchen waste (KW) was evaluated at
   hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 20, 15, 12 and 9 d with and without
   thermal microwave (MW) pretreatment (145 degrees C). Anaerobic
   acidification in terms of acid accumulation was superior compared to
   microaerophilic acidification. Maximum anaerobic acidification of KW was
   determined to occur with an HRT of 2 d which was then selected for the
   acidification stage. The dual stage AD system fed with untreated MW
   produced the maximum biogas and volatile solids (VS) stabilization
   efficiencies at the shortest HRT of 9 d. Conversely, for free liquid
   resulting from MW pretreatment of KW the two stage reactor at 20 d HRT
   produced three fold more methane compared with the untreated free liquid
   control. However, MW pretreatment and AD of the free liquid fraction
   only, was not a sustainable treatment option. For KW, staging of the AD
   process had a greater positive impact on waste stabilization and methane
   yield compared to single stage reactors or MW pretreatment. MW can be
   characterized as being a readily biodegradable solid waste;
   concomitantly it is recommended that digester staging without MW
   pretreatment be employed to maximize methane yield and production. (C)

   one by a factor of 3 pi/16, and (16/3 pi)(2) respectively. In addition,
   depending on which part of the J versus P is selected, different r(p)
   and (epsilon/l(p)) will be resulted in. Finally, at the regions which
   the slope is negative or zero, the conventional GPT method is not
   capable to establish any prediction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: The functionalization of metallic surfaces aims at promoting
   the cellular response at the biomaterial-tissue interface. This study
   investigates the effects of the functionalization of titanium (Ti)
   microtopography with a calcium phosphate (CaP) coating with and without
   peptide 15 (P-15), a synthetic peptide analog of the cell-binding domain
   of collagen I, on the in vitro progression of osteogenic cells.
   Methods: Sandblasting and acid etching (SBAE; control) Ti
   microtopography was coated with CaP, enabling the loading of two
   concentrations of P-15: 20 or 200 mg/mL. A machined Ti was also
   examined. Rat calvarial osteogenic cells were cultured on Ti disks with
   the surfaces mentioned above for periods up to 21 days (n = 180 per
   group).
   Results: CaP coating exhibited a submicron-scale needle-shaped
   structure. Although all surfaces were hydrophobic at time zero,
   functionalization increased hydrophilicity at equilibrium.
   Microtopographies exhibited a lower proportion of well-spread cells at 4
   hours of culture and cells with long cytoplasmic extensions at day 3;
   modified SBAE supported higher cell viability and larger extracellular
   osteopontin (OPN) accumulation. For SBAE and modified SBAE, real-time
   polymerase chain reaction showed the following results: 1) lower levels
   for runt-related transcription factor 2 at 7 days and for bone
   sialoprotein at days 7 and 10 as well as higher OPN levels at days 7 and
   10 compared to machined Ti; and 2) higher alkaline phosphatase levels at
   day 10 compared to day 7. At 14 and 21 days, modified SBAE supported
   higher proportions of red-dye-stained areas (calcium content).
   Conclusion: Addition of a CaP coating to SBAE Ti by itself may affect
   key events of in vitro osteogenesis, ultimately resulting in enhanced
   matrix mineralization; additional P-15 functionalization has only
   limited synergistic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term variations of streamflow in a tidal channel were measured
   using a Fluvial Acoustic Tomography (FAT) system through one
   transmission path. FAT is an innovative acoustic technology that
   utilizes the time-of-travel method to determine velocity between two
   points from multiple ray paths that traverse the entire cross-section of
   stream. Due to high spatial variability of flow distribution stationary
   ADCP measurements were not likely to yield true section-averaged flow
   velocity and moving-boat ADCP method was therefore used to provide
   reference data. As such, two short-term moving boat ADCP campaigns were
   carried out by the authors. In the first campaign, a couple of acoustic
   stations were added to the FAT system in order to resolve flow
   angularity in addition to the mean velocity. Comparing the FAT results
   with corresponding ADCP section-averaged flow direction and velocity
   indicated remarkable consistency. Second campaign was designed to
   capture the influence of salt wedge intrusion on the sound propagation
   pattern. It was found that FAT velocity measurements bias high if
   acoustic stations lay inside the cooler freshwater layer. Ray-tracing
   hindcasts suggest that installing acoustic stations inside the salt
   wedge may significantly improve function of output of the system.
   Comparing salinities evaluated from long-term FAT travel time records
   with nodal salinity measurements provided by conductivity-temperature
   sensors reveals the potential ability of FAT in measuring salt flux.

Abstract = {{Long-reach passive optical networks (LR-PONs), as a part of the next
   generation PON technologies, aim at combining the capacity of metro and
   access networks so that the telecommunication network topology is
   simplified and the operational cost is reduced. However, in order to
   eliminate the delay performance degradation introduced by long
   propagation distance, LR-PONs call for bandwidth distribution schemes
   that are different than the existing schemes for conventional PONs. In
   this paper, we propose a new bandwidth distribution approach which
   employs a two-stage buffering mechanism at the ONUs and adopts the
   reduced delay advantage of multi-thread polling. REPORT generator at an
   ONU generates the requests by using an adaptive burst assembly process.
   According to the proposed scheme, ONUs maintain time threshold and size
   threshold values for the upstream input queues. Upon receipt of a GATE
   message, each ONU runs an adaptive burst assembly procedure to set the
   appropriate time and size thresholds and determines the bandwidth
   request of the REPORT message. We evaluate our proposed bandwidth
   distribution scheme by simulations for the ONU-OLT distances of 20 km
   and 100 km. The simulation results confirm that consolidation of
   multi-thread polling and two-stage buffering enhances the delay
   performance of long-reach EPON (LR-EPON). Furthermore, under heavy
   loads, the proposed scheme leads to high utilization of the upstream
   channel. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Location privacy is an important issue in vehicular networks since
   knowledge of a vehicle's location can result in leakage of sensitive

   dynamically formed at the time the vehicle requests it. The size of the
   mix-zone is determined by the vehicle's predicted location, the traffic
   statistics and the level of vehicle's privacy requirement. In order to
   provide unlinkability of new and old pseudonyms and locations, DMLP
   encrypts messages when transmitted while the vehicle is within the
   mix-zone. Simulation based analysis shows that DMLP offers a high level
   of location privacy and can be used regardless of the nature of the road
   at the location of the vehicle,e.g. highway, rural road or street in the

   out from the bank (in an upstream direction) to redirect flow and
   prevent erosion of the bank. As well as providing bank protection, barbs
   promote vegetated stream banks, create scour hole resting pools for fish
   habitat and can increase aquatic species diversity. Flow conditions

   bathymetry using a Total Station have been measured over a period of 5
   years, both before (2 years) and after (2 years) the construction of the
   barbs, providing valuable data for understanding stream barb performance
   in a semi-alluvial channel. Pre-barb velocity measurements indicate that
   the flow field in the first bend is dominated by strong secondary
   circulation and high cross-stream bed stresses that comprise a
   substantial proportion of the total near-bed Reynolds stress. Post-barb
   results indicate that velocity magnitude along the outer bank was
   reduced. Scour occurred in the channel centre near barb tips, but in
   general, little to no bathymetry changes were measured between seasonal
   surveys, suggesting that the barbs had limited impact on bed topography
   and/or that semi-alluvial channel bends are resistant to change.
   Recommendations for future design and implementation of stream barbs are
   also included. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   and embankment failures are highlighted. Aspects such as shear failure
   of steel piles, shear failure of concrete substructure elements,
   failures and severe buckling of steel braces, failures of shear keys and
   restrainers at supports, and damage to girders due to lack of diaphragms
   are described. Many examples of loss of superstructure support are
   presented. Skew supports and multi-span simply supported bridges were
   particularly susceptible to loss of support. Several aspects of the
   Chilean bridge design code are discussed and compared with North

   Structural steel buildings are not common in Chile, due to the

   structures was observed in industrial facilities. In general, the
   structural steel buildings performed well. Limited damage was observed
   in some of the older buildings. Extensive damage was sustained by
   nonstructural elements, including masonry infill walls, suspended
   ceilings, partition walls, and architectural features. Brick masonry
   partition walls, commonly used in Chilean buildings, suffered damage

   cladding or roofing. The hydrodynamic (drag) forces, impulsive loading,
   hydrostatic forces, buoyant forces, and debris impact loading were
   probable sources during the tsunami causing the observed damage.
   Failures included punching of brick masonry infill walls, partial and

Abstract = {{The characterisation of dual-output Mach-Zehnder interferometers
   operating with long-range surface plasmon-polaritons at a free-space
   wavelength of similar to 1370 nm is reported. The devices were
   constructed by embedding Au stripes in Cytop claddings, and consist of a
   symmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer in cascade with a 50:50 coupler.
   By injecting electric current via probes to generate heat in the active
   region in one arm of the interferometer, a phase difference between the
   arms was thermo-optically induced, modulating the optical power of the
   two outputs. The outputs were complementary as expected theoretically,
   thus demonstrating the switching abilities of the structure. The
   advantages for sensing applications of a dual-output interferometer over
   a single-output one are a 2X larger dynamic range and the ability to
   cancel common noise and source fluctuations. The larger dynamic range
   and noise cancellation produced a minimum detectable phase shift 4X
   lower than obtained by monitoring a single output. The smallest value of
   Delta phi(min) obtained was similar to 3 mrad. The structure is
   especially promising for (bio)chemical sensing applications.}},

Title = {{Bioleaching of six nickel sulphide ores with differing mineralogies in

Abstract = {{A bioleaching study was conducted with six nickel sulphide ores from
   different geographical locations across Canada. Mineralogical and
   chemical examination revealed considerable variability between the
   samples, particularly in the silicate phases. The ores contain 0.3-1\%
   nickel, primarily in pentlandite and secondarily in pyrrhotite. Copper
   is present primarily in chalcopyrite, and cobalt in pentlandite. The
   ores were subjected to the same crushing and grinding procedure, and
   bioleached under the same conditions for 3 weeks with a mixed culture of
   iron- and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria. Stirred-tank experiments with
   finely ground ore (-147 mu m) at 30 degrees C were conducted to assess
   the effect of pH (2-5) and the impact of the bacteria. Nickel extraction
   from pentlandite and pyrrhotite during bioleaching at pH 2 and 3 was
   generally good (49-86\% after 3 weeks), and cobalt extraction tracked
   nickel extraction over most conditions. All six ores showed a similar
   response to a change in pH; an increase in pH from 2 to 3 resulted in
   approximately the same nickel and cobalt extraction (within statistical
   error), and a statistically significant reduction in sulphuric acid
   consumption, dissolved iron, and magnesium extraction. Crown Copyright

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Leader election problem has been studied in the past to improve the
   efficiency of both distributed systems and wireless ad hoc and sensor
   networks. Yet, few research has been done on the leader election process
   for wireless mesh networks. Most of the existing leader election
   protocols consider wireless networks in general, without focusing on the
   particularities of mesh networks. Thus, these protocols are not suitable
   for wireless mesh networks. The lack of research on this issue has
   motivated us to design a leader election protocol dedicated to wireless
   mesh networks. In this work, we propose an efficient leader election
   protocol for wireless mesh network, which is based on the construction
   of a spanning tree that includes all wireless mesh routers. The protocol
   elects the node with the longest remaining battery life. In this paper,
   we give a detailed description of the proposed protocol, prove its
   correctness, discuss its message and time complexities and then evaluate
   its performance through simulation using ns-2. We show that our protocol
   is efficient and scales well with the increase in number of mesh routers
   and mesh clients. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{A continuously tunable photonic radio-frequency (RF) phase shifter based
   on polarization modulation and all-optical differentiation using a
   polarization modulator (PolM) and an optical frequency discriminator is
   proposed, theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated. In the
   proposed phase shifter, two light waves at different wavelengths are
   injected into a PolM which is driven by an RF signal to be phase
   shifted. For one wavelength, the state of polarization (SOP) of the
   light wave is aligned with one principal axis of the PolM, thus the PolM
   operates jointly with an optical frequency discriminator as an optical
   differentiator to produce a quadrature (Q) signal. For the other
   wavelength, the SOP of the light wave is oriented with 45 degrees or 135
   degrees with the principal axis of the PolM, thus the PolM operates
   jointly with a polarizer as an intensity modulator to produce an
   in-phase (I) signal. By detecting the I-Q optical signals at a
   photodetector (PD), a phase-shifted RF signal is generated. The value of
   the phase shift is determined by the amplitudes of the I-Q signals,
   which can be continuously tuned by controlling the powers of the light
   waves. An experiment is performed. A phase shifter with a full tunable
   range of 360 degrees at an RF frequency tunable from 3 to 10 GHz is
   demonstrated.}},

Pages = {{21-28}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The performance of CaO-based sorbents modified with formic acid in both
   its liquid and vapor phase has been investigated for high-temperature
   post-combustion CO2 capture in calcium-looping cycles. The treatment of
   limestone with aqueous solutions containing 10 or 30 vol\% formic acid
   was found to promote crystal growth. By contrast, higher acid
   concentrations produced smaller crystals. However, all sorbents modified
   by acid solutions had almost identical reductions of 44\% and 46\% in
   surface area and pore volume (determined by N-2 adsorption),
   respectively, relative to the parent material. Despite the low porosity,
   limestone (fine powder) treated with 10\% acid solution displayed the
   highest CO2 capture capacity in the first cycle with a capture of 0.6 g
   CO2/g sorbent compared to 0.49 g/g for untreated powder material. By 20
   cycles, the modified sorbent still captured 67.4\% more CO2 than the
   natural sorbent captured under similar conditions. Relatively low
   concentration formic acid solution improved the CO2 capture capacity of
   CaO-based sorbents better than treatment with acid vapor due to the
   limited acidification achieved by vapor phase treatment. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this work, a dual-rail EO modulator structure is presented with the
   advantages of extremely high electro-optic (EO) coefficient r(51) of
   BaTiO3 crystal, the quadratic modulation effect and the thin-film
   waveguide structure where electric fields are applied at both transverse
   and horizontal directions of optical beam propagation to create a
   dual-rail driven modulation effect to the refractive index of optical
   channel. A new theoretical model of the quadratic modulation effect to
   the dual-rail driven regime is proposed. The dependences of (V pi L)-L-2
   on the physical parameters of devices such as the two electrode gaps,
   the r(51) value and the birefringence of BaTiO3 crystal thin-film are
   simulated, then the intrinsic relationships among the half-wave voltage
   V-pi, interaction length L, EO coefficient r(51), birefringence B-eo and
   electrode gap G are investigated. As an illustration, for an extremely
   small L value of 1 mm, <6.0 V V-pi values correspond to 600 pm/V r(51),
   -0.007 B-eo and 7.5 mu m G. Finally, the challenges and possibilities to
   the new regime of dual-rail driven EO modulators are discussed. Crown

Title = {{FiloDetect: automatic detection of filopodia from fluorescence
   microscopy images}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Filopodia are small cellular projections that help cells to
   move through and sense their environment. Filopodia play crucial roles
   in processes such as development and wound-healing. Also, increases in
   filopodia number or size are characteristic of many invasive cancers and
   are correlated with increased rates of metastasis in mouse experiments.
   Thus, one possible route to developing anti-metastatic therapies is to
   target factors that influence the filopodia system. Filopodia can be
   detected by eye using confocal fluorescence microscopy, and they can be
   manually annotated in images to quantify filopodia parameters. Although
   this approach is accurate, it is slow, tedious and not entirely
   objective. Manual detection is a significant barrier to the discovery
   and quantification of new factors that influence the filopodia system.
   Results: Here, we present FiloDetect, an automated tool for detecting,
   counting and measuring the length of filopodia in fluorescence
   microscopy images. The method first segments the cell from the
   background, using a modified triangle threshold method, and then
   extracts the filopodia using a series of morphological operations. We
   verified the accuracy of FiloDetect on Rat2 and B16F1 cell images from
   three different labs, showing that per-cell filopodia counts and length
   estimates are highly correlated with the manual annotations. We then
   used FiloDetect to assess the role of a lipid kinase on filopodia
   production in breast cancer cells. Experimental results show that
   PI4KIII beta expression leads to an increase in filopodia number and
   length, suggesting that PI4KIII beta is involved in driving filopodia
   production.
   Conclusion: FiloDetect provides accurate and objective quantification of
   filopodia in microscopy images, and will enable large scale comparative
   studies to assess the effects of different genetic and chemical
   perturbations on filopodia production in different cell types, including
   cancer cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{A microwave photonic link (MPL) using a single polarization modulator
   (PolM) with an improved spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) is proposed
   and experimentally demonstrated. The proposed MPL is designed based on
   the destructive combination of the distortion signals in the electrical
   domain, which is realized using a PolM with its output split into two
   channels. In the upper channel, the PolM, a polarization controller
   (PC), and a polarization beam splitter (PBS) form an equivalent
   Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) that is biased at the quadrature point. The
   optical carrier is suppressed using a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating
   (PS-FBG). In the lower channel, the PolM, another PC, and the PBS form a
   second equivalent MZM that is also biased at the quadrature point but at
   the opposite slope of the transfer function. The signals from the two
   channels are sent to a photodetector (PD). If the optical powers into
   the two channels are identical, the third-order intermodulation terms
   are completely suppressed. An experiment is performed. An enhancement in
   SFDR of 10 dB is achieved. The insertion loss of the proposed MPL is
   also estimated, which is 9.5 dB smaller than a phase modulator based
   MPL.}},

Journal = {{OPTICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{2611-2613}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a fiber-optic sensor
   implemented based on a dual-frequency optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)
   for transverse load sensing. In the OEO loop, a phase-shifted fiber
   Bragg grating (PS-FBG) is employed to which a transverse load is applied
   to introduce a birefringence to create two orthogonally polarized
   notches, which leads to the generation of two oscillating frequencies.
   The beat frequency between the two oscillating frequencies is a function
   of the load force applied to the PS-FBG. The proposed sensor is
   experimentally demonstrated. The sensitivity and the minimal detectable
   load are measured to be as high as similar to 9.73 GHz/(N/mm) and 2.06 x
   10(-4) N/mm, respectively. The high-frequency purity and stability of
   the generated microwave signal by the OEO permit extremely reliable and
   high-accuracy measurement. The frequency interrogation allows the system
   to operate at an ultra-high speed. In addition, the sensing signal is
   insensitive to the variations of both the environmental temperature and
   the optical carrier wavelength. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The recent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant caused
   by the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2012 reminded us vividly
   of the serious hazards of radioactive substances spread over a wide
   range of the affected region. Currently, there is a great concern over
   the effect of contaminated soil and water on the health and safety of
   the inhabitants of the region. Hence, the advancement in the
   technologies of nuclear waste treatment is of vital importance if we
   decide to live with nuclear power to maintain our modern civilization.
   Among various separation technologies used, membrane technologies have
   been chosen in this article since they are considered as one of the
   emerging technologies with many advantages over the conventional
   processes. In this review the membrane technology is classified into
   different processes and, for each process, progress made since the onset
   of this millennium in the radioactive decontamination of water is shown.
   The new directions are shown by considering the progress made in
   membrane manufacturing and membrane processes. Thus, the combined
   efforts of the researchers who are engaged in membrane and membrane
   process design with those who are engaged in nuclear waste treatment
   near the plant sites were highlighted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the use of the Cold Gas Dynamic Spray (Cold
   Spray) process to consolidate reactive materials with low porosity (up
   to 99.8\% of the theoretical maximum density) and controllable shapes
   for potential near-net shape applications. The study focuses on the
   Al/CuO thermite mixture. The microstructure and mechanical properties
   (four-point bending and microhardness) of the consolidated samples were
   investigated while varying the spray process parameters, such as
   stand-off distance, propellant gas pressure and feedstock powder (fuel)
   particle size. The reactive mixture was successfully consolidated
   without the onset of the thermite reaction. The consolidated sample
   reactivity was addressed through flame propagation velocity measurements
   as a function of sample density. Results show a relation between the
   sample's porosity level and the flame propagation velocity. The
   reduction of porosity tends to decrease the flame speed from
   approximately 1400 mm/s at 20\% density down to 150 mm/s at 100\%. This
   indicates a transition from convection dominated energy transfer at low
   porosities to heat conduction dominated mechanism at vanishing
   porosities when gas percolation is not possible. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Nonstationary signal analysis is one of the main topics in the field of
   machinery fault diagnosis. Time-frequency analysis can identify the
   signal frequency components, reveals their time variant features, and is
   an effective tool to extract machinery health information contained in
   nonstationary signals. Various time-frequency analysis methods have been
   proposed and applied to machinery fault diagnosis. These include linear
   and bilinear time-frequency representations (e.g., wavelet transform,
   Cohen and affine class distributions), adaptive parametric
   time-frequency analysis (based on atomic decomposition and
   time-frequency auto-regressive moving average models), adaptive
   non-parametric time-frequency analysis (e.g., Hilbert-Huang transform,
   local mean decomposition, and energy separation), and time varying
   higher order spectra. This paper presents a systematic review of over 20
   major such methods reported in more than 100 representative articles
   published since 1990. Their fundamental principles, advantages and
   disadvantages, and applications to fault diagnosis of machinery have
   been examined. Some examples have also been provided to illustrate their
   performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of eccentricity on heat transfer in upward flow in a
   vertical, open-ended, annular channel with a diameter ratio of 0.61, an
   aspect ratio of 18: 1, and both internal surfaces heated uniformly has
   been investigated experimentally. Results have been reported for
   eccentricities ranging from the concentric case to the near-contact case
   and three inlet bulk Reynolds numbers, equal approximately to 1500,
   2800, and 5700. This work complements our recently reported experimental
   results on natural convection in the same facility. The present results
   are deemed to be largely in the mixed convection regime with some
   overlap with the forced convection regime and likely to include cases
   with laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows in at least a part of
   the test section. Small eccentricity had an essentially negligible
   effect on the overall heat transfer rate, but high eccentricity reduced
   the average heat transfer rate by up to 60\%. High eccentricity also
   resulted in wall temperatures in the narrow gap region that were much
   higher than those in the open channel. The concentric-case Nusselt
   number was higher than the Dittus-Boelter prediction, whereas the highly
   eccentric-case Nusselt number was significantly lower than that.}},

Abstract = {{Dependence analysis on an Extended Finite State Machine representation
   of the requirements of a system under test identifies various types of
   control and data dependencies between transitions caused by a set of
   modifications on the requirements. These particular types of
   dependencies capture the effects of the modifications, that is, their
   direct effects on the changed parts of the system and their side effects
   on the unchanged parts of the system. Recent work on model-based
   regression testing shows that dependencies capturing direct effects and
   side effects of the changes made on the requirements can be used for
   regression test suite (RTS) reduction (reducing the size of a given test
   suite by eliminating redundancies), for RTS prioritization (ordering
   test cases in a given test suite for early fault detection), or for RTS
   generation (designing a test suite covering the identified
   dependencies). This paper proposes an additional use of such
   dependencies, namely, RTS selection, which is the process of selecting a
   subset of a given test suite to form an RTS by considering the coverage
   of dependencies related to the effects of the modifications. The
   dependencies marked during this process as uncovered provide a basis for
   augmenting an (incomplete) RTS with test cases covering uncovered
   dependencies. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Different camera configurations to capture panoramic images and videos
   are commercially available today. However, capturing omnistereoscopic
   snapshots and videos of dynamic scenes is still an open problem. Several
   methods to produce stereoscopic panoramas have been proposed in the last
   decade, some of which were conceived in the realm of robot navigation
   and three-dimensional (3-D) structure acquisition. Even though some of
   these methods can estimate omnidirectional depth in real time, they were
   not conceived to render panoramic images for binocular human viewing.
   Alternatively, sequential acquisition methods, such as rotating image
   sensors, can produce remarkable stereoscopic panoramas, but they are
   unable to capture real-time events. Hence, there is a need for a
   panoramic camera to enable the consistent and correct stereoscopic
   rendering of the scene in every direction. Potential uses for a stereo
   panoramic camera with such characteristics are free-viewpoint 3-D TV and
   image-based stereoscopic telepresence, among others. A comparative study
   of the different cameras and methods to create stereoscopic panoramas of
   a scene, highlighting those that can be used for the real-time
   acquisition of imagery and video, is presented. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {{Hemp fiber provides industries with numerous possibilities for
   bio-product market development. An experiment was conducted to
   decorticate green and retted hemps using a hammermill. Treatments
   included three screening scenarios (19.3 and 25.7 mm round-holed screens
   and no screen), three feeding masses (75, 125, and 200 g), and two
   precutting scenarios (hemp cut into 40 mm segments and non-cut hemp).
   Fiber yield, core (or hurd) yield, effectiveness of decortication, and
   power and energy requirements were experimentally determined. Results
   showed that effects of precutting and feeding mass significantly
   interacted with screen scenarios. With screens, precutting green hemp
   resulted in reduced energy requirement for decortication, while without
   screens, non-cut and cut green hemp required comparable energy. A higher
   energy requirement was observed only for the 25.7 mm screen for the
   retted hemp. For both the green and retted hemps, mixed results were
   obtained for the effects of feeding mass on the power requirement.
   However, clear trends were observed for the effects of feeding mass on
   the energy with larger feeding mass requiring greater energy. Fiber
   yield varied from 1.0\% to 34.6\%, and core yield varied from 11.8\% to
   73.7\%, depending on the treatments. In most cases, better fiber and
   core yields, and greater decortication effectiveness were observed for
   the cut hemp with smaller feeding mass and the presence of a screen when
   compared to the non-cut hemp with higher feeding mass without screens.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of buoyancy-driven natural convection on the performance of
   ground-coupled heat exchangers of closed loop geothermal systems is
   investigated. The governing equations of continuity, momentum, and
   energy balance are derived, taking into account a porous ground medium
   fully saturated with liquid water. Boussinesq approximation is used to
   model the effect of buoyancy forces in water. A three-dimensional
   finite-volume discretization method over a structured mesh is used to
   solve the governing equations numerically. The performance of the
   ground-coupled heat exchanger system is assessed based on the rate of
   energy extraction and the outlet fluid temperature. The effects of
   hydraulic conductivity of the heat exchange medium and seasonal
   variations of heat load on the heat transfer phenomenon are studied. The
   results are evaluated by comparing them against the results of existing
   conduction-based heat transfer models. The influence of natural
   convection on the sustainable rate of heat extraction from a geothermal
   resource is underlined and interpreted. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   modulator (PolM) in a Sagnac loop is proposed and demonstrated. The PolM
   in the loop functions, in conjunction with a polarization controller and
   a polarization beam combiner, as a Mach Zehnder modulator (MZM), which
   only modulates the incident light wave along the clockwise direction,
   leaving the counter-clockwise light wave unmodulated due to the velocity
   mismatch. Two clockwise intensitymodulated signals along two paths (Path
   1 and Path 2) are generated, with one (Path 2) combined with the
   non-modulated light wave from the counter-clockwise direction to
   suppress part of the optical carrier. By controlling the power
   relationship between the two paths, the third-order intermodulation
   distortion (IMD3) can be fully suppressed, and thus an MPL with improved
   dynamic range is achieved. A theoretical analysis is presented, which is
   validated by an experiment. The IMD3 can be suppressed by 50 dB, giving
   an improvement in SFDR of 16 dB. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A photonic integrated microfluidic device is demonstrated to perform
   optical excitation and forward scatter collection all on-chip in a
   planar format. Integrated on-chip optics formed a tailored beam geometry
   for optimal excitation of particles while a special design modification
   allowed for on-chip forward collection with the beam shaping
   capabilities. A notch was placed in the lens system that caused a dark
   spot on the facet of a collection waveguide while not affecting the beam
   geometry at the point of interrogation. The modified device with the
   ability to form a 10 mu m beam geometry was demonstrated to detect the
   forward scatter from blank 5 mu m diameter polystyrene beads. Free-space
   collection of side scatter signals was performed simultaneously with the
   on-chip collection and the designs demonstrated and enhanced SNR while
   the reliability of detection was determined to be appropriate for many
   applications. Excellent performance was confirmed via a false positive
   rate of 0.4\%, a missed events rate of 6.8\%, and a coincident rate of
   96.3\% as determined between simultaneously performed free-space and

Abstract = {{A frequency-tunable microwave photonic filter (MPF) with a narrow and
   flat-top passband implemented using a phase modulator (PM) and a
   superstructured fiber Bragg grating (SFBG) is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. The key component in the MPF is the SFBG,
   which is designed and fabricated based on the equivalent phase shift
   (EPS) technique. Two phase shifts are introduced, and the combination of
   the two phase shifts would lead to a flat-bottom notch in the reflection
   band. By incorporating the SFBG into the MPF, a frequency response with
   a narrow and flat-top passband is achieved. The reflection bandwidth and
   the notch width of the SFBG, which determine the frequency tunable range
   and passband width, can be controlled by the length and maximum index
   modulation (MIM) of the SFBG. An experiment is performed. An MPF with a
   3 dB bandwidth of 143 MHz, a 20 dB bandwidth of 370 MHz, and a tunable
   range from 0.4 to 6.4 GHz is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Oscillometry is a popular technique for automatic estimation of blood
   pressure (BP). However, most of the oscillometric algorithms rely on
   empirical coefficients for systolic and diastolic pressure evaluation
   that may differ in various patient populations, rendering the technique
   unreliable. A promising complementary technique for automatic estimation
   of BP, based on the dependence of pulse transit time (PTT) on cuff
   pressure (CP) (PTT-CP mapping), has been proposed in the literature.
   However, a theoretical grounding for this technique and a nonparametric
   BP estimation approach are still missing. In this paper, we propose a
   novel coefficient-free BP estimation method based on PTT-CP dependence.
   PTT is mathematically modeled as a function of arterial lumen area under
   the cuff. It is then analytically shown that PTT-CP mappings computed
   from various points on the arterial pulses can be used to directly
   estimate systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure without
   empirical coefficients. Analytical results are cross-validated with a
   pilot investigation on ten healthy subjects where 150 simultaneous
   electrocardiogram and oscillometric BP recordings are analyzed. The
   results are encouraging whereby the mean absolute errors of the proposed
   method in estimating systolic and diastolic pressures are 5.31 and 4.51
   mmHg, respectively, relative to the Food and Drug Administration
   approved Omron monitor. Our work thus shows promise toward providing
   robust and objective BP estimation in a variety of patients and
   monitoring situations.}},

Abstract = {{The current paper describes the design of a prototype system to explore
   the feasibility of the adsorption thermal energy storage. Water was
   chosen as the adsorbate, and three different adsorbents were tested.
   Zeolite 13X, NaLSX zeolite, and an activated alumina (AA)/zeolite 13X
   composite adsorbent were used as adsorbents. Experiments were performed
   at varying flow rates and different relative humidities to determine the
   optimal operating conditions for the system. The regeneration of the
   adsorbents also was explored by performing repeated runs on the same
   adsorbent sample. The results indicate that complete regeneration was
   achieved. A maximum energy density of 160kWh/m3 has been achieved with
   the AA/13X adsorbent, and this adsorbent was chosen for further studies.
   After this adsorbent screening, the system was modified to improve the
   data recording and system performance. Tests were performed on AA/13X,
   and a maximum energy density of 200kWh/m3 was achieved, which was much
   higher than the maximum energy density reported in the literature for
   adsorption thermal energy storage systems (165kWh/m3). Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{As one of the most newly developed liquid-phase membrane separation
   processes, nanofiltration (NF) is used in several industrial and
   environmental applications due to low energy consumption and elevated
   flux rates. In spite of several attempts for modeling NF separation
   ranging from rigorous space-charge approaches to simpler irreversible
   thermodynamics, neither have been totally sufficient either due to
   extensive computational requirements limiting their application in
   multi-component systems or oversimplifying assumptions leading to loss
   of generality. A promising model as a compromise between simplicity and
   accuracy can then be very helpful in this regard.
   This paper is an effort for modeling the nanofiltration separation
   process based on the modified extended Nernst-Planck equation (MENP) for
   solute transport through membrane active layer which is improved for
   concentrated electrolyte solutions. Based on simulation results, the
   effect of high ionic concentrations on the rejection of chloride ion is
   investigated, in case of pure NaCl solutions. The modified version of
   ENP, takes into account the variations of activity coefficient and the
   resulting influence on the retention behavior by increasing the ionic
   strength. The results show significant reduction of the predicted
   rejection by increasing the ionic strength. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{A novel approach to the design of multijunction solar cells on silicon
   substrates for 1-sun applications is described. Models for device
   simulation, including porous silicon layers, are presented. A silicon
   bottom subcell is formed by diffusion of dopants into a silicon wafer.
   The top of the wafer is porosified to create a compliant layer, and a
   III-V buffer layer is then grown epitaxially, followed by middle and top
   subcells. Because of the resistivity of the porous material, these
   designs are best suited to high-efficiency 1-sun applications. Numerical
   simulations of a multijunction solar cell that incorporates a porous
   silicon-compliant membrane indicate an efficiency of 30.7\% under
   AM1.5G, 1-sun for low-threading dislocation density, decreasing to
   23.7\% for a TDD of 10(7) cm(-2).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a spatio-temporal event-based approach to
   video signal analysis and abstraction employing wavelet transform
   features. The video signal is assumed to be a sequence of overlapping
   independent visual components called events, which typically are
   temporally overlapping compact functions that describe temporal
   evolution of a given set of the spatial parameters of the video signal.
   We utilize event-based temporal decomposition technique to resolve the
   overlapping arrangement of the video signal that is known to be one of
   the main concerns in video analysis via conventional frame-based
   schemes. In our method, a set of spatial parameters, extracted from the
   video, is expressed as a linear combination of a set of temporally
   overlapping compact functions, called events, through an optimization
   process. First, to reduce computational complexity, the video sequence
   is divided into overlapped groups. Next, Generalized Gaussian Density
   (GGD) parameters, extracted from 2D wavelet transform subbands, are used
   as the spatial parameters. Temporal decomposition is then applied to the
   GGD parameters, structured as a frame-based matrix of GGD vectors, to
   compute the event functions and associated orthogonal GGD parameters.
   Frames located at event centroids, which are much smaller in number than
   the number of frames in the original video, are taken as candidates for
   the keyframes that are selected based on a distance criterion in the
   feature space. Our contribution is that this still image video
   abstraction scheme does not need shot or cluster boundary detection,
   unlike current methods. Experimental results confirm the efficiency and
   accuracy of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Operational load monitoring and impact damage detection are the two
   critical aspects of aerospace structural health monitoring (SHM). Fiber
   Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have demonstrated great potential in both.
   But the currently available interrogation systems can only handle one of
   the two types of SHM capabilities offered by FBG sensors. In addition,
   the practical implementation of FBG sensor systems in aerospace vehicles
   requires the interrogator to be small size, light weight, and low-power
   consuming. In this paper, we present an Echelle diffractive grating
   (EDG) based interrogation system for FBG sensors, which possesses two
   operation modes, i.e., the sweeping mode for operational load monitoring
   and the parked mode for impact damage detection. Experimental results
   show that this interrogator offers better than 1-pm measurement
   resolution and 10-pm repeatability. In addition, the interrogation
   system is very compact and weighs less than 60 g (excluding the
   electronic controller). It also has the potential to achieve a
   measurement speed of 300 kHz and be powered by a battery.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems (CPSs) can significantly improve the resiliency
   of the smart grid. In CPSs, real time and reliable monitoring require an
   accurate and stable model of the wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
   monitoring system. Furthermore, WSNs require strict quality of service
   (QoS) provisioning as the data generated by the monitored equipment is
   generally delay and reliability -sensitive. QoS provisioning in WSNs has
   been widely studied in the literature where most of the work addresses
   the issue by QoS-aware protocol design. However, analytical models that
   consider delay, throughput, and power consumption have not matured for
   CPSs. In this paper, we propose a Markov-based model for cluster-tree
   WSN topologies that enhances the stability of the WSNs. Cluster-tree
   deployments are particularly of interest to cyber-physical power grid
   monitoring systems since they are suitable for large-scale deployments.
   We perform an exhaustive performance evaluation using different traffic
   and network conditions in star and cluster-tree WSN topologies.
   Furthermore, we test the accuracy of our model by performing simulations
   in environments that are consistent with the analytical model.}},

Abstract = {{The effect and interplay of pathomorphology and joint kinematics is
   increasingly recognized as important in the study of femoroacetabular
   impingement (FAI). Hip joint kinematics consists of motion analysis at
   the macroscopic hip joint level. Although overall joint morphology and
   subject-specific kinematics are important, the cellular mechanobiology
   of cartilage and the biologic response to cartilage injury are poorly
   understood and require further study if surgeons are to understand how
   tissue damage actually occurs. A clearer understanding of these factors
   may provide the foundation for new treatments that could alter the joint
   injury associated with FAI. The purpose of this study group was to
   discuss the current evidence regarding the interaction of hip joint
   motion, cartilage mechanics, and cartilage biology with FAI and
   determine future priorities for research in these areas to expand the
   surgeon's ability to understand and manage this increasingly recognized
   clinical entity. Specific research needs were identified in four areas:
   motion analysis (how do muscle contributions to joint loading influence
   the disease process?), arthrokinematics (what happens at the joint level
   in vivo?), cartilage mechanics (how do cartilage cells respond to
   different mechanical stimuli?), and cartilage biology (need to identify
   biomarkers for cartilage degradation).}},

Abstract = {{PbS-loaded K4Nb6O17 nanocomposite photocatalysts (hereafter designated

   nanocomposite materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction,

   fluorescence spectrometer, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection
   spectra, photoluminescence measurement and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. The nano-semiconductor PbS@K4Nb6O17 composites have the
   layered structure and the band gaps of the two semiconductors couple.
   The nanocomposite PbS@K4Nb6O17 exhibited a strong photocatalytic
   activity for degradation of Rhodamine B (hereafter referred as RhB)
   under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the nanocomposite PbS(25
   wt.\%)@K4Nb6O17 shows the highest photocatalytic activity, the
   decomposition rate of RhB solution is about 71\% after 120 min under
   visible light irradiation, which is over that of the pure K4Nb6O17 and
   pure PbS particles. The nanocomposite photocatalysts proved to be fairly
   photostable through the recyclability experiments. The mechanism of
   separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes at the PbS@K4Nb6O17

Abstract = {{The reclamation of mining operation tailings water is of major concern

   major toxic component in tailings water. The acid-catalyzed

   as a test case for the utilization of these toxic compounds. In a series
   of batch acid-catalyzed esterification reactions, the influence of
   reaction temperature, catalyst type, catalyst concentration, and
   methanol to oil ratio on the esterification was investigated. The NA
   esterification reactions were found to be positively dependent on
   temperature and catalyst concentration while large methanol to oil
   ratios had a negative effect on the esterification. Finally, sulfuric
   acid was identified as a preferred catalyst for the esterification
   compared to p-toluene sulfonic acid. The esterification was completed
   successfully at the relatively mild conditions used in commercial

Abstract = {{A novel photonic approach to the implementation of an ultra-wideband
   microwave phase shifter is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In
   the proposed system, a single-sideband (SSB) signal is sent to a
   polarization-maintaining fiber Bragg grating (PM-FBG), which has two
   spectrally separated transmission notches along the fast and the slow
   axes. By locating the optical carrier along the fast axis at the
   transmission notch, the optical carrier in the SSB signal is removed. At
   the output of the PM-FBG, two orthogonally polarized optical signals,
   one with the optical carrier and the sideband, the other with only the
   sideband, are obtained. The two orthogonal signals are then sent through
   a variable retardation plate (VRP) to a polarizer and then detected by a
   photodetector. By controlling the VRP to introduce a tunable phase
   difference between the two orthogonally polarized SSB signals, a
   microwave signal with a tunable phase shift is generated. A theoretical
   analysis is developed, which is validated by an experiment. A microwave
   phase shifter with a full 360 degrees phase shift over a frequency range
   from 10 to 40 GHz is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effects of using fuel particles of non-uniform
   size in packed bed combustion and gasification. Experiments were
   performed in an overfeed packed bed combustor fed with mixtures of
   different size fractions of charcoal particles. Gas compositions and
   temperatures within the bed as well as particle size analyses of the bed
   contents are presented for a number of different mixtures, covering a
   range of particle sizes from 6-24 mm. The experimental data are compared
   with a numerical model for packed bed combustion, and it is shown that
   the use of the volume-surface mean as an average feed particle size in
   the model gives good agreement with measured profiles of concentration,
   temperature, and average particle size in the bed. Other definitions of
   the mean particle size work nearly as well for gas concentrations and
   temperatures, but not for particle sizes within the bed. Mixtures with
   large differences in particle sizes may show some degree of segregation
   during feeding or sampling of the bed owing to the motion of small
   particles through the interstices between larger ones. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A water soluble chitosan derivative, N-succinyl chitosan (NSCS), was
   blended with polysulfone (PSf) in three different compositions to
   fabricate PSf/NSCS blend membranes. The blending of polymers was
   confirmed by Attenuated Total Reflectance Infra-Red (ATR-IR)
   spectroscopy. The membranes were characterized by Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM) images for their cross-sectional morphology. Pure water
   flux, water uptake and contact angle of the PSf/NSCS blend membranes
   were measured and compared with the pristine polysulfone membrane. The
   PSf/NSCS blend membranes showed enhanced hydrophilicity and permeation
   fluxes compared to the pristine polysulfone membrane. The membrane
   antifouling property was determined by filtering the bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) solution. The maximum flux recovery ratio (FRR) of 70\%
   was observed by the PSf/NSCS blend membrane with 20\% NSCS content. The
   PSf/NSCS membranes with the PSf:NSCS ratios of 80:20 and 90:10 showed
   nearly the same fluxes as those of polysulfone/polyethylene glycol
   (PSf/PEG) blend membranes with the same compositions. The hydrophilic
   derivative of chitosan NSCS acted as an excellent additive in improving
   PSf ultrafiltration properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Phase control is crucial to the operation of coherent beam combining
   systems, whether for laser radar or high-power beam combining. We have
   recently demonstrated a design for a multi-aperture, coherently

   that is capable of scanning in two dimensions with dynamic group delay
   compensation. Here we describe in detail the optical phase locking
   system used in the design. The phase locking system achieves an
   estimated Strehl ratio of 0.8, and signals from multiple emitting
   apertures are phase locked simultaneously to within pi/5 radians (1/10
   wave) after propagation through 2.2 km of single-mode fiber per channel.
   Phase locking performance is maintained even as two independent slow
   light mechanisms are utilized simultaneously. (C) 2013 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Most rivers exhibit regions of strong channel curvature that are
   characterized by more complex and variable flow and erosion patterns,
   compared to regions of lower curvature. Studies investigating
   high-curvature bends using eddy-resolving techniques have been limited,
   and the effect of bend angle on flow and erosion has rarely been
   investigated. This study investigates flow in a 135 degrees nonerodible
   bank open channel bend of high curvature: ratio of radius of curvature,
   R, to channel width, B, is 1.5. The bathymetry is obtained during the
   final stages of a clear water scour experiment. Large Eddy Simulation is
   used to investigate the effect of secondary flow on the redistribution
   of streamwise momentum, the details of coherent structures, and
   mechanisms leading to erosion within the bend. Results are compared with
   those from a similar numerical study of a 193 degrees sharply curved
   open channel bend with R/B=1.35. The angle of the 135 degrees bend is
   representative of typical regular meander geometry, while the larger
   angle of the 193 degrees bend is representative of a tortuous meander
   geometry. The different bathymetries induced important quantitative and
   qualitative differences in the vortical and turbulence structure within
   the open channel for the two cases. Inner bank streamwise-oriented
   vortical (SOV) cells formed in both cases, but the position and extent
   of shear layers forming between regions of fast and slow moving fluid
   differed, and flow did not separate at the inner bank in the 135 degrees
   bend. An outer-bank cell was observed in the 135 degrees bend, but not
   in the 193 degrees bend. Distributions of predicted boundary shear
   stresses indicated the capacity of the flow to erode the outer bank of a
   sharply curved bend under two representative regimes found in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity has become an outstanding public health issue in most countries
   around the world. Many attempts have been made to address this issue
   that ranges from taking medication to doing exercise to following a diet
   plan to playing games. Few approaches combine exercise and game to
   engage the obese people in playing fun-based games or purposeful games,
   also known as serious games, while monitoring their bio-signals.
   However, existing work hardly provides a configurable, scalable and
   context-aware serious game framework that can be used as a support for
   obesity treatment. In this paper, we take an attempt to propose such a
   framework. The proposed framework facilitates bio-signal monitoring
   based on body sensor network, context-awareness based on pervasive
   sensors, and on-the-spot activity recommendation based on current
   game-playing context. It uses the cloud computing platform as
   infrastructural support that ensures the scalability of the framework.
   In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed framework, we
   developed a sample serious game; deploy it over a cloud platform; and
   experiment with it by capturing some psycho-physical data while the
   obese are engaged in game-play. We observed that the obese people were
   very much engaged in game-play and they had positive experience using
   the system.}},

Title = {{Gender, Vertical Height and Horizontal Distance Effects on Single-Leg
   Landing Kinematics: Implications for Risk of non-contact ACL Injury}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HUMAN KINETICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{27-38}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is a lack of studies investigating gender differences in
   whole-body kinematics during single-leg landings from increasing
   vertical heights and horizontal distances. This study determined the
   main effects and interactions of gender, vertical height, and horizontal
   distance on whole-body joint kinematics during single-leg landings, and
   established whether these findings could explain the gender disparity in
   non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury rate. Recreationally
   active males (n=6) and females (n=6) performed single-leg landings from
   a takeoff deck of vertical height of 20, 40, and 60 cm placed at a
   horizontal distance of 30, 50 and 70 cm from the edge of a force
   platform, while 3D kinematics and kinetics were simultaneously measured.
   It was determined that peak vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) and
   the ankle flexion angle exhibited significant gender differences
   (p=0.028, partial eta(2)=0.40 and p=0.035, partial eta(2)=0.37,
   respectively). Peak VGRF was significantly correlated to the ankle
   flexion angle (r= -0.59, p=0.04), hip flexion angle (r= -0.74, p=0.006),
   and trunk flexion angle (r= -0.59, p=0.045). Peak posterior ground
   reaction force (PGRF) was significantly correlated to the ankle flexion
   angle (r= -0.56, p=0.035), while peak knee abduction moment was
   significantly correlated to the knee flexion angle (r= -0.64, p=0.03).
   Rearfoot landings may explain the higher ACL injury rate among females.
   Higher plantar-flexed ankle, hip, and trunk flexion angles were
   associated with lower peak ground reaction forces, while higher knee
   flexion angle was associated with lower peak knee abduction moment, and
   these kinematics implicate reduced risk of non-contact ACL injury.}},

Journal = {{CHAOS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The accuracy of genetic network inference is limited by the assumptions
   used to determine if one hypothetical model is better than another in
   explaining experimental observations. Most previous work on epistasis
   analysis-in which one attempts to infer pathway relationships by
   determining equivalences among traits following mutations-has been based
   on Boolean or linear models. Here, we delineate the ultimate limits of
   epistasis-based inference by systematically surveying all two-gene
   network motifs and use symbolic algebra with arbitrary regulation
   functions to examine trait equivalences. Our analysis divides the motifs
   into equivalence classes, where different genetic perturbations result
   in indistinguishable experimental outcomes. We demonstrate that this
   partitioning can reveal important information about network
   architecture, and show, using simulated data, that it greatly improves
   the accuracy of genetic network inference methods. Because of the
   minimal assumptions involved, equivalence partitioning has broad
   applicability for gene network inference. (C) 2013 Author(s). All

Abstract = {{A novel technique to implement a multitap microwave photonic filter with
   positive and negative coefficients based on the inherent birefringence
   in a LiNbO3 phase modulator is proposed and demonstrated. In the
   proposed filter, a microwave signal is applied to the phase modulator
   and an optical polarizer is connected at the output of the phase
   modulator to perform polarization interference and phase-modulation to
   intensity-modulation (PM-IM) conversion. Thanks to the inherent
   birefringence in the LiNbO3 crystal, a pi phase shift is obtained by
   adjusting the wavelength spacing between two adjacent wavelengths, which
   leads to the generation of a positive coefficient and a negative
   coefficient. An equivalent experiment is performed. Four-tap and six-tap
   microwave photonic filters with positive and negative coefficients are
   experimentally demonstrated. The reconfigurability of the four-tap and
   six-tap microwave photonic filters is also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel, compact, single-sideband (SSB)
   subharmonically-pumped (SHP) direct upconverter developed in a uniplanar
   0.18 mu m GaAs technology. A total of 100 MHz in-phase and quadrature
   signals directly modulate the second harmonic of a 30 GHz carrier
   signal, producing a 60.1 GHz output. Two pairs of antiparallel diodes
   reduce feed-through of the 30 GHz local oscillator (LO) signal to the
   mixer's RF output. Novel structures patterned in the center conductor of
   a coplanar waveguide (CPW) provide matching and size-reduction
   simultaneously. The 2.1mm(2) circuit also uses a miniaturized Wilkinson
   divider based on asymmetric coplanar stripline and a standard CPW 90
   degrees coupler. The SSB SHP direct upconverter exhibits a conversion
   loss of 10 dB, a lower-sideband rejection of 15 dB and 2f(LO)
   suppression of approximately 25 dB over a wide frequency range from
   52-61 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{As mobile phones become smarter and include a wider and more powerful
   array of sensory components, the opportunity to leverage those
   capabilities in contexts other than telephony grows. We have in
   particular identified those sensory capabilities as key components for
   modern user interfaces that can detect movement, actions and intentions
   to enrich human-computer interaction in a natural way. In this work, we
   present research around using smartphones as input controllers in the
   context of exertion videogames. We propose a conceptual framework that
   identifies the core elements of such interfaces, regardless of the
   underlying technological platforms, and provides a design pattern for
   their integration into existing videogames without having to change the
   game's source code. We present a proof of concept implementation for the
   framework, with two smartphone input controllers, which using a soft
   button and accelerometer data, interface to a target-shooting exertion
   game played while exercising on a stationary bicycle. We present
   findings from a user experience evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The present work compares electrochemical degradation of red and blue
   azo textile dyes in single- and two-compartment electrochemical cells in
   the presence of Fenton reagent (Fe2+) and using a boron-doped diamond
   anode. Degradation of both dyes was related to the concentration of dye,
   applied current density and the concentration of FeSO4 catalyst.
   Complete colour removal and approximately 91\% of organic matter
   oxidation was achieved in a two-compartment electrochemical cell at an
   applied current density of 20mA center dot cm (-2), pH of 3 and Fe2+ ion
   concentration of 0.02 mM. Higher current density and reaction time were
   required to achieve the same removals in a one-compartment
   electrochemical cell. Dye degradation kinetics as well as chemical
   oxygen demand removal rate were successfully modelled to pseudo
   first-order kinetics. The apparent first-order rate constants (k(o)) for
   degradation of red dye with an initial concentration of 20, 40 and 60ppm
   were found to be 2.67 +/- 0.16, 2.19 +/- 0.09 and 1.5 +/- 0.03min(-1),

Abstract = {{An optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) for the generation of a microwave
   signal with both tunable frequency and phase is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. In the proposed OEO, a single-sideband
   (SSB) polarization-modulated signal is generated by a polarization
   modulator (PolM) and a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG). The
   SSB polarization-modulated signal is then split into two parts. One part
   is sent to a photodetector (PD) and then fed back to the PolM to form
   the OEO loop. The other part is sent to an electronically tunable
   polarizer (ETP) and then applied to a second PD. The frequency
   tunability is achieved by tuning the wavelength of the optical carrier.
   The tunable phase is introduced by tuning the principal axis of the ETP.
   An experiment is performed, and a microwave signal with a tunable
   frequency from 6.6 to 13.1 GHz and a tunable phase from -180 degrees to
   180 degrees is generated. The phase noise performance of the generated

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new pricing mechanism for virtual network (VN)
   services to regulate the demand for their shared substrate network (SN)
   resources. The contributions of this article are two-fold; first, we
   introduce a new time-of-use pricing policy for the SN resources that
   reflects the effect of resource congestion introduced by VN users. The
   preferences of the VN users are first represented through corresponding
   demand-utility functions that quantify the sensitivity of the
   applications hosted by the VNs to resource consumption, time-of-use and
   prices during peak-demand periods. We then introduce a novel model of
   time-varying VNs, where users are allowed to up-or down-scale the
   requested resources to continuously maximize their utility while
   minimizing the cost of embedding the VNs onto the SN. The second
   contribution is a novel hierarchical embedding management approach
   tailored to efficiently map these dynamic VNs. The proposed VN embedding
   scheme recasts the VN embedding problem as a subgraph matching one, and
   introduces a simple heuristics-based matching procedure to find a good
   VN embedding from a number of candidate solutions obtained in parallel.
   In contrast to existing solutions, the proposed scheme does not impose
   any limitations on the size or topology of the VN requests. Instead, the
   search is customized according to the VN size and the associated
   utility. Experimental results demonstrate the performance achieved by
   the proposed work in terms of the increased profit, resource utilization
   and number of accepted requests.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the fast-growing Internet traffic, this paper propose a
   distributed traffic management framework, in which routers are deployed
   with intelligent data rate controllers to tackle the traffic mass.
   Unlike other explicit traffic control protocols that have to estimate
   network parameters (e.g., link latency, bottleneck bandwidth, packet
   loss rate, or the number of flows) in order to compute the allowed
   source sending rate, our fuzzy-logic-based controller can measure the
   router queue size directly; hence it avoids various potential
   performance problems arising from parameter estimations while reducing
   much consumption of computation and memory resources in routers. As a
   network parameter, the queue size can be accurately monitored and used
   to proactively decide if action should be taken to regulate the source
   sending rate, thus increasing the resilience of the network to traffic
   congestion. The communication QoS (Quality of Service) is assured by the
   good performances of our scheme such as max-min fairness, low queueing
   delay and good robustness to network dynamics. Simulation results and
   comparisons have verified the effectiveness and showed that our new
   traffic management scheme can achieve better performances than the
   existing protocols that rely on the estimation of network parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A series of cadmium sulfide (CdS)-sensitized layered perovskite-type
   compound (K2La2Ti3O10) composites (hereafter designated as
   CdS/K2La2Ti3O10) photocatalysts were synthesized by loading CdS
   particles on K2La2Ti3O10 via a facile precipitation method. The
   photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse
   reflection spectra. The photocatalytic activities of these catalysts for
   H-2 production were investigated in the presence of a Na2S sacrificial
   reagent under visible light irradiation. The results revealed that the
   CdS/K2La2Ti3O10 samples displayed a strong light absorption in the
   visible region, and the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra changed with
   the proportion of CdS present. The composite photocatalysts exhibited
   enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the highest activity of
   50.53 mu mol was achieved using 5 wt.\% CdS/K2La2Ti3O10. This enhanced
   photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the efficient separation of
   electron-hole pairs and prevention of their recombination under the
   joint effects of the electric field established at the heterojunction
   and the layered space of K2La2Ti3O10. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon-doping of TiO2 was performed to improve the visible light
   response and photocatalytic activity of this catalyst. In this work, the
   high temperature annealing of TiC was studied and the anatase-rutile
   doped TiO2 mixtures created were characterized by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet-visible
   light absorption spectrophotometry (UV-Vis). It was found that the TiC
   fully reacts at 400 degrees C. Transformation of the anatase to rutile
   phase was observed since the latter form is more heat stable. XPS
   analysis revealed that the carbon in the sample was present as carbonate
   species. The UV-Vis spectrum of the doped powders were red shifted
   compared to P25 TiO2, and a band gap narrowing of 0.2 eV was observed.
   The photocatalytic activity of the powders was quantified by the
   degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation.
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics were applied, and the maximum pseudo-first
   order degradation rate observed was 0.015 min(-1) for the powder
   annealed at 400 degrees C for 8 h. Disinfection of Escherichia coli K12
   was performed using the catalyst in an immobilized configuration under
   visible light, and up to 80\% inactivation was observed, compared to
   negligible inactivation with P25. The modified Hom disinfection kinetic
   model was used to describe the data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Wavelength reuse in a bidirectional UWB over fiber system using a
   polarization modulator (PolM) and an electro-absorption modulator (EAM)
   is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Since the PolM functions as
   a special phase modulator that supports phase modulation along the two
   principal axes with opposite modulation indices and the EAM is a
   polarization-independent component, the signals due to the
   phase-modulation to intensity-modulation (PM-IM) conversion along the
   two orthogonal directions in the upstream link will be complementary and
   cancelled out, thus the impact of the downstream signal to the upstream
   transmission due to the PM-IM conversion is fully eliminated. Error-free
   bidirectional transmission of a 1.25-Gbps UWB signal over 17 km
   single-mode fiber (SMF) is demonstrated. A power penalty due to the
   wavelength reuse for upstream transmission is measured to be as low as
   0.2 dB. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

   and refilling of samples into a HC-PCF under identical optical
   conditions. Consequently, high-quality and reliable spectral data could
   be obtained which were suitable for multivariate analysis (partial least

   different concentrations of heparin and adenosine in serum. Thus the

Abstract = {{Photonic generation of a phase-coded microwave waveform with ultrawide
   frequency tunable range using two polarization modulators (PolMs) is
   proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The first PolM (PolM1) is used
   to control the polarization direction of a linearly polarized light wave
   to have an angle of 45 degrees or 135 degrees relative to one principal
   axis of the second PolM (PolM2). PolM2 operates in conjunction with a
   polarization controller and a polarizer as an equivalent Mach-Zehnder
   modulator (MZM). Depending on the polarization direction of the incident
   light wave, the equivalent MZM is biased at the opposite slopes of the
   transfer function. Thus, by applying a binary coding signal with a
   switching voltage of V-pi to PolM1, a pi phase-coded microwave waveform
   is generated. The key significance of the technique is that a
   phase-coded microwave waveform with an ultrawide frequency tunable range
   can be generated. The technique is experimentally evaluated. The
   generation of a frequency-tunable phase-coded microwave waveform with a
   frequency at 10, 20, 30, and 40 GHz is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency quadrupling for tunable microwave and sub-terahertz generation
   using a single polarization modulator (PolM) in a Sagnac loop without
   using an optical filter or a wideband microwave phase shifter is
   proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In the proposed system, a
   linearly polarized continuous wave from a tunable laser source (TLS) is
   split into two orthogonally polarized optical waves by a polarization
   beam splitter (PBS) and sent to the Sagnac loop traveling along the
   clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. A PolM to which a reference
   microwave signal is applied is incorporated in the loop. The PolM is a
   traveling-wave modulator, due to the velocity mismatch only the
   clockwise light wave is effectively modulated by the reference microwave
   signal, and the counter-clockwise light wave is not modulated. This is
   the key point that ensures the cancelation of the optical carrier
   without the need of an optical filter. Along the clockwise direction,
   the joint operation of the PolM, a polarization controller (PC), and a
   polarizer corresponds to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) with the bias
   point controlled to suppress the odd-order sidebands. The optical
   carrier is then suppressed by the counter-clockwise light wave at the
   polarizer. As a result, only two +/- 2nd-order sidebands are generated,
   which are applied to a photodetector (PD) to generate a microwave signal
   with a frequency that is four times that of the reference microwave
   signal. A theoretical analysis is developed, which is validated by an
   experiment. A frequency-quadrupled electrical signal with a large
   tunable range from 2.04 to 100 GHz is generated. The performance of the
   proposed system in terms of stability and phase noise is also evaluated.}},

   concentrations of lithium chloride additives were prepared for CO2
   stripping test. Physical membrane characterizations such as atomic force
   microscopy analysis, gas permeation, contact angle measurement and
   liquid entry pressure were also conducted. Correlations among the
   membrane properties, i.e. contact angle, gas permeation, mean pore size,
   nodule aggregates and surface roughness obtained from experimental
   analysis were discussed. The overall trend showed that increasing
   lithium chloride concentration has decreased the mean pore size, mean
   nodule aggregates and mean surface roughness of the membrane. On the
   contrary, the membrane liquid entry pressure has been significantly
   improved. It was found that the mean pore size determined by tapping
   mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) is 2.3 to 2.7 times larger than
   that of obtained from gas permeation test. The decreases in nodule size,
   mean pore size and low surface roughness have contributed to the
   enhancement of CO2 stripping performance in membrane contactor system.
   Increasing LiCl concentration has increased the CO2 stripping flux and
   membrane mass transfer coefficient. However, the concentration of LiCl
   showed minimal effect on the liquid side mass transfer coefficient. (C)

Abstract = {{Silicon-based surface-plasmon subbandgap detectors integrated with an
   asymmetric metal stripe are investigated for different metals, modes,
   and wavelengths of operation. Low-order bound modes supported by Al and
   Au stripes cladded below by silicon and covered by air are studied at
   the infrared wavelengths of 1310 and 1550 nm. Input optical power is
   end-fire coupled into the modes supported by the stripe, resulting in
   the total absorption of coupled power over a short length. The absorbed
   power creates excited carriers in the metal throughout the modal
   absorption volume, which can cross the Schottky barrier and become
   collected as photocurrent (internal photoemission). Measurements
   obtained for Au on n-type Si support predicted trends. The device has
   promise for applications in short-reach high-speed optical interconnects
   and silicon-based nanophotonics.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of seismic motions is one of the most important issues for
   the time-history analysis of buildings. This paper discusses four
   different methods for obtaining spectrum-compatible acceleration time
   histories (i.e., accelerograms) of seismic motions. Based on these
   methods, four sets of accelerograms compatible with the design spectrum
   for Vancouver were selected for this study. These included (i) scaled
   real accelerograms, (ii) modified real accelerograms, (iii) simulated
   accelerograms, and (iv) artificial accelerograms. The selected sets were
   used as excitation motions in the nonlinear analysis of three reinforced
   concrete frame buildings designed for Vancouver. The buildings included
   a 4-storey, a 10-storey, and a 16-storey building, which can be
   considered representative of low-rise, medium-rise, and high-rise
   buildings, respectively. The storey shears, interstorey drifts, and
   curvature ductilities for beams and columns obtained from the analysis
   were used for the evaluation of the effects of the selected sets on the
   responses of the buildings. Based on the results from the analysis,
   scaled real accelerograms are recommended for use in time-history
   analysis of reinforced concrete frame buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Computer software was developed for inelastic analysis of structural

   performance levels. The results are presented in graphical format in
   terms of structural load-deformation characteristics, single degree of
   freedom displacement - time histories and iso-displacement

Abstract = {{Seismic screening software is developed for existing buildings in Canada
   on the basis of the requirements of 2010 National Building Code of
   Canada. The software is based on the ``Manual for Screening of Buildings
   for Seismic Investigation,{''} published by the National Research
   Council of Canada in 1992. The new software incorporates updated
   seismicity and soil classifications used in the National Building Code
   of Canada (NBCC) since 2005, as well as the new ductility and
   over-strength factors specified in the 2010 NBCC. The uniform hazard
   spectrum values of the current Canadian seismicity, defined for each
   municipality in Canada with a 2500 year earthquake return period, are
   used as reference hazard values. Seismic risk associated with the use of
   older seismic hazard values specified in older editions of the NBCC is
   identified relative to the current reference seismicity. The new site
   classifications are incorporated, while establishing relative soil
   amplification values between the new acceleration-based and
   velocity-based soil amplification factors and the foundation factors
   used in older codes. The new ductility and over-strength factors used in
   recent editions of the code are introduced in identifying different
   structural types with different toughness and energy dissipation
   capacities. The software can be used to conduct seismic screening of
   buildings located in different municipalities in Canada relative to the
   seismic requirements of NBCC-2010. It can also be used to generate

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Most existing video encoders currently used in mobile applications are
   unable to gracefully degrade their output quality as the battery life
   nears its end. In other words, they cannot manage power consumption to
   efficiently utilize the available power resources. To be able to
   effectively adapt to changes in the encoder's software and hardware
   platforms, especially due to the power limitations of mobile devices,
   the effect of encoder parameters on the encoding quality and power
   consumption has to be represented using a Rate-Distortion-Complexity
   (R-D-C) model. Most existing R-D-C models only consider macroblock level
   parameters, and overlook other higher level parameters that may have a
   more significant impact on complexity. In this paper, the distortion and
   complexity of the H.264/AVC encoder is controlled considering a subset
   of higher level encoding parameters consisting of search range, number
   of reference frames, and motion vector resolution. First, the complexity
   of full and fast motion estimation methods is modeled in an
   implementation and platform independent manner. Then, using this
   complexity model, a common encoding parameter setting table is derived,
   which leads to the least amount of distortion for each complexity
   condition. Finally, a complexity control mechanism is proposed which
   tunes the encoding parameters in a real-time manner. The proposed model
   can be combined with other existing macroblock level models in order to
   design a two-phase fine grain complexity controller. Simulation results
   indicate that when our method is integrated with the direct resource
   allocation (DRA) approach, performance increases by an average of 1.02
   dB and 1.06 dB for full and fast motion estimation approaches,
   respectively. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   main features of various fire samples to analyze their tracks and
   synthesize a new fire by combining various fire samples, recorded with
   high frame rates, in order to edit given sequences of fire animations.
   For this purpose, we present how to recognize similarity of the shapes
   of fire in order to change the pattern from one style of fire to another
   distinct style of fire procedurally. Our techniques require very little

   exopolysaccharide (EPS) concentration and the broth viscosity were used
   as optimization objective functions to be maximized. A 6-run uniform
   design was used to investigate five factors. Under the best operating
   conditions among the six runs, 29.0 g L-1 EPS was produced at 102 h.
   This condition was used as the starting point for further investigation
   on the two statistically significant factors, the pH and the agitation
   speed. An 8-run 3-level custom design that investigates up to
   second-order effects was used in the second stage. An optimal zone of
   operating conditions for large quantity of high MW pullulan production
   was identified. A concentration of 23.3 g L-1 EPS was produced at 78 h.
   This is equivalent to an EPS productivity of 0.30 g L-1 h(-1). The
   corresponding apparent viscosity of the broth was 0.38 Pa s at the shear
   rate of 10 s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a turbo receiver for multicarrier spread spectrum systems
   employing parity bit selected spreading code (MC-SS-PB) is proposed
   where detection and decoding are performed iteratively for each detected
   bit in the receiver. In MC-SS-PB systems, the parity bits generated by a
   linear block encoder are used to select a spreading code from a set of
   orthogonal spreading sequences. The selected spreading code is then used
   to spread the signals in all subcarriers. In the proposed receiver, soft
   information passes between the detector and the decoder on multiple
   iterations. Detection is performed by using the received signal in
   combination with the extrinsic likelihood provided by a soft input soft
   output decoder. The turbo receiver is further extended to a multiple
   user system where the multiple access interference is estimated in each
   iteration and subtracted out from the received signal. Simulations show
   a significant reduction in bit error rates when a turbo receiver is used
   in these systems.}},

   optimization}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{343-354}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a multiobjective optimization of the heat transfer area
   and pumping power of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger is presented to
   provide the designer with multiple Pareto-optimal solutions which
   capture the trade-off between the two objectives. Nine decision
   variables were considered: tube layout pattern, number of tube passes,
   baffle spacing, baffle cut, tube-to-baffle diametrical clearance,
   shell-to-baffle diametrical clearance, tube length, tube outer diameter,
   and tube wall thickness. The optimization was performed using the fast
   and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) available
   in the multiobjective genetic algorithm module of MATLAB (R). In order
   to verify the improvements in design that the method offers, two case
   studies from the open literature are presented. The results show that
   for both case studies, better values of the two objective functions can
   be obtained than the ones previously published. In addition, NSGA-II
   provides a Pareto front with a wider range of optimal decision
   variables. Ranking the Pareto-optimal solutions using a simple cost
   function shows that the costs for optimal design are lower than those
   reported in the literature for both case studies. The algorithm was also
   used to determine the impact of using continuous values of the tube
   length, diameter and thickness rather than using discrete standard
   industrial values to obtain the optimal heat transfer area and pumping
   power. Results show that using continuous values of these three decision
   variables only leads to marginally improved performance compared to
   discrete values. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive demodulation technique for bearing fault
   detection. It is implemented via the tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT).
   With the TQWT, the bearing vibration signal is decomposed into
   sub-signals corresponding to different band-pass filters of the TQWT.
   Kurtosis as an effective indicator of signal impulsiveness is adopted to
   guide the merging of the sub-signals leading to a signal component which
   contains information most relevant to the bearing fault. The purpose of
   the proposed approach is to adaptively search for the best filter for
   envelope demodulation analysis. In fact, the implementation of the
   proposed method can be interpreted as the process to obtain the optimal
   filter for the Hilbert demodulation analysis by two steps of merging of
   the band-pass filters of the TQWT. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method has been demonstrated by both simulation and experimental
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, with the increasing level of competition in the global
   construction market several research efforts have focused on the
   application of information technology (IT) as a way to improve the
   integration process of construction supply chain management (CSCM).
   Visual representation of the process can provide an effective tool for
   monitoring resources in the CSCM. In order to support this objective,
   this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic
   information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping
   track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure
   the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is
   implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a
   detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process.
   Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used
   in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the
   CSCM, GIS is used in the present model. Thus, this paper represents the
   integrated GIS-BIM model manifesting the flow of materials, availability
   of resources, and ``map{''} of the respective supply chains visually. A
   case example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the
   developed system. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},
