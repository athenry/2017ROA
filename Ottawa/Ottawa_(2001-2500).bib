Abstract = {{On-line oil debris monitoring is an effective approach to detecting
   machine component wear through estimating the size and the quantity of
   metallic debris in the lubricating oil. However, oil debris (particle)
   signatures are often contaminated by background noise and vibration
   interference during the operation of the oil debris sensor. As such, the
   accuracy of debris measurement and counting depends largely on the
   authenticity of the extracted debris signature. Considering
   characteristics of both target and interference signals obtained by the
   oil debris sensor, we propose a novel debris signature extraction
   technique to improve the oil debris measurement capability based on the
   wavelet domain information. In each wavelet scale of the oil debris
   sensor output signal, the debris coefficients are detected based on the
   singularity of the debris signal. The interference coefficients are
   estimated by adaptive linear prediction. The overlapped debris and
   interference coefficients are separated by a new prediction strategy
   involving alternating applications of forward and backward predictors.
   The differences between the mixture and the estimated interference
   coefficients are employed to reconstruct the debris signature. The
   proposed technique is evaluated using both uni- and bi-excitation
   experimental data and compared with a recently reported method. The
   experimental results and comparisons indicate that the proposed new
   method can extract the debris signature more truthfully, and thus
   improve the oil debris monitoring accuracy in real applications. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigate the applicability of photonic crystal waveguides to
   high-resolution on-chip spectrometers. We argue that the figure of merit
   by which their performance should be gauged is not the group index
   bandwidth product, which photonic crystal waveguides are usually
   optimized for, but the working finesse, which relates to the maximum
   number of spectral lines resolvable by a slow-light spectrometer.
   Through numerical simulation, we show that a properly-optimized photonic
   crystal waveguide could form the basis of a spectrometer with a spectral
   resolution of 0.04 nm over a 12.5 nm bandwidth near 1550 nm and with a
   footprint six times smaller than a conventional spectrometer. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) stripping from water was conducted through the
   porous asymmetric polysulfone (PSf) hollow fiber membrane contactor. The
   effect of the liquid and gas flow rates on the stripping performance,
   the liquid phase CO2 concentration and the CO2 stripping efficiency of
   the membrane module and the effect of liquid phase temperature on CO2
   stripping flux were studied. The experimental results showed that the
   stripping gas velocity had a minor effect on the CO2 desorption flux
   while the increase in the liquid velocity could enhance CO2 desorption
   flux in the gas stripping membrane contactor. By increasing liquid flow
   rate to 200 ml/min, the maximum CO2 stripping efficiency of almost 66\%
   was achieved. Enhancement of liquid flow rate from 50 to 200 ml/min
   increased the CO2 flux around 482\%. It was found that the CO2 stripping
   flux was significantly affected by the liquid phase temperature. By
   increasing liquid temperature from 80 to 90 C, the CO2 stripping flux
   increased from 1.3 x 10(-4) to 4.9 x 10(-4) mol m(-2) s(-1) at liquid
   velocity of 200 ml min(-1). Hence, the higher stripping efficiency can
   be achieved by applying the higher liquid flow rate in the membrane
   contactor module. As well, the liquid phase temperature is a key
   parameter that needs to be controlled. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nanofiber membranes were fabricated by electrospinning poly(vinylidene
   fluoride). The electrospun nanofiber membranes were further modified by
   grafting of acrylic acid (AA) and methacrylic acid (MM) over the
   surfaces of the membranes. Plasma AA graft was attempted only, and the
   results indicated the partial membrane pore filling with grafted AA. For
   MM grafting, chemically induced polymerization using benzoyl peroxide
   and hydrogen peroxide was attempted. The combination of plasma and
   chemically induced MM graft polymerization was also attempted. The
   membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and static contact angle (SCA)
   measurement. SEM surface analysis indicated partial pore narrowing of
   grafted membranes. The average pore size was reduced from 0.97 mu m for
   the untreated membrane to 0.15 mu m for the two step plasma and
   chemically induced grafted membranes. XPS analysis confirmed that
   grafting has taken place on the top surface of the membranes. The
   surfaces of the grafted membrane were significantly hydrophilic as
   observed by SCA. It was also found that the combination of plasma and
   chemically induced grafting using hydrogen peroxide was the most
   effective in terms of flux and selectivity. The grafting reduced the
   pore size by filling the pores of the original membranes by the graft
   polymers. This practice resulted in producing tight micro-filtration
   (MF) membranes from loose MF ones. An impressive high water flux of 150
   kg/h m(2) at an operating pressure of 4 psig, and a 79\% removal of
   polyethylene oxide (molecular weight 400 kilo-Daltons) were achieved.

Abstract = {{An optical vector network analyzer (OVNA) based on unbalanced
   double-sideband (UB-DSB) modulation with improved measurement accuracy
   is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. It is different from an
   OVNA based on optical single-sideband (OSSB) modulation in which
   one-to-one mapping between the optical and radio frequency responses is
   employed to measure the magnitude and phase responses of an optical
   component, the proposed technique measures the magnitude and phase
   responses by taking into consideration of the power of the other
   sideband through solving two equations that are associated with the
   UB-DSB modulation, thus the errors due to the residual power of the
   other sideband in an OSSB modulation based approach are completely
   eliminated. A mathematical model providing the transfer function of an
   optical component is derived. The measurement of a phase-shifted fiber
   Bragg grating and a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating is performed.
   Comparing with the measured results based on OSSB modulation, obvious
   improvement in measurement accuracy is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Cd1-xZnxS-sensitized K2Ti4O9 composite photocatalysts (hereafter

   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), ultraviolet-visible diffuse
   reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

   activities for degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) were investigated under
   visible light irradiation. The Cd0.8Zn0.2S particles, which were
   scattered on the surface of K2Ti4O9, had a relatively uniform size
   distribution centered around approximately 50 nm, and the absorption
   edge of K2Ti4O9 was shifted to the visible light region after the
   deposition of Cd0.8Zn0.2S. The Cd0.8Zn0.2S crystal was found to be
   hexagonal and the K2Ti4O9 crystal monoclinic in the composite
   photocatalysts. Cd0.8Zn0.2S/K2Ti4O9 showed lower PL peak intensity than
   K2Ti4O9. The composite photocatalyst loaded with 30 wt.\% Cd0.8Zn0.2S
   exhibited the highest photo-catalytic activity, and was able to degrade
   95\% of RhB in 180 min. The photocatalytic reaction parameters, such as
   initial RhB concentration, photocatalyst dosage and initial solution pH
   were studied. The mechanism of separation of the photo-generated

Abstract = {{A surface-modifying macromolecule (SMM) was used to enhance the surface
   hydrophobicity of poly(ether imide) (PEI) hollow-fiber membranes. The
   membranes were used for a membrane contactor to absorb CO2 with water.
   The effects of three hollow-fiber fabrication parameters, that is, the
   PEI concentration in the casting dope, the SMM concentration in the
   casting dope, and the air gap, on the liquid entry pressure of water
   (LEPw) and the absorption rate (AR) of CO2 were investigated with
   response surface methodology. The model developed for LEPw satisfied the
   criterion for regression but had a low goodness of fit. The model
   predicted that LEPw would increase with PEI (weight percentage) but
   decrease with air gap. Furthermore, it showed a minimum value with a
   change in SMM (weight percentage). The model developed for the AR of CO2
   had meaningful statistical parameters and was accurate; this indicated
   that interactions existed between the fabrication parameters on the AR
   of CO2. The performance of one of the fabricated membranes was compared
   with in-house and commercially made hydrophobic membranes in terms of
   the AR of CO2 with distilled water as an absorbent on the lumen side and
   pure CO2 on the shell side. The comparison showed a superior CO2 flux in
   the surface-modified membrane; for example, at a liquid velocity of 0.4
   m/s, the surface-modified membrane exhibited a 416\% higher AR than the
   commercial membrane contactor (Celgard MiniModule 0.75X5) made of
   polypropylene. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci.

Abstract = {{Gas-particle flows are present in many industrial applications such as
   polymerization, fluid catalytic cracking, chemical vapor deposition,
   combustion and drying. Particle-particle, particle-wall and gas-particle
   interactions cause electrostatic charge to form on particles. The motion
   of charged particles creates an electric field, affecting the
   hydrodynamics in reactors such as polymerization fluidized beds and
   fluid catalytic crackers (Hendrickson, 2006). In this work, a combined
   multi-fluid and electrostatic model previously developed in Rokkam et
   al. (2010) is used to simulate laboratory-scale experiments on
   electrostatics in gas-solid fluidized beds conducted by Sowinski et al.
   (2010). The fluidized-bed experiments were operated in two flow regimes,
   bubbling and slug flow. Charge-to-mass ratio (q/m) measured in the
   experiments was used as an input to the computational fluid dynamic
   (CFD) electrostatic model. Particle-phase segregation from CFD
   simulations with electrostatic forces compared well with experimental
   measurements and observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The devastation due to storm surge flooding caused by extreme wind waves
   generated by the cyclones is a severe apprehension along the coastal
   regions of India. In order to coexist with nature's destructive forces
   in any vulnerable coastal areas, numerical ocean models are considered
   today as an essential tool to predict the sea level rise and associated
   inland extent of flooding that could be generated by a cyclonic storm
   crossing any coastal stretch. For this purpose, the advanced 2D
   depth-integrated (ADCIRC-2DDI) circulation model based on finite-element
   formulation is configured for the simulation of surges and water levels
   along the east coast of India. The model is integrated using wind stress
   forcing, representative of 1989, 1996, and 2000 cyclones, which crossed
   different parts of the east coast of India. Using the long-term
   inventory of cyclone database, synthesized tracks are deduced for
   vulnerable coastal districts of Tamil Nadu. Return periods are also
   computed for the intensity and frequency of cyclones for each coastal
   district. Considering the importance of Kalpakkam region, extreme water
   levels are computed based on a 50-year return period data, for the
   generation of storm surges, induced water levels, and extent of inland
   inundation. Based on experimental evidence, it is advocated that this
   region could be inundated/affected by a storm with a threshold pressure
   drop of 66 hpa. Also it is noticed that the horizontal extent of inland
   inundation ranges between 1 and 1.5 km associated with the peak surge.
   Another severe cyclonic storm in Tamil Nadu (November 2000 cyclone),
   which made landfall approximately 20 km south of Cuddalore, has been
   chosen to simulate surges and water levels. Two severe cyclonic storms
   that hit Andhra coast during 1989 and 1996, which made landfall near
   Kavali and Kakinada, respectively, are also considered and computed
   run-up heights and associated water levels. The simulations exhibit a
   good agreement with available observations from the different sources on
   storm surges and associated inundation caused by these respective
   storms. It is believed that this study would help the coastal
   authorities to develop a short- and long-term disaster management,
   mitigation plan, and emergency response in the event of storm surge
   flooding.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study that focuses on the
   investigation of the coupled effects of temperature and sulphate on the
   permeability of hardened cemented paste backfill (CPB). Hydraulic
   conductivity tests and a microstructural analysis are conducted on
   mature CPBs prepared with various amounts of sulphate (0, 5000, 15,000,

   degrees C, 35 degrees C, and 50 degrees C). Important findings and
   valuable results are gained. It is found that the coupled effects of
   sulphate and temperature can lead to decrease (i.e. improvement of the
   environmental performance of CPBs) or increase of the hydraulic
   conductivity of CPBs. There is competition between the permeability
   decreasing and increasing factors. The dominant influencing factors
   depend on the curing temperature and initial sulphate content. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Multi-frequency acoustic backscatter profiles recorded with side-looking
   acoustic Doppler current profilers are used to monitor the concentration
   and size of sedimentary particles suspended in fluvial environments.
   Data at 300, 600, and 1200 kHz are presented from the Isere River in
   France where the dominant particles in suspension are silt and clay
   sizes. The contribution of suspended sediment to the through-water
   attenuation was determined for three high concentration (> 100 mg/L)
   events and compared to theoretical values for spherical particles having
   size distributions that were measured by laser diffraction in water
   samples. Agreement was good for the 300 kHz data, but it worsened with
   increasing frequency. A method for the determination of grain size using
   multi-frequency attenuation data is presented considering models for
   spherical and oblate spheroidal particles. When the resulting size
   estimates are used to convert sediment attenuation to concentration, the
   spheroidal model provides the best agreement with optical estimates of
   concentration, but the aspect ratio and grain size that provide the best
   fit differ between events. The acoustic estimates of size were one-third
   the values from laser grain sizing. This agreement is encouraging
   considering optical and acoustical instruments measure different
   parameters. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{The re-centering phenomenon of superelastic Shape Memory Alloy (SMA)
   reinforced concrete is a unique characteristic that is appealing for
   structural applications, along with the ability to respond with stable
   hystereses and achieve similar strength and ductility to concrete
   reinforced with conventional deformed bars. The objective of this study
   was to investigate the structural performance of superelastic SMA
   reinforced concrete and to develop a preliminary constitutive model
   applicable to nonlinear finite element algorithms. Seven simply
   supported flexure-critical concrete beams, reinforced with either SMA
   bars in the critical region or conventional deformed reinforcement, were
   subjected to monotonic, cyclic, and reverse cyclic loading. The
   experiment results demonstrated the superior capacity of the SMA beams
   to recover inelastic displacements. The SMA beams sustained displacement
   ductility and strength capacity comparable to the conventional beams.
   Crack widths and crack spacing were larger in the SMA beams; however,
   upon removal of load, the crack openings were recovered. Energy
   dissipation was lower in the SMA beams, particularly when subjected to
   reverse cyclic loading. The constitutive model based on a trilinear
   backbone envelope response and linear unloading and reloading rules
   provided satisfactory simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Many technologies are now being explored to permit the combustion of
   fossil fuels while achieving CO2 capture in a state suitable for
   compression, transporting, and sequestration. Among the chief contenders
   are processes in which the fuel is first decarbonized, usually by
   gasification, followed by the use of a shift reaction to produce pure
   H2; post-combustion capture, in which the CO2 is removed from the flue
   gases either at high temperatures (e.g. carbonate or Ca looping) or at
   near-ambient temperatures (e.g. amine scrubbing); chemical looping in
   which the fuel is converted in the presence of a solid oxide carrier,
   thus producing a stream of gas consisting primarily of CO2 and H2O; and
   finally, oxyfuel combustion in which the fuel is burned in a stream of
   pure, or nearly pure, oxygen. The latter technology is already being
   investigated for application with pulverized fuel or coal, but more
   recently, the possibility of using oxyfuel combustion with circulating
   fluidized beds has been receiving increasing attention. There is already
   a 30 MWth demonstration unit operating in Spain, with plans to build a
   300 MWe plant. This perspective describes the current status of oxyfuel

Abstract = {{A finite-element formulation is developed for the lateral torsional
   buckling analysis of plane frames with moment connections consisting of
   two pairs of welded plate stiffeners. The finite element provides a
   realistic representation of the partial warping restraint provided by
   the joint to the adjoining members. The element consists of two nodes
   with four generalized buckling degrees of freedom per node and is thus
   devised to interface with two classical beam buckling elements connected
   at right angles. The new finite element extends the functionality of the
   classical beam finite element to predict the lateral buckling load for
   noncollinear structures, such as portal frames. A comparison with
   results based on shell finite-element analysis demonstrates the ability
   of the new formulation to reliably predict the lateral buckling
   resistance of plane frames at a fraction of the computational and
   modeling cost of shell-based finite-element solutions. DOI:

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to model the thermal expansion
   coefficients of various Ni-based superalloys used in gas turbine
   components. The thermal expansion coefficient is described as a function
   of temperature, chemical composition including Ni, Cr, Co, Mo, W, Ta,
   Nb, Al, Ti, B, Zr, and C contents as well as heat treatment including
   solutionizing and aging. Experimental values are well described and
   their relative changes well correlated by the model. Because gas turbine
   engine components operate under severe loading conditions and at high
   and varying temperatures, the prediction of their thermal expansion
   coefficient is crucial. The model developed in this work can be useful
   for design optimizations for minimizing thermo-mechanical stresses
   between the base alloys and potential protective coatings or adjacent
   components. It can substantially contribute to improve the performance
   and service life of gas turbine components.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-aeration, which refers to the addition of very small amounts of
   air, is a simple technology that can potentially be incorporated in
   septic tanks to improve the digestion performance. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate and compare the effects of micro-aeration on
   anaerobic digestion of primary sludge under septic tank conditions. 1.6
   L batch reactor experiments were carried out in duplicate using raw
   primary sludge, with 4.1 \% total solids, and diluted primary sludge,
   with 2.1 \% total solids. Reactors were operated for 5 weeks at room
   temperature to simulate septic tank conditions. Micro-aeration rate of
   0.00156 vvm effectively solubilised chemical oxygen demand (COD) and
   improved the subsequent degradation of COD. Micro-aeration also
   increased the generation of ammonia and soluble proteins, but did not
   improve the reduction in total and volatile solids, or the reduction in
   carbohydrates. Experiments using diluted sludge samples showed similar
   trends as the experiments with raw sludge, which suggest that initial
   solids concentration did not have a significant effect on the
   degradation of primary sludge under septic tank conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the availability of shared resources, substantial efforts
   have been applied to the development of large-scale distributed
   simulations, and performance has become an essential aspect that can be
   impaired by heterogeneity and availability of resources, dynamic,
   unpredictable load imbalances, and communication delays. In order to
   manage and keep such distributed simulations consistent, the high level
   architecture (HLA) standard has been designed; however, it does not
   provide any solution that directly solves simulation performance issues.
   Many balancing approaches have been proposed in order to offer a
   suboptimal balancing solution, but they are limited to certain
   simulation aspects, are specific to determined applications, or are
   unaware of the HLA-based simulation characteristics. In light of
   considering both computational and communication aspects for HLA-based
   simulations, a centralized hierarchical balancing scheme was proposed.
   This scheme presents several drawbacks that make it susceptible to
   bottlenecks, overheads, global synchronization, and single point of
   failure. Therefore, a scheme based on a distributed algorithm to
   re-arrange the computational and communication load is proposed.
   Experiments have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   distributed scheme when compared with the scheme based on a centralized
   redistribution algorithm. The results showed that the distributed
   balancing technique could provide similar performance gain or even
   improve it for some specific cases. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Nowadays social tagging has become a popular way to annotate, search,
   navigate and discover online resources, in turn leading to the sheer
   amount of user-generated metadata. This paper addresses the problem of
   recommending suitable tags during folksonomy development from a
   graph-based perspective. The proposed approach adapts the Katz measure,
   a path-ensemble based proximity measure, for the use in social tagging
   systems. We model a folksonomy as a weighted, undirected tripartite
   graph. We then apply the Katz measure to this graph, and exploit it to
   provide tag recommendations for individual users. We evaluate our method
   on two real-world folksonomies collected from CiteULike and Last.fm. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the
   recommendation performance and is effective for both active taggers and
   cold-start taggers compared to existing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Multirelational classification aims to discover patterns across multiple
   interlinked tables (relations) in a relational database. In many large
   organizations, such a database often spans numerous departments and/or
   subdivisions, which are involved in different aspects of the enterprise
   such as customer profiling, fraud detection, inventory management,
   financial management, and so on. When considering classification,
   different phases of the knowledge discovery process are affected by
   economic utility. For instance, in the data preprocessing process, one
   must consider the cost associated with acquiring, cleaning, and
   transforming large volumes of data. When training and testing the data
   mining models, one has to consider the impact of the data size on the
   running time of the learning algorithm. In order to address these
   utility-based issues, the paper presents an approach to create a pruned
   database for multirelational classification, while minimizing predictive
   performance loss on the final model. Our method identifies a set of
   strongly uncorrelated subgraphs from the original database schema, to
   use for training, and discards all others. The experiments performed
   show that our strategy is able to, without sacrificing predictive
   accuracy, significantly reduce the size of the databases, in terms of
   the number of relations, tuples, and attributes.The approach prunes the
   sizes of databases by as much as 94 \%. Such reduction also results in
   decreasing computational cost of the learning process. The method
   improves the multirelational learning algorithms' execution time by as
   much as 80 \%. In particular, our results demonstrate that one may build
   an accurate model with only a small subset of the provided database.}},

Abstract = {{Large scale dense Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) will be increasingly
   deployed in different classes of applications for accurate monitoring.
   Due to the high density of nodes in these networks, it is likely that
   redundant data will be detected by nearby nodes when sensing an event.
   Since energy conservation is a key issue in WSNs, data fusion and
   aggregation should be exploited in order to save energy. In this case,
   redundant data can be aggregated at intermediate nodes reducing the size
   and number of exchanged messages and, thus, decreasing communication
   costs and energy consumption. In this work, we propose a novel Data
   Routing for In-Network Aggregation, called DRINA, that has some key
   aspects such as a reduced number of messages for setting up a routing
   tree, maximized number of overlapping routes, high aggregation rate, and
   reliable data aggregation and transmission. The proposed DRINA algorithm
   was extensively compared to two other known solutions: the Information
   Fusion-based Role Assignment (InFRA) and Shortest Path Tree (SPT)
   algorithms. Our results indicate clearly that the routing tree built by
   DRINA provides the best aggregation quality when compared to these other
   algorithms. The obtained results show that our proposed solution
   outperforms these solutions in different scenarios and in different key
   aspects required by WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-particle image velocimetry (mu PIV) is used to visualize paired
   images of micro particles seeded in blood flows. The images are
   cross-correlated to give an accurate velocity profile. A protocol is
   presented for mu PIV measurements of blood flows in microchannels. At
   the scale of the microcirculation, blood cannot be considered a
   homogeneous fluid, as it is a suspension of flexible particles suspended
   in plasma, a Newtonian fluid. Shear rate, maximum velocity, velocity
   profile shape, and flow rate can be derived from these measurements.
   Several key parameters such as focal depth, particle concentration, and
   system compliance, are presented in order to ensure accurate, useful
   data along with examples and representative results for various

Abstract = {{Users of social Web sites actively create and join communities as a way
   to collectively share their media content and rich experience with
   diverse groups of people. In this study we focus on the issue of
   recommending social communities (or groups) to individual users. We
   address specifically the potential of social tagging for accentuating
   users' interests and characterizing communities. We also discuss some
   unique methods of improving several techniques that have been adapted
   for use in the context of community recommendations: collaborative
   filtering, a random walk model, a Katz influence model, a latent
   semantic model, and a user-centric tag model. We effectively incorporate
   social tagging information in each algorithm. We present empirical
   evaluations using real datasets from CiteULike and Last.fm. Our
   experimental results demonstrate that the different algorithms
   incorporated with social tagging offer significant advantages in
   improving both the recommendation quality and coverage, and demonstrate
   their feasibility for community recommendations in dealing with
   sparsity-related limitations.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Using two measurements with simultaneous speech and noise presentation,
   Hagerman and Olofsson have suggested a time-domain method to estimate
   the speech and noise signals at the output of a hearing device. The
   method, which uses a simple phase-inversion scheme, has gained
   popularity in hearing-aid research, although receiving only limited
   validation. In this work, we present an evaluation of this
   signal-separation method using simulated measurements with different
   hearing aids and listening conditions. Estimates of the speech and noise
   spectra from the phase-inversion method are compared to those obtained
   using the coherence function. New measures of speech and noise
   distortion are proposed as tools to evaluate the phase-inversion method.
   Additionally, we analyze the intelligibility predictions computed from
   the recovered spectral estimates, while accounting for the proposed
   speech distortion measure. Under additive-noise conditions, the
   phase-inversion method provides ideal signal separation without
   suffering any biases at low signal-to-noise ratios. For conditions
   involving automatic gain control, compressive output limiting, and peak
   clipping, the intelligibility predictions based on the phase-inversion
   method are found to agree with relevant findings from the literature.}},

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Ni, NiO, beta-Ni(OH)(2) and Pt nanomaterials are prepared with cathodic
   contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE) in acidic and alkaline media
   by alternating the Ni and Pt cathode vs. a large Ni anode. The
   morphological and crystalline characterizations of the products suggest
   two reaction mechanisms where in the first, metal ions are locally
   reduced by the high reducing agents generated by the electrical
   discharges from the cathode, i.e. the solvated electron, the H-center
   dot radical and secondary species if any. This is supported by CGDE
   experiments conducted in acidic environment with Ni or Pt cathode that
   gave Ni-based materials only. The second mechanism for the formation of
   metals aggregates is due to the cathode material electro-erosion due to
   the high temperature spots at its surface that lead to the local
   vaporization of its material and the rapid quenching of the generated
   powder. This conclusion is drawn after eliminating the source of Ni2+
   ions, initially due to the Ni anode dissolution in acidic pH, and
   conducting the same two previous experiments in concentrated KOH
   solutions instead. In both arrangements, it is the cathode material that
   was the source of the synthesized nanoparticles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The coupling coefficients of the cladding-mode resonances of a tilted
   fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) are linearly increasing or decreasing in
   different wavelength regions. Based on the Kramers-Kronig relations,
   when the coupling coefficients are linearly increasing, the phase shifts
   are linearly increasing correspondingly. This feature is employed, for
   the first time, for the implementation of a multi-tap continuously
   tunable microwave photonic filter with complex coefficients by using a
   TFBG. By locating the optical carriers of single-sideband-modulated
   signals at the cladding-mode resonances of the TFBG which has linearly
   increasing depths, linearly increasing phase shifts are introduced to
   the optical carriers. By beating the optical carriers with the single
   sidebands, the phase shifts are translated to the microwave signals, and
   thus complex coefficients with the required linearly increasing phase
   shifts are generated. The tunability of the complex coefficients is
   realized by optically pumping the TFBG which is written in an
   erbium/ytterbium (Er/Yb) co-doped fiber. A proof-of-concept experiment
   is performed; a three- and four-tap filter with a frequency tunable
   range of 150 and 120 MHz, respectively, are demonstrated. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The behavior of sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) with
   different degrees of sulfonation (DS) (60-76\%) blended with charged
   surface modifying macromolecule (cSMM) at different operating
   temperatures as an electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cell
   (DMFC) application has been studied. A good DMFC electrolyte membrane
   should possess high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability.
   In this work, the fabricated SPEEK/cSMM membranes were compared with
   pure SPEEK and commercial Nafion 112 membranes in terms of water uptake,
   proton conductivity, and methanol permeability at temperature range of
   room to 80 degrees C The water uptake of SPEEK/cSMM membranes increased
   with the temperature and it was higher than that of SPEEK and Nafion 112
   membranes; however newly fabricated membranes with 68\% and 76\% DS were
   dissolved at high temperatures although showed the same trend at lower
   temperatures. In agreement with the result of water uptake, proton
   conductivity of SPEEK/cSMM membranes also increased with temperature and
   was higher as compared to the corresponding SPEEK membranes; however it
   was still lower than that of Nafion 112. The methanol permeability
   values of the SPEEK/cSMM membranes were lower at different temperatures
   as compared to corresponding SPEEK and Nafion 112 at the same condition.
   Owing to considerable proton conductivity and lower methanol
   permeability values, SPEEK60/cSMM exhibited the highest overall
   performance than other tested membranes at 60 degrees C. These results
   indicated that SPEEK60/cSMM membrane is promising to be used as a
   polymer electrolyte membrane in direct methanol fuel cell. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We propose a decentralized security framework for smart grids that
   supports data aggregation and access control. Data can be aggregated by
   home area network (HAN), building area network (BAN), and neighboring
   area network (NAN) in such a way that the privacy of customers is
   protected. We use homomorphic encryption technique to achieve this. The
   consumer data that is collected is sent to the substations where it is
   monitored by remote terminal units (RTU). The proposed access control
   mechanism uses attribute-based encryption (ABE) which gives selective
   access to consumer data stored in data repositories and used by
   different smart grid users. RTUs and users have attributes and
   cryptographic keys distributed by several key distribution centers
   (KDC). RTUs send data encrypted under a set of attributes. Since RTUs
   are maintained in the substations they are well protected in control
   rooms and are assumed to be trusted. Users can decrypt information
   provided they have valid attributes. The access control scheme is
   distributed in nature and does not rely on a single KDC to distribute
   the keys which makes the approach robust. To the best of our knowledge,
   ours is the first work on smart grids, which integrates these two
   important security components (privacy preserving data aggregation and
   access control) and the first paper which addresses access control in
   smart grids.}},

Title = {{Effect of the Axial Spacing between Vanes and Blades on a Transonic Gas

Abstract = {{Unsteady numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the
   effect of axial spacing between the stator vanes and the rotor blades on
   the performance of a transonic, single-stage, high-pressure, axial
   turbine. Three cases were considered, the normal case, which is based on
   the geometry of a commercial jet engine and has an axial spacing at 50\%
   blade span equal to 42\% of the vane axial chord, as well as two other
   cases with axial spacings equal to 31 and 52\% vane axial chords,
   respectively. Present interest has focused on the effect of axial gap
   size on the instantaneous and time-averaged flows as well as on the
   blade loading and the turbine performance. Decreasing the gap size
   reduced the pressure and increased the Mach number in the core flows in
   the gap region. However, the flows near the two endwalls did not follow
   monotonic trends with the gap size change; instead, the Mach numbers for
   both the small gap and the large gap cases were lower than that for the
   normal case. This Mach number decrease was attributed to increased
   turbulence due to the increased wake strength for the small gap case and
   an increased wake width for the large gap case. In all considered cases,
   large pressure fluctuations were observed in the front region of the
   blade suction side. These pressure fluctuations were strongest for the
   smaller spacing. The turbine efficiencies of the cases with the larger
   and smaller spacings were essentially the same, but both were lower than
   that of the normal case. The stator loss for the smaller spacing case
   was lower than the one for the larger spacing case, whereas the opposite
   was true for the rotor loss.}},

Abstract = {{The present work is a study of the effects of rotor blade scaling of a
   single-stage high pressure turbine on the time-averaged turbine
   performance and on parameters that influence vibratory stresses on the

   considered: a reference case with 36 rotor blades and 24 stator vanes, a
   case with blades upscaled by 12.5\%, and a case with blades downscaled
   by 10\%. The present results demonstrate that blade scaling effects were
   essentially negligible on the time-averaged turbine performance, but
   measurable on the unsteady surface pressure fluctuations, which were
   intensified as blade size was increased. In contrast, blade torque
   fluctuations increased significantly as blade size decreased. Blade
   scaling effects were also measurable on the vanes.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the recent paradigm shift from system-on-board to designs
   embracing embedded cores-based system-on-chips (SOCs), the complexity of
   digital circuits has enormously increased. This growing complexity has
   resulted in a huge challenge in developing their appropriate and
   efficient fault testing environment. Despite significant efforts
   directed toward implementing effective testing strategies of very large
   scale integrated circuit chips with reasonable cost, new frontiers
   emerged with advances in technology. The subject paper endeavors to
   develop method to test verify circuit architecture under hardware
   software co-design environment, targeting specifically embedded
   cores-based SOCs. The concept of design-for-testability is utilized in
   the paper together with ModelSim simulation and verification tool to
   test synthesize the entire design. Some simulation results on the
   International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) 85 combinational
   and ISCAS 89 full-scan sequential benchmark circuits are also included

Title = {{A proof of wavelength conversion not improving Lagrangian bounds of the
   sliding scheduled RWA problem}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{600-606}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Extensive previous studies confirmed that wavelength conversion may only
   marginally improve the solutions to the static Routing and Wavelength
   Assignment (RWA) problem. This means that, for the static RWA problem,
   certain RWA schemes that do not use wavelength conversion can achieve a
   performance almost as good as the one from the best RWA scheme. Previous
   research work on sliding scheduled RWA problems, where a given set of
   lightpath demands are allowed to slide within their time windows, has
   also indicated in limited simulation results that the benefit of using
   wavelength conversion is marginal. However, the observation cannot be
   conclusive without the solid mathematical proof. We are thus motivated
   to investigate whether schedule sliding really requires wavelength
   conversion to achieve a better performance. In this paper, we prove that
   wavelength conversion does not improve the Lagrangian bound of the
   sliding scheduled RWA problem. In most test cases, this bound is very
   close to the best achieved objective function value. Our proof implies
   that, for those cases, the improvements achieved by making use of
   wavelength conversion are very marginal. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{As part of a larger experimental program on dam breaching, this paper
   presents experimental results for a series of breach tests conducted on
   homogeneous non-cohesive embankments under several initial breach
   conditions. The initial conditions utilized different geometries
   including a V-notch cut into the crest of the embankment, which is
   typical of a number of previous experimental studies, as well as the
   more realistic mechanisms of overtopping over a flat crest, and the
   novel breach overtopping mechanism of simulating a crater caused by an
   explosive blast. The relative failure rates of each of the three initial
   breach geometries were compared against each other, as well as against
   previous experimental studies. It was found that the breach initiation
   mechanism has a strong influence on the time required for the breach to
   progress to failure. Based on the experimental results, a four-stage
   breach process is proposed to describe breach morphology and outflow.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory flume experiments were conducted to study the flow field and
   sediment dynamics in a mobile-bed channel bend with and without the
   presence of stream barbs (upstream-angled submerged groynes). This paper
   presents spatial distributions of the vorticity field and the turbulent
   Reynolds shear stresses, kinetic energy, and integral scales. The
   objectives of the present paper were to (1) advance understanding of the
   role that vorticity and turbulence play in the erosion process in
   channel bends with and without barbs, and (2) optimize barb design for
   reducing erosion along the outer bank regions of channel bends through
   consideration of flow-field turbulence and vorticity. Results indicate
   that (1) increased z-vorticity occurred in the outer bank scour zone for
   all runs with and without barbs; (2) for the runs without barbs and with
   moderately sized barbs, increased streamwise-cross-stream Reynolds
   stress (tau(uv)) was found to coincide with locations of scour; and (3)
   for the run with large barbs, all three Reynolds shear stresses
   increased, but tau(vw) was most consistently associated with scour
   locations. In general, local scour near the barbs was associated with
   increased z-vorticity, tke, and nonprincipal Reynolds stresses (tau(uv)
   and tau(vw)). Furthermore, it was observed that the outer bank region
   (particularly between adjacent barbs) may be susceptible to increased
   erosion if stream barbs, due to their size and layout, generate
   excessive turbulence and secondary velocities. DOI:

   the predicted and experimentally measured rheological properties of CPB.

Abstract = {{Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is an important problem in
   Bioinformatics that aims to align more than two sequences in order to
   emphasize similarity regions. This problem is known to be NP-Hard, so
   heuristic methods are used to solve it. DIALIGN-TX is an iterative
   heuristic method for MSA that generates alignments by concatenating
   ungapped regions with high similarity. Usually, the first phase of MSA
   algorithms is parallelized by distributing several independent tasks
   among the nodes. Even though heterogeneous multicore clusters are
   becoming very common nowadays, very few task allocation policies were
   proposed for this type of architecture. This paper proposes an
   MPI/OpenMP master/slave parallel strategy to run DIALIGN-TX in
   heterogeneous multicore clusters, with several allocation policies. We
   show that an appropriate choice of the master node has great impact on
   the overall system performance. Also, the results obtained in a
   heterogeneous multicore cluster composed of 4 nodes (30 cores), with
   real sequence sets show that the execution time can be drastically
   reduced when the appropriate allocation policy is used.}},

   of two nonlinear diffusion equations. A new temporal filter which leads
   to significant improvement of numerical results is proposed, and the
   impact of the filter on the stability and accuracy of the results is
   investigated. Noteworthy improvements are obtained as compared to other
   commonly used numerical schemes. Linear stability analysis of the

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of exploring an anonymous unoriented ring by a
   team of k identical, oblivious, asynchronous mobile robots that can view
   the environment but cannot communicate. This weak scenario is standard
   when the spatial universe in which the robots operate is the
   two-dimensional plane, but (with one exception) has not been
   investigated before for networks. Our results imply that, although these
   weak capabilities of robots render the problem considerably more
   difficult, ring exploration by a small team of robots is still possible.
   We first show that, when k and n are not co-prime, the problem is not
   solvable in general, e.g., if k divides n there are initial placements
   of the robots for which gathering is impossible. We then prove that the
   problem is always solvable provided that n and k are co-prime, for ka
   parts per thousand yen17, by giving an exploration algorithm that always
   terminates, starting from arbitrary initial configurations. Finally, we
   consider the minimum number rho(n) of robots that can explore a ring of
   size n. As a consequence of our positive result we show that rho(n) is
   O(logn). We additionally prove that Omega(logn) robots are necessary for
   infinitely many n.}},

Abstract = {{Photocaged RGDS is a cell nonadhesive tetrapeptide that can be activated
   with light to become cell-adhesive. Such molecules can find useful
   applications in controlling cell adhesion for biological study, drug
   development, and in forming dynamic, adhesion-controlled biomaterials.
   Herein, we prepared RGDS peptide photocaged either on the Arg-Gly
   backbone amide nitrogen atom (R{[}-]GDS) or Asp side chain carboxyl
   (RG{[}D]S). A critical comparison of the peptides' chemical and
   physiological properties relevant for biological applications was
   carried out. It was observed that RG{[}D]S was synthesized more readily
   via automated solid-phase synthesis, underwent uncaging with a rate
   constant 3-fold higher than R{[}-]GDS, and was more stable in aqueous
   solution. Automated docking studies were performed to examine the
   interactions of various caged RGDS peptides with cell surface integrin
   receptor to identify suitable locations for the photosensitive
   2-nitrobenzyl (NB) group for biological applications. A competitive
   binding ELISA method compared the ability of various peptides to bind to
   aV beta 3 cell integrin receptors and the data were found to be
   consistent with the modeling predictions. Finally, the application of
   our caged RGDS peptides in controlling cell adhesion to form cell
   patterns on a hydrogel material was presented. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The deformation and fracture mechanisms of voided polymers and
   rubber-toughened polymers are an active research area where accurate
   fracture models still need to be proposed. The reason for the lack of
   accurate models stems from a lack of controlled experiments at the
   microscale, the scale of voids and cracks forming in polymers. In this
   paper, controlled experiments were carried out on thin polycarbonate
   sheets containing controlled arrays of laser microvoids, loaded in-situ
   under an optical microscope. Void dimensions were extracted
   experimentally and compared to a simple finite element model that was
   able to accurately predict macroscopic stress strain curves as well as
   the microscopic behavior in terms of void growth. It is shown that the
   local equivalent plastic strain at failure is independent of the void
   configuration studied and can therefore be used as a criterion for
   predicting fracture in voided polycarbonate under plane stress. We
   propose that it is not the intervoid spacing that controls fracture but
   the competition between intervoid strain localization and the spread of
   plasticity through the propagation of shear bands. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{The current study is a series of experiments designed to examine the
   role of turbulent instabilities on the ignition process of pressurized
   hydrogen jets which are released into oxidizer environments. The
   experiments were conducted in a shock tube where hydrogen gas is
   shock-accelerated into a partly confined oxygen environment across a
   perforated plate. Although the considered scenario differs from most
   practical applications where high pressure hydrogen is released into
   air, the results may be applicable toward cases where hydrogen leaks are
   shock assisted through holes in fuel cell membranes. Schlieren
   visualization permitted the reconstruction of the gas dynamic evolution
   of the release while time resolved self-luminosity records permitted us
   to record whether ignition was achieved. Despite the presence of
   confinement in the experiments, the ignition limits determined
   experimentally were found to be relatively agreeable with trends
   predicted by a previously developed 1-D numerical model (Maxwell and
   Radulescu, 2011), which assumes a release into an unconfined
   environments. However, the role of confinement in the experiments not
   only influence ignition at lower limits compared to the 1-D ignition
   model, but was also found to promote turbulent mixing through shock
   reflections and flow instabilities. Turbulent mixing thus influences how
   the ignition spots interact to ignite the entire jet. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Nanoantennas are key optical components for several applications
   including photodetection and biosensing. Here we present an array of
   metal nano-dipoles supporting surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)
   integrated into a silicon-based Schottky-contact photodetector. Incident
   photons coupled to the array excite SPPs on the Au nanowires of the
   antennas which decay by creating ``hot{''} carriers in the metal. The
   hot carriers may then be injected over the potential barrier at the
   Au-Si interface resulting in a photocurrent. High responsivities of 100
   mA/W and practical minimum detectable powers of -12 dBm should be
   achievable in the infra-red (1310 nm). The device was then investigated
   for use as a biosensor by computing its bulk and surface sensitivities.
   Sensitivities of similar to 250 nm/RIU (bulk) and similar to 8 nm/nm
   (surface) in water are predicted. We identify the mode propagating and
   resonating along the nanowires of the antennas, we apply a transmission
   line model to describe the performance of the antennas, and we extract
   two useful formulas to predict their bulk and surface sensitivities. We
   prove that the sensitivities of dipoles are much greater than those of
   similar monopoles and we show that this difference comes from the gap in
   dipole antennas where electric fields are strongly enhanced. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Carbon-supported PtIr nanoparticles with the nominal atomic ratio of 70
   to 30 \% in the 3 nm scale are investigated for the ammonia oxidation
   reaction (AOR) in 1 M KOH. The morphological and surface properties of
   alloyed PtIr electrocatalysts synthesized at pH 7 and 8.5 are
   characterized by TEM, XRD, SAXS and XPS. According to SAXS,
   nanoparticles prepared at lower pH (PtIr (1)) are mono-dispersed with
   particle size of 2.9 nm, whereas nano-sized catalyst PtIr (2)
   synthesized at higher pH has bi-modal size distribution with modes at
   1.8 and 3.4 nm. XPS revealed that Pt on the surface of PtIr (1) is
   present in metallic state contrary to PtIr (2) where platinum surface
   species of higher oxidation state are identified. Iridium on the surface
   of both samples is present in Ir-0, Ir3+ and Ir4+ form. From the
   electrochemical characterizations, the onset potential of PtIr for
   ammonia oxidation is more negative (-1.07 V vs. MSE) compared to the
   monometallic Pt nanoparticles of 3.0 nm in size (-0.94 V vs. MSE). Long
   term electrolysis (12 h) demonstrated a 33\% higher degradation rate of
   ammonia on PtIr (1) than on Pt with N-2 as the main product, in addition
   to some traces of NO3 and NO2. Higher catalytic activity, stability and
   activity recovery of PtIr nanoparticles is attributed to the electronic
   effect generated between Pt and Ir atoms in alloy. The surface of
   alloyed PtIr nanoparticles displays a complex of physicochemical and
   electrocatalytic properties, thus the maximum electrocatalytic activity
   towards AOR is highly correlated with the narrow size distribution and
   lower amount of surface oxygenated species. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Modifications and pelletization of limestone were investigated in order
   to improve the utilization of CaO-based materials for different
   catalytic reactions and environmental applications. Attempts to purify
   the limestone by ion-exchange with CaCl2 solution did not result in
   significant removal of impurities. On the other hand, acetification with
   10 vol.\% acetic acid enhanced pore surface area and pore volume of the
   sorbent by 42\% and 3-fold, respectively. The acetification was found to
   widen small pores, and thus create a beneficial pore size distribution
   with more pores in the range of 25-100 nm. In order to utilize such
   powdered materials in fluidized beds, pelletization is the next step.
   Unfortunately, pelletization results suggested that natural kaolin is an
   unsuitable binder for preparing CaO-based pellets due to its negative
   impact on pellet morphology. By contrast, Al(OH)(3) binder obtained from
   kaolin leaching had a strong positive effect on the porous texture of
   the pellets, demonstrated by pore surface area and volume of 22.48 m(2)
   g(-1) and 0.051 cm(3) g(-1) for 1 mm pellets with CaO/binder ratio of
   5.5, compared to 10.92 m(2) g(-1) and 0.039 cm(3) g(-1) for natural
   materials. The enhancement in pellet morphology is mainly attributed to
   transformation of Al(OH)(3) to the highly porous Al2O3 at high
   temperatures. Pellets synthesized from limestone modified with 10 vol.\%
   acetic acid with Al(OH)(3) binder (ratio of 5.5) exhibited high pore
   surface area and volume, represented by 1.3-fold and 44\% increase over
   those for natural limestone. It was concluded that the combination of
   acetified limestone with Al(OH)(3) binder is a promising approach for
   synthesis of CaO-based pellets with enhanced morphology. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Calcium looping is an emerging CO2 capture technology based on cyclic
   calcination/carbonation reactions using calcium-based sorbents. Steam is
   typically present in flue/fuel gas streams from combustion or
   gasification and in the calciner used for sorbent regeneration. The
   effect of steam in the calciner on sorbent performance has received
   little attention in the literature. Here, experiments were conducted
   using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to determine the effect of
   steam injection during calcination on sorbent reactivity during
   carbonation. Two Canadian limestones, Cadomin and Havelock, were tested,
   and various levels of steam (up to 40\%) were injected in the sorbent
   regeneration process for 15 calcination/carbonation cycles. All
   concentrations of steam examined were found to increase sorbent
   reactivity for carbonation for both sorbents. In these experiments, 15\%
   steam concentration with calcination had the largest impact on carrying
   capacity for both sorbents. Steam changes the morphology of the sorbent
   while calcination is occurring, probably causing a shift from smaller to
   larger pores, resulting in a structure which increases carrying
   capacity. It was also demonstrated that steam addition produced a larger
   impact on sorbent reactivity for carbonation than for calcination.}},

Title = {{Exploring an unknown dangerous graph using tokens}},
Journal = {{THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{472}},
Pages = {{28-45}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Consider a team of (one or more) mobile agents operating in a graph G.
   Unaware of the graph topology and starting from the same node, the team
   must explore the graph. This problem, known as graph exploration, was
   initially formulated by Shannon in 1951, and has been extensively
   studied since under a variety of conditions. Most of the existing
   investigations have assumed that the network is safe for the agents, and
   the vast majority of the solutions presented in the literature succeed
   in their task only under this assumption.
   Recently, the exploration problem has been examined also when the
   network is unsafe. The danger examined is the presence in the network of
   a black hole, a node that disposes of any incoming agent without leaving
   any observable trace of this destruction. The goal is for at least one
   agent to survive and to have all the surviving agents to construct a map
   of the network, indicating the edges leading to the black hole. This
   variant of the problem is also known as a black hole search. This
   problem has been investigated for the most part assuming powerful
   inter-agent communication mechanisms: whiteboards at all nodes. Indeed,
   in this model, the black hole search problem can be solved with an
   optimal team size and performing a polynomial number of moves.
   In this paper, we consider the less powerful enhanced token model: each
   agent has available a token that can be carried, placed on a node or on
   a link, and can be removed from it. All tokens are identical and no
   other form of marking or communication is available. We constructively
   prove that the black hole search problem can be solved also in this
   model; furthermore, this can be done using a team of agents of optimal
   size and performing a polynomial number of moves. Our algorithm works
   even if the agents are asynchronous and if both the agents and the nodes
   are anonymous. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b is responsible for a high percentage
   of fatal cases of food-borne infection. In a previous study, we created
   15 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against a similar to 77 kDa antigen that
   is associated with the cell surface of live L. monocytogenes serotype 4b
   cells. Here we report an extensive characterization of these MAbs to
   further their development as diagnostic reagents. The similar to 77 kDa
   target antigen was identified by mass spectrometry and N-terminal
   sequencing to be IspC, a novel surface associated autolysin. Epitope
   localization experiments revealed that each of the 15 MAbs recognized
   the C-terminal cell-wall binding domain of IspC. The presence of IspC
   was shown to be highly conserved within L. monocytogenes serotype 4b, as
   evidenced by a strong reaction between anti-IspC MAbs and all 4b
   isolates. To determine the range of cross-reactivity with other L.
   monocytogenes serotypes ELISA was used to test each MAb against multiple
   isolates from each of the L. monocytogenes serotypes. Of the 15 MAbs,
   five: M2774, M2775, M2780, M2790 and M2797, showed specificity for L.
   monocytogenes serotype 4b and only cross reacted with serotype 4ab
   isolates. The kinetics of the interaction between each of the MAbs and
   IspC was measured using surface plasmon resonance. The MAbs M2773,
   M2792, M2775, M2797 and M2781 each had very low dissociation constants
   (4.5 x 10(-9) to 1.2 x 10(-8) M). While several of these antibodies have
   properties which could be useful in diagnostic tests, the combined high
   fidelity and affinity of M2775 for the IspC protein and serotype 4b
   isolates, makes it a particularly promising candidate for use in the
   development of a specific L. monocytogenes serotype 4b diagnostic test.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel semi-passive radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) system for accurate indoor localization. The
   system is composed of a standard ultra high frequency (UHF) ISO-18000-6C
   compliant RFID reader, a set of standard passive RFID tags whose
   locations are known, and a newly developed tag-like RFID component,
   which is attached to the items that need to be localized. The new
   semi-passive component, referred to as sensatag (sense-a-tag), has a
   dual functionality: it can sense and decode communication between the

Abstract = {{A TiO2-coated rotating corrugated reactor is experimentally

   of methylene blue (MB). Using degradation kinetics derived from
   flat-plate experiments and finite-element discrete-ordinate models

   UV-lamp array, the simulated reactor performance is experimentally
   validated and extended to explore the impact of geometry variations.
   Mass-transfer limitations between the corrugated surface and the
   reservoir bulk are identified as a determining factor in the degradation
   rate of MB. Optimization studies suggest minimizing the corrugation
   half-angle to improve reactor performance for a given area, increasing
   the number of corrugations rather than the corrugation depth subject to
   practical limitations arising from undesirable bubble formation at small
   aperture widths. Given the relevance of mass transfer to this system,
   future work is needed to elucidate the experimental impact of reservoir
   volume and geometry while validating the use of flat-plate correlations

Abstract = {{By having a thorough understanding of the methods involved in reducing
   electrification within gas-solid fluidized beds, additional techniques
   for reduction or prevention can be developed. In this study, the effect
   of fluidizing gas relative humidity was investigated with the focus on
   its influence on charge distribution within a fluidized bed, and the
   amount of particle wall fouling within the bubbling and slugging
   fluidization flow regimes. Gas relative humidities of 0\%, 20\%, 40\%,
   60\% and 80\% were evaluated with polyethylene resin received from a
   commercial reactor. The effect on charging was examined for particles in
   three regions of the bed: elutriated fines, bulk particles and those
   particles that adhered to the fluidization column wall. Particle charge,
   mass, and size distributions were measured for all regions. It was found
   that the effect of relative humidity on wall fouling was only apparent
   in the bubbling flow regime where the particle layer on the wall reduced
   at 60\% and 80\% relative humidity. A similar trend was also observed
   for these particle charges while their charge-to-mass ratio remained
   constant. In the slugging flow regime for those particles that adhered
   to the column wall a decline in particle net charge-to-mass ratio was
   obtained for only at high humidity of 80\%. Other variations in charge
   and charge-to-mass ratio were observed in both flow regimes but did not
   follow any trends with respect to the gas relative humidity. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Pt nanoparticles (2.5 +/- 0.5 nm) deposited on yttria-stabilized
   zirconia (YSZ), ceria (CeO2) and samarium doped-ceria (SDC) show a
   strong metal support interaction (SMSI) resulting in O2- transfer
   towards Pt through the triple phase boundary (tpb) and electron transfer
   from Pt to the ceramic. This charge transfer leads to a remarkable
   catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles interfaced with ionically and
   mixed conductive supports for carbon monoxide and ethylene oxidation in
   the absence of O-2 in the gas feed. It is proposed, that Pt nanoparticle
   and the conducting ceramic form local micro-galvanic cells, where anodic
   reaction is VOCs oxidation by O2- at the tpb and the cathodic reaction
   is the partial reduction of zirconia or ceria. The complete
   electrooxidation of 909 ppm of CO and C2H4 by O2- from the conductive
   ceramic support was achieved in the temperature range of 120-240 degrees
   C depending on the support. The total oxygen fraction consumed from each
   support per catalytic run was 1.9-2.4 and 16.9-25.9\% for oxidation of
   909 ppm of CO and C2H4, respectively. The catalytic activity of Pt/solid
   electrolytes was compared with YSZ, CeO2 and SDC blank supports and also
   with Pt nanoparticles deposited on non-ionically conductive carbon black
   (Pt/C) and gamma-alumina (Pt/gamma-Al2O3) supports, which all showed no
   catalytic activity in the absence of oxygen in the gas feed. (C) 2012

Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A series of laboratory flume experiments were performed to study the
   effect of stream barbs on flow field dynamics and sediment erosion in a
   135 degrees mobile-bed channel bend. Stream barbs (also known as spur
   dikes or submerged groynes) are low-profile linear rock features that
   redirect high velocity flow away from the outer bank of channel bends.
   Unlike emergent groynes, the submerged nature of these structures
   creates a unique combination of horizontal shear (plunging type flow)
   and vertical shear (at the groyne tip). Spatially dense, high frequency
   velocity data were collected and analyzed to describe the pattern and
   magnitude of three-dimensional (3D) velocity throughout the bend and in
   the vicinity of the stream barbs. This paper demonstrates that the outer
   bank region (particularly between barbs) may still be at risk of erosion
   (or even increased erosion greater than the same case without barbs) if
   stream barbs generate excessive secondary velocities (because of their
   size and layout) that are opposing the primary secondary flow naturally
   occurring in channel bends. Characterizing the role of flow field
   dynamics on the pattern of deposition and erosion through experimental
   measurements provided valuable data about how such flow features
   contribute to local scour, and about the performance of these
   structures. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000655. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{The distribution of charge within the wall fouling region and bulk of a
   fluidized bed reactor was investigated. Experiments were conducted in a
   0.1 m in diameter carbon steel fluidization column under atmospheric
   conditions. Polyethylene particles were fluidized with extra dry air at
   1.5 the minimum fluidization velocity (bubbling flow regime) for 1 h.
   Using an online Faraday cup measurement technique, the net
   charge-to-mass ratio (q/m), as well as the size distribution of all
   particles adhered to the column wall and those in the bulk of the bed
   was determined. The wall particles were found to be predominantly
   negatively charged while those which did not adhere to the wall were
   predominantly positively charged. The charge distribution within each
   region was then investigated by a custom made charged particle separator
   that separated the particles according to their charge magnitude and
   polarity. It was determined that although the net charge of the wall
   layer particles was negative, a significant amount of positively charged
   particles existed within each sample and therefore the entire wall
   particle layer. This suggests that the wall layer was formed through
   layering between positively and negatively charged particles. Particles
   in the bulk of the bed also consisted of bipolarly charged particles.

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Surgery to correct cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is
   increasingly popular. Nevertheless, no known study has analyzed both the
   three-dimensional lower-extremity joint kinematics and kinetics to
   quantify FAI surgical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the effects of FAI surgery on the affected lower-extremity
   joint mechanics during gait by comparing the three-dimensional hip,
   knee, ankle and pelvic angular displacements, as well as the hip, knee
   and ankle moments and powers of preoperative and postoperative FAI
   groups, and a healthy control group. Ten patients with unilateral
   symptomatic cam FAI, who underwent corrective surgery using an open or
   combined technique, participated in the biomechanical analysis of level
   walking preoperatively and postoperatively. Thirteen healthy control
   subjects provided normative data. Results showed that gait biomechanics
   of FAI patients did not return to normal after surgery. Postoperatively,
   patients had reduced hip frontal and sagittal plane ROM, smaller peak
   hip abduction and internal rotation moments, and decreased peak hip
   power generation compared to the control group. Despite reductions in
   hip pain, hip impairments and trends detected preoperatively, perhaps
   due to modified gait patterns, persisted postoperatively. Additional
   discrepancies in lower-extremity joint mechanics were observed
   postoperatively, which are believed to have resulted from partial muscle
   impairment caused by the surgical approaches. Further research is
   required to confirm the reasons for which lower-extremity gait mechanics
   of FAI patients do not return to normal following surgery. Clarifying
   these causes could help improve surgical techniques and rehabilitation
   programs for the treatment of FAI, and thus improve surgical outcomes.

Abstract = {{We previously reported a unique genome with systematically fragmented
   genes and gene pieces dispersed across numerous circular chromosomes,
   occurring in mitochondria of diplonemids. Genes are split into up to 12
   short fragments (modules), which are separately transcribed and joined
   in a way that differs from known trans-splicing. Further, cox1 mRNA
   includes six non-encoded uridines indicating RNA editing. In the absence
   of recognizable cis-elements, we postulated that trans-splicing and RNA
   editing are directed by trans-acting molecules. Here, we provide insight
   into the post-transcriptional processes by investigating transcription,
   RNA processing, trans-splicing and RNA editing in cox1 and at a newly
   discovered site in cob. We show that module precursor transcripts are up
   to several thousand nt long and processed accurately at their 5' and 3'
   termini to yield the short coding-only regions. Processing at 5' and 3'
   ends occurs independently, and a processed terminus engages in
   trans-splicing even if the module's other terminus is yet unprocessed.
   Moreover, only cognate module transcripts join, though without
   directionality. In contrast, module transcripts requiring RNA editing
   only trans-splice when editing is completed. Finally, experimental and
   computational analyses suggest the existence of RNA trans-factors with
   the potential for guiding both trans-splicing and RNA editing.}},

Abstract = {{Heparin is the most widely used anti-coagulant for the prevention of
   blood clots in patients undergoing certain types of surgeries including
   open heart surgeries and dialysis. The precise monitoring of heparin
   amount in patients' blood is crucial for reducing the morbidity and
   mortality in surgical environments. Based upon these considerations, we
   have used Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with partial least squares
   (PLS) analysis to measure heparin concentration at clinical level which
   is less than 10 United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in serum. The PLS
   calibration model was constructed from the Raman spectra of different
   concentrations of heparin in serum. It showed a high coefficient of
   determination (R-2 > 0.91) between the spectral data and heparin level
   in serum along with a low root mean square error of prediction similar
   to 4 USP/ml. It enabled the detection of extremely low concentrations of
   heparin in serum (similar to 8 USP/ml) as desirable in clinical
   environment. The proposed optical method has the potential of being
   implemented as the point-of-care testing procedure during surgeries,
   where the interest is to rapidly monitor low concentrations of heparin
   in patient's blood. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{In a manufacturing environment, workforce flexibility can be achieved by
   cross-training and improved via job rotation. In firms with a flexible
   workforce, employees perform different tasks and functions in response
   to fluctuations in both product demands and labour resources. This paper
   presents a mathematical programming model that assigns workers to tasks,
   rotates workers between the tasks, and determines the training schedule.
   The objective is to minimize the total costs including training cost,
   flexibility cost, and productivity loss cost. A constructive-search
   heuristic is also developed to solve the proposed model. The algorithm
   provides good solutions in two phases: construction and improvement. At
   the construction phase, a solution is built using some problem-specific
   information. The quality of the solution is then enhanced by changing
   worker assignments at a particular time point during a planning horizon.
   Our computational results for a number of randomly generated test
   problems confirms the efficiently of the proposed method. Journal of the

Abstract = {{Pervasive broadband access will transform cities to the net social,
   environmental and economic benefit of the e-City dweller as did the
   introduction of utility and transport network infrastructures. Yet
   without action, the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to
   the increasing energy consumption of access networks will become a
   serious threat to the environment. This paper introduces the vision of a
   `sustainable Digital City' and then considers strategies to overcome
   economic and technical hurdles faced by engineers responsible for
   developing the information and communications technology (ICT) network
   infrastructure of a Digital City. In particular, ICT energy consumption,
   already an issue from an operating cost perspective, is responsible for
   3 \% of global energy consumption and is growing unsustainably. A grand
   challenge is to conceive of networks, systems and devices that together
   can cap wireless network energy consumption whilst accommodating growth
   in the number of subscribers and the bandwidth of services. This paper
   provides some first research directions to tackle this grand challenge.
   A distributed antenna system with radio frequency (RF) transport over an
   optical fibre (or optical wireless in benign environments) distribution
   network is identified as best suited to wireless access in cluttered
   urban environments expected in a Digital City from an energy consumption
   perspective. This is a similar architecture to Radio-over-Fibre which,
   for decades, has been synonymous with RF transport over analogue
   intensity-modulated direct detection optical links. However, it is
   suggested herein that digital coherent optical transport of RF holds
   greater promise than the orthodox approach. The composition of the
   wireless and optical channels is then linear, which eases the digital
   signal processing tasks and permits robust wireless protocols to be used
   end-to-end natively which offers gains in terms of capacity and energy
   efficiency. The arguments are supported by simulation studies of
   distributed antenna systems and digital coherent Radio-over-Fibre links.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-over- fibre (RoF) technology is receiving large attention due to
   its ability to provide simple antenna front ends, increased capacity and
   increased wireless access coverage. Coherently detected RoF systems
   would enable the information to be carried in both the amplitude and
   phase or in different states of the polarisation of the optical field.
   Additionally, the selectivity of coherent receiver is very well suited
   for access networks. We present a 90A degrees optical hybrid built on a
   silicon-on-insulator planar light-wave circuit, which can be used as the
   optical front end of the digital coherent receiver in a digitised RoF
   link and will lead to reduced receiver footprint and cost. The optical
   hybrid circuit includes 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 multimode interference (MMI)
   splitters, in a polarisation diversity configuration. The simulation
   results at vacuum wavelength 1,550 nm show polarisation independence and
   phase errors between the ports of less than 0.03A degrees. The
   properties of the prototyped 4 x 4 MMI were measured over a wide range
   of wavelengths. The 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 MMI showed nearly equal splitting
   ratios. Measurements of the relative phase relationship between the
   ports for Transverse Electric mode polarisation are shown to match the
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to steer optical beams, crucial to the operation of
   high-speed optical wireless links may be achieved using optical phased
   array antennas which have significant potential in this application. The
   beam formed by the phased array antennas is steered by tuning the
   relative phase difference between the adjacent antenna elements which
   may be achieved nonmechanically. In this paper, the characteristics and
   behaviour of two dimensional optical phased arrays with a structure
   composed of 2 x 2, 4 x 4, and 16 x 16 antenna elements in beam steering
   are verified. The wavelength beam steering of -0.16A degrees/nm is
   measured along the theta direction with a required steering range
   (between main lobes) of 1.97A degrees within a -3 dB envelop of 5A
   degrees extent in the theta direction and 7A degrees extent in the I
   broken vertical bar direction. To achieve two-dimensional beam steering,
   thermo-optic beam steering can be used in I broken vertical bar
   direction. It is found that the thermo-optic phase tuning departs the
   expected quadratic dependence and is well characterised by a quartic
   dependence upon heater current or voltage.}},

Abstract = {{The papers in this special issue reflect several of the major themes and
   topics from the 7th International Workshop on Gravel-Bed Rivers. The
   papers focus primarily on aspects of bed material transport in
   gravel-bed rivers and larger scale morpho-dynamics. Research in
   gravel-bed rivers is increasingly integrating processes over a wide
   range of temporal and spatial scales by combining field observation, lab
   experimentation, numerical modeling and theory testing in a range of
   river types, aided by new technological developments in particle
   tracking, computational modeling and high resolution spatial data. This
   is leading to greater understanding of the processes leading to
   distinctive morpho-dynamics of river types and a more reliable basis for
   river management. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of mobile cloud computing (MCC) indicates that
   increasingly abundant applications are available, thus deeming energy
   problems even more significant. To achieve energy optimization in mobile
   systems, power consumption involved with each component or application
   need to be estimated prior to execution. In this paper, we present a
   survey on the universal energy estimation model for mobile devices.
   Additionally, due to the significance of wireless network interface card
   (WNIC) in the power use of mobile devices, considerable researches have
   been devoted to a low-power design of the WNIC (i.e., Cellular and
   WiFi). These efforts have allowed us to provide a comprehensive summary
   of recent work on transmission energy savings. Finally, we conclude the
   survey and discuss the future research directions.}},

   Poly{[}(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl] butanediamide (mPASB) polymers were
   synthesized, using succinyl chloride and substituted

   prepared by blending these novel polymers by Diffusion Induced Phase
   Separation (DIPS) method. The performance of the membrane was studied in
   terms of salt rejection, water flux and molecular weight cutoff. The
   prepared membranes were hydrophilic in nature, which was confirmed by
   water uptake studies and contact angle measurement. All the membranes
   showed 1000 Da molecular weight cutoff. A maximum NaCl rejection of 52\%
   was observed in some of the membranes. The effect of feed NaCl
   concentration on the NaCl rejection was also studied. The resistance of
   the membranes in a wide pH range was studied by water uptake
   measurement. Antifouling properties of the membranes were also performed
   using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) solution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Slag chemistry is important for the assessment of flow behaviour of
   slags produced during gasification of coal and coal-petroleum coke
   blends. Slags containing vanadium species react readily with the
   crucible and spindle materials used for viscosity measurements.
   Interaction of vanadium-rich slags with various materials has been
   investigated in order to obtain a better understanding of the impact of
   containment materials on the resulting slag chemistry and viscosity. The
   bulk and phase compositions of two petroleum coke slags in Al2O3, Mo, Pt
   and Ni crucibles produced under different laboratory conditions were
   analysed, and kinetics of slag composition changes at 1400 degrees C
   were determined. Mechanisms of the slag interactions with crucibles are
   described. They involve exchanging of crucible and slag constituents,
   formation of interfaces with distinct compositions, and continuously
   changing phase equilibria in the system. For slag processed in Ni and Pt
   crucibles, reduction of Fe and Ni from oxide to metallic form occurs and
   is followed by dissolution into the crucible materials. Viscosity of
   slags with Mo, Ni and Al2O3 crucibles are determined in the temperature
   range 1200-1500 degrees C. Resulting changes in the bulk composition of
   the processed slag has an impact on the slag viscosity. At given
   temperatures, viscosities of the slags produced in different crucibles
   are different. The impact of crucible materials and their applicability
   in viscosity measurements of high vanadium-containing slags are also
   discussed in order to define the optimal conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Butyl acrylate/acrylic acid/2-hydroxyl methacrylate (BA/AA/HEMA, weight
   ratio: 96/2/2) latexes were produced via starved seeded semi-batch
   emulsion polymerization. The microstructure of the latex polymers was
   controlled by varying the amount of chain transfer agent
   (1-dodecanethiol). The latexes were characterized for gel content, M-c
   (molecular weight between two adjacent cross-linking points), M-w
   (molecular weight of sol polymers) and M-e (molecular weight between
   entanglements). From these latexes, PSA films were cast, dried,
   conditioned and then thermally post-treated at 120 degrees C to react
   the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups from the AA and HEMA units. Tack, peel
   strength and shear strength of the PSA films were then measured. The
   thermal post-treatment was shown to be an effective way to improve
   latex-based PSA performance. The effectiveness of the post-treatment was
   observed to depend on the polymer microstructure (M-c relative to M-e
   relative to M-w) of the untreated latex-based PSAs and on the gel
   content.}},

Volume = {{469}},
Pages = {{53-68}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{We study the computability and complexity of the exploration problem in
   a class of highly dynamic networks: carrier graphs, where the edges
   between sites exist only at some (unknown) times defined by the periodic
   movements of mobile carriers among the sites. These graphs naturally
   model highly dynamic infrastructure-less networks such as public
   transports with fixed timetables, low earth orbiting (LEO) satellite
   systems, security guards' tours, etc. We focus on the opportunistic
   exploration of these graphs, that is by an agent that exploits the
   movements of the carriers to move in the network.
   We establish necessary conditions for the problem to be solved. We also
   derive lower bounds on the amount of time required in general, as well
   as for the carrier graphs defined by restricted classes of carrier
   movements.
   We then prove that the limitations on computability and complexity we
   have established are indeed tight. In fact we prove that all necessary
   conditions are also sufficient and all lower bounds on costs are tight.
   We do so constructively by presenting two optimal solution algorithms,
   one for anonymous systems, and one for those with distinct node IDs.

Abstract = {{A class of nano-scale wavelength-selective optical filters is proposed
   where the core of a metal-insulator-metal square ring is replaced with a
   split-ring core (SRC). The proposed resonator supports
   split-ring-resonator- like (SRR-like) resonant modes that are
   characteristics of the structure. These resonant modes are highly
   adjustable, via the gap size of the split-ring core, over a range of
   hundreds of nanometers. The proposed resonator can also incorporate
   tunable materials localized in the gap of the SRC or placed throughout
   the resonating path. By varying the refractive index (1 to 2) of the
   material in the gap of the SRC, first and second SRR-like modes can be
   tuned over similar to 200 and 300 nm, respectively. A circuit model
   based on transmission-line theory is proposed for the structure and used
   to derive the resonance conditions of the split-ring-resonator-like
   modes; the model compares favorably to the numerical results. The
   proposed resonator has the potential to be utilized effectively in
   integrated nano-scale optical switches and tunable filters. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Straight long-range surface plasmon waveguides are demonstrated as
   biosensors for the detection of cells, proteins and changes in the bulk
   refractive index of solutions. The sensors consist of 5 mu m wide 22 nm
   thick Au stripes embedded in polymer (CYTOP (TM)) with microfluidic
   channels etched into the top cladding. Bulk sensing is demonstrated by
   sequentially injecting six solutions of different refractive indices in
   2 x 10(-3) RIU increments; such index steps were detected with a
   signal-to-noise ratio of similar to 1000. Selective capture of cells is
   demonstrated using Au waveguides functionalized with antibodies against
   blood group A, and red blood cells of group A and O in buffer as
   positive and negative analyte. Bovine serum albumin in buffer was used
   to demonstrate protein sensing. A monolayer of bovine serum albumin
   physisorbed on a carboxyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer on Au was
   detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of similar to 300. Overall, the
   biosensor demonstrated a good capability for detecting bulk changes in
   solution and for sensing analyte over a very wide range of mass (from
   cells to proteins). The biosensors are compact, inexpensive to
   fabricate, and may find use over a wide range of cost-sensitive sensing

Abstract = {{Molecular-reorganization-induced morphology alteration in asymmetric
   substrate-supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) was directly visualized by
   means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and total internal reflection
   fluorescence (TIRE) microscopy. SLB samples were fabricated on
   mica-on-glass and glass substrates by Langmuir-Blodgett
   (LB)/Langmuir-Schaeffer (LS) using binary lipid mixtures, namely,
   1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
   (DOPC)/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and ternary
   mixtures DOPC/DPPC/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS),
   labeled with 0.2 mol \% Texas Red
   1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine triethylammonium
   salt (TR-DHPE) dye. Phase segregations were characterized by TIRE
   imaging, and DPPC-enriched domain structures were also observed.
   Interestingly for similar to 40\% (n = 6) of the samples with binary
   mixtures in the LB leaflet and a single component in the LS leaflet,
   that is, (DOPC/DPPC)(LB)+DOPCLS, the contrast of the DPPC domains
   changed from the original dark (without dye) to bright (more TR dye
   partitioning) on TIRF images, returning to dark again. This contrast
   reverse was also correlated to AFM height images, where a DPPC-DPPC gel
   phase was spotted after the TIRF image contrast returned to dark. The
   rupture force mapping results measured on these binary mixture samples
   also confirmed unambiguously the formation of DPPC-DPPC gel domain
   components during the contrast change. The samples were tracked over 48
   h to investigate the lipid molecule movements in both the DPPC domains
   and the DOPC fluid phase. The fluorescence contrast changes from bright
   to dark in SLBs indicate that the movement of dye molecules was
   independent of the movement of lipid molecules. In addition, correlated
   multimodal imaging using AFM, force mapping, and fluorescence provides a
   novel route to uncover the reorganization of lipid molecules at the
   solid-liquid interface, suggesting that the dynamics of dye molecules is
   highly structure dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-scale materials can be designed to exhibit novel and significantly
   improved physical and chemical properties. Polymer nanofibers, an
   important class of nano-materials, have attracted increasing attention
   in the last 10 years because of their high surface-to-mass (or volume)
   ratio and special characteristics attractive for advanced applications.
   In particular, electro-spun nanofiber membranes (ENMs) have high
   porosity, interconnected open pore structure and tailorable membrane
   thickness. Moreover, their high surface hydrophobicity makes them
   suitable for membrane distillation (MD). In this paper, recent
   progresses are reviewed on the preparation of different types of
   nanofibers with different secondary nanostructures, including hollow
   nanofibers. Applications of hollow nanofibers for membrane separation
   processes are then discussed based on an imaginary design of hollow
   nanofiber module. Application of ENMs in MD is, on the other hand, not a
   product of imagination but experiments have already been conducted in
   various laboratories, as reviewed in this paper. In particular, the
   experimental results obtained in our laboratory for desalination of
   saline water and gases stripping of VOCs are highlighted. By using an
   electrospun PVDF nanofiber membrane, saline water with NaCl content of
   6\% was successfully desalinated for more than 20 days with no
   indication of membrane wetting. The PVDF ENM could also be successfully
   used in gas-stripping of chloroform, representing VOCs, with mass
   transfer coefficients higher than hollow fiber membranes. It is expected
   that MD by ENMs can be applied for many other purposes such as waste
   water treatment, food processing, and treatment of pharmaceutical
   products. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional hip joint center (HJC) calculation involves recording
   movements of femur relative to acetabulum through markers placed on skin
   around thigh and pelvis. This non-invasive method of finding hip joint
   center involves either fitting a geometric sphere onto marker
   trajectories or coordinate transformation techniques which find the
   point with least movement in local frame with respect to global frame. A
   survey study by Ehrig et al has evaluated both categories of formal
   methods through virtual simulation and also contributed another
   algorithm known as ``SCoRE{''} (Systematic center of rotation
   estimation). This algorithm gives an accuracy of 0.5 cm with 20 degree
   range of motion (ROM) and claimed to be most accurate with both segments
   in motion. This paper reviews the studies using this method to calculate
   hip joint center. Also a review of studies using Ultrasound as a
   validation method has been provided. This forms the basis to the

Abstract = {{Multi-instance learning uses a set of bags containing many instances,
   which makes it different from standard propositional classification. Our
   research shows that, similar to the single-instance imbalance problem,
   classification of multi-instance data with imbalanced class
   distributions significantly degrades performance when compared to most
   standard multi-instance algorithms in a balanced setting. Due to the
   inherent differences between multi-instance and single-instance
   learning, the existing solutions for single-instance class imbalance
   problems do not transfer directly to multi-instance datasets. This is a
   drawback, as imbalanced multi-instance problems often occur in data
   mining practice. In this paper, we propose two solution frameworks for
   multi-instance class imbalanced datasets. In the first we explore
   multi-instance data sampling methods, and in the second we present a
   novel generalized version of a multiinstance cost-sensitive boosting
   technique. Experimental results, on benchmark datasets and application
   datasets, show that the proposed frameworks are an effective solution
   for the multiinstance class imbalance problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the application of Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT)
   as a data-based control technique to parameter tuning of linear
   controllers for Multi Input-Multi Output (MIMO) twin rotor systems. The
   azimuth and pitch position control are carried out using a MIMO control
   system structure with two control loops, one for each position, and two
   decoupling controllers. The initial controller design is based on zero
   cross-coupling between the two control loops; therefore, the azimuth and
   pitch controllers are tuned in terms of the Modulus Optimum method and
   the initial transfer functions of the two decoupling controllers are
   zero. An IFT algorithm is applied to tune the four controllers in order
   to ensure the control system performance improvement by the
   experiment-based iterative solving of a model reference tracking
   optimization problem. A set of experimental results is given to show the
   strong performance improvement after few IFT algorithm iterations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of a comprehensive experimental program
   aimed to a better understanding and quantification of tsunami-induced
   forces on inland infrastructure. The experimental program was conducted
   by researchers from the University of Ottawa, Canada, in collaboration
   with the Canadian Hydraulics Centre of the National Research Council in
   Ottawa. The experimental program focuses on the impact of extreme
   hydrodynamic forces on structural elements and mitigation methods that
   are effective in reducing the magnitude of such loads. Two structural
   models (with square and circular cross sections) were subjected to
   simulated tsunami bores. Time-history of pressures, forces, moments,
   lateral displacements and accelerations, in addition to the time-history
   of the bore water surface elevation around the models were recorded.
   Regular and highspeed video cameras were used to capture details of the
   bore-structure interaction. The recorded pressure distribution on the
   upstream face of the model was analyzed in correlation with the
   corresponding inundation depth and the total force recorded using a
   six-degree of freedom load cell. The effect of various configurations of
   a low-height mitigation wall installed upstream from the model on the
   recorded parameters (pressures and forces) was also investigated. The
   measured force included the following components: impulse (surge), runup
   and hydrodynamic forces due to the sequential bore loading. The results
   of different test configurations are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In light wood frame buildings, diaphragm flexibility influences the load
   distribution between shear walls under lateral load induced by
   earthquake or wind action, which is important for structural design. A
   multiple spring model with the ability to represent the
   load-transferring behaviour of this complex lateral load resisting
   system of light wood frame buildings was developed. The developed model
   was validated with results from the more sophisticated model, spring
   deep-beam model. The lateral load distribution between shear walls with
   various stiffness ratios of diaphragm to shear wall was also
   investigated. Based on preliminary findings from this study, contrary to
   common belief, the forces transferred by a semi-rigid diaphragm to the
   supporting shear walls, may be higher than those predicted by flexible
   and rigid diaphragm assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are emerging as promising tools to aid
   in monitoring the smart grid. WSNs can be easily deployed in a wide
   number of smart grid assets such as substations, overhead power lines
   and power generation sites. They offer ubiquity and flexibility at a
   low-cost. However it may be difficult to offer the Quality of Service
   (QoS) demanded by the smart grid applications with WSNs since sensor
   nodes share the same wireless communication medium. To overcome this
   challenge QoS-aware medium access is essential. In this paper, we
   propose the QoS-aware GTS Allocation (QGA) scheme which aims to reduce
   the end-to-end delay of delay-critical data while routing delay-tolerant
   data using unutilized resources. QGA is implemented for a multi-hop,
   mesh network topology which is the most flexible WSN deployment. In QGA
   intermediate level sensor nodes run an optimization model in order to
   perform optimum time slot allocation to minimize the delay of critical
   data. Meanwhile, delay-tolerant data is buffered until the
   delay-critical traffic passes through this relaying node. Smart grid
   monitoring application determined whether data is delay-critical or not
   based on the alarm values. For instance, a transformer overloading
   measurement is treated as delay-critical while an ambient measurement
   corresponding to room temperature is treated as delay-tolerant. We show
   that QGA significantly reduces the end-to-end delay of high priority
   traffic.}},

Abstract = {{The smart grid, generally referred to as the next generation power
   electric system, relies on robust information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) to provide efficient, secure, and reliable
   information delivery. The implementation of the smart grid includes the
   deployment of multiple new infrastructures with vulnerabilities that
   have not yet been identified. Therefore, the traditional focus on
   security, reliability, compliance, and human safety is a paramount
   concern. This paper first addresses critical issues of smart grid
   primarily in terms of ICTs and standards. A risk-based approach has been
   presented, which could be implemented to address the security aspects
   and health impact of the smart grid. The paper evaluates the security
   threats to the smart grid as well as the health risks of smart meters
   currently under implementation in the context of radio frequency (RF)
   radiation. Finally, a combined framework for risk management in major
   technological and health domains has been proposed. Such a framework
   calls for a coordinated assessment of cyber and power grid risks keeping
   the whole grid security and safety goals in mind.}},

Abstract = {{Plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have been recently introduced
   as environmentally friendly and fuel economic vehicles. It is believed
   that they will be widely adopted in the coming years, which puts the
   resilience of the electric grid in question. The large amount of
   electricity drawn by simultaneously charging multiple PHEVs can cause
   electric overloads which will either destroy grid components or shorten
   the equipment's life expectancy. In this paper, we propose a smart PHEVs
   charging algorithm to efficiently manage random and uncontrolled PHEV
   charging. The algorithm is based on a modified regret matching procedure
   that leads to a set of correlated equilibrium. A game theoretic approach
   is used to formulate the PHEV charging problem into a game where the
   players are the PHEVs and the strategies are their charging schedules.
   The proposed algorithm preserves users' privacy in terms of charging
   schedules and does not incur much overhead on the system. Simulation
   results show that proposed algorithm achieves high saving in terms of
   the total energy costs, individual costs, and flattens the overall
   charging load. The algorithm is also scalable and converges in an
   acceptable time.}},

   minimization of objective functions expressed as integrals of squared
   modeling errors. The variables of the objective functions are the limits
   of the supports of the input membership functions and the kernels of
   these membership functions are kept constant. SA algorithms are
   implemented to solve the optimization problems which yield optimal TSK
   fuzzy models. A set of real-time experimental results for a laboratory
   nonlinear servo system validates the new optimal TSK fuzzy models.}},

Abstract = {{Recommender Systems have been applied in a large number of domains.
   However, current approaches rarely consider multiple criteria or the
   level of mobility and location of a user. In this paper, we introduce a
   novel algorithm to construct personalized multi-criteria Recommender
   Systems. Our algorithm incorporates the user's current context, and
   techniques from the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis field of study
   to model user preferences. The obtained preference model is used to
   assess the utility of each item, to then recommend the items with the
   highest utility. The criteria considered when creating preference models
   are the user location, mobility level and user profile. The latter is
   obtained considering the user requirements, and generalizing the user
   data from a large-scale demographic database. The evaluation of our
   algorithm shows that our system accurately identifies the demographic
   groups where a user may belong, and generates highly accurate
   recommendations that match his/her preference value scale.}},

   difficult decisions on the direction of care of their infant with the

   allocation of resources, and reduction of the negative outcomes. The
   tool underwent a usability study with 8 parents whose infant survived
   the NICU stay and 5 neonatologists. Both parents and physicians thought
   the tool was easy to use, useful, and would help improve team
   communication. The next usability study will be with parents whose
   infant died while in the NICU, and then conduct a randomized prospective
   study with parents who have a sick infant admitted to the NICU.}},

Abstract = {{The Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) holds promises for on-road security
   applications. In this paper, we utilize the VANET for surveillance
   purpose, tracking a noncooperative mobile target. We explore the
   possibilities of engaging Onboard Units (OBUs) and Roadside Units (RSUs)
   in a metropolitan VANET for tracking a vehicle that is on the run. The
   uncertainty associated with the unplanned locomot ion of a vehicle in
   the metropolitan road network, that exhibits dynamic characteristics,
   such as different speed limits and time varying traffic congestion,
   makes vehicle tracking challenging. We present a tracking system
   composed of three operational modules: localization, tracking data
   collection and prediction of future locations of a target. Tracking
   messages are communicated among the OBUs and RSUs and are triggered on
   in probable areas where the target may be present. Therefore, another
   imperative element of the addressed problem is to scope the search to
   limit the number of OBUs and RSUs involved in the tracking operation.
   Our proposal does not presume any motion model for the target. A novel
   movement modeling technique utilizes OBU observations to classify the
   target's movement pat tern. We propose a Dirichlet-multinomial model
   under the Bayesian estimation framework. The movement estimation is then
   exploited for predicting future locations of the target. The proposed
   method is analogous to chasing an on the run vehicle using police squad
   cars. We believe this approach holds potentials as an alternative to
   high-speed pursuits.}},

Abstract = {{Optimum ordering strategies for the coded V-BLAST with capacity
   achieving temporal codes on each stream are analytically studied in this
   paper, including optimal power and/or rate allocations among data
   streams. A compact closed-form solution is obtained for the case of two
   transmit antennas and necessary optimality conditions are found for the
   general case. The optimal rate allocation is shown to have a major
   impact (stronger streams are detected last) while the optimal power
   allocation does not alter the original Foschini ordering (stronger
   streams are detected first). A sub-optimal ordering is proposed based on

Abstract = {{Gesture Control dominates presently the research on new human computer
   interfaces. The domain covers both the sensors to capture gestures and
   also the driver software which interprets the gesture mapping it onto a
   robust command. More recently, there is a trend to use depth-mapping
   camera as the 2D cameras fall short in assuring the conditions of
   real-time robustness of the whole system. As image processing is at the
   core of the detection, recognition, and tracking the gesture, depth
   mapping sensors have to provide a depth image insensitive to
   illumination conditions. Thus depth-mapping cameras work in a certain
   wavelength of the infrared (IR) spectrum. In this paper, a novel
   real-time depth-mapping principle for an IR camera is introduced. The
   new IR camera architecture comprises an illuminator module which is
   pulse-modulated via a monotonic function using a cycle driven feedback
   loop for the control of laser intensity, while the reflected infrared
   light is captured in ``slices{''} of the space in which the object of
   interest is situated. A reconflgurable hardware architecture unit
   calculates the depth slices and combines them in a depth-map of the
   object to be further used in the detection, tracking, and recognition of
   the gesture made by the user. Images of real objects are reconstructed
   in 3D based on the data obtained by the space-slicing technique, and a
   corresponding image processing algorithm builds the 3D map of the object
   in real-time. As this paper will show through a series of experiments,
   the camera can be used in a variety of domains, including for gesture
   control of 3D objects in virtual environments.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid growth in space missions necessitates the onboard intelligence,
   which creates autonomous space systems by providing high level decision
   making, robust execution of decisions, and automatic fault repairing.
   Mostly, autonomous space systems are implemented as hybrid architectures
   with a few conceptual layers. Validating the stability and evaluating
   the performance of an autonomous architecture is critical for space
   missions. Software in the loop simulation is a suitable approach for
   addressing this demand. However, the data acquired from simulation is
   represented as alphanumeric values or diagrams, which needs to be
   interpreted. In this paper, we propose an intelligent architecture to
   provide onboard autonomy for an observation micro-satellite. The
   architecture integrates the low level physical actions with conceptual
   decision making ability in a hierarchical manner. To evaluate the
   proposed architecture, we have implemented a distributed software in the
   loop simulation to simulate the space, satellite, ground stations, and
   intelligent onboard software. Moreover, for the first time, we have used
   virtual reality to visualize the satellite's autonomous behavior in the
   orbit. It lets the users have a high level feedback from integrated
   simulation. Scenario-based evaluations have shown the stability and
   efficiency of the proposed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a risk-aware robotic sensor network (RSN) is proposed in
   the context of Critical Infrastructure Protection. Such a network will
   be comprised of mobile sensor nodes that perceive various aspects of
   their environment and topologically reconfigure in order to secure a
   strategic area of interest. Risk awareness is provided through the
   application of a recently developed Risk Management Framework to the
   RSN. The risk level of each node is assessed in terms of their degree of
   distress, proximity factor, and terrain maneuverability. Risk monitoring
   alerts are issued whenever any given sensor node's quantitative risk
   metric exceeds a user-defined threshold value. At this point, a
   node-in-distress (NID) has been identified as the weak point of the
   securing structure around which the RSN is deployed. The NID can no
   longer be used with confidence and the effective perimeter coverage of
   the RSN has been reduced, thus creating potential security breaches in
   the area of interest. In response, the remaining nodes will
   self-organize to maximize the perimeter coverage while minimizing the
   cost of doing so. A limited set of contingency network topologies is
   produced via evolutionary multi-objective optimization using the
   Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and then ranked
   according to a human-guided alternative selection algorithm. The
   security operator picks the most suitable topology, which is then
   effectuated upon the environment. Results indicate that NSGA-II is
   capable of producing feasible network topologies to satisfy maximum
   perimeter coverage, while reducing the energy required for topology
   reconfiguration. As far as we are concerned, this is the first time a
   RSN applied to a CIP scenario is self-organized in response to a risk
   analysis conducted on every sensor node on the basis of multiple risk
   features.}},

   with its relatively simple design approach. The solution carries out the
   on-line adaptation of a single parameter of the input membership
   functions of a Takagi-Sugeno PI-fuzzy controller with input integration
   (T-S PI-FC-II) by a single neuron trained by back propagation with

   functions is tuned by the modal equivalence principle. Linear matrix
   inequalities are proposed as sufficient stability conditions to be
   fulfilled by the parameters of the rule consequents of the T-S PI-FC-II
   in order to guarantee the stable design of the hybrid T-S PI-N-FC. The
   solution is validated by a case study using a set of three process

Abstract = {{The paper presents a study on the behavior of some control solutions for
   electric drive systems evolving in conditions of reference, disturbance
   and parameter variability. The results of this study substantiate new
   control solutions that ensure the possibility to avoid the worst cases.
   The study addresses the real situation of an electric drive system with
   continuously variable reference input (speed), variable moment of
   inertia and variable load disturbance. Two control structures with
   controllers with fixed parameters are considered and discussed with
   focus on the speed control loop. The justified new control structures
   employ the switching between several control algorithms; their design is
   based on the detailed mathematical model of the plant and on the
   particular features of the drive system. The solutions are validated by
   means of digital simulations and experiments on a laboratory equipment
   application for three values of the moment of inertia.}},

Abstract = {{We present the continuum model of a robot inspired by organisms like
   centipedes and polychaete worms. The continuum model is obtained as the
   limit of a rigid body chain with pinned elements, which leads to a
   Timoshenko beam model that is described by a one dimensional continuum
   with local Euclideian structure. The local Euclideian structure models
   the cross sections that are kinematically described by their position
   and orientation. The leg structures in the biological systems are
   modeled in the continuum limit as a distribution of compliant elements.
   Modal properties of the system are investigated. The compliance of the
   legs can be exploited for sensing purposes with specific application to
   the reconstruction of the surrounding environment and to the estimation
   of physical properties. The class of models in this papers applies to
   the continuum description of several emerging robotic application that
   range from tools for exploration in hazardous or generally not
   accessible environments (to humans) to novel healthcare systems as for
   example endoscopic tools for diagnostic in the gastrointestinal tract.}},

   investigate the performance of specified modulation and coding schemes
   in additive white Gaussian noise channel and realistic 60 GHz band

   orthogonal frequency division multiplex physical layer, Single Carrier
   and Low Power Single carrier physical layer, are designed and evaluated
   in terms of bit error rate and packet error rate performances.
   Simulation results show that single carrier modes in most cases
   outperforms OFDM modes in LOS and NLOS scenarios. QAM based modulation
   schemes are sensitive to marginal channel conditions and provide poor
   performance in NLOS case, while BPSK and QPSK modulation schemes with
   low density parity coding are relatively more robust, and present a good

Abstract = {{The protein docking problem refers to the task of predicting the
   appropriate matching of one protein molecule (the receptor) to another
   (the ligand), when attempting to bind them to form a stable complex.
   Research shows that matching the three-dimensional geometric structures
   of proteins plays a key role in determining a so-called docking pair.
   However, the active sites which are responsible for the binding do not
   always present a rigid-body shape matching problem. Rather, they may
   undergo deformations when docking occurs, which complicates the process.
   To address this issue, we present an isometry-invariant and
   topologically robust partial shape descriptor method for finding
   complementary protein sites. Our method employs Heat Kernel Signature
   shape descriptors which are based on the diffusion of heat on surfaces.
   Our experimental results against the Protein-Protein Benchmark 4.0
   demonstrate the viability of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{A typical scenario for multi-view 3D consists of several 3D video
   sequences captured simultaneously from the same scene with the help of
   multiple cameras from different positions and through different angles.
   Due to the extremely high bandwidth of multi-view/3D video, rate control
   is one of the key factors influencing its quality. In this paper, we
   investigate the impacts of multi-view/3D video characteristics on the
   bit rate of a compressed video and we propose an analytical view-level
   rate model for multi-view video coding. Our rate model takes into
   account both previous theoretical results as well as new results
   specifically obtained for multi-view video and confirmed by
   comprehensive practical experiments. These new results reveal a close
   relationship between the rate of each view and consequently the
   perceived quality by users, available bandwidth and processing power.
   Simulation results indicate that our model can predict the rate of each
   view with relatively high precision and a low estimation error of 20\%
   on average.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an approach to the Simulated Annealing (SA)-based
   optimization of fuzzy models for magnetic levitation systems. The
   unstable and nonlinear processes are first linearized at nine operating

   structure. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models are obtained by the
   modal equivalence principle in terms of placing the local SFCS
   state-space models in the rule consequents. The optimization problems
   are defined aiming the minimization of objective functions expressed as
   the squared modeling errors, and the variables of these functions are a
   part of the parameters of the input membership functions. SA algorithms
   are involved in solving the optimization problems which give optimal T-S
   fuzzy models. A set of real-time experimental results validates the
   fuzzy modeling approach and the new optimal T-S fuzzy models for

Abstract = {{This paper presents applicative aspects concerning the modeling,
   simulation, analysis and design of control solutions for a direct
   current electric drive system with continuously variable reference input
   (speed), variable moment of inertia and variable load disturbance. Two
   variable control structures for speed control are treated. The
   structures employ the switching between three or more control
   algorithms, and their design is based on the detailed mathematical model
   of the plant and on the particular features of the drive system.
   Conventional and fuzzy control solutions are offered as they are
   advantageous with respect to the continuous parameter adaptation because
   of the simplicity in adaptation at representative operating points. The
   solutions are validated by a digitally simulated application with fixed
   parameters and tested on a strip winding system laboratory equipment as
   a representative mechatronics system application.}},

Abstract = {{As the demand for field mobile robots in off-road operations increased,
   the need to investigate the 3D motion for mobile robots became
   important. One of the main difficulties in the 3D motion of a mobile
   robot is the torque saturation of the DC motors of the wheels that
   occurs while climbing hills. In the present work, off-road conditions
   are utilized to benefit by avoiding torque saturation. Energy
   optimization algorithm using predictive control is implemented on a
   two-DC motor-driven wheels mobile robot while crossing a ditch. The
   developed algorithm is simulated and compared with the PID control and
   the open-loop control. The predictive control showed more capability to
   avoid torque saturation and noticeable reduction in the energy
   consumption. Furthermore, using the wheels motors armature current
   instead of the supply voltage as control variable in the predictive
   control showed more robust speed control. Simulation results showed that
   in case of knowing the ditch dimensions ahead of time, the developed
   algorithm is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Businesses are always looking for opportunities to improve their
   processes in order to become more efficient and effective. Patterns for
   business process improvement have been defined and used as best
   practices to help analysts discover such opportunities. A modeling
   language allowing analysts to define or use a predefined library of
   improvement patterns to detect improvement opportunities in business
   processes can be of a significant value. Based on a comprehensive set of
   improvement patterns from the literature, this paper defines the
   requirements for a modeling language to support a framework capable of
   defining and detecting such patterns. We use an example from the retail
   industry to motivate the collected requirements. The paper's
   contributions allow us to capture more sophisticated business process
   improvement patterns, bringing us one step closer to a comprehensive
   model-driven, aspect-oriented business process modeling language.
   Furthermore, the collected requirements for the desired modeling
   language clearly indicate that currently popular business process
   modeling languages are not yet capable of capturing all the required
   details for business process improvement patterns on a broad scale.}},

   for publishing longitudinal health data. Longitudinal health data
   contain valuable clinical information about patients collected over time
   and there is an increasing demand to use these data in medical and
   clinical research. However, since longitudinal health data contain
   personal information, improper release and usage of such data may
   violate privacy of patients. In this paper, we study the challenges of
   publishing longitudinal health data and propose a privacy notion, called
   (K, C)(P)-privacy, together with a hybrid anonymization algorithm. This
   work is the first attempt to anonymize multidimensional longitudinal
   data to prevent both identity disclosure and attribute disclosure.
   Experimental results on the synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness
   of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing concept re-engineers the Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT) business by enabling on-demand and self-automated
   access to shared resources, and offers software, platform and
   infrastructure as services to the cloud users. As computing and storage
   facilities migrate to a shared pool of resources which are mainly hosted
   in the data centers, the traffic intensity in the backbone is expected
   to increase tremendously. Consequently, power consumption of the network
   equipment, as well as the data centers, is expected to increase the
   operational costs of the network and data center operators. In this
   paper, we present possible solutions to reduce the operational costs of
   the operators via virtualization of an IP over WDM backbone network with
   optical bypass in the presence of dynamic electricity pricing. Based on
   the cyber-physical properties of the data centers and look-ahead demand
   profile of the cloud-based services, virtualization of the optical
   backbone network is reconfigured in order to accommodate all demands
   with the objective of minimum operational cost for the network and data
   center operators. Through simulations, we show that efficient
   utilization and reconfiguration of the optical backbone enables
   cost-efficient and sustainable cloud communications.}},

Abstract = {{As of today's current communication system, all Fire Fighters (FFs) use
   the simplex Radio Frequency (RF) system (walkie-talkie) to communicate
   with each other. Serious problems and injuries can occur because of the
   current communications system; so far, very little attention has been
   dedicated to solve these problems. Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) are
   infrastructure-less and self-organized wireless networks. MANETs are
   suitable for the hosting of a wide range of applications in emergency
   situations, such as natural or human-induced disasters, and military and
   commercial settings. This paper focuses on building a new communication
   system for FFs and provides them with new functions on the fire ground,
   e. g. conferencing audio and video. The limitations of the current
   communication system are determined, and the requirements are derived. A
   cluster-based signaling architecture supporting Audio/Video
   Conferencing/Sub-conferencing has been proposed. The proposed
   architecture implementation using SIP is also presented along with the
   performance evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous acquisition of depth and texture information, such as that
   provided by RGB-D sensors, finds an ever increasing number of
   applications, including objects modeling, human-machine interfaces, and
   robot navigation. One of the challenges resulting from the use of
   densely populated 3D datasets originates from the massive acquisition,
   management and processing of the data generated. This reality often
   preempts full usage of the information available for autonomous systems
   to make educated decisions. Current methods for reducing dataset's
   dimension remain independent from the content of the model and therefore
   do not optimize the balance between the richness of the measurements and
   their compression. This paper presents two computational methods to
   selectively drive the selection of depth measurements over the most
   significant regions of a scene, characterized by their 3D features
   distribution, while capitalizing on the knowledge readily available in
   previously acquired depth data. One of the methods builds on
   self-organizing neural networks, namely neural gas, while the second one
   computes an empirical improvement metric. Both techniques are adapted to
   automatically establish which subset of depth measurements within a
   range sensor's field of view contribute most to the representation of
   the scene, and therefore streamline the depth measurements acquisition
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Patient wait times and care service times are key performance measures
   for care processes in hospitals. Managing the quality of care delivered
   by these processes in real-time is challenging. A key challenge is to
   correlate source medical events to infer the care process states that
   define patient wait times and care service times. Commercially available
   complex event processing engines do not have built in support for the
   concept of care process state. This makes it unnecessarily complex to
   define and maintain rules for inferring states from source medical
   events in a care process. In this paper, we introduce a state monitoring
   engine for inferring and managing states based on an application model
   for care process monitoring. The research is validated with a case study
   developed in collaboration with a large community hospital.}},

Abstract = {{Improving care processes in healthcare institutions relies on
   effectively monitoring and making timely decisions for improving patient
   experience. Business Intelligence solutions have proven to be effective
   for monitoring processes in other industries. However, healthcare
   organizations face three challenges for implementing Business
   Intelligence solutions that effectively monitor care processes. First,
   the great variation of processes in healthcare domain makes it difficult
   to model them. Second, there is a gap between abstract administrative
   indicators and fine-grained operation-level measures of healthcare
   processes. Finally, it is difficult to reuse the underlying healthcare
   processes used for other successful solutions. In this paper, we present
   a Care Process Metamodel geared towards modeling healthcare processes.
   This metamodel (a) provides a platform for creating uniform care
   processes, (b) enables hierarchical care processes for modeling of
   composite processes as well as bridging the gap between abstract
   performance indicators and operation-level measures of healthcare
   processes, and (c) facilitates reusing the processes and the data
   structures required for monitoring them. This metamodel thus addresses
   some of the challenges for implementing successful Business Intelligence
   care process monitoring solutions for healthcare organizations. We also
   demonstrate how the Care Process Metamodel-based processes fit into an
   architecture, where data collected about encounters of patients can be
   used by stakeholders for improving the process and its execution. We use
   samples of cardiac-related processes to illustrate our approach.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with control solutions for an electric drive system
   where the reference and the load disturbance are continuously variable
   and the plant has variable parameters. The main variable parameter of
   the process is the moment of inertia in the context of a system that
   corresponds to laboratory equipment. Using a detailed mathematical model
   of the process and the particular features of the drive system, the
   paper proposes variable control structures with switching between three
   or more control algorithms. This solution is preferred instead of a
   continuously parameter adaptation due to its simplicity in adaptation to
   the representative operating points. The control design results are
   focused on development of two-degree-of-freedom PID control solutions.
   The control solutions are applied in case studies based on digital
   simulation but, considering fixed values of the process parameters, they
   can be easily verified on laboratory equipment {[}1]. The proposed
   control solutions have a large applicability in the field of
   mechatronics systems, where such applications with variable moment of
   inertia and control system inputs are always present.}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction Gesture Control technology in the electronic
   gaming technology a series of attempts have been made to deploy it also
   on other domains such as robotics, teaching, medical, automotive and
   many others. Human gesture used for Man-Machine Interaction became
   attractive as it offers a simpler way of controlling sophisticated
   devices, in a sci-fi-like scenario, in return of an increasingly
   computational power required by the artificial intelligence algorithms
   needed to detect, track and recognize them. There have been attempts to
   bring a solution to it by using 2D or 3D based image processing methods.
   There is a clear balance incline towards 3D methods in the consumer
   product as besides the almost insurmountable difficulties for producing
   robust and stable results, the price constraint added supplementary
   hurdles. As perfect illumination conditions are core factors in
   obtaining the above results, the infrared light was unanimously adopted
   by the domain technologies.
   In this paper, a novel real-time depth-mapping principle and a
   corresponding hardware solution for an IR depth-mapping camera is
   introduced. The new IR camera architecture comprises an illuminator
   module which is pulsed and modulated via a monotonic function using a
   phase-locked loop control for the laser intensity, while the reflected
   infrared light is captured during the increasing and decreasing
   monotonic function. A reconfigurable hardware architecture (RHA) unit
   calculates the depth and controls the IR waves in synchronism with the
   infrared sensor. The resolution of the depth map is variable depending
   on the resolution and gating possibilities of the image sensor. A sensor
   of 1 megapixel is used, providing a resolution of 1024x1024. Images of
   real objects are reconstructed in 3D based on the data obtained by the
   laser controlled by the RHA. A corresponding image processing algorithm
   builds the 3D map of the object in real-time. In this paper the camera
   is used to control consumer electronic products such as TV sets, laptops
   and others.}},

   not possess basic knowledge regarding haptics, to add and modify haptic

   well-described haptic-enabled web application with 3D graphics in a

Abstract = {{This paper presents a compact microstrip-fed ultrawideband (UWB) antenna
   and its four-element array design for target detection applications. A
   prototype was fabricated and then measured based on optimal parameters.
   There is good consistency between the simulated S11 and the measured
   one. In addition, a 1 x 4 linear array design with the size of 100 mm x
   34 mm has been proposed to achieve a higher gain. Simulation shows that
   the array gain is increased about 6 dBi in comparison to the single
   element through the whole UWB frequency range of 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz.
   The proposed array has an average of 15 dB side lobe level (SLL) in the
   mentioned range. And also, a 23 dB SLL has been achieved by applying
   Dolph-Chebyshev amplitude distribution at 6 GHz. Simulation results
   confirm that the antenna exhibits a constant bidirectional radiation
   pattern with a high and flat gain in case of the array design.}},

Abstract = {{Multimedia surveillance systems in this age are equipped with
   heterogeneous sensors such as cameras, motion sensors, sound sensors,
   and RFID in order to provide a sense of safety and security to the
   people. However, due to the potential of being exposed, many people are
   increasingly being reluctant to be electronically monitored and suffer
   from privacy loss. Therefore, it is desirable to have privacy
   preservation (i.e. hiding people's face) mechanism in the surveillance
   system as best as possible without compromising usual surveillance
   tasks. This paper proposes the design of a secure privacy vault to
   conceal privacy-sensitive data obtained from different visual sensors.
   It also studies the different privacy leakage channels in the video
   surveillance context and shows how the proposed solution helps to
   mitigate the potential privacy leakage problems at different levels of
   the leakage channels. It is envisioned that the proposed approach will
   stand as an improved approach to privacy preservation in multimedia
   surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{Acquisition of depth and texture with vision sensors finds numerous
   applications for objects modeling, man-machine interfaces, or robot
   navigation. One challenge resulting from rich textured 3D datasets
   resides in the acquisition, management and processing of the large
   amount of data generated, which often preempts full usage of the
   information available for autonomous systems to make educated decisions.
   Most subsampling solutions to reduce dataset's dimension remain
   independent from the content of the model and therefore do not optimize
   the balance between the richness of the measurements and their
   compression. This paper experimentally evaluates the performance
   achieved with two computational methods that selectively drive the
   acquisition of depth measurements over regions of a scene characterized
   by higher 3D features density, while capitalizing on the knowledge
   readily available in previously acquired data. Both techniques
   automatically establish which subsets of measurements contribute most to
   the representation of the scene, and prioritize their acquisition. The
   algorithms are validated on datasets acquired from two different RGB-D
   sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Malfunctions in a working robot system are serious factors which can
   result in deviations from the desired goals. Among these, temperature
   increase over safe values is one of the most important factors that can
   limit the usage of available energy. The heat generated from motors and
   batteries can damage the electrical systems and affect the overall
   performance. This results in the need to control and maximize the
   utilization of supplied energy from batteries. In this paper, the
   authors designed an intelligent system to control temperature thus
   preventing system malfunction due to overheating in insulated robots,
   such as underwater robots. This temperature controller works in parallel
   with the robot motion controller. The proposed temperature control
   system uses fuzzy logic as a control layer system. It has been adopted
   to avoid system errors and efficiently use the energy available. The
   system is developed using fans, heaters and fuzzy logic circuits for
   achieving an energy efficient robot with long-term high performance.}},

Abstract = {{To initiate our simulations of canine left ventricle (LV) mechanics, we
   needed to specify an initial geometry and an initial wall stress
   distribution. Although there are sufficient measurements of LV
   geometries, there are no assessments of stresses under any conditions.
   To estimate a physiologically plausible range of stresses at end
   diastole, we have inflated an unloaded reference geometry using static
   pressure loads. The LV was modelled as a six-layered truncated prolate
   ellipsoid. The myocardium was defined as a slightly compressible,
   transversely isotropic, hyperelastic material. The reference LV was
   inflated statically by gradually increasing the pressure on its inner
   surface until an end-diastolic state was reached. The calculated
   dependence of normalized LV volume changes on the applied pressure was
   in good agreement with previous experimental results. Our calculated
   geometry was found to be comparable to previous measurements. The
   end-diastolic stresses were found to have complex variations, which
   cannot be determined by adopting an ad hoc stress-free, end-diastolic
   geometry. The calculated geometry and stress distribution are deemed to
   be suitable for use as initial states for cardiac cycle simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an ``anti-fatigue{''} control method for
   bionic actuated systems. Specifically, the proposed method is
   illustrated on an over-actuated bionic arm. Our control method consists
   of two steps. In the first step, a set of linear equations is derived by
   connecting the acceleration description in both joint and muscle space.
   The pseudo inverse solution to these equations provides an initial
   optimal muscle force distribution. As a second step, we derive a
   gradient direction for muscle force redistribution. This allows the
   muscles to satisfy force constraints and generate an even distribution
   of forces throughout all the muscles (i.e. towards ``anti-fatigue{''}).
   The overall proposed method is tested for a bending-stretching movement.
   We used two models (bionic arm with 6 and 10 muscles) to verify the
   method. The force distribution analysis verifies the ``anti-fatigue{''}
   property of the computed muscle force. The efficiency comparison shows
   that the computational time does not increase significantly with the
   increase of muscle number. The tracking error statistics of the two
   models show the validity of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical evaluation of research tools is growing especially in the
   field of software engineering. A number of research techniques have been
   proposed and used in evaluating research prototypes. We take the view
   that evaluation of software engineering tools is best achieved in
   industrial settings, with real life artifacts and tasks, and with
   professional software engineers. However, the feasibility of such
   evaluation is limited for many reasons. Some challenges are related to
   the prototypes under study, others are related to the industrial
   environments where the need to meet business requirements take
   precedence on experimenting with new tools and techniques.
   In this paper, we summarize our experiences in evaluating a research
   prototype tool using a grounded theory study, a questionnaire, and a
   controlled experiment. We discuss the challenges that hindered our
   industrial evaluation and share ideas on how to overcome these
   challenges. We propose an action research study where the research tool
   is used by a small number of experienced professionals in an industrial

Abstract = {{Regulations are a source of evolving requirements for products and

   regulations, they increasingly adopt legislation performance modeling,
   at the basis of regulatory intelligence. In this context, performance
   modeling refers to the measuring of important business aspects in a
   coordinated manner and the use of these measurements for improved

   regulations that may be still prescriptive rather than outcome-based.
   The process of turning the underlying textual legislation into a formal
   performance model that can be assessed by Business Intelligence (BI)
   tools is complicated due to organizational, cultural, and technological
   reasons. In this paper, we present a methodology from a technical
   perspective that enables regulatory institutions to reason about

   demonstrate the methodology using traffic law as an example regulation,
   jUCMNav for performance modeling, and IBM Cognos for BI reporting.}},

   has grown in the regulatory community. In this context, performance
   modeling refers to the measuring of important business aspects in a

   when expressing and analyzing performance models. Since most regulations
   are still written in natural language, support for the transformation of

   regulators and regulated parties to keep working with familiar natural
   language regulations and to use goal models indirectly while avoiding a
   potentially significant learning curve for goal-modeling techniques. In
   this paper, we present such a tool-supported transformation to goal
   models expressed with the User Requirements Notation that enables
   reasoning about outcome-based regulations via widely available
   evaluation mechanism for goal models. The transformation is implemented
   in the jUCMNav goal modeling tool and illustrated with an example from

Abstract = {{Local spatio-temporal features and bag-of-features representations have
   become popular for action recognition. A recent trend is to use dense
   sampling for better performance. While many methods claimed to use dense
   feature sets, most of them are just denser than approaches based on
   sparse interest point detectors. In this paper, we explore sampling with
   high density on action recognition. We also investigate the impact of
   random sampling over dense grid for computational efficiency. We present
   a real-time action recognition system which integrates fast random
   sampling method with local spatio-temporal features extracted from a
   Local Part Model. A new method based on histogram intersection kernel is
   proposed to combine multiple channels of different descriptors. Our
   technique shows high accuracy on the simple KTH dataset, and achieves
   state-of-the-art on two very challenging real-world datasets, namely,
   93\% on KTH, 83.3\% on UCF50 and 47.6\% on HMDB51.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for the automatic detection and fast 3D
   profiling of lateral body panels of vehicles. The work introduces a
   method to integrate raw streams from depth sensors in the task of 3D
   profiling and reconstruction and a methodology for the extrinsic
   calibration of a network of Kinect sensors. This sensing framework is
   intended for rapidly providing a robot with enough spatial information
   to interact with automobile panels using various tools. When a vehicle
   is positioned inside the defined scanning area, a collection of
   reference parts on the bodywork are automatically recognized from a
   mosaic of color images collected by a network of Kinect sensors
   distributed around the vehicle and a global frame of reference is set
   up. Sections of the depth information on one side of the vehicle are
   then collected, aligned, and merged into a global RGB-D model. Finally,
   a 3D triangular mesh modelling the body panels of the vehicle is
   automatically built. The approach has applications in the intelligent
   transportation industry, automated vehicle inspection, quality control,
   automatic car wash systems, automotive production lines, and scan
   alignment and interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we review a blind musical-noise-free speech extraction
   method using a microphone array that can be applied to nonstationary
   noise. In our previous study, it was found that optimized iterative
   spectral subtraction (SS) results in speech enhancement with almost no
   musical noise generation, but this method is valid only for stationary
   noise. The proposed method consists of iterative blind dynamic noise
   estimation by, e.g., ICA or multichannel Wiener filtering, and
   musical-noise-free speech extraction by modified iterative SS, where
   multiple iterative SS is applied to each channel while maintaining the
   multichannel property reused for the dynamic noise estimators. Also,
   related to the proposed method, we discuss the justification of applying
   ICA to such signals nonlinearly distorted by SS. From objective and
   subjective evaluations simulating real-world hands-free speech
   communication system, we reveal that the proposed method outperforms the
   conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that the low-power ZigBee based wireless
   sensor networks (WSN) are vulnerable to the interference of Wi-Fi
   wireless local area networks (WLAN). From our experimental studies on
   this coexistence issue, it is found that there are a large number of
   acknowledgement (ACK) packet losses in the ZigBee packet transmission
   process, which, in turn, generates large number of unnecessary packet
   retransmissions, wasting precious channel bandwidth and energy. To
   address this issue, in this paper, a novel technique named ACK with
   Interference Detection (ACK-ID) that can effectively reduce the ACK
   losses and consequently reduce ZigBee packet retransmissions is proposed
   and implemented in the Crossbow MICAz motes of our testbed. The
   experimental performance evaluation results show that the proposed
   ACK-ID can significantly improve the performance of ZigBee packet
   transmission in terms of ACK delivery rate and packet retransmission
   rate while operating under interference from the collocated WLAN.}},

Abstract = {{Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), a multiple
   user access scheme based on the single carrier frequency domain
   equalization (SC-FDE) technique, has been proposed for the uplink in
   fourth generation (4G) mobile communications. SC-FDE requires reliable
   channel estimates to maintain an acceptable bit error rate (BER)
   performance. Much research focuses on the use of pilot symbols which
   reduces the spectral efficiency of SC-FDE systems. In this paper, we
   propose a subspace decomposition approach for semi-blind channel
   estimation in SC-FDE systems as a means to reduce or eliminate the need
   for pilot symbols and increase their overall spectral efficiency.
   Simulation results show that, under the conditions presented in this
   paper, a BER of 10(-3) can be achieved with a power loss of roughly 1 dB
   compared to a system with perfect channel estimates. This result is
   achieved with channel estimates that have a normalized mean square error
   (NMSE) less than 1\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an auction-based node selection technique is considered
   for a risk-aware Robotic Sensor Network (RSN) applied to Critical
   Infrastructure Protection (CIP). The goal of this risk-aware RSN is to
   maintain a secure perimeter around the CIP, which is best maintained by
   detecting high-risk network events and mitigate them through a response
   involving the most suitable robotic nodes. These robotic nodes can
   operate without the use of a centralized system and select amongst
   themselves the nodes with the best fitness to risk mitigation plan. The
   robot node that is first aware of a high-risk event becomes an
   auctioneer. The risk mitigation task is advertised to the entire
   network. Each robotic node is responsible for calculating their bid
   metric (i.e. availability metric) for the risk mitigation task. We
   employ fuzzy logic in the process of the bid calculation, which
   incorporates the battery level, distance to the event, and redundant
   coverage to produce an appropriate bid value. The auctioneer only
   considers the top bidders. The nature of this system is to permit
   simultaneous mitigation plans to execute on a single RSN by effectively
   segmenting the network into discrete autonomous groups. Each autonomous
   group will utilize an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm - the
   Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) - to optimize the
   segment's topology to mitigate the risk. A chromosome length is
   determined by the number of bids received, but the NSGA-II explored to
   separate solution spaces to achieve optimal Pareto results. The NSGA-II
   will seek optimal node positions and determine the optimal set of
   robotic nodes to utilize of the bids received. The NSGA-II will produce
   a set of optimized responses for each network segment for a security
   operator to pick the most suitable response.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new methodology for escaping from local minima
   using an actual-virtual target switching strategy. In particular, this
   approach proposes suitable steps to detect trap situations and guide the
   robot away from local minima even when the environment is completely
   unknown. In this work the navigation system consists of two layers. In
   the low-level layer, a Nearest Virtual Target (NVT) approach is adapted
   as a reactive collision avoidance method for mobile robot navigation to
   achieve collision free motion in cluttered, dense and troublesome
   scenarios. Where the robot is surrounded by obstacles and a trap
   situation is likely to occur, the high-level layer becomes responsible
   to plan a path to pull the robot out of the trap. Finally, the
   performance of the proposed approach is validated by simulation results.}},

   beamformer are derived based only on directional criteria. In far-field
   assumptions (i.e., plane wave propagation model for the signals
   captured), we show that certain factors appearing in the beamformer
   coefficients calculation, which are usually formulated using complicated
   integrals, can be computed using closed-form expressions involving
   familiar, physically meaningful quantities. Next, by resorting to a
   limiting case, we demonstrate a clear theoretical link between the
   resulting solution and MVDR beamforming in cylindrically isotropic noise
   fields. We then discuss a solution to preserve spatial cues if desired
   which also allows to easily control and modulate the enhancement
   strength of the beamformer. Some experimental results are finally given
   in a challenging real-world environment, showing the merits of the
   approach.}},

   infrastructure for the applications of Smart Grid to monitor and control
   the intelligent electric devices in Power Grid. This paper also includes
   a case where the power flows in the residential areas are managed by a
   mechanism implemented on top of this overlay network. The peer nodes of
   the overlay network are the computers. These computers construct into an
   overlay network that has the structure of the R-tree (used by some
   spatial databases for indexing its objects) through mapping to the tree
   nodes. They take over the intelligent devices in the geographic area
   around their own locations by communicating with them using the devices'
   protocols. In our case study, these peer nodes run the procedures of the
   energy management mechanism to manage the power flows in their
   geographic areas. Our simulation results show that, using the overlay
   network, the energy generated by the distributed generators is
   effectively shared by the homes at the different times of day. The paper
   also present the simulation results showing the properties of the
   overlay network, including the scalability in terms of the stretch of
   the path between a peer node and the control center. For the case of
   churn, the experiment results indicate that the number of split or merge

Abstract = {{Crawling web applications is important for indexing, accessibility and
   security assessment. Crawling traditional web applications is an old
   problem, as old as the web itself. Crawling Rich Internet Applications
   (RIA) quickly and efficiently, however, is an open problem. Technologies
   such as AJAX and partial Document Object Model (DOM) updates only makes
   the problem of crawling RIA more time consuming to the web crawler. To
   reduce the time to crawl a RIA, this paper presents a new distributed
   algorithm to crawl a RIA in parallel with multiple computers, called
   Dist-RIA Crawler. Dist-RIA Crawler uses the JavaScript (R) events in the
   DOM structure to partition the search space. This paper illustrates a
   prototype implementation of Dist-RIA Crawler and inspect empirical

   approach to improve their robustness and efficiency to achieve real-time
   matching. We demonstrate our method by applying it to BRIEF {[}7]

   several state-of-the-art descriptors like SURF {[}6], ORB {[}8], and

   Schottky contact thereon, and covered by water. The behavior of this
   array under normal excitation has been extensively investigated. Trends
   have been found and confirmed by identification of the mode propagating
   in nanodipoles and its properties. This device can be used to detect
   infrared radiation below the bandgap energy of the substrate via
   internal photoelectric effect (IPE). Also we estimate its responsivity
   and detection limit. Finally, we assess the potential of the structure
   for bulk and surface (bio) chemical sensing. Based on modal results an
   analytical model has been proposed to estimate the sensitivity of the
   device. Results show a good agreement between numerical and analytical
   interpretations.}},

Abstract = {{Applications that involve the use of hydrogen gas (H-2) have an inherent
   risk in that hydrogen is combustible in air and hence accurate detection
   of its concentration is critical for safe operation.
   Long-Range Surface Plasmon Polaritons (LRSPPs) are optical surface waves
   that are guided along thin metal films or stripes which are
   symmetrically cladded by a dielectric and have been demonstrated to be
   highly sensitive for biological and chemical sensing.
   The sensor presented here consists of a gold (Au) stripe suspended on an
   ultrathin Cytop membrane. This architecture is referred to as the
   membrane waveguide and has previously been demonstrated to support LRSPP
   propagation. Hydrogen sensing is achieved by overlaying a palladium (Pd)
   patch on a straight waveguide section, which induces a measureable
   insertion loss change under the presence of hydrogen.
   The design and optimization of the sensor through finite element method
   (FEM) simulation will be discussed. This will include the design of the
   optimal waveguide geometry along with the design of an integrated
   grating coupler for broadside light coupling. In addition, details on
   the fabrication process are presented.}},

   (WDM) passive optical network (PON) is proposed and demonstrated. In the
   proposed system, an OOK Gaussian pulse signal is modulated on the

   edge filter, a baseband signal and a 30-GHz signal are then modulated on
   the same optical carrier. By employing polarization multiplex technique,
   the UWB and baseband signal will have orthogonal polarization directions
   and the spectrum interference between the two signals is avoided. By
   suppressing the optical carrier, a frequency-doubled mmW signal at 60
   GHz is generated by beating the two 1st order sidebands at a
   photodetector (PD). Error-free transmission of a UWB signal at 2.5 Gbps

Abstract = {{Optical information processing has traditionally been demonstrated using
   3D free-space optical systems employing bulk optical components. These
   systems are bulky and unstable due to the stringent alignment tolerances
   that must be met. Taking advantage of the alignment accuracy offered by
   planar light circuits, these issues may be overcome by confining the
   light in a planar slab waveguide. The limitation on scaling, consequent
   on the loss of one dimension is offset by the nanoscale component
   footprints attainable in a silicon integration platform. A key component
   of this free-space-optics-on-a-chip concept is a waveguide lens.
   Waveguide lenses are of general utility but our specific application is
   their use to implement the complex crossover interconnections of a
   switch fabric.
   The graded refractive index of the lens is engineered by patterning the
   silicon layer of silicon on insulator slab waveguides into a dense
   distribution of cylinders; either solid (silicon) or voids (air); using
   a single etch step. The cylinders have variable diameters and are placed
   on a regular square or hexagonal grid with sub-wavelength pitch. In the
   case of voids, the patterned silicon may be suspended in air to form the
   core of a symmetric slab waveguide. Solid cylinders must be supported by
   the Si0(2) layer leading to an asymmetric waveguide of reduced effective
   index range. Advantageously, the patterning of the metamaterial region
   within the slab-waveguide requires only a single etch step. Photonic
   wire feeder waveguides at different positions around the lens may be
   used to launch light into the lenses or collect light from the lenses. A
   method is developed to determine the local effective media index of a
   periodic metamaterial in terms of the parameters of its unit cell. This
   method is used as a calibration to lay out a metamaterial with graded
   parameters. The operation of a metamaterial Luneburg lens telescope is
   verified by FDTD simulations and shown to be capable of near zero
   insertion loss and crosstalk. The careful approximation of the graded
   index of the Luneburg lens by a metamaterial introduces minimal
   impairments.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that acquiring large amount of range data with
   vision sensors can quickly lead to important data management challenges
   where processing capabilities become saturated and preempt full usage of
   the information available for autonomous systems to make educated
   decisions. While sub-sampling offers a naive solution for reducing
   dataset dimension after acquisition, it does not capitalize on the
   knowledge available in already acquired data to selectively and
   dynamically drive the acquisition process over the most significant
   regions in a scene, the latter being generally characterized by
   variations in depth and surface shape. This paper discusses the
   development of a formal improvement measure and a method to
   automatically establish which regions within the field of view of a
   range sensor would provide the most improvement to a model of the scene
   if further acquisitions were concentrated in priority over those
   regions. The proposed algorithm mainly targets applications using random
   access range sensors, defined as sensors that can acquire depth
   measurements at specified azimuth and elevation within their field of
   view. However, the framework is developed to be independent of the range
   sensing technology used, and is validated with range data acquired from
   the popular Kinect multi-modal imaging sensor, as well as Neptec's LMS
   laser random access range sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Model Driven Engineering proposes the use of models as the main
   development artifacts. This methodology involves generating code from
   models and then perhaps adding some details to the generated code.
   Frequently, it is required to also reverse-engineer code to generate
   models. Despite the wide acceptance of modeling benefits, the use of
   Model Driven Engineering practices remains limited. We present model
   oriented programming as a new paradigm to reduce the ever-present
   tension between model-centric and code-centric development styles. The
   core of this approach is to add UML abstractions such as associations
   and state machines directly into a high-level programming language code.
   In this approach, model diagrams become just another abstract view of
   the code. The need for reverse engineering is eliminated, since
   everything in the diagram is represented directly in the code. Model
   orientation is illustrated using Umple, a working model oriented
   programming platform. A functional layer of an airline reservation
   system is presented as a case study.}},

Abstract = {{The Quality of Service (QoS) in smart grid communications especially in
   monitoring smart grid assets is becoming significantly important for
   emerging smart grid applications. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are
   expected to be widely utilized in a broad range of smart grid
   applications due to their numerous advantages along with their
   successful adoption in various critical areas including military and
   health. WSNs protocols are not designed to provide QoS provisioning for
   monitoring applications. Thus, the use of WSNs in transmitting
   delay-critical data from smart grid assets calls for data prioritization
   and delay-mitigation schemes. In this paper, we propose a
   delay-responsive, cross layer scheme with linear backoff (LDRX)
   mechanism to address delay and service requirements of the smart grid
   monitoring applications. The LDRX scheme is designed to operate in
   cluster-tree WSN topology that is suitable for monitoring wide areas
   such as electrical substations or large installations. We show that LDRX
   has greater impact on delay reduction compared to previously proposed
   WSNs delay reduction schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of recovering virtual networks (VNs)
   affected by a substrate node failure. A novel heuristics-based algorithm
   that efficiently reallocates new resources for the affected VNs after a
   node failure is proposed. In this algorithm, a manager substrate node
   executes a set of recovery steps to migrate all the hosted virtual nodes
   in the failed substrate node in addition to the virtual paths traveling
   across it. The proposed approach is executed in a distributed manner
   without any coordination from the central Infrastructure Provider (InP).
   The developed scheme efficiently minimizes the node failure recovery
   cost, the time needed to recover the virtual nodes hosted on the failed

Abstract = {{Gesture Control is a subject which has been investigated almost from the
   beginning of using terminals to interact with the computer central unit.
   The advent of Kinect, has sparked a series of efforts to apply gesture
   control not only in gaming, but rather in controlling TVs or set-top
   boxes, PCs, laptops, and others. Gestures have been captured by various
   sensors, either triggering some binary events using primitive methods
   like mounting diodes around the bezel of the monitor and sensing the
   passage of the hand over them, or trying to interpret gestures using a
   camera and complex image processing algorithms based on learning
   machines techniques. By using special infrared (IR) illumination, it is
   now possible to obtain robust and stable real-time interaction between
   the user and the computer. Existing 3D cameras, however, require exotic
   hardware components, multiple image sensors, or structured IR light
   projected onto the user. In this paper, a novel real-time depth-mapping
   principle and IR camera is introduced. The new IR camera architecture
   comprises an illuminator module which is pulsed and modulated via a
   monotonic function using a phase-locked loop control for the laser
   intensity, while the reflected infrared light is captured in
   ``slices{''} of the space in which the object of interest is situated. A
   reconfigurable hardware architecture unit calculates the depth slices
   and combines them in a depth-map of the object. The depth map is further
   used in the detection, tracking, and recognition of the gesture made by
   the user. The resolution is variable depending on the resolution and
   gating possibilities of the image sensor. A sensor of 1 megapixel is
   used, providing a resolution of 1024x1024. Images of real objects are
   reconstructed in 3D based on the data obtained by the laser slicing
   technique, and a corresponding image processing algorithm builds the 3D
   map of the object in real-time. As this paper will show through a series
   of experiments, the camera can be used in a variety of domains,
   including for gesture control of 3D objects in virtual environments.}},

   authentication of H. 264/AVC compressed videos. The watermark signals,
   which represent the macroblock's (MB) and frame's indices, are embedded
   into the last nonzero quantized DCT value of blocks. Also, analyzing the
   detection error helps to distinguish malicious attacks from some common
   processing such as H. 264/AVC recompression. Experimental results show
   that the distortion caused by our watermarking system is negligible,
   leading to a PSNR of about -0.78 dB and increasing the bitrate by just
   3.6\%. Furthermore, average bit correct rate (BCR) after H. 264/AVC
   recompression is 0.725.}},

   forms a tree that connects all the nodes in the network, this tree will
   be used later to transfer control data to the base station. The second
   is a centralized weighted clustering protocol that uses the CDDP to
   transmit control data to the base station which will select the best
   cluster heads in the network according to a weighted criteria function.
   The effect of using a realistic energy consumption model in
   cluster-based communication for WSN will be investigated. The

Abstract = {{Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been garnering a lot of attention from
   medical researchers and biomedical engineers due to its ability to
   expose crucial information about the status of the nervous system and
   the health of the human heart. Although time domain analysis of a HRV
   signals can yield a wealth of information, frequency domain analysis has
   been gaining in popularity. This is mainly due to the identification of
   distinct frequency bands that reflect specific components of the nervous
   system. Nonetheless, signal artifact can severely distort the extracted
   time and frequency domain parameters alike and thus rendering the
   information obtained from the signal unusable. In this paper, we propose
   the use of a Windowed Impulse Rejection (WIR) based artifact detection
   algorithm. Our performance evaluation demonstrated that our method
   performs with a higher level of accuracy than its competitors. Also, in
   terms of complexity, it outperformed the Moving Average algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The perceived usefulness of a Clinical Data Repository (CDR) prototype

Abstract = {{This paper presents a system for recognition of dynamic sign language
   and voice recognition for smart home interactive applications. We use
   the Bag-of-Features and a local part model approach for bare hand
   dynamic gesture recognition from video. We use a dense sampling to
   extract local 3D multiscale whole-part features. We adopted
   three-dimensional histograms of a gradient orientation (3D HOG)
   descriptor to represent features. The K-means++ method was applied to
   cluster the visual words. Dynamic hand gesture classification was
   conducted by using a Bag-of-features (BOF) and non-linear support vector
   machine (SVM) methods. As the BOF does not track the order of events we
   use a multiscale local part model to preserve temporal context. Initial
   experimental results show a higher level of recognition. A voice
   recognition system is then used to translate voice commands
   complementing the hand gesture commands for the human-intuitive control
   of a personal service android robot for smart home or long-term
   healthcare environment applications.}},

Abstract = {{Automatically detecting daily activities using wearable smartphones
   would provide valuable information to clinicians. While accelerometer
   data is effective in this area, classifying stair ascent can be
   difficult. In this paper, video content analysis is performed on short
   videos captured from a wearable smartphone in order to distinguish
   between level ground walking and stair climbing. High contrast image
   features, such as corners, were tracked across consecutive video frames
   to create feature paths. Computing the median of the slope of the paths
   in each frame revealed substantial differences, in both magnitude and
   variation over time, for stair climbing as opposed to walking. A time
   series of median slope values was produced for each video clip, and the
   number of local maxima and minima above a threshold of 1.0 were
   computed. Results revealed that the number of peaks during stair
   climbing were substantially larger than walking and, therefore, could be
   used as a feature for distinguishing between these two activities.}},

Abstract = {{Several researchers have highlighted the importance of studying stress
   and exploring methods to effectively reduce its harmful effects on human
   wellbeing. Biofeedback is an emerging technology being used as a
   legitimate preventive health care technique for achieving higher levels
   of well-being and can also be used for stress management. In this paper,
   we propose a mathematical model for personalizing relaxation techniques
   for stress management. The model considers both physiological reactions
   to various relaxation techniques and contextual information to optimize
   relaxation effectiveness. The long term objective is to teach users
   about what actually works best for them among several relaxation
   techniques. A case study for ubiquitous stress management application is
   presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. The simulation
   results demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to provide users
   with feedback about what relaxation techniques work best for them as
   well as adapt to various environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Plantar pressure measurement is an important tool for understanding foot
   and gait biomechanics. F-Scan is a popular device for measuring in-shoe
   plantar pressures; however, the validity of the F-Scan force
   measurements has been questioned. Therefore, a study was performed to
   analyze changes in plantar pressure and temperature over time. One
   participant was fitted with two F-Scan sensors before step calibration.
   Single leg standing trials were captured for each limb while the subject
   stood on a force plate, then the subject performed multiple trials of
   level ground walking. Sensor temperatures were measured immediately
   after each set of walking trials. This procedure was repeated every 10
   minutes for 140 minutes. Total force values decreased over time, with
   the largest decrease in total force occurring in the first 60 minutes.
   Sensor temperature increased during the first hour and then leveled off.
   Centre of pressure trajectories were similar over 140 minutes,
   indicating that cell pressures change similarly over time. This study
   showed that F-Scan is appropriate for evaluating pressure profiles and
   centre of pressure shape but additional considerations are required when
   using total force as an outcome measure.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we evaluated the quality of the ECG signals obtained from
   conductive fabric dry electrodes. The purpose of this work was to
   evaluate if lead I ECG collected with dry conductive fabric electrodes
   is suitable for applications where no special preparation of electrodes
   specific for ECG monitoring is allowed. An example of such application
   is ECG-assisted blood pressure (BP) monitoring device where the user of
   the BP device should only follow standard procedures of BP measurements.
   In this paper, we present a system that we developed for the acquisition
   of ECG signals and their transfer to the PC, and we evaluate the quality
   of the ECG signals from different electrodes placed at biceps and wrist
   or touched by fingers. In our experiments we compared signals obtained
   using gel Ag/AgCl, dry contact electrodes made of golden plates and
   conductive fabric-based electrodes. Conductive fabric-based electrodes
   are capable of collecting ECG with accuracy comparable to the accuracy
   of the signal collected by gel electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Some research indicates that the TCP congestion control mechanism may
   cause the burstiness of traffic flow. A group of TCP segments are
   delivered simultaneously, while an acknowledgement (ACK) of a
   retransmission is successfully received. This burstiness leads to a
   network with high level contention, which extremely increases the
   probability of packet loss on wireless networks. TCP pacing is one of
   the solutions for TCP burstiness on multi-hop network. The idea is to
   spread the TCP segment transmissions over the whole Round Trip Time
   (RTT). Most of the pacing protocols attempt to insert a delay interval
   into the TCP segment flows or ACK flows, without noticing a Cross Layer
   pacing algorithm on IEEE802.11 with deferring and backoff mechanism. In
   this paper, we measure and analyze the way contention window size (CW)
   affects TCP throughput in different scenarios; and, we propose a cross
   layer TCP pacing protocol by controlling the lower bound of contention
   window for the optimization of the overall TCP throughput on multi-hop
   topology. Finally, a comparison of simulations is presented in order to
   verify the improvement achieved by our protocol.}},

Abstract = {{The development of effective hemp decortication methods has been
   considered as an emerging need by the bio-composites and other fiber
   industries. In this study, the drop weight method was used for hemp
   decortication. Tests were conducted using a laboratory-scale impactor
   (consisting of a hammer and a mold). In the tests, a 40-g sample of hemp
   stalk was placed in the mold where it was subjected to various impact
   intensities from different numbers of hammer drops. These different
   impact intensities corresponded to different energy inputs onto the
   given mass of hemp sample. The energy inputs were expressed as specific
   energy levels and they were 4.5, 9.1, 13.6, 18.2, 22.7, and 27.2 MJ
   Mg-1. Two types of hemp sample, named as hemp A (unretted hemp) and hemp
   B (retted hemp), were used in the tests. Two different sieving scenarios
   (without-sieving and with-sieving between hammer drops) were also
   applied in the tests. The results showed that using higher specific
   energy to impact hemp stalk, higher fiber yield, and fiber detaching
   efficiency could be achieved. Sieving the chaff (particles smaller than
   20 mm) out between hammer drops could further improve the fiber yield
   and detaching efficiency. The best performance of the drop weight method
   was observed for the treatment of the hemp B with sieving at the highest
   specific energy level. This treatment gave a fiber yield of 24\% and a
   detaching efficiency of 0.89.}},

Title = {{Intercepting UHF RFID signals through synchronous detection}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Recently, augmented ultrahigh frequency radio-frequency identification
   (UHF RFID) systems have been developed, and they contain additional
   components that can detect a tag's backscattered response and use this
   information for the localization of the tag and other applications. The
   methods currently employed either have poor performance because the
   detection of the tag's response is based on envelope detection or are
   costly because they are based on software-defined radio. The solution
   proposed in the paper is to use a method called synchronous detection to
   intercept tag signals. Using synchronous detection, we were able to use
   a conventional UHF RFID reader integrated circuit for the method,
   leading to a cost-effective, high-performance solution. We performed an
   analysis of its read rate and read range performance. The analysis
   showed that our receiver is capable of receiving tag signals with a read
   rate of 50\% for passive and 66\% for semi-passive tags at a 1-m
   distance between the tag and the receiver and is capable of receiving
   tag signals at a maximum distance between the tag and the receiver of
   3.25 m for passive and 5.5 m for semi-passive tags, with the reader
   being within 8 m of the receiver. This augmented RFID system has a
   potential to facilitate localization and prevent the cross-read problem
   in RFID-based portals. In addition, it can be used as a protocol
   analyzer as well as a component of future Internet of Things.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-wrapped titanium dioxide nanoflower composites (G-TiO2)
   consisting of nanosheets and nanoparticles were synthesized using a
   two-step solvo/hydrothermal process. Materials were characterized using
   SEM, TEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and
   FTIR. Further analysis was performed using Branauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   specific surface area analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy.
   Photocatalytic activity was determined by the photo-degradation of
   methylene blue under UV irradiation. Results show that the TiO2
   nanoflower exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity than commercial P25
   by a factor of 1.49. This is attributed to the highly crystalline,
   hierarchical nature of the nanoflower structure, which provides improved
   charge transport and a reduced recombination rate of photo-generated
   electron-hole pairs. After wrapping with graphene, the G-TiO2 composite
   can further improve the photocatalytic performance by providing a planar
   conjugated surface for dye adsorption, by further reducing recombination
   through accepting electrons from TiO2, and by causing a red shift in
   light absorption. The highest photocatalytic performance was found using
   a graphene loading of 5 wt\%, which outperforms commercial P25 by a
   factor of 3.4.}},

Abstract = {{One of the important aspects of decision making and management in
   distributed systems is collecting accurate information about the
   available resources of the peers. The previously proposed approaches for
   collecting such information completely depend on the system's
   architecture. In the server-oriented architecture, servers assume the
   main role of collecting comprehensive information from the peers and the
   system. Next, based on the information about the features of the basic
   activities and the system, an exact description of the peers' status is
   produced. Accurate decisions are then made using this description.
   However, the amount of information gathered in this architecture is too
   large, and it requires massive processing. On the other hand, updating
   the information takes time, causing delays and undermining the validity
   of the information. In addition, due to the limitations imposed by the
   servers, such architecture is not scalable and dynamic enough. The
   peer-to-peer architecture was introduced to address these concerns.
   However, due to a lack of complete knowledge of the peers and the
   system, the decisions are made without a precise description of the
   peers' status and are only based on the hardware data collected from the
   peers. Such an abstract and general image of the peers is not adequate
   for the purpose of decision making. In this paper, a 4-dimensional model
   is presented for the purpose of information collection and the exact
   description of the peer's status, including the features of the peer,
   the basic activity, the time, and the specifications of the system. The
   proposed model is for a server-oriented architecture, but it also adapts
   to the peer-to-peer serverless architecture. Based on this model, a new
   approach is introduced for information collection and an exact
   description of the peers' status in a peer-to-peer system based on the
   Latin square concept. We evaluate the model in the server-oriented and
   serverless situations. The workload is considered as the basic activity
   in our evaluation. Our evaluation demonstrates that in a server-oriented
   situation, increasing the size of the system has a direct relation with
   time. However, a serverless situation does not follow this behavior.}},

Title = {{Comparing predictions made by a prediction model, clinical score, and

Journal = {{APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{376-391}},
Abstract = {{Background: Asthma exacerbations are one of the most common medical
   reasons for children to be brought to the hospital emergency department
   (ED). Various prediction models have been proposed to support diagnosis
   of exacerbations and evaluation of their severity.
   Objectives: First, to evaluate prediction models constructed from data
   using machine learning techniques and to select the best performing
   model. Second, to compare predictions from the selected model with
   predictions from the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM)
   score, and predictions made by ED physicians.
   Design: A two-phase study conducted in the ED of an academic pediatric
   hospital. In phase 1 data collected prospectively using paper forms was
   used to construct and evaluate five prediction models, and the best
   performing model was selected. In phase 2 data collected prospectively
   using a mobile system was used to compare the predictions of the
   selected prediction model with those from PRAM and ED physicians.
   Measurements: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and
   accuracy in phase 1; accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and
   negative predictive values in phase 2.
   Results: In phase 1 prediction models were derived from a data set of
   240 patients and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. A naive Bayes
   (NB) model demonstrated the best performance and it was selected for
   phase 2. Evaluation in phase 2 was conducted on data from 82 patients.
   Predictions made by the NB model were less accurate than the PRAM score
   and physicians (accuracy of 70.7\%, 73.2\% and 78.0\% respectively),
   however, according to McNemar's test it is not possible to conclude that
   the differences between predictions are statistically significant.
   Conclusion: Both the PRAM score and the NB model were less accurate than
   physicians. The NB model can handle incomplete patient data and as such
   may complement the PRAM score. However, it requires further research to
   improve its accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider nonconvex control problems of stochastic
   differential equations driven by relaxed controls adapted, in the weak
   star sense, to a current of sigma algebras generated by observable
   processes. We cover in a unified way both continuous diffusion and jump
   processes. We present existence of optimal controls before we construct
   the necessary conditions of optimality (unlike some papers in this area)
   using only functional analysis. We develop a stochastic Hamiltonian
   system of equations on a rigorous basis using the semimartingale
   representation theory and the Riesz representation theorem, leading
   naturally to the existence of the adjoint process which satisfies a
   backward stochastic differential equation. In other words, our approach
   predicts the existence of the adjoint process as a natural consequence
   of Riesz representation theory ensuring at the same time the (weak star)
   measurability. This is unlike other papers, where the adjoint process is
   introduced before its existence is proved. We believe this is one of our
   major contributions in this paper. We also discuss the realizability of
   relaxed controls by regular controls using the Krein-Millman theorem. We
   believe this is another major contribution of this paper. We also
   believe that our approach is direct and easy to understand following
   simply the precise logic of functional analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon photodetectors combine metallic features on which
   surface plasmons may be excited with a semiconductor detector structure
   such as a pn or Schottky junction. The involvement of surface plasmons
   in detection conveys particular characteristics to the device, such as
   enhanced photoyield, polarisation sensitivity or spectral selectivity,
   which is useful for applications. An application of present interest is
   the detection of radiation at photon energies below the bandgap energy
   of silicon, particularly at optical communications wavelengths (1310 and
   1550 nm), targeting optical interconnect and sensing applications.
   Internal photoemission on metal-silicon Schottky contacts is well-suited
   for this purpose as it is a broadband detection mechanism (optical and
   electrical). Internal photoemission is inefficient but structuring the
   metal forming the Schottky contact to excite surface plasmons at the
   metal-semiconductor interface results in an enhancement of the
   responsivity of the detector. Structures that exploit surface plasmons
   to enhance photodetection are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The present work demonstrates the integration of hollow core photonic
   crystal fibers (HC-PCF), microfluidics, and statistical analysis for
   monitoring biomolecules using Raman spectroscopy. HC-PCF as a signal
   enhancer has been proven by many researchers. However, there have been
   challenges in using HC-PCF for practical applications due to limitations
   such as coupling, stability, evaporation, clogging, consistent filling,
   and reusing the same fiber. This limited the potential of HC-PCF to
   detect low concentrations of liquid samples, which is why HC-PCF still
   hasn't transcended the lab barriers. The current device is based on an
   H-design lay-out which uses the pressure difference between the two ends
   of the fiber for filling and flushing the liquid samples. This mitigated
   several issues related to device performance by allowing us to fill the
   fiber with liquid samples consistently, rapidly and reproducibly. The
   resulting Raman signals were significantly more stable as various
   concentrations of ethanol in water were sequentially introduced into the
   fiber. The scheme also allowed us to overcome the barrier of predicting
   low concentrations by applying Partial Least Square (PLS) technique
   which was done for the first time using HC-PCF. Thus, the present scheme
   paves path for the inclusion of HC-PCF in the main stream point-of-care
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{There are different panoramic techniques to produce outstanding
   stereoscopic panoramas of static scenes. However, a camera configuration
   capable to capture omnidirectional stereoscopic snapshots and videos of
   dynamic scenes is still a subject of research. In this paper, two
   multiple-camera configurations capable to produce high-quality
   stereoscopic panoramas in real-time are presented. Unlike existing
   methods, the proposed multiple-camera systems acquire all the
   information necessary to render stereoscopic panoramas at once. The
   first configuration exploits micro-stereopsis arising from a narrow
   baseline to produce omni-stereoscopic images. The second panoramic
   camera uses an extended baseline to produce poly-centric panoramas and
   to extract additional depth information, e.g., disparity and occlusion
   maps, which are used to synthesize stereoscopic views in arbitrary
   viewing directions. The results of emulating both cameras and the pros
   and cons of each set-up are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address the problem of disparity estimation required
   for free navigation in acquired cubic-panorama image datasets. A client
   server based scheme is assumed and a remote user is assumed to seek
   information at each navigation step. The initial compression of such
   image datasets for storage as well as the transmission of the required
   data is addressed in this work. Regarding the compression of such data
   for storage, a fast method that uses properties of the epipolar geometry
   together with the cubic format of panoramas is used to estimate
   disparity vectors efficiently. Assuming the use of B pictures, the
   concept of forward and backward prediction is addressed. Regarding the
   transmission stage, a new disparity vector transcoding-like scheme is
   introduced and a frame conversion scenario is addressed. Details on how
   to pick the best vector among candidate disparity vectors is explained.
   In all the above mentioned cases, results are compared both visually
   through error images as well as using the objective measure of Peak
   Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) versus time.}},

   associated stigma. This study sought to determine if artificial
   intelligence could increase grab bar use by seniors and to determine the
   efficacy of different cues (auditory, visual, and audiovisual
   combination) on the frequency of use of a grab bar. Sixty-nine healthy
   participants aged 60 to 86 years (average 68.7 years) were randomly
   assigned to three subgroups. Each subgroup tested two different cueing
   conditions: the no cue and one of three cued conditions (visual,
   auditory, or combined audio-visual). Results suggest that the smart grab
   increased seniors' grab bars use by 39\% and that the effect was
   maintained after removal of the cues. Participants preferred the visual
   cue but the auditory cue was the most powerful. Results suggest that
   artificial intelligence may be an interesting avenue to increase grab
   bar use in community-dwelling older adults and in people requiring
   supervision to use grab bars on a regular basis to decrease the risk of
   falls during bathing or bathtub transfers.}},

Abstract = {{While open communication infrastructures are embedded into smart grids
   to support vast amounts of data exchange, it makes smart grids
   vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the effects
   of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on load frequency control (LFC) of
   smart grids. In contrast with existing works, we consider the problem
   that how DoS attacks affect the dynamic performance of a power system.
   The state space model of power systems under DoS attacks is formulated
   as a switched system. By applying switched system theories, the
   existence of DoS attacks that make the dynamics of a power system
   unstable is proved. A two-area power system is used to conduct case
   studies. The dynamic performance of the power system, such as
   convergence and steady-state errors, is compared under different DoS
   attack scenarios. It is shown that the dynamic performance of the power
   system is affected strongly if the adversaries launch DoS attacks before
   the dynamics of the power system converge.}},

Abstract = {{Certain Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications such as patient
   monitoring, smart grid and equipment condition monitoring require
   accurate estimation of specific WSN parameters such as the end-to-end
   delay, the reliability and the power consumption. The estimation of
   these parameters calls for an accurate and lightweight WSN model that is
   suitable for the low processing capabilities of sensor nodes. In this
   paper, we present a realistic and stable Markov based model for WSNs. We
   perform a comprehensive performance analysis using different traffic and
   network conditions. Furthermore, we test the accuracy of our model by
   conducting extensive simulations in environments that are equivalent to
   the analytical model. The proposed model takes into account the traffic
   generation probabilities and considers the impact of a finite MAC-level
   buffer size on the end-to-end delay, reliability and power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrin has been widely used in wound healing. However, its benefit for
   spinal cord injury (SCI) is limited. In this study, we investigated the
   impact of fibrin scaffolds containing ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs)
   on histological and behavioral recovery after SCI and compared it with
   fibrin alone. To achieve this, EMSCs derived from adult rat nasal
   respiratory mucosa were cultured, characterized and transfected with
   green fluorescent protein adenovirus before transplantation. Then,
   Sprague-Dawley host rats were randomly assigned into four groups: the
   control group (laminectomy); the SCI group (laminectomy and transection
   of spinal cords); the fibrin group (fibrin was transplanted immediately
   after SCI), and the fibrin cell (FC) group (fibrin scaffolds containing
   EMSCs were transplanted after SCI). Three days after the operation, a
   TUNEL assay indicated less apoptotic cells in the FC group than in the
   fibrin group. Two weeks after SCI, fluorescence staining demonstrated
   not only the survival and migration of EMSCs into the lesion sites, but
   also a higher number of nerve fibers in the FC group than in the fibrin
   group. Histological examination including immunohistochemistry and
   transmission electron microscopy 12 weeks after the operation showed
   more nerve fibers and a thicker myelin sheath in the FC group compared
   to the fibrin group. Western blotting confirmed these morphological
   results. Consistent with the histological results, Basso, Beattie and
   Bresnahan locomotor scores of the FC group were higher than those of the
   fibrin group. These results suggest that fibrin scaffolds containing
   EMSCs can improve the behavioral and histological recovery after SCI
   better than fibrin alone. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Title = {{Vibrations due to Flow-Driven Repeated Impacts}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{We consider a two-degree-of-freedom model where the focus is on
   analyzing the vibrations of a fixed but flexible structure that is
   struck repeatedly by a second object. The repetitive impacts due to the
   second mass are driven by a flowing fluid. Morison's equation is used to
   model the effect of the fluid on the properties of the structure. The
   model is developed based on both linearized and quadratic fluid drag
   forces, both of which are analyzed analytically and simulated
   numerically. Conservation of linear momentum and the coefficient of
   restitution are used to characterize the nature of the impacts between
   the two masses. A resonance condition of the model is analyzed with a
   Fourier transform. This model is proposed to explain the nature of
   ice-induced vibrations, without the need for a model of the ice-failure
   mechanism. The predictions of the model are compared to ice-induced
   vibrations data that are available in the open literature and found to
   be in good agreement. Therefore, the use of a repetitive impact model
   that does not require modeling the ice-failure mechanism can be used to
   explain some of the observed behavior of ice-induced vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we are interested in algorithms for finding 2-factors that
   cover certain prescribed edge-cuts in bridgeless cubic graphs. Since a
   Hamilton cycle is a 2-factor covering all edge-cuts, imposing the
   constraint of covering those edge-cuts makes the obtained 2-factor
   closer to a Hamilton cycle. We present an algorithm for finding a
   minimum-weight 2-factor covering all the 3-edge cuts in weighted
   bridgeless cubic graphs, together with a polyhedral description of such
   2-factors and that of perfect matchings intersecting all the 3-edge cuts
   in exactly one edge. We further give an algorithm for finding a 2-factor
   covering all the 3- and 4-edge cuts in bridgeless cubic graphs. Both of
   these algorithms run in O(n(3)) time, where n is the number of vertices.
   As an application of the latter algorithm, we design a 6/5-approximation
   algorithm for finding a minimum 2-edge-connected spanning subgraph in
   3-edge-connected cubic graphs, which improves upon the previous best
   ratio of 5/4. The algorithm begins with finding a 2-factor covering all
   3- and 4-edge cuts, which is the bottleneck in terms of complexity, and
   thus it has running time O(n(3)). We then improve this time complexity
   to O(n(2) log(4) n) by relaxing the condition of the initial 2-factor
   and elaborating on the subsequent processes.}},

   ultrasensitive refractive index sensing}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2541-2546}},
Abstract = {{Past works on refractive index sensing using nanohole arrays in metal
   films typically achieved a resolution of around 10(-4) to 10(-5)
   refractive index units (RIU), up to 10(-6) with complicated detection
   setups. This is an order of magnitude worse than commercial
   Kretschmann-based surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors. Here, we
   demonstrate intensity-based bulk refractive index sensing in an aqueous
   environment with a resolution of 9.38 x 10(-8) refractive index units
   (RIU), showing for the first time comparable performance for nanohole
   SPR with Kretschmann-based SPR. This is achieved by the combination of
   three advances in the materials properties: (a) template stripping to
   achieve ultra-flat Au surfaces of similar to 0.2 nm roughness, (b)
   elliptical nanoholes to enhance transmission, and (c) a Cytop substrate
   to symmetrize the refractive index with the aqueous environment above
   the metal film. The simple optical microscope geometry and microfluidic
   integration used in this work is promising for multiplexed lab-on-chip
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Service Overlay Networks (SONs) provide new complex services in the
   Internet without requiring major changes to underlying physical
   networks. A SON is an overlay network made up of virtual nodes and links
   on top of the existing infrastructure. Whenever a client requests a
   specific service, such as streaming a video on his mobile device, the
   SON creates a path on the fly to deliver the video stream from the
   server to the client. This path is called a Service Specific Overlay
   Network (SSON) and consists of nodes that meet the Quality of Service
   (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), and technical requirements of the
   user. Unfortunately, the highly dynamic nature of overlay networks makes
   it challenging to keep video quality at the required levels. Errors and
   delays due mainly to congestion cause packets to be dropped or queued
   for a long period of time in intermediate nodes. Video quality is
   greatly affected by such impairments. In this paper, we propose a
   utility function to predict QoE of video delivered over SSONs. The
   proposed function is based on application-level statistical information,
   namely frame delay. It allows user QoE to be monitored in real-time
   without incurring additional overhead on the network. When degradation
   in the utility is detected, appropriate adaptation schemes can be used
   to restore the QoE to acceptable levels. We show the effectiveness and
   flexibility of the proposed scheme via mathematical proofs and
   simulation results.}},

   proper name and a synset can be based on pattern-driven search and on
   distributional analyses in large corpora. The sources are heterogeneous
   and the measures of semantic relatedness vary widely. We propose a
   flexible method, an adaptation of the algorithm of Activation Area
   Attachment, which treats each type of sources slightly differently. We
   reach 80\% precision in linking proper names with places in a wordnet

Abstract = {{Biocompatible and naturally occurring chitosan was used as an additive
   for the preparation of a polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane. Two
   different compositions of polysulfone in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and
   chitosan in 1\% acetic acid were blended to prepare PSf-CS
   ultrafiltration membranes by the diffusion induced phase separation

   membranes was confirmed by ATR-IR analysis. The surface and
   cross-sectional morphology of the membranes was studied by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). The membrane hydrophilicity was determined by
   water uptake and contact angle measurements. The PSf-CS membrane showed
   an enhanced hydrophilicity compared to a PSf ultrafiltration membrane.
   The time dependent permeation studies revealed the improved flux of
   PSf-CS membranes. PSf-CS membranes were subjected to bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) protein rejection studies. An improved antifouling
   property was observed for PSf-CS blend membranes as compared to pristine

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new stability analysis method dedicated to a class
   of fuzzy control systems (FCSs) controlling multi input-multi output
   (MIMO) nonlinear processes by means of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic
   controllers (FLCs). The stability analysis of the FCSs is carried out
   using LaSalle's global invariant set theorem by the separate stability
   analysis of each fuzzy rule in MIMO fuzzy control systems. Therefore the
   complexity of the stability analysis is reduced and the adding of new
   fuzzy rules can be conducted easily; this modification of FLC structure
   requires the fulfillment of only one of the conditions of the stability
   analysis theorem suggested in this paper. Another advantage of the
   stability analysis approach proposed in this paper is that the
   derivative of the Lyapunov function candidate must be only negative
   semi-definite in comparison with Lyapunov's stability theorem where it
   must be negative definite. The conservativeness of stability conditions
   is thus reduced, and this enables the convenient design of FLCs. The
   applicability and efficiency of the theoretical results are illustrated
   by numerical simulations for a representative MIMO process which deals
   with the level control in a three spherical tank system.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes an adaptive gravitational search algorithm (AGSA)
   which carries out adaptation of depreciation law of the gravitational
   constant and of a parameter in the weighted sum of all forces exerted
   from the other agents to the iteration index. The adaptation is ensured
   by a simple single input-two output (SITO) fuzzy block in the
   algorithm's structure. SITO fuzzy block operates in the iteration
   domain, the iteration index is the input variable and the gravitational
   constant and the parameter in the weighted sum of all forces are the
   output variables. AGSA's convergence is guaranteed by a theorem derived
   from Popov's hyperstability analysis results. AGSA is embedded in an
   original design and tuning method for Takagi-Sugeno
   proportional-integral fuzzy controllers (T-S PI-FCs) dedicated to servo
   systems modelled by second-order models with an integral component and
   variable parameters. AGSA solves a minimisation-type optimisation
   problem based on an objective function which depends on the sensitivity
   function with respect to process gain variations, therefore a reduced
   process gain sensitivity is offered. AGSA is validated by a case study
   that optimally tunes a T-S PI-FC for position control of a laboratory
   servo system. Representative experimental results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop and optimize a simple and
   economical method for the extraction and determination of bisphenol-A
   (BPA), using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with
   ultraviolet (UV) detection at environmentally relevant concentrations in
   both dissolved and particulate phases. To clean-up and pre-concentrate
   liquid samples, solid-phase extraction (SPE) method was optimized with
   regard to pH, volume, washing and elution solvents for high recovery of
   BPA and good clean-up. For sludge samples, four extraction methods,
   microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasonication extraction (USE),
   accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and high-pressure homogenizer
   (HPH), were compared for isolation of BPA from activated sludge samples.
   Analysis was performed by optimized procedures using HPLC-UV. Recoveries
   of BPA from liquid and solid phases were determined to be 90-105 and
   60-90\%, respectively. MAE had the highest recovery among examined
   extraction methods. The method detection limits were 100 ng/L and 100
   ng/g dry weight. To validate the method, a mass balance study was
   conducted with 100 mL spiked mixed liquor volatile suspended solids
   (VSS) samples from three laboratory-scale porous pot reactors and
   concentrations of BPA in liquid and solid phases were determined using
   the optimized conditions. The results had an average 86\% overall
   recovery for all samples.}},

Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{192-201}},
Abstract = {{Improving kinetic modeling of nitrification in rivers is of growing
   importance due to yearly increases in the anthropogenic release of
   nitrogen into rivers around the world. The use of water quality models
   can abate the expense of water quality monitoring while enabling the
   user to predict trends of variation. Data collected from a series of
   laboratory kinetic experiments were used to calculate the rate of
   nitrification in the Rideau River, Canada, and modify nitrification
   algorithms used in the traditional water quality model Qual2E. The
   modified model relates the reaction rate coefficients with a simple
   biomass concentration measurement of volatile suspended solids (VSS) in
   the river and subsequently introduces biomass growth functions directly
   into the kinetic algorithm. Furthermore, this modified model includes a
   nitrate-nitrogen assimilation pathway. The modified model demonstrates
   an improved correlation to nitrogen parameters observed in river water
   samples compared with the classical water quality model Qual2E. The
   inclusion of bacterial concentrations based upon the simple measurement
   of VSS plays a critical role in the reactions of the nitrification
   system and nitrate-nitrogen assimilation is an important pathway at low
   ammonia-nitrogen concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of finding the breakpoint median for
   multichromosomal unsigned genomes that contain circular or mixed
   (circular and linear) chromosomes. It has been shown by Tannier, Zheng,
   and Sankoff that for signed multichromosomal circular or mixed genomes
   the breakpoint median can be found in polynomial time; however, the
   complexity of the unsigned versions of the problems were unknown. In
   this paper, we show that these problems can all be solved in polynomial
   time. We also study restricted versions of the multichromosomal
   breakpoint median problem where the number of chromosomes of the median
   must be a certain number. We show that as soon as we impose a fixed
   number of chromosomes the problem becomes NP-hard. Moreover, we
   introduce the notion of partially signed circular or mixed genomes,
   where both signed and unsigned genes may exist in the same genome. We
   provide the first study of this form of these breakpoint median problems
   and show that these problem can also be solved in polynomial time by
   providing a novel transformation to b-matchings.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel particles are synthesized by a modified polyol method using 1 at.
   \% of Pd as nucleation agent (Ni99Pd1) followed by an electrochemical
   sinusoidal wave treatment in 0.1 M Na2SO4 + 30 mM ascorbic acid. This
   treatment proved to significantly enhance the catalytic activity of Ni
   towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (her). After treatment, the
   current density of her increases almost four times and is accompanied by
   the onset potential shift to more positive values. From SEM, no visible
   changes in Ni particle size and shape were observed after treatment. XPS
   analysis of the surface of as-prepared Ni particles reveals that it
   contains Ni-0, NiO, NiOOH and Ni(OH)(2), whereas after treatment Ni
   atoms exist mainly in the metallic form and as NiOOH. The increase in
   the activity of Ni particles after the treatment might be due to the
   higher amount of Ni-0 at the surface. (C) 2012 Academie des sciences.

   growing concern about SCADA security including substation security.
   Although there are several solutions utilized to prevent security
   threats in SCADA networks, existing SCADA networks still have severe
   shortcomings. In this article, we propose a lightweight and efficient
   security solution for SASs that provides multilevel multi-factor
   authentication and attribute-based authorization by deploying public key

   verification and access control mechanisms using attribute certificates.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new method for transient simulation, using
   high-order stable methods, of microwave structures modeled using a large
   number of lumped components. The target of the proposed technique is
   circuit-based simulation of the large linear circuits that arise from
   full-wave modeling of distributed structures, such as transmission lines
   and microstrip elements, along with the terminating nonlinear devices.
   In this case, the cost of the solution of the linear system typically
   dominates the computational effort. The proposed method takes advantage
   of the special structure of the block matrices in these applications to
   reduce the computational cost significantly. The core of the proposed
   algorithm is based on the idea of ``node tearing{''} to separate the
   large linear sub-circuits from the nonlinear devices. This idea
   faciliates handling the linear sub-circuits using a better matrix
   factorization technique, resulting in faster simulations compared to
   classical techniques.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{74-84}},

Abstract = {{This paper suggests the optimal tuning of low-cost fuzzy controllers
   dedicated to a class of servo systems by means of three new evolutionary
   optimization algorithms: Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Simulated Annealing (SA)
   algorithm. The processes in these servo systems are characterized by
   second-order models with an integral component and variable parameters;
   therefore the objective functions in the optimization problems include
   the output sensitivity functions of the sensitivity models defined with
   respect to the parametric variations of the processes. The servo systems
   are controlled by Takagi-Sugeno proportional-integral-fuzzy controllers
   (T-S PI-FCs) that consist of two inputs, triangular input membership
   functions, nine rules in the rule base, the SUM and PROD operators in
   the inference engine, and the weighted average method in the
   defuzzification module. The T-S PI-FCs are implemented as low-cost fuzzy
   controllers because of their simple structure and of the only three
   tuning parameters because of mapping the parameters of the linear
   proportional-integral (PI) controllers onto the parameters of the fuzzy
   ones in terms of the modal equivalence principle and of the Extended
   Symmetrical Optimum method. The optimization problems are solved by GSA,
   PSO and SA resulting in fuzzy controllers with a reduced parametric
   sensitivity. The comparison of the three evolutionary algorithms is
   carried out in the framework of a case study focused on the optimal
   tuning of T-S PI-FCs meant for the position control system of a servo
   system laboratory equipment. Reduced process gain sensitivity is
   ensured. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to create a task-based support
   architecture for developing clinical decision support systems (CDSSs)
   that assist physicians in making decisions at the point-of-care in the
   emergency department (ED). The backbone of the proposed architecture was
   established by a task-based emergency workflow model for a
   patient-physician encounter.
   Methods: The architecture was designed according to an agent-oriented
   paradigm. Specifically, we used the O-MaSE (Organization-based
   Multi-agent System Engineering) method that allows for iterative
   translation of functional requirements into architectural components
   (e.g., agents). The agent-oriented paradigm was extended with
   ontology-driven design to implement ontological models representing
   knowledge required by specific agents to operate.
   Results: The task-based architecture allows for the creation of a CDSS
   that is aligned with the task-based emergency workflow model. It
   facilitates decoupling of executable components (agents) from embedded
   domain knowledge (ontological models), thus supporting their
   interoperability, sharing, and reuse. The generic architecture was
   implemented as a pilot system, MET3-AE - a CDSS to help with the
   management of pediatric asthma exacerbation in the ED. The system was
   evaluated in a hospital ED.
   Conclusions: The architecture allows for the creation of a CDSS that
   integrates support for all tasks from the task-based emergency workflow
   model, and interacts with hospital information systems. Proposed
   architecture also allows for reusing and sharing system components and
   knowledge across disease-specific CDSSs.}},

Abstract = {{As aortic valve (AV) repairs become more sophisticated, surgeons need
   increasingly detailed information about the structure and function of
   this valve. Unlike two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography
   (2D-TEE), using three-dimensional (3D)-TEE makes it possible to image
   the entire AV. We hypothesized that measuring coaptation surface area
   (CoapSA) would be feasible and reproducible, and CoapSA would decrease
   in patients with aortic insufficiency.
   We developed a new technique to calculate the AV-CoapSA using 3D-TEE. We
   measured the coaptation surfaces between the right coronary cusp/left
   coronary cusp, right coronary cusp/non-coronary cusp, and left coronary
   cusp/non-coronary cusp in ten normal AVs and ten AVs with
   moderate-severe aortic insufficiency (AI). Since computer models have
   previously shown that CoapSA is trapezoidal, we used the formula:
   trapezoid area = length x (medial coaptation height + lateral coaptation
   height)/2. The total CoapSA was calculated by adding all three areas. To
   adjust for valve size, we indexed the value to the diameter of the
   ventricular aortic junction (VAJ). Measurements were performed by two
   observers.
   The intra-observer correlation was 0.84 for one observer (P < 0.0001)
   and 0.93 for the other (P < 0.0001). The inter-observer correlation was
   0.87 (P < 0.0001). In normal valves, the CoapSA {[}mean total (standard
   deviation)] was significantly greater than in the insufficient valves
   {[}1.61 (0.31) cm(2) vs 1.03 (0.22) cm(2), respectively; P < 0.001].
   After indexing for the VAJ diameter, the total CoapSA remained
   significantly greater in normal valves than in insufficient valves.
   In this proof of concept study, we present a new and innovative
   technique to measure AV-CoapSA using 3D-TEE. It is reproducible and
   shows decreased CoapSA in patients with AI. Coaptation surface area may
   provide insight into mechanisms of AI and may have predictive value
   following AV repair.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid forensic science is a newly flourishing research area that is
   tightly coupled with cyber and physical security of the smart grid.
   Post-mortem analysis of a power system after a cyber attack or natural
   disaster generally provides the most accurate comprehension of the
   real-world vulnerabilities of the system and helps to protect the grid
   against similar attacks in the future as well as avoid failures during
   disasters. Besides increasing the security level of the smart grid,
   smart grid forensics aids evidence collection for the service of
   criminal justice. For instance, data extracted from smart meters and
   data collectors can provide evidence to legal proceedings in electricity
   theft matters. Furthermore, authentication and timestamping audio
   recordings using power grid frequency have been employed in several
   recent academic studies, as well as by the Metropolitan Police Forensic
   Audio Laboratory in London. Briefly, smart grid forensic science is
   emerging as a powerful security component of the power system. On the
   other hand, storage and processing of the enormous amount of data
   introduce significant challenges together with the privacy issue. In
   this article, we introduce the emerging application areas of smart grid
   forensic science, discuss the challenges, and outline the open issues in
   the topic. This article aims to serve as a roadmap for future smart grid
   forensic studies.}},

Pages = {{H22-H27}},
Abstract = {{Several biosensing techniques like SPR and QCM use glass as the
   substrate, bearing a thin Au layer which serves as the sensing surface.
   Other substrates of interest include Si due to processing knowledge and
   the potential integration of electronics, and Cytop which has a
   refractive index close to that of water. Au on glass is highly
   crystalline, with a large 111 character, especially after annealing,
   whereas on Si and on Cytop, Au is non-textured
   ({''}polycrystalline{''}). These structural differences result in
   distinct voltammetric behavior, both faradaic and capacitive, of SAM-
   and protein-coated Au on different substrate types. A contact angle and
   double-layer capacitance examination of protein adsorption on SAM-coated
   Au on these substrates, and electrochemical desorption of the resulting
   molecular stacks, indicates that the usual assumption that hydrophobic
   SAMs promote adsorption and hydrophilic ones prevent adsorption is not
   universally true, and depends both on the protein type and the
   substrate. Thus, caution is advised against applying results obtained on
   one substrate to another. On the other hand, systems utilizing
   bioconjugation seem to be much less sensitive to Au type, and thus the
   underlying substrate. Electrochemical desorption of proteins from Au
   does occur but with limited efficiency. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{Urban water demand (UWD) is highly dependent on interacting natural and
   socio-economic factors, and thus a wide range of data analysis and
   forecasting methods are required to fully understand the issue. This
   study applies, for the first time, the continuous wavelet transform to
   determine changes in the temporal pattern of UWD and its potential
   meteorological drivers for three major Canadian cities: Calgary,
   Montreal, and Ottawa. This analysis is complemented by Fourier and
   cross-spectral analysis to determine inter-relationships and the
   significance of the patterns detected. The results show that the annual
   (365 days) cycle provides the most consistent and significant
   relationship between UWD and meteorological drivers. Wavelet analysis
   shows that UWD is only sensitive to air temperature in the summer months
   when mean daily temperatures are greater than 10 to 12 A degrees C. For
   the three cities studied, the UWD increases by between 10 ML (Montreal)
   and 50 ML (Calgary) per day with every 1 A degrees C increase in air
   temperature. In an area with low precipitation (Calgary), there is an
   inverse relationship between UWD and precipitation during summer months.
   Wavelet transform and Fourier analysis also detected a 7-day cycle in
   UWD, particularly in the more industrialized city of Montreal, which is
   related to the working week. In general, applying the season dependent
   linear relationships between UWD and temperature is suggested as perhaps
   being more appropriate and potentially successful for forecasting,
   rather than continuous complex nonlinear algorithms that are designed to
   explain variability in the entire UWD record.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This work investigates auditory speech processing in normal
   listeners through measurement of brainstem responses to the synthetic
   vowel /a/.
   Methods: The vowel is presented in quiet and in continuous white noise
   with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of + 5, 0, - 5, and - 10 dB.
   Results: In the presence of noise, transient response waves V and A are
   delayed when compared to those evoked in quiet, whereas the amplitude of
   wave V and the steepness of the slope between waves V and A are strongly
   reduced. The spectral component of the steady-state evoked response
   corresponding to the fundamental frequency (F0) of the vowel shows
   significantly greater amplitude and local SNR in the less severe noise
   conditions compared to the quiet condition. Such increases of the
   amplitude and SNR were not observed for the spectral component
   corresponding to the first formant of the vowel (F1).
   Conclusions: Results suggest that, at F0, both local noise suppression
   and signal enhancement contribute to the SNR gain. There is suppression
   of local noise near F1, but no signal enhancement.
   Significance: The physiological SNR gain was estimated to be
   approximately + 12 dB at both F0 and F1, as stimulus SNR was reduced
   from + 5 to - 10 dB. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{Material properties needed for accurate stress analysis of the human
   aorta are still incompletely known, especially as many reports have
   ignored the presence of residual stresses in the aortic wall. To
   contribute new material regarding these issues, we carried out
   measurements and pressurization testing on ascending, thoracic and
   abdominal aortic samples from 24 human subjects aged 38-77 years, and
   evaluated the opening angle describing the circumferential residual
   stress level present in the aorta. We determined material constants for
   the aorta by gender, anatomic location and age group, according to a
   simple phenomenological constitutive model. The unpressurized aortic
   radius positively correlated with age, and the circumferential and
   longitudinal stretch ratios under systemic pressure negatively
   correlated with age, confirming the known enlargement and stiffening of
   the aorta with aging. The opening angle was measured to range from a
   minimum of 89 degrees to above 360 degrees for extreme cases. For given

   circumferential and longitudinal mural stress distributions indicated a
   profound influence of the opening angle. For instance, in the thoracic
   aorta of males aged 38-66, opening angles in the range of 0 degrees to
   80 degrees (resp. 60 degrees) may equalize the gradient of in vivo
   circumferential (resp. longitudinal) stress between the inner and outer
   layers of the aorta, as commonly expected; however, opening angles above
   160 degrees (resp. 120 degrees) may cause the gradient of
   circumferential (resp. longitudinal) stress to reverse and increase
   compared to the case without residual stress, putting the maximum
   stresses toward the adventitia instead of the intima. Even though the
   analysis of the aortic wall excluded possible longitudinal residual
   stresses as well as material inhomogeneities, such as constitutive
   differences between the intimal, medial and adventitial layers, the
   experimental data reported herein are important to aortic modeling at
   large and the better understanding of aortic pathophysiology in
   particular. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biocompatible polymers are commonly used to fabricate microfluidic
   channels for the study of biological flows such as blood microflows. The
   most common of these materials is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which is
   very hydrophobic. Oxygenated plasma is advocated to treat the PDMS with
   reported decreases in contact angle i.e. increase the hydrophilicity of
   the material in order to make the liquid flow easily. All contact angle
   studies have been reported with water. Here the contact angles of blood
   suspensions, in saline and native plasma, are compared to each other and
   water on common microfluidic chip materials. The hydrophilic effect of
   plasma-treatment on PDMS is not found to be as significant with blood
   suspensions as it is with water. Red blood cells suspended in native
   plasma are found to have a greater contact angle than those suspended in

Abstract = {{This experimental study addresses the re-initiation mechanism of
   detonation waves following the Mach reflection of a shock-flame complex.
   The detonation diffraction around a cylinder is used to reproducibly
   generate the shock-flame complex of interest. The experiments are
   performed in methane-oxygen. We use a novel experimental technique of
   coupling a two-in-line-spark flash system with a double-frame camera in
   order to obtain microsecond time resolution permitting accurate
   schlieren velocimetry. The first series of experiments compares the
   non-reactive sequence of shock reflections with the reflection over a
   rough wall under identical conditions. It was found that the hot
   reaction products generated along the rough wall are entrained by the
   wall jet into a large vortex structure behind the Mach stem. The second
   series of experiments performed in more sensitive mixtures addressed the
   sequence of events leading to the detonation establishment along the
   Mach and transverse waves. Following ignition and jet entrainment, a
   detonation first appears along the Mach stem while the transverse wave
   remains non-reactive. The structure of the unburned tongue however
   indicates local instabilities and hot spot formation, leading to the
   rapid reaction of this gas. Numerical simulations are also reported,
   confirming the sequence of ignition events obtained experimentally. (C)

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{2035-2041}},
Abstract = {{Using Fickett's model for reactive compressible flows, i.e., the
   reactive form of Burgers' equation, we address the problem of shock
   induced ignition by a piston in a reactive medium characterized by a 2
   step induction-reaction kinetics. Owing to the model's simplicity, the
   ignition and acceleration mechanism is explained using the two families
   of characteristics admitted by the model. The energy release along the
   particle paths provides the amplification of forward-traveling pressure
   waves. These waves pre-compress the medium in the induction layer ahead
   of the reaction zone, therefore changing the induction delays of
   successive particles. The variation of the induction delay provides the
   modulation of the amplification of the forward traveling pressure waves
   by controlling the residence time of the pressure waves in the reaction
   zone. A closed form analytical solution is obtained by the method of
   characteristics and high activation energy asymptotics. The acceleration
   of the reaction zone was found to be proportional to the product of the
   activation energy, the ratio of the induction to reaction time and the
   heat release. This finding provides a theoretical justification for the
   previous use of this non-dimensional number to characterize the ignition
   regimes observed experimentally in detonations and shock induced
   ignition phenomena. Numerical simulations are presented and analyzed.
   Both subsonic and supersonic internal flame propagation are observed,
   consistent with experiment and previous reactive Euler models. (C) 2012

Journal = {{EAR AND HEARING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-74}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: This study investigated speech auditory brainstem responses
   (speech ABR) with variants of a synthetic vowel in quiet and in
   background noise. Its objectives were to study the noise robustness of
   the brainstem response at the fundamental frequency F0 and at the first
   formant F1, evaluate how the resolved/unresolved harmonics regions in
   speech contribute to the response at F0, and investigate the origin of
   the response at F0 to resolved and unresolved harmonics in speech.
   Design: In total, 18 normal-hearing subjects (11 women, aged 18-33
   years) participated in this study. Speech ABRs were recorded using
   variants of a 300 msec formant-synthesized /a/ vowel in quiet and in
   white noise. The first experiment employed three variants containing the
   first three formants F1 to F3, F1 only, and F2 and F3 only with relative
   formant levels following those reported in the literature. The second
   experiment employed three variants containing F1 only, F2 only, and F3
   only, with the formants equalized to the same level and the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maintained at -5 dB. Overall response
   latency was estimated, and the amplitude and local SNR of the envelope
   following response at F0 and of the frequency following response at F1
   were compared for the different stimulus variants in quiet and in noise.
   Results: The response at F0 was more robust to noise than that at F1.
   There were no statistically significant differences in the response at
   F0 caused by the three stimulus variants in both experiments in quiet.
   However, the response at F0 with the variant dominated by resolved
   harmonics was more robust to noise than the response at F0 with the
   stimulus variants dominated by unresolved harmonics. The latencies of
   the responses in all cases were very similar in quiet, but the responses
   at F0 due to resolved and unresolved harmonics combined nonlinearly when
   both were present in the stimulus.
   Conclusions: Speech ABR has been suggested as a marker of central
   auditory processing. The results of this study support earlier work on
   the differential susceptibility to noise of the F0 and F1 components of
   the evoked response. In the case of F0, the results support the view
   that in speech, the pitch of resolved harmonics and that of unresolved
   harmonics are processed in different but interacting pathways that
   converge in the upper brainstem. Pitch plays an important role in speech
   perception, and speech ABR can offer a window into the neural extraction
   of the pitch of speech and how it may change with hearing impairment.

Abstract = {{Porous asymmetric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane
   were fabricated via a phase-inversion method using surface modifying
   macromolecules (SMM) (1 wt\%) as the additive in the spinning dope.
   Distilled water and tap water were used as internal and external
   coagulation bath, respectively. The membranes were characterized in
   terms of gas permeation, wetting resistance, overall porosity, contact
   angle and collapsing pressure. CO2 stripping from diethanolamine (DEA)
   solutions was conducted through the gas-liquid membrane contactor. The
   effect of some operating conditions such as gas and liquid velocities,
   DEA concentration and rich solution temperature on the CO2 stripping
   flux and efficiency were investigated. By increasing liquid flow rate to
   200 ml.min(-1), the maximum CO2 stripping efficiency of almost 82\% was
   achieved. In addition, an increase in the liquid flow rate resulted in a
   significant increase of CO2 stripping flux. By increasing the liquid
   flow rate from 50 to 200 ml.min(-1), the CO2 flux increased by 900\%. By
   increasing the gas velocity the CO2 desorption flux increased but this
   changing was negligible. The effect of rich solution temperature was
   investigated and the results showed that the CO2 desorption flux
   increased with increasing the solution temperature from 80 to 90 C. The
   results of DEA concentration enhancement on the CO2 desorption flux
   showed that the CO2 stripping flux increased drastically with enrichment
   of the DEA concentration from 1.0 to 3.0 (mol l(-1)). Therefore, the
   higher stripping efficiency can be achieved by applying the higher
   liquid flow rate, temperature and DEA concentration in the absorbent
   liquid in the membrane contactor module. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{classification is a supervised learning technique that predicts the
   classes of unobserved data by employing a model built from available
   data. One of the efficient ways to represent this predictive model is to
   express it as an optimal set of classification rules to provide
   comprehensibility and precision, simultaneously. In this paper, we
   propose a novel incremental parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
   approach for classification rule discovery. Our proposed method
   separates the training data into a set of data chunks regarding the
   classes and extracts optimal set of classification rules for each chunk
   in a parallel manner. In order to extract the rules from data chunks, we
   introduce an incremental PSO algorithm in which the previously extracted
   rules are directly employed to initialize the swarm population.
   Moreover, in each generation of the swarm, a tournament method is
   employed to substitute the weak individuals with strong extracted
   knowledge. To support the parallelism, we assign a PSO thread for each
   data chunk. As soon as all the PSO threads are completed, the extracted
   rules are integrated into a rule-base to construct a classification
   model. The evaluation results of the proposed approach on six datasets

Abstract = {{During the last couple of decades, evolutionary and swarm intelligence
   algorithms have significantly advanced the state of the art for both
   discrete and numerical optimization. Without niching strategies, they
   usually converge to a single optimum, even in multimodal search spaces
   where numerous global or local solutions exist. In the literature,
   several niching approaches have been proposed for simultaneously
   computing multiple optima, though most of them require some
   user-specified parameters that should be calculated a priori, i.e.
   additional knowledge about the problem domain is required. Recently, it
   was demonstrated that particle swarm optimization (PSO) using a ring
   topology for neighborhood definition can give rise to robust and
   parameterless niching methods. Nevertheless, their performance
   dramatically worsens when the dimensionality of the solution space
   hikes, thus increasing the number of local optima. This paper aims at
   enhancing the performance of these types of PSO-based algorithms by
   introducing two procedures: (1) a differential operator for improving
   the search ability and (2) a heuristic clearing operator for controlling
   the swarm diversity. Such operators are probabilistically activated
   through a novel self-adaptive learning strategy. Empirical results
   confirm the superiority of our proposed scheme with respect to six other
   competitive niching techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are widely considered as
   indispensable elements of the future intelligent transportation systems
   that are aiming to apply information and communications technologies to
   improve transportation safety and quality of experience. We present our
   take on a relatively unexplored problem, exploiting VANETs for on-road
   surveillance. The proposal is inspired by multi-agent systems intended
   for surveillance, e.g., a distributed camera network. We propose a
   tracking system composed of three operational modules, namely,
   localization, tracking data collection and prediction of future
   locations of a target. Camera equipped onboard units (OBUs) act as
   remote mobile sensors. Tracking messages are communicated among the OBUs
   and roadside units (RSUs). These messages are also triggered in the
   possible locations of the target in a timely manner. Therefore, it is
   imperative to scope the search to limit the number of OBUs and RSUs
   involved in the tracking operation, thus, minimizing the number of
   tracking messages. To this end, a movement modeling technique utilizes
   the OBU-observations to classify the target's movement pattern to aid
   future trajectory prediction. In our previous work, we proposed a
   Dirichlet-multinomial (D-M) model under the Bayesian estimation
   framework. In this paper, we present newly identified cues towards
   improving the movement estimation model. The D-M model is constrained to
   the assumption that all the choice sets are identical across trials. We
   demonstrate that this is almost never the case. The improved model
   exploits a choice model, called the conditional logit. The conditional
   logit model is attractive when choice sets vary across trials.
   Additionally, we weight outcome of each trial according to the given
   choice sets to achieve higher estimation accuracy. We evaluate the new
   model by means of an experimental analysis and compare results with the
   D-M model.}},

Abstract = {{Warning data dissemination using vehicular networks is envisioned in
   Intelligent Transportation System applications. Due to extended
   connectivity of roadway vehicles and consequent extension of region of
   data propagation, data may be accessed in some geographical areas where
   it is neither relevant nor effectively beneficial. Moreover, propagating
   data to irrelevant regions increases communication cost. Therefore it is
   crucial to limit the warning data dissemination to a certain region.
   This research strives to address the above challenges by proposing an
   effective warning data dissemination which restricts data dissemination
   to a Region of Interest (RoI). Among the factors influencing the RoI
   determination, the type of warning message is considered so that the
   more severe the incident, the wider the RoI. Also, in order to reduce
   message overhead during data dissemination, the strategy which assigns
   the responsibility of packet retransmission to only certain vehicles
   (relays) is deployed. In the selection of the relay point, border relay
   area where the relay point is placed, is adapted to the traffic density
   so that the higher the traffic density, the narrower the relay area. The
   proposed scheme informs the vehicles located in the immediate vicinity
   of an incident, reduces message overhead, and prevents unnecessary and
   inappropriate message dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{There has recently been a considerable amount of research work on using
   data compression techniques to minimize the volume of transmitted
   traffic, and consequently assist in reducing power consumption levels in
   Wireless Sensor Networks. In this paper, we present a data Oriented
   approach called Model-based Clustering (MBC) which shrinks the
   communication flows between sensor nodes and sink node in a way that
   contributes to reducing power consumption in wireless sensor networks.
   The proposed work utilizes the capabilities of mixture-model based
   clustering to exploit both the temporal locality and slowly varying
   properties of the sensed data to model the sensor network's traffic. The
   generated models will be utilized by both the sensor nodes to process
   the sensed raw measurements and sink node to recover the original data
   without requesting those data to be completely transferred by the
   limited resources' sensor nodes. Results show that our approach
   contributes to decreasing energy consumption in resource-limited sensor
   network.}},

Abstract = {{A new connectivity metric is proposed for cognitive radio networks. The
   analysis is developed based on a generalized model for cognitive radio
   networks where multiple primary users with independent activity factors
   are considered. The adjacent matrix elements, representing the weights
   associated to the network graph edges, are set proportional to the
   activity factors of primary users. It is shown that the proposed
   connectivity metric is a monotonically decreasing measure with the
   primary users activity factors. Furthermore, the metric efficiently
   determines the network connectivity under different primary users
   activities. The proposed connectivity metric is compared to the
   probability of finding a route metric which is commonly used as a
   measure for network connectivity. It is shown that the proposed metric
   captures the behavior of the probability of finding a route method with
   significant complexity reduction. Compared to the algebraic connectivity
   metric, the proposed metric is more robust in the presence of isolated
   nodes. Finally, the proposed metric can be utilized to analytically
   study and design cognitive radio networks.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to monitor and control power
   utility assets in the smart grid is gaining increasing popularity due to
   their various desirable features. WSNs with multihop cluster tree
   topologies solve the limited coverage problem of sensor nodes. However,
   in smart grid monitoring applications, data rates could increase
   suddenly due to the occurrence of critical faults in the monitored
   environment. Critical data transmission could experience excessive
   delays because of this increase in the packet arrival rates. Therefore,
   there should be an optimum operating point in the network where the
   network could handle high packet arrival rates and maintain low latency
   at the same time. In this paper, we present an optimization scheme that
   can achieve low latency while maintaining high reliability values.
   Furthermore, we design our scheme to provide Quality of Service (QoS)
   differentiation to high priority and delay critical data. Results show
   that our proposed scheme significantly reduces the delay while providing
   high reliability and incurring low energy consumption.}},

   the interconnection of cloud data centers over a wide area network,
   namely the US National Backbone, via IP over elastic optical transport
   medium. Initially, we present a numerical model to analyze the outage
   probability of various demand types such as downstream data center,
   upstream data center and data center-to-data center demands. Then, we
   propose two provisioning schemes, namely, Minimum Outage Probability
   Provisioning (Min-OPP) and Resilient Provisioning with Minimum Power
   Consumption (RPMPC) where the latter is an extension of the former
   incorporating energy-awareness. Through numerical results, we show that
   energy-awareness in the resilient design reduces the power consumption
   in the cloud backbone by approximately 7\% when compared to Min-OPP with
   significantly lower (45\%similar to 97\%) outage probabilities for data
   center demands when compared to a naive energy-minimized provisioning.
   Furthermore, RPMPC introduces shorter path delays which are not higher
   than those introduced by Min-OPP.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, networks play an indispensable role in social life, and social
   networks have become a new advertising medium for offline activities.
   Previous studies of information diffusion or behavior spread over social
   networks have mostly focused on diffusion models and analysis of virtual
   interaction between online users, and very few of them focus on the
   propagation of real world activities in these social networks. To
   address this problem, we use data obtained from the Chinese largest
   recommendation social network - Douban, and study how the offline
   activities spread from one user to another through Douban. By using
   cascading subgraphs and diffusion trees, we break a whole cascade into
   local subgraphs. After analyzing the activities of about 1.47 million
   users, we observe the statistical and topological characteristics of
   these local cascading subgraphs. Next, we find the size and degree
   distributions of these cascading subgraphs and several common patterns
   of topology of local cascades. Moreover, we also have some other
   interesting discoveries, like the relation between the number of initial
   adopters and the final cascade size, and the underlying influences
   driving user behaviors. Finally, we propose a diffusion model that can
   generate information cascades that follow the patterns we have observed,
   and validate it by empirical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of wireless networks, the solution for
   degradation of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over wireless
   networks becomes more and more significant because of the software
   reusability. In order to improve the performance of TCP protocol,
   several studies have been proposed in different directions. Some of them
   attempt to find a suitable path for TCP transmission. Expected
   Transmission Count (ETX) is one of the most famous routing metrics to
   select a path with the least expected transmissions. However, ETX does
   not consider the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) mechanism in TCP, which
   generates extra transmissions. By modifying the ETX, we proposed a
   Frame-based TCP-ETX (FTCP-ETX), which calculates the expected frame
   transmissions for a TCP segment transmission. To evaluate our proposal,
   we conducted simulations by comparing FTCP-ETX, ETX and DSDV. Simulation
   results reveal that our routing metric improves TCP performance by
   selecting a better path.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we proposed a new framework for obtaining the spongy and
   cortical bones from the MRI data. The method focuses on the accurate
   extraction of the edges of the target tissues, which is the main
   drawback of the previous works. This framework first limits the
   searching area for the bone voxels from the whole data to a small strip
   around the edges of the cortical and spongy bones then applies a very
   accurate segmentation on the searching area using the newly developed
   deformable kernel Fuzzy C-Means (DKFCM) algorithm, which is proposed in
   this paper. Comparing the results of this work with previous
   segmentation methods on a testing dataset consisting of 10,485,760
   voxels demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method especially on
   the edges of the spongy and cortical bone.}},

Abstract = {{The EPCglobal Network is a global network developed to ensure global
   interoperability between trading partners in supply chains. Its main
   goal consists of providing real-time and accurate traceability of items
   in the supply chains. One of the major building blocks of the EPCglobal
   Network is the Object Naming Service (ONS) which is a central lookup
   service used mainly to locate the EPC manager information sources of a
   given EPC. Discovery services refer to a suite of services enabling any
   user, subject to authentication, to retrieve all relevant data, subject
   to access control policies, related to a given EPC in the EPCglobal
   Network. Many promising DHT-based distributed and secure architectures
   have been proposed to make the ONS more scalable and more secure than
   the current ONS specifications. Some of them focused on improving a
   specific aspect of the existing ONS architecture while others suggested
   integrated solutions for various weaknesses of the current ONS system.
   In this paper, we present a DHT-based, scalable and secure architecture
   for data lookup in the EPCglobal Network. The proposed architecture aims
   at replacing the current ONS system with a secure distributed Discovery
   Services system.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) suffers degradation in wireless
   networks because, among other factors, low quality links tend to
   interrup a TCP connection. Most of the routing protocols use the number
   of hops as path metric without considering the link condition. Expected
   Transmission Count (ETX) calculates the estimated number of
   transmissions to successfully transmit a packet, but it fails to
   calculate the correct number of transmissions for a TCP segment. In
   addition, the overhead of ETX is very high because it needs to probe all
   destinations to calculate the link loss probability. In this paper, we
   propose a novel cross layer path metric, TCP-ETX, which calculates the
   accurate number of transmissions for TCP segments and minimizes the
   protocol overhead. To evaluate our proposal, we conduct simulations and
   compare our solution to existing protocols, which shows that our
   protocol can offer a significant improvement on the TCP performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an extended architecture of the EPCglobal
   network that allows tracking objects. This architecture makes use of the
   distributed discovery services along with the EPC-BGP to provide
   detailed information about an object regardless of its location. In the
   EPCglobal network, each object is assigned an IPv6 address once it
   leaves the last gateway in the supply chain. The IP address of the last
   gateway enables backtracking of all the information about this object
   throughout the supply chain. To this end, EPC status updates are crucial
   in order to advertise any changes in the EPC into the supply chain. On
   the other hand, concurrent EPC updates, expired EPC databases and/or
   limitation of resources may cause blocking of an EPC update request.
   Therefore, we evaluate our proposed architecture in terms of blocking
   probability of the EPC update requests. To this end, We define three
   types of blocking, namely the Justified Update Blocking (JUB),
   Unjustified Update Acceptance (UUA), and Unjustified Update Blocking
   (UUB). We investigate the impact of the frequency of update
   advertisements on the blocking probability. Numerical results confirm
   the trade-off between blocking probability and communication /
   computation overhead due to EPC update messages. However, further
   investigation in terms of the number of advertisements and the distance
   between the routing tables confirms that advertisement of EPC update
   messages based on certain thresholds can overcome this trade-off.}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption in the residential sector is a considerable source of
   a wide range of environmental problems. It has been mentioned that the
   energy consumption in this sector represents 46\% of total energy
   consumption and 23\% of greenhouse gas emissions. Technology and
   services can help consumers manage the energy generated by their
   renewable or traditional electric grid. Service oriented architecture
   (SOA) has recently become very popular. SOA is an approach to build
   distributed systems that deliver application functionality as services
   to end-user applications or to build other services We adopt an approach
   to formulate the problem of managing energy in the building in a general
   form of linear programming by optimizing three criteria: environmental,
   economic and user comfort. First, we formulate this problem into an
   integer linear programming (ILP) problem. A round-up heuristic algorithm
   which is based on linear programming relaxation is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is the leading edge concept which combines the

   the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) business. This new
   business model aims at moving the services such as software, platform
   and/or infrastructure to a shared pool of resources which are mainly
   housed in the data centers. In this paper, we propose a novel
   virtualization scheme for the cloud network with the objective of
   provisioning the demands among the data centers in a Time-Of-Use (ToU)
   pricing-aware manner while ensuring maximum energy savings in the cloud
   network throughout the day. In addition to the unicast demands between
   backbone nodes, upstream user demand destined to data centers, and
   downstream data center demands originating from many data centers, here,
   we also consider inter-data center traffic in order to enable workload
   sharing between the data centers. Through numerical results, we show
   that significant savings in terms of operational expenditures (Opex) can
   be achieved while demands can be provisioned with less energy
   consumption in the data centers and network equipments. Furthermore, we
   show that incorporation of inter-data center workload sharing in
   ToU-aware provisioning can mitigate the increased propagation delay
   introduced to the user demands submitted to the cloud.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel matting method is proposed to automatically
   detect and separate foreground, background and transitional (unknown)
   regions in a color image. In order to detect the background color,
   K-means clustering in YCbCr color space is firstly used to classify the
   background colors into a limited number of clusters. Then the spatial
   information is further used to refine the background and minimize the
   unknown regions. In this case, an image can be automatically segmented
   into three hard regions: foreground, background and unknown regions. For
   transitional (unknown) regions, the alpha matting based on Wang's robust
   matting algorithm is utilized to refine the accuracy of the separation
   results. By combining an automatical background determination metric and
   Wang's robust matting, the proposed matting method can handle images
   with single-colored or gridded background. The required user input is
   significantly simplified compared to conventional alpha matting schemes
   which require users to provide a hard image segmentation manually. The
   experimental results show that improved matting results can be achieved
   for complex unknown regions which contain semi-transparent materials or
   tiny objects such as hair stripes.}},

Abstract = {{Convexity properties of error rates of a class of decoders, including
   the ML/min-distance one as a special case, are studied for arbitrary
   constellations. Earlier results obtained for the AWGN channel are
   extended to a wide class of (non-Gaussian) noise densities, including
   unimodal and spherically-invariant noise. Under these broad conditions,
   symbol error rates are shown to be convex functions of the SNR in the
   high-SNR regime with an explicitly-determined threshold, which depends
   only on the constellation dimensionality and minimum distance, thus
   enabling an application of the powerful tools of convex optimization to
   such digital communication systems in a rigorous way. It is the
   decreasing nature of the noise power density around the decision region
   boundaries that insures the convexity of symbol error rates in the
   general case. The known high/low SNR bounds of the convexity/concavity
   regions are tightened and no further improvement is shown to be possible
   in general.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a manipulator robot surface following algorithm
   using a 3D model of vehicle body panels acquired by a network of rapid
   but low resolution RGB-D sensors. The main objective of this work is to
   scan and dynamically explore regions of interest over an automotive
   vehicle body under visual guidance by closely following the surface
   curves and maintaining close proximity to the object. The work is
   motivated by applications in automated vehicles inspection and screening
   in security applications. The proposed path planning strategy is
   developed based on a perception-modeling-planning-action approach. Raw
   data rapidly captured by a calibrated network of Kinect sensors are
   processed to provide the required 3D surface shape of objects, normal
   measurements, orientation estimation, and obstacle detection. A robust
   motion planning method is designed that relies on this information,
   resulting in a safe trajectory that is planned to follow and explore the
   curved surfaces while avoiding collision with protruding components of
   the vehicle. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is
   validated through experimental results with a 7-DOF manipulator
   navigating over automotive body panels.}},

Abstract = {{An optical triangular waveform generator using a polarization modulator
   (PolM) in a Sagnac loop is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. A
   triangular pulse train has a Fourier series with only odd harmonics,
   which can be realized using a sinusoidal signal to modulate a light wave
   at a PolM in a Sagnac loop. In the proposed triangular waveform
   generator, a sinusoidal microwave signal is applied to the PolM in the
   Sagnac loop. Due to the velocity mismatch, only the clockwise light wave
   in the Sagnac loop is effectively modulated by the sinusoidal microwave
   signal at the PolM, and the counter-clockwise light wave is not
   modulated. Along the clockwise direction, the even-order sidebands are
   suppressed by tuning the polarization controller (PC) after the PolM. As
   a result, a modulated signal with only the odd order sidebands is
   generated, which is combined with the counter-clockwise propagated
   optical carrier at the output of a polarization beam splitter (PBS). By
   applying the combined signal to a photodetector (PD), a microwave signal
   with only the odd harmonics is generated, which corresponds to a
   triangular waveform. A theoretical analysis is developed, which is
   validated by an experiment. A triangular waveform with a repetition rate

Abstract = {{Photonic generation of an arbitrary phase-coded microwave waveform with

   optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is proposed and experimentally

   The optical sideband is injected into a polarization modulator (PolM)
   jointly with part of the light wave from the OEO laser source, with
   their polarization directions alighted, respectively, with the principal
   axes of the PolM. An electrical phase coding signal is applied to the
   PolM, to generate two complementarily phase-coded light waves which are
   converted to an electrical signal by the two signals at a highspeed
   photodetector (PD). The key significance of the technique is that a
   phase-coded signal with a tunable microwave carrier frequency and a
   reconfigurable coding pattern can be generated without using a separate
   microwave source. The technique is experimentally verified. The

Abstract = {{In critical infrastructure monitoring applications, the packet arrival
   rates of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may abruptly increase when
   cascaded failures are observed in the monitored environment. WSNs with
   cluster-tree topologies could experience excessive delays because of
   this increase in packet arrival rates. Therefore, there should be an
   optimum operating point in the network where the network could
   accommodate high packet arrival rates with low latency. In this paper,
   we propose an adaptive scheme that can achieve low latency while
   maintaining high reliability values in cluster-tree based WSNs.
   Furthermore, our scheme provides Quality of Service (QoS)
   differentiation to high priority data. Analytical and simulation results
   show that our scheme significantly reduces the delay while maintaining
   high reliability and energy efficiency values.}},

Abstract = {{The mobile networks are continually evolving in order to support more

   important techniques for high data rate wireless multiuser communication
   systems, such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and IEEE 802.16
   Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), not only
   because of its flexibility in resource allocation, but also because of
   its ability to exploit multiuser diversity. The scheduling algorithms
   that both support the QoS and maintain the throughput required to ensure
   users' satisfaction are essential to the development of the next network

Abstract = {{Energy routing has not been feasible in the traditional power grid due
   to real-time nature of the electrical services. Electricity is generated
   and used almost in real time where the balance between the two is
   maintained by regulation services. Additionally, small number of fixed
   storage units are utilized to store some portion of the generated
   energy. In the future electricity grids, Mobile Energy Buffers (MEB)
   together with local energy buffering capabilities, will be the enabler
   of energy routing. In this paper, we propose an energy routing framework
   for low and medium voltage electricity distribution systems that house
   prioritized MEBs, local buffers and Delay-Tolerant electrical Loads
   (DTL). We model the distribution system as a token-based system where
   energy transfer between MEBs and local storage units rely on the
   availability of tokens that are generated by DTLs. Coordination of token
   advertisement, storage interest and token access is maintained by
   machine-to-machine communications. The underlying communication
   technology can be PowerLine Communications (PLC) or a medium-range
   wireless communication technology. We provide a mathematical analysis of
   the token-network with DTLs and prioritized MEBs. We show that
   coordination and prioritization allow lower blocking rates for high
   priority MEBs. Our analysis provides valuable insights for utility
   planning decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its great promises, current Cloud offering is still typically
   rather static and does not support very dynamic execution patterns. In
   fact, while dynamic resource allocation is typically required to ensure
   efficient and effective usage of the Cloud resources, Cloud providers
   have to deal with complex services, usually treated as black-boxes;
   hence, the estimation of the maximum number of resources that could
   improve service execution is a big challenge. This paper proposes and
   explores a novel automatic service rescaling approach to solve the
   deployment scaling problem. The proposed scheme, called Dynamic Cloud
   Infrastructure (DCI), has been designed and verified as a new
   architecture for the IBM Cloud infrastructure. DCI provides hints useful
   to understand if a particular service could take full advantage from
   additional resources enabling automatic discovery of the deployment
   configuration that jointly addresses high service scalability and low
   resource consumption. We detail the lessons learnt from the application
   of the proposed solution in the IBM Smart Bay project and present
   experimental results that demonstrate our approach as a viable first
   step toward run-time service scaling.}},

Abstract = {{Research has shown that the functionalities of proteins are largely
   influenced by their three dimensional (3D) shapes. This observation is
   especially relevant in drug design, where the knowledge of the 3D
   structure of a protein enables pharmacologists to select the best
   binding proteins when aiming to moderate functions. However, a
   relatively small number of 3D shapes are known. In contrast, amino acid
   sequences may be acquired through very efficient automated, high
   throughput experimental methods and the amino acid sequences of a vast
   number of proteins have therefore been identified. It follows that it is
   important to address this knowledge gap. To this end, this paper
   introduces an approach to predict the 3D shapes of proteins, utilizing
   feed-forward artificial neural networks. Our novel solution allows one
   to learn the representations of the 3D shape associated with a protein
   by starting directly from its amino acid sequence descriptors. Once a
   neural network is trained, our search engine enables one to retrieve the
   closest known 3D shape associated with an unknown, so-called query
   protein. We evaluate the performance of our approach against the Protein
   Data Bank (PDB), by considering proteins from a diverse set of families.
   Our results indicate that our system is able to accurately find the most
   similar protein structures for a wide variety of protein 3D shapes and
   diverse protein family sizes.}},

Abstract = {{To improve safety, a warning message in VANETs should be delivered both
   reliably and urgently. Existing solutions either tend to compromise
   propagation delay or do not reach high reliability due to broadcast
   storm problem caused by excessive retransmissions. We propose Receiver
   Consensus, which exploits geographical information to help nodes
   autonomously achieve agreement on forwarding strategies. Each forwarding
   candidate ranks itself and its neighbors (who affirmatively or
   potentially received the message already) by distance to the centroid of
   neighbors in need of message, to assign different priority in forwarding
   among neighboring nodes and remarkably suppress unnecessary
   retransmission, while enabling best nodes to transmit the packet without
   waiting. The effectiveness and efficiency of this method are validated
   through extensive simulations under 802.11p settings. The results
   demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves the high reliability of
   leading state-of-the-art solutions, while at the same time significantly
   enhances timeliness, dedicating itself to disseminating emergency
   messages in 2D vehicular networks. Our solution is also superior to all
   existing solutions in 1-D scenarios. The algorithm is also generalized
   for vehicles with heterogeneous transmission ranges as follows.
   Candidate neighbors are ranked using d r instead of d for ranking, where
   d is the distance to the ideal forwarding location and r is the
   communication range of a node.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the use of composite materials in different applications like
   aircrafts, wind turbines and towers has developed rapidly. This rapid
   development of large size composite structures is, though, not without
   its problems, particularly in case of difference in lamination when
   using various materials. Health monitoring and delaminating preventive
   maintenance are important issues when using composite materials. The use
   of smart structures enables realtime monitoring of the composite
   materials and permits applications using sensors to appropriately arrive
   to a desired state. This paper presents an optimal, inexpensive and
   continuous laminated sensor based monitoring in composites using Fiber
   Bragg Grating (FBG). This paper investigates layered composites and ELM
   based on the static and dynamic equations and the mechanical behavior
   with respect to stress and strain. De laminating criteria of a composite
   cantilever beam can be analyzed based on wavelength shifting relations
   of FBG and in the resulting reflected spectrum caused by applied forces
   or displacements.}},

Abstract = {{Long-Term Evolution (LTE) has now become the leading candidate for
   facilitating interoperability and information sharing among different
   types of first responders, in what has come to be commonly known as
   Public Safety Networks (PSNs). However, research has shown that the
   bandwidth assigned to these networks will not be sufficient to support
   the offered load and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the
   applications. Thus, resource management and context-awareness become
   significantly important in maximizing the efficiency of the network and
   prioritizing the traffic according to its importance. This paper aims to
   formulate the problems of resource management and context-awareness in
   PSNs. Therefore, the main challenges and requirements of these problems
   will be identified. In addition, a condensed survey of some important
   resource management and context-awareness techniques will be offered.
   Furthermore, a conceptual framework that encompasses ideas for these
   topics in different layers will be proposed as a guide for future
   researchers.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a novel experimental technique for measuring the
   transient response of pore-water-pressures (PWP) through a sand bed on a
   steep slope, typical to homogenous non-cohesive earthfill dams or dikes,
   under supercritical flow using planar overtopping tests. The use of
   seepage-control elements in 3-D breach overtopping simulations of
   embankment breach failures carried out in laboratory flumes has been
   previously investigated by the authors. In this study, the real-time
   PWPs were recorded using inexpensive tensiometer-transducer probe
   assemblies (TTPAs), designed, assembled and tested for planar
   overtopping tests in hydraulic flumes. The TTPAs, comprised of a 2 mm
   diameter and 2 cm long ceramic probe, were installed at several
   locations below the downstream embankment slope face to capture the
   transient PWP response throughout the saturated-unsaturated zone with
   minimal intrusion in the soil and water mediums. This paper also
   describes the installation process, calibration, and response tests for
   the TTPAs conducted in the Geotechnical and Hydraulic Engineering
   Laboratories at the University of Ottawa, Canada. A transient flownet
   analysis was also developed using the measured PWPs to define the
   magnitude and direction of the exit hydraulic gradient at the soil-water
   boundary of the eroding downstream slope. The time-history of the slope
   erosion and its subsequent retreat was captured and analyzed by means of
   a photogrammetric technique. Using a time-series of bed and water
   surface elevations, the evolution of the bed slope profile was further
   converted into an erosion rate and sediment flux, using the
   1-dimensional sediment continuity equation. The shear stress acting on
   the eroding bed, determined by spatial and temporal discretization of
   the flow parameters, was modified to account for the non-hydrostatic
   pressure distribution subjected by upward and downward seepage
   determined from the transient flownet analysis. The dimension less bed
   mobility parameters, bed shear stress and sediment transport rate, which
   are employed in classical sediment formulations, were modified to
   account for seepage across the porous boundary. The degree of
   saturation, and consequently the seepage through the embankment models,
   was varied using different drainage configurations. The results of the
   modified bed mobility relationship, obtained for one of the embankment
   configurations using the proposed novel technique, revealed the
   importance of the seepage mechanism in supercritical flow on steep
   slopes particularly with near incipient fluidization conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Submerged water intake structures are commonly used to collect seawater
   for cooling in industrial facilities such as power stations, refineries
   and LNG plants. A typical submerged intake structure for a coastal site
   consists of an open-ended vertical pipe located above the seabed and
   below a horizontal plate supported on several columns. The horizontal
   plate, known as a velocity cap, helps mitigate vortex formation and
   protects against entrainment of fish and other marine life. Estimating
   wave-induced forces on these types of structures is challenging,
   particularly when the intakes are located under breaking waves in
   shallow water. The relationships between wave properties and forces are
   not well understood, and no simple methods are available to predict
   hydrodynamic loads on submerged intakes, particularly those below
   breaking waves. This paper presents results from a series of experiments
   conducted in a wave flume at 1: 15 scale to study the hydrodynamic
   forces exerted on a generic intake structure located on a sloping seabed
   in shallow water below breaking and non-breaking waves. The model intake
   structure was exposed to a wide range of regular and irregular wave
   conditions at three water levels, while the wave properties, kinematics,
   and 6-axis forces on the intake structure were all measured
   continuously. The measurements have been analyzed to discover the
   relationship between the wave conditions and the forcing - for different
   parts of the intake and for the whole structure. This paper provides new
   insights concerning the hydrodynamic loads on submerged intake
   structures in shallow water under breaking and non-breaking waves.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses both numerical modeling and field measurements to
   describe river ice processes. River ice regime plays a significant role
   in river hydraulics and morphology in higher latitudes of the northern
   hemisphere, with important implications for hydro-electrical power
   generation operations. An ice-cover changes various river
   characteristics, including water stage and velocity distribution. These
   variations can influence sediment transport and channel morphodynamics,
   particularly during extreme conditions when ice-jamming and break-up can
   locally accelerate the flow, and ice can mechanically scour the river
   bed and banks. Although the influence of ice on rivers is tremendous and
   clear, it is not well studied largely due to the difficulty and danger
   of river ice field studies, especially during the unstable break-up
   period. In this paper we studied river ice conditions in the Lower
   Nelson River, Northern Manitoba, Canada, during winter 2012 using both
   numerical modeling and In-situ autonomous field measurements to validate
   the model predictions. The accuracy of numerical models is an intrinsic
   concern, especially in the analysis of dynamic processes such as river
   ice, and verification with field data is essential.. The ICESIM was
   originally developed by Acres International Limited (now Hatch) in 1973
   for studies of the Nelson River hydroelectric plants; since then it has
   been continuously improved. The field data were collected from a bottom
   mounted instrument pod deployed below the ice-cover for a four-month
   period (March-June 2012), which included both the stable cover and
   break-up periods. Instrumentation included a 546 kHz ASL
   Multi-Functional Acoustic Water Column Profiler (MF-AWCP) and 1200kHz
   TELEDYN RD Instrument Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for measurements
   of water velocity. The MF-AWCP could measure frazil ice particles in the
   water column and more importantly, the variation in the condition and
   thickness of the ice cover. In this paper we demonstrate the model
   capability by comparing measured and model-calculated results, focusing
   specifically on the model's ability to predict ice thickness and timing
   of ice-cover stages i.e. freeze-up, stable ice-cover, and breakup.}},

Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},

Abstract = {{Although many improvements in the manufacturing of guitars have been
   made recently, one aspect that has often been overlooked is that of the
   acoustical consistency of the final manufactured product. The aim of
   this paper is to create a better understanding of the effect of a brace
   on the frequencies of vibration of the brace-soundboard system. This
   paper seeks to shed light on why a luthier `tunes' braces when a guitar
   soundboard is hand-manufactured. A simple analytical model of a
   rectangular brace and soundboard is derived from first principles using
   Kirchhoff plate theory in order to develop insight into the effect of
   the soundboard's stiffness and brace thickness on the frequencies of the
   combined system. Natural frequencies and modeshapes of the combined
   system are calculated via the assumed shape method. Results show that by
   adjusting the thickness of the brace in order to compensate for the
   stiffness of the plate, one of the natural frequencies of the combined
   system can be adjusted to meet a desired value. However, simultaneously
   adjusting several natural frequencies cannot be done with a rectangular
   brace. Therefore modifications to the shape of the brace are explored.}},

Abstract = {{Possibilities for transforming contemporary prescriptive and
   semi-engineered design practices for timber light-frame building
   superstructures into fully-engineered design practices are discussed.
   Impetus for such change are increasing demand for construction of larger
   and taller buildings of the light-frame type; taking advantage of
   relaxation of fire performance related restrictions on heights and
   overall sizes of buildings constructed using combustible materials;
   concerns that existing design practices are not robust in ability to
   differentiate between efficient and inefficient design solutions; and
   availability of new technical information and design tools. As the title
   indicates the key to fully-engineered light-frame building
   superstructures is ability to predict how forces associated with various
   design loading scenarios flow through them from points of application to
   foundations. This narrative is based on recent research studies in
   Canada by the authors and their collaborators.}},

Abstract = {{Structured mini-/microscale reactors continue to receive attention from
   both industry and academia due to their low pressure drop, high heat and
   mass transfer rates, and ease of scale-up relative to conventional
   reactor technology. Commonly considered for reactions such as
   hydrogenations, hydrodesulfurization, oxidations, and Fischer-Tropsch
   synthesis, the performance of these systems is highly dependent on
   mixing and the interfacial area between phases. While existing
   literature describes the initial flow patterns generated by a broad
   range of two-phase contactors, few studies explore the dynamic impacts
   of downstream passive mixing elements. Experimental and computational
   methodologies for characterizing two-phase flow pattern transitions,
   pressure drop, and heat and mass transfer are discussed, with relevant
   examples for serpentine and Venturi-based passive mixing designs. The
   efficacies of these two configurations are explored in the context of
   pressure drop, conditions leading to significant interface renewal, and
   design considerations for optimizing mass transfer. Challenges associate
   with the characterization of multiphase flow through these systems are
   highlighted, and strategies suggested for both experimental and
   computational analysis of dynamic flow patterns and fluid-fluid
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a two-dimensional shallow water system over movable beds. We
   begin with a continuous system and prove the existence of the solutions,
   and then we investigate their smoothness. Then, we employ a Galerkin
   method to obtain a finite-dimensional problem which is solved using a
   Brouwer fixed point theorem. Therefore, we show that the limits of the
   resulting solution sequences satisfy the model equations.
   After solving the continuous problem, we focus on the corresponding
   discrete problem. We employ a local discontinuous Galerkin scheme for
   numerical solution of the discrete system and conduct an error analysis
   of the numerical scheme. We prove that the method is convergent and that
   the error is bounded according to a specific norm defined herein. (C)

Abstract = {{It is often very important for multichannel speech enhancement systems,
   such as hearing aids, to preserve spatial impressions. Usually, this is
   achieved by first designing a particular speech enhancement algorithm
   and later or separately constraining the obtained solution to respect
   spatial cues. Instead, we propose in this paper to conduct the entire
   system's design via the minimization of statistical spectral distances
   seen as functions of a real-valued, common gain to be applied to all
   channels in the frequency-domain. For various spectral distances, we
   show that the gain derived is expressible in terms of optimal
   multichannel spectral amplitude estimators (such as the multichannel
   Minimum Mean Squared Error Spectral Amplitude Estimator, among others).
   In addition, we report experimental results in complex environments
   (i.e., including reverberation, interfering talkers, and low
   signal-to-noise ratio), showing the potential of the proposed methods
   against recent state-of-the-art multichannel enhancement setups which
   preserve spatial cues as well. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper proposes new stability analysis and convergence results
   applied to the Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) of a class of
   Takagi-Sugeno-Kang proportional-integral-fuzzy controllers (PI-FCs). The
   stability analysis is based on a convenient original formulation of
   Lyapunov's direct method for discrete-time systems dedicated to
   discrete-time input affine Single Input-Single Output (SISO) systems. An
   IFT algorithm which sets the step size to guarantee the convergence is
   suggested. An inequality-type convergence condition is derived from
   Popov's hyperstability theory considering the parameter update law as a
   nonlinear dynamical feedback system in the parameter space and iteration
   domain. The IFT-based design of a low-cost PI-FC is applied to a case
   study which deals with the angular position control of a direct current
   servo system laboratory equipment viewed as a particular case of input
   affine SISO system. A comparison of the performance of the IFT-based
   tuned PI-FC and the performance of the PI-FC tuned by an
   evolutionary-based optimization algorithm shows the performance
   improvement and advantages of our IFT approach to fuzzy control.

Abstract = {{A novel approach to implementing a wideband microwave photonic phase
   shifter by a joint use of a polarization modulator (PolM) and a
   polarization-maintaining fiber Bragg grating (PM-FBG) is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. A microwave signal to be phase shifted is
   applied to the PolM. Two phase-modulated signals along the two principal
   axes of the PolM are generated and sent to the PM-FBG. The
   phase-modulated signals have a static but complementary phase shift
   introduced by the dc bias applied to the PolM. Due to the birefringence
   of the polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber, the PM-FBG has two
   spectrally separated and orthogonally polarized reflection bands. By
   employing the PM-FBG to reflect one first-order sideband along one
   polarization direction and one optical carrier along the other
   polarization direction, and send them back to the PolM, a second-time
   phase modulation is imposed to the sideband and the optical carrier. By
   sending the two signals to a polarizer and beating them at a
   photodetector, a phase shifted microwave signal is obtained. Since the
   PolM is used twice, a low dc bias voltage would lead to a large phase
   shift. A full 360 degrees microwave photonic phase shifter over a
   frequency range of 30-40 GHz is experimentally demonstrated. The
   spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of the phase shifter is also studied.

Abstract = {{Integer-scale structuring element is usually used in the traditional
   mathematical morphology (MM) for signal processing. When applied for
   impulsive feature demodulation of vibration signal of rolling element
   bearings, the integer-scale MM (ISMM) may lead to low resolution result
   and thus undermines its defect diagnosis capability. For this reason,
   this paper proposes a continuous-scale MM (CSMM) scheme by interpolation
   and re-sampling to improve scale resolution for more reliable fault
   signature extraction. Based on the frequency domain kurtosis criterion,
   a narrowband merging operation is employed to locate the optimal scale
   band that best reflects the impulsive feature from the CSMM analysis
   results. The demodulated components in the optimal scale band are
   employed to detect the existence of the bearing fault. The proposed
   optimal CSMM demodulation technique is evaluated using both simulated
   and experimental bearing vibration signals. The results show that, the
   CSMM is capable of generating demodulation signals with higher
   resolution, and the optimal scale band demodulation based on the CSMM
   can reliably extract impulsive features for bearing defect diagnosis.

Title = {{A shortcut method for faster determination of permeability coefficient
   from time lag experiments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{423}},
Pages = {{165-174}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Time lag permeation experiments are a well-known method for the
   determination of permeability and diffusion coefficients of gases in
   polymer films. In these experiments pressurized gas is brought in
   contact with one side of the film and the amount of gas evolving from
   the opposite, low pressure, side of the film is measured as a function
   of time. The permeability coefficient is obtained from the steady-state
   permeation flux and the diffusion coefficient is obtained from the
   permeation flux versus time behavior through an extrapolation method.
   The time required to reach steady-state permeation is of the order of
   several hours or less for most polymers, but can be of the order of
   weeks or even months for films prepared from low-permeability barrier
   polymers.
   A novel method is described in this paper for the early determination of
   the permeability coefficient, which was revealed to yield estimates at
   1/10th the time it normally takes with the conventional time lag
   methods. This method requires (i) short-time approximation of the
   diffusivity coefficient, and (ii) accurate monitoring of transient gas
   flux in and out of the tested membrane. The diffusivity coefficient was
   determined based on a known, but little used work of Rogers et al.
   {[}1]. To measure the gas flux entering the membrane, a new design of
   the upstream side of a constant volume system was developed.
   The applicability of the shortcut method is demonstrated in permeation
   tests with nitrogen in a PPO membrane. The results show good compliance
   with the classical time lag and steady state methods. In the case of
   imprecise pressure measurements, improved accuracy of results are
   observed and expected when operating at higher pressures. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{With the growth of social network services, the need for identifying
   trustworthy people has become a primary concern in order to protect
   users' vast amounts of information from being misused by unreliable
   users. In this study, we propose the extended Advogato trust metric that
   facilitates the identification of trustworthy users associated with each
   individual user. By incorporating the strength of social relationships,
   we recursively diffuse a capacity of a target user throughout his/her
   personal network. Based on the capacity propagation, this paper also
   presents the capacity-first maximum flow method capable of finding the
   strongest path pertinent to discovering an ordered set of reliable users
   and preventing unreliable users from accessing personal networks.
   Experimental results demonstrate that our approach has advantages over
   existing representative methods in terms of both the discovery of
   reliable users and the preventability of unreliable users. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of designing real-time helpfulness
   prediction algorithms. Instead of following the conventional route, in
   which the fraction of positive votes is used as the measure of
   helpfulness, we give helpfulness a naturally sensible and mathematically
   precise definition, namely, as the probability that a user will vote
   helpful on the user-generated content. Building on this definition, we
   introduce a principled methodology to helpfulness prediction, in which
   the prediction problem is naturally formulated as an optimization
   problem. Under this proposed methodology, we first develop a batch
   (off-line) algorithm. Experiments on data from Amazon.com suggest that
   our proposed model in fact outperforms the previously reported
   prediction algorithm, support vector regression. In some circumstances,
   an online algorithm that can update the model as additional data arrive
   is required. In light of this, we proposed an online algorithm that
   incrementally updates the parameters of the model. Finally, an efficient
   hybrid algorithm is provided to increase the convergence rate and
   prediction precision. The final two algorithms are tested on real-life
   user-generated contents, and experimental results illustrate that the
   hybrid approach efficiently processes incoming data and generates
   reliable helpfulness predictions for users. Copyright (c) 2011 John

Abstract = {{Many biomolecular systems depend on orderly sequences of chemical
   transformations or reactions. Yet, the dynamics of single molecules or
   small-copy-number molecular systems are significantly stochastic. Here,
   we propose state sequence analysis-a new approach for predicting or
   visualizing the behaviour of stochastic molecular systems by computing
   maximum probability state sequences, based on initial conditions or
   boundary conditions. We demonstrate this approach by analysing the
   acquisition of drug-resistance mutations in the human immunodeficiency
   virus genome, which depends on rare events occurring on the time scale
   of years, and the stochastic opening and closing behaviour of a single
   sodium ion channel, which occurs on the time scale of milliseconds. In
   both cases, we find that our approach yields novel insights into the
   stochastic dynamical behaviour of these systems, including insights that
   are not correctly reproduced in standard time-discretization approaches
   to trajectory analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A man-portable personal cooling garment based on the concept of vacuum
   desiccant cooling (VDC) was developed. It was demonstrated with cooling
   pads that a cooling capacity of 373.1 W/m(2) could be achieved in an

   prototype cooling garments consisting of 12 VDC pads with an overall

   garment could maintain a core temperature substantially lower than the
   control when the workload was walking on a treadmill of 2\% inclination
   at 3 mph. The exercise was carried out in an environment of 40 degrees C
   and 50\% relative humidity (RH) for 60 min. Tests also showed that the
   VDC garment could effectively reduce the metabolic heat accumulation in
   body with subject wearing heavily insulated nuclear, biological and
   chemical (NBC) suit working in the heat and allow the participant to
   work safely for 60 min, almost doubling the safe working time of the
   same participant when he wore NBC suit only. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The need for energy efficient and intelligent systemic solutions, has
   lead many researchers around the world to investigate and evaluate the
   existing technologies in order to create solutions that would be adopted
   for the near future intelligent homes and buildings, aiding in smart
   grid initiatives. In this paper an algorithm based on the adaptable
   learning system principles is presented. The proposed algorithm utilizes
   the adaptable learning system concepts. The Observe, Learn, and Adapt
   (OLA) algorithm proposed is the result of integration of wireless
   sensors and artificial intelligence concepts towards the same objective:
   adding more intelligence to a programmable communicating thermostat
   (PCT), for better energy management and conservation in smart homes. A
   house simulator was developed and used as an ``expert system shell{''}
   to assist in implementation and verification of the OLA algorithm. The
   role of PCT is to provide consumer with a means to manage and reduce
   energy use, while accommodating their every day schedules, preferences
   and needs. In this paper, the actual results of learning and
   adaptability of a PCT equipped with OLA, as a result of the occupant's
   pattern/schedule changes, and in general, the overall system
   improvements with respect to energy consumption and savings are
   demonstrated via simulation for the zone controlled home equipped with
   OLA and Knowledge Base, versus a home without zone control, Knowledge

Abstract = {{High Dynamic Range (HDR) images of real world scenes often suffer from
   ghosting artifacts caused by motion in the scene. Existing solutions to
   this problem typically either only address specific types of ghosting,
   or are very computationally expensive.
   We address ghosting by performing change detection on
   exposure-normalized images, then reducing the contribution of moving
   objects to the final composite on a frame-by-frame basis. Change
   detection is computationally advantageous and it can be applied to
   images exhibiting varied ghosting artifacts. We demonstrate our method
   both for Low Dynamic Range (LDR) and HDR images. Additional constraints
   based on a priori knowledge of the changing exposures apply to HDR
   images. We increase the stability of our approach by using recent
   superpixel segmentation techniques to enhance the change detection. Our
   solution includes a novel approach for areas that see motion throughout
   the capture, e.g., foliage blowing in the wind.
   We demonstrate the success of our approach on challenging ghosting
   scenarios, and that our results are comparable to existing
   state-of-the-art methods, while providing computational savings over
   these methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep scheduling is a widely used strategy for saving the energy of
   sensor nodes and prolonging the lifetime of a wireless sensor network

   efficient distributed routing protocols for multi-hop duty-cycled WSNs.
   This issue has attracted much attention and various routing protocols
   have been proposed. In this article we first summarize the fundamental
   issues in the design of routing protocols for such networks, and then
   classify existing protocols based on different design criteria. We then
   present a survey of state-of-the-art routing protocols in this area. We
   illustrate how different protocols work and discuss their merits and

Abstract = {{Flow within an alluvial channel bend is significantly affected by
   channel geometry, including curvature ratio (bend radius/channel width,
   R/B) and aspect ratio (channel width/flow depth, B/H). High curvature
   bends (R/B <= 3) can experience substantially more erosion than milder
   curvature bends. This study employs a three-dimensional
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model to investigate the effects
   of curvature ratio and aspect ratio on bend flow with respect to a high
   curvature (R/B = 1.5) base case in a 135 degrees bend. Experimental data
   are used to validate the RANS model predictions for the high curvature
   base case with a flat bed (FB) and an equilibrium deformed bed (DB).
   Five curvature ratios (1.5, 3, 5, 8, and 10) and four aspect ratios
   (5.00, 6.67, 9.09, and 12.50) are investigated. Results show that a
   decrease in R/B or B/H for the FB cases results in a strong increase in
   total circulation of the regions associated with the primary cell of
   cross-stream circulation (Gamma(+)), an increase in maximum bed shear
   stress, and an increase in the contribution of the cross-stream
   component to the total magnitude of bed shear stress. The values of R/B
   and B/H also affect the structure of the cross-stream flow. The primary
   cell of cross-stream circulation splits into two clockwise-rotating
   cells at low R/B values and the cell situated closer to the inner wall
   induces strong ejections of vorticity. At high R/B values, a secondary
   counter-clockwise rotating cell forms at the outer bank. At lower B/H
   values, the primary cell splits into two clockwise-rotating cells. This
   study shows that the position and size of regions of high bed shear
   stress, and thus the capacity of the flow to entrain sediment, depend
   strongly on bend curvature. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000643. (C)

Abstract = {{Distributed virtual simulations can always undergo load imbalances
   during run-time due to their dependency on underlying shared resources.
   Such imbalances are commonly generated by external background load,
   improper deployment of simulation elements, and dynamic oscillations of
   simulation load. HLA was devised as a simulation framework that
   simplifies the design and management of distributed simulations. Even
   though the framework presents services for the coordination of
   simulations, it does not provide any tool for identifying and reacting
   to load imbalances. Due to the importance of balancing simulation load,
   many schemes have been developed, aiming to reduce simulation time
   through analysis of specific metrics. These schemes are limited to
   issues from specific simulation applications, or they disregard
   large-scale environmental characteristics. In order to overcome the
   drawbacks of previous balancing approaches, a distributed balancing
   scheme has been designed. Nevertheless, this scheme, as well as the
   others, is not concerned with migration latencies when redistributing
   simulation load. Migration delays are directly involved with balancing
   responsiveness and efficiency, and they can cause simulation performance
   loss instead of performance improvement if they are not considered in
   the redistribution analysis. Thus, a migration-aware balancing scheme is
   proposed to include migration latency analysis in its load
   redistribution algorithm. Extensions are also proposed to improve the
   analysis of migration delays by enabling necessary costly migrations in
   iterative analysis. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
   proposed migration-aware balancing schemes by comparing performance when
   costly migrations are present in simulations.}},

Title = {{Bladed disc crack diagnostics using blade passage signals}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One of the major potential faults in a turbo fan engine is the crack
   initiation and propagation in bladed discs under cyclic loads that could
   result in the breakdown of the engines if not detected at an early
   stage. Reliable fault detection techniques are therefore in demand to
   reduce maintenance cost and prevent catastrophic failures. Although a
   number of approaches have been reported in the literature, it remains
   very challenging to develop a reliable technique to accurately estimate
   the health condition of a rotating bladed disc. Correspondingly, this
   paper presents a novel technique for bladed disc crack detection through
   two sequential signal processing stages: (1) signal preprocessing that
   aims to eliminate the noises in the blade passage signals; (2) signal
   postprocessing that intends to identify the crack location. In the first
   stage, physics-based modeling and interpretation are established to help
   characterize the noises. The crack initiation can be determined based on
   the calculated health monitoring index derived from the sinusoidal
   effects. In the second stage, the crack is located through advanced
   detrended fluctuation analysis of the preprocessed data. The proposed
   technique is validated using a set of spin rig test data (i.e. tip
   clearance and time of arrival) that was acquired during a test conducted
   on a bladed military engine fan disc. The test results have demonstrated
   that the developed technique is an effective approach for identifying
   and locating the incipient crack that occurs at the root of a bladed
   disc.}},

Abstract = {{Gelation temperature of methylcellulose (MC) can be altered by adding
   different additives. Pure MC showed sol-gel transition at 60 degrees C.
   Sodium citrate and sodium tartrate were used alone and in combination to
   see the effect of individual salt and combination of salts on the
   gelation temperature of MC. The gelation temperature of all the binary
   and ternary combinations of MC and salts were measured with different
   methods such as test tube tilting method (TTM), UV-vis spectroscopy,
   viscometry, and by rheometer and also the morphology of gels were
   characterized with the help of environmental scanning electron
   microscopy (ESEM). It was observed that when 0.1 M sodium citrate (NaC)
   and 0.1 M sodium tartrate (NaT) were used separately, the gelation
   temperature of MC was reduced up to 44 degrees C and 47 degrees C
   respectively but when mixture of NaC and NaT (0.1 (M) NaC and 0.1 (M)
   (NaT)) were used the gelation temperature was further reduced to 36
   degrees C. It was clear from ESEM images that when NaC and NaT were used
   separately the formation of network was not distinguishable. But,
   well-connected network structure was observed when a mixture 0.1 M NaC
   and 0.1 M NaT was used. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report a novel nonfouling passivation method using poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG) engraftment on the surfaces of poly(dimethylsiloxane)
   (PDMS) microfluidic devices sealed with SU-8. To achieve bonding between
   the PDMS and SU-8 surfaces, the PDMS surface was first functionalized
   with amines by treatment with 3-amino-propyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) for
   subsequent reaction with epoxide functional groups on SU-8 surfaces. To
   modify the heterogeneous surfaces of the resulting PDMS/SU-8
   microfluidic device further, the remaining SU-8 surfaces were amino
   functionalized using ethylene diamine (EDA), followed by treating both
   amino-functionalized PDMS and SU-8 surfaces with mPEG-NHS
   (N-hydroxysuccinimide) through an amine-NHS reaction for facile PEG
   immobilizations, thus simultaneously modifying both PDMS and SU-8
   surfaces in one reaction. Detailed surface analyses such as the water
   contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) were conducted to confirm the chemical reactions and
   characterize the resulting surface properties. To test the efficacy of
   this surface-modification strategy, we conducted nonspecific protein and
   particle binding tests using microfluidic devices with and without
   modifications. The PEG-modified PDMS/SU-8 device surfaces showed a
   64.5\% reduction in nonspecific bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption in
   comparison to that of the unmodified surfaces and 92.0 and 95.8\%
   reductions in microbead adhesion under both stagnant and flowing
   conditions, respectively.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{44}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Surface plasmon sub-bandgap Schottky detectors based on an asymmetric Au
   stripe waveguide on p-Si are investigated theoretically and
   experimentally at free-space wavelengths of lambda(0) = 1310 and 1550
   nm. Au on p-Si produces a low Schottky barrier (0.33 eV), which improves
   the internal quantum efficiency. Thick and thin Au stripes are compared,
   with the latter increasing the hot hole emission probability relative to
   the former, and thus also improving the internal quantum efficiency. Two
   excitation schemes are considered: end facet illumination which launches
   surface plasmons on the detector, and top illumination which does not.
   Both schemes are implemented using a piezoelectric positioner that is
   programmed to scan the detection area in steps of 100-200 nm, thus
   enabling the acquisition of high-resolution photocurrent maps. The
   surface plasmon detectors yield a responsivity of similar to 1 mA W-1,
   similar to 2 x larger than the same detectors under top illumination,
   due to the absorption of surface plasmons. We compare the measurements
   with theoretical results for both excitation schemes and estimate the

Abstract = {{The mainstream object categorisation community relies heavily on object
   representations consisting of local image features, due to their ease of
   recovery and their attractive invariance properties. Object
   categorisation is therefore formulated as finding, that is, `detecting',
   a one-to-one correspondence between image and model features. This
   assumption breaks down for categories in which two exemplars may not
   share a single local image feature. Even when objects are represented as
   more abstract image features, a collection of features at one scale (in
   one image) may correspond to a single feature at a coarser scale (in the
   second image). Effective object categorisation therefore requires the
   ability to match features many-to-many. In this paper, we review our
   progress on three independent object categorisation problems, each
   formulated as a graph matching problem and each solving the many-to-many
   graph matching problem in a different way. First, we explore the problem
   of learning a shape class prototype from a set of class exemplars which
   may not share a single local image feature. Next, we explore the problem
   of matching two graphs in which correspondence exists only at higher
   levels of abstraction, and describe a low-dimensional, spectral encoding
   of graph structure that captures the abstract shape of a graph. Finally,
   we embed graphs into geometric spaces, reducing the many-to-many
   graph-matching problem to a weighted point matching problem, for which
   efficient many-to-many matching algorithms exist.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of sound exposure for individuals using communication
   headsets and headphones in the workplace imposes many technical
   challenges, and it has been difficult to integrate such measurements in
   national and international standards on occupational noise exposure.
   This paper reviews existing methods to measure sound exposure directly
   under listening devices, including the use of specialized acoustic
   manikins, artificial ears and real-ear procedures, and the associated
   field logistics and data analysis procedures. An alternative indirect
   calculation method is proposed that uses the main determinants of
   exposure as input parameters into the assessment, such as the external
   noise around the user, the attenuation of the device, and the user's
   listening signal-to-noise ratio. The advantages and disadvantages of the
   different methods are discussed. Together, they form the basis for a set
   of four measurement methods and one calculation method on assessing
   occupational sound exposure from headsets and headphones under
   consideration by a technical Working Group of the Canadian Standards
   Association. (C) 2012 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing services are mainly hosted in remote data centers (DCs)
   where high performance servers and high capacity storage systems are
   located. Moving the services to distant servers can help handling the
   energy bottleneck of the information and communication technologies by
   leading to significant power savings at the local computing resources,
   which on the other hand increases the energy consumption of the
   transport network and the DCs. In this paper, we propose
   mixed-integer-linear-programming- (MILP-) based provisioning models to
   guarantee either minimum delayed or maximum power-saving cloud services
   where high performance DCs are assumed to be located at the core nodes
   of an IP-over-wavelength division multiplexing network. We further
   propose heuristics, namely, delay-minimized provisioning and
   power-minimized provisioning, each of which mimics the behavior of the
   benchmark MILP formulation. Through numerical results, we show that
   power savings can be attained at the expense of increased propagation
   delays. Hence, we finally propose the delay- and power-minimized
   provisioning (DePoMiP), which aims to minimize the propagation delay,
   maximize the power savings in the transport network and minimize the
   power consumption overhead introduced to the DCs. Simulation results
   verify that DePoMiP achieves low-delay and low-power provisioning in an
   environment which is dominated by the cloud services.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background A theoretical clinical advantage of hip resurfacing (HR) is
   the preservation of femoral bone. HR femoral component revision
   reportedly yields postoperative function comparable to that of primary
   THA. However, few studies have looked at the outcome of both HR femoral
   and acetabular side revisions.
   Questions/purposes We determined whether (1) patients undergoing HR
   revision to THA have perioperative measures and outcome scores
   comparable to those of patients undergoing primary THA or revision of
   primary THA and (2) patients undergoing HR revision of both components
   have perioperative measures and outcome scores comparable to those of
   patients undergoing HR revision of the femoral component only.
   Methods We retrospectively reviewed and compared 22 patients undergoing
   revision HR to a THA to a matched (age, sex, BMI) group of 23 patients
   undergoing primary THA and 12 patients undergoing primary THA revision.
   Patients completed the WOMAC and SF-12 questionnaires before surgery and
   at latest followup (range, 24-84 months for HR revision, 28-48 months
   for primary THA, and 24-48 months for revision THA). Blood loss, days in
   hospital, complications, and outcome scores were compared among groups.
   Results We observed no differences in SF-12 scores but observed lower
   WOMAC stiffness, function, and total scores in the HR revision group
   than in the primary THA group. Patients undergoing HR revision of both
   components had comparable SF-12 and WOMAC stiffness, function, and total
   scores but overall lower WOMAC pain scores compared to patients
   undergoing HR revision of the femoral side only. The HR revision group
   had greater intraoperative blood loss compared to the primary THA group
   but not the revision THA group.
   Conclusions The perioperative measures and outcome scores of HR revision
   are comparable to those of revision THA but not primary THA. Longer
   followup is required to determine whether these differences persist.
   Patients undergoing HR revision of one or both components can expect
   comparable stiffness and function.

Abstract = {{Throughout various complex processes within hospitals, context-aware
   services and applications can help to improve the quality of care and
   reduce costs. For example, sensors and radio frequency identification
   (RFID) technologies for e-health have been deployed to improve the flow

   position and orientation determination of equipment. Our system utilizes
   passive (RFID) technology mounted on flooring plates and several
   peripherals for sensor data interpretation. The system is implemented
   and tested through extensive experiments. The results show that our

Abstract = {{Childhood obesity is nowadays considered one of the major health
   problems that many societies suffer from today. The obesity epidemic
   leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart
   disease, high blood pressure, and mental health problems like
   depression, anxiety, and loneliness just to mention a few. Several
   approaches, including physical exercises, strict diet, and exergames
   among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic.
   Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several
   health problems such as obesity, where a combination of ``exercise{''}
   and 3-D ``gaming{''} are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team.
   Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it
   addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids
   to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the
   client-server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the
   3-D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck
   if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids
   stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer
   from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it
   increases the exercise hours. In this paper, we propose a new trend of
   mobile collaborative exergaming applications that is based on the
   peer-to-peer architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection
   protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for
   streaming the relevant 3-D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC,
   is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move
   inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head-mounted
   devices, have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which
   in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity
   epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile
   collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team
   for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing
   the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner
   selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying
   partners, by minimizing the time required to acquire the data. The
   performance evaluation that we have obtained to evaluate our suite of
   protocols using a realistic set of exergame scenarios for obese kids is
   then presented and discussed.}},

   transmission, particularly with rapidly changing topology and frequent
   link disruption. In this paper, based on the moving behaviors of
   vehicles, we divide vehicles into different communities and propose a
   reliable lightweight opportunistic routing (RLOR) protocol for
   inter-region interest data gathering in VSNs. The RLOR protocol consists
   of a quota-style message replication procedure (MRP) and a
   community-aware message forwarding procedure (MFP). In MRP, one vehicle
   node sprays its limited message copies to a few of vehicle nodes that
   have more stable link connections until the left message copy is one.
   Then in MFP we forward the last message copy to a vehicle node that
   belongs to same community with the collector, or an active vehicle node
   that may encounter more different vehicle nodes. Simulation experiments
   under ONE (Opportunistic Networks Environment) show that our proposed
   RLOR protocol outperforms other current popular replication-based
   routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio and communication
   cost while having acceptable latency.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis and lesions to cartilage tissue are diseases that
   frequently result in impaired joint function and patient disability. The
   treatment of osteoarthritis, along with local bone defects and systemic
   skeletal diseases, remains a significant clinical challenge for
   orthopaedic surgeons. Several bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are
   known to have osteoinductive effects, whereof BMP-2 and BMP-7 are
   already approved for clinical applications. There is growing evidence
   that the metabolism of bone as well as the cartilage damage associated
   with the above disease processes are strongly inter-related with the
   interactions of the inflammation-related pathways (in particular
   prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2))) and osteogenesis (in particular bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)). There is strong evidence that the
   pathways of prostaglandins and bone morphogenetic proteins are
   intertwined, and they have recently come into focus in several
   experimental and clinical studies. This paper focuses on PGE(2) and
   BMP-2 intertwining pathways in bone and cartilage metabolism, and
   summarizes the recent experimental and clinical data.}},

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b is a food-borne pathogen of public
   health concern, since it accounts for approximately 40\% of human
   listeriosis cases. We have recently identified IspC, a surface-localized
   peptidoglycan hydrolase, as the antigen recognized by a number of
   monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) produced against a serotype 4b strain for
   diagnostic applications. To determine whether IspC, which is well
   conserved among various serotype 4b strains, is a useful diagnostic
   marker in antibody-based methods, we assessed the expression of IspC in
   L. monocytogenes cultured under normal and stress conditions. A
   functional promoter directing the transcription of the ispC gene was
   identified upstream of the ispC open reading frame by constructing a
   promoterless lacZ gene fusion with the putative ispC promoter region and
   by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis. Using both the lacZ
   reporter gene system and immunofluorescent staining with an
   IspC-specific MAb, we provide evidence that IspC is expressed on the
   cell surface in all growth conditions tested (temperature, osmotic
   stress, pH, ethanol, oxidative stress, anaerobic conditions, carbon
   source, and type of growth media) that allow for cellular division,
   although the level of ispC gene expression varies. These results
   demonstrated the usefulness of IspC as an excellent diagnostic marker
   for the serotype 4b strains and imply that IspC, in conjunction with
   specific MAbs, can be targeted for detection and isolation of L.
   monocytogenes serotype 4b strains directly from food, environmental, and
   clinical samples with minimal or no need for culture enrichment.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the problem of achieving energy-balanced
   data propagation in a distributed wireless sensor network. The energy
   balance property is essential for prolonging the network lifetime by
   maximizing the functional lifetime of a large portion of sensors. We
   propose a distributed, adaptive data propagation algorithm that exploits
   limited, local density information for achieving energy-balanced
   propagation while at the same time keeping energy dissipation at low
   levels.
   Apart from traditional studies considering uniform sensor distribution,
   we investigate heterogeneous sensor placement distributions. We conduct
   a detailed experimental evaluation and comparison with state-of-the-art
   energy-balanced protocols in order to demonstrate that our density-based
   protocol improves energy efficiency significantly while also having
   better energy balance properties.
   To illustrate that our protocol has near-optimal performance, we compare
   our protocol with a centralized, off-line optimum solution derived by a
   linear program which maximizes the network lifetime and show that it
   achieves near-optimal performance for uniform sensor deployments. (c)

   were investigated as a potential magnetic adsorbent for the purification
   of hexahistidine-tagged (His6-tagged) recombinant proteins. The
   synthesis resulted in nanoparticles having an average diameter of 68 +/-
   28 nm. The x-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the presence of nickel
   metal, as well as the presence of unreacted nickel (II) hydroxide
   Ni(OH)(2). Magnetic characterization showed that a magnetization
   saturation of 39.3 electromagnetic unit (emu)/g at 20,000 Oersted (Oe)
   was reached rapidly and that the material exhibited ferromagnetic
   behavior. Protein purification results showed that the synthesized NNPs
   were highly selective for binding to a His6-tagged recombinant protein
   single-domain antibody ToxA5.1. In addition, NNPs were used for four

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, various natural polymers have been applied to
   the problem of oral insulin delivery using advanced nanotechnology.
   Parenteral administration of insulin is widely accepted, but
   administration via the oral route could overcome the poor patient
   compliance with repeated injection. Polymers from natural as well as
   synthetic sources have recently been used in the synthesis of insulin
   delivery vehicles suitable for oral administration. The biopolymer
   chitosan has been widely studied in oral insulin delivery due to its
   favorable properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability,
   non-immunogenicity and non-toxicity.
   This review focuses on progress in the synthesis of chitosan and
   modified chitosan nanoparticles for efficient oral insulin delivery,
   with an emphasis on the biological efficacy of the nanoparticles.
   Obstacles to oral delivery and possible remedies are also brought into
   focus. Modifications to protect insulin from the harsh acidic
   environment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are described. Chemical
   barriers such as the acidic gastric pH and the presence of proteolytic
   enzymes in the stomach and intestine limit the effective absorption of
   external insulin within the GI tract. Absorption of insulin is
   physically hindered by the absorption barrier consisting of a single
   layer of columnar epithelial cells joined at the apical surface by a
   tight junction complex. The presence of negative charges in the junction
   complex leads to segregation of the apical layer from the basolateral
   compartment of the epithelial cells, making the intestinal environment
   selective for particles based on size and charge. Nanoparticles are able
   to overcome these barriers and deliver insulin. While this technology
   still has some drawbacks, chitosan and modified chitosan nanoparticles
   are highly promising agents for oral insulin delivery. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A photonic-microfluidic integrated device is demonstrated with excellent
   and reliable fluorescence detection performance. CV values of 8\% for
   2.5-mu m beads and 14\% for 6-mu m beads were achieved through the
   correct deployment of carefully formed excitation beam shapes via
   integrated on-chip optics even without the use of 3D hydrodynamic
   focusing or a high-quality laser source and single mode beam
   propagation. The devices are fabricated in a monolithic planar fashion
   using a system of microlenses and waveguides integrated with
   microfluidic channels on-chip and packaged using a high-quality and
   low-cost channel sealing and high-performance interconnecting technology
   developed from our earlier works. Beam geometry in the excitation region
   is shown to affect the variation of fluorescence intensity from
   specimens, hence configurations of beam geometry targeted for a specific
   bead sizes are examined to ensure proper deployment of the lens designs.
   The formed high-quality optical excitation regions ensure reliable
   detection even with relaxed hydrodynamic focusing to ensure
   applicability with multiple specimen sizes. Device performance with each
   bead size was found to be acceptable for a range of beam geometries with
   a different ideal configuration for each bead size. These device designs
   help to form a device that will supplement conventional flow cytometry
   in point-of-care and remote detection applications by performing
   specific detections with an inexpensive and replaceable device.}},

Abstract = {{The aggregate interference distribution in cognitive radio networks is
   studied in a rigorous analytical way using the popular Poisson point
   process model. While a number of results are available for this model of
   regular (non-cognitive) networks, cognitive ones present an extra level
   of difficulties for the analysis, mainly due to the exclusion region
   around the primary receiver, which are typically addressed via various
   ad-hoc approximations (e. g. based on the interference cumulants) or via
   the large-deviation analysis. Unlike the previous studies, we do not use
   here ad-hoc approximations but rather obtain the asymptotic interference
   distribution in a systematic and rigorous way, which also has a
   guaranteed level of accuracy at the distribution tail. This is in
   contrast to the large deviation analysis, which provides only the
   (exponential) order of scaling but not the outage probability itself.
   Unlike the cumulant-based analysis, our approach provides a guaranteed
   level of accuracy at the distribution tail. Additionally, our analysis
   provides a number of novel insights. In particular, we demonstrate that
   there is a critical transition point below which the outage probability
   decays only polynomially but above which it decays super-exponentially.
   This provides a solid analytical foundation to the earlier empirical
   observations in the literature and also reveals what are the typical
   ways outage events occur in different regimes. The analysis is further
   extended to include interference cancelation and fading (from a broad
   class of distributions). The outage probability is shown to scale down
   exponentially in the number of canceled nearest interferers in the
   below-critical region and does not change significantly in the
   above-critical one. The proposed asymptotic expressions are shown to be
   accurate in the non-asymptotic regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Outage probability and capacity of a class of block-fading MIMO channels
   are considered under partial channel distribution information.
   Specifically, the channel or its distribution is not known but the
   latter is known to belong to a class of distributions where each member
   is within a certain distance (uncertainty) from a nominal distribution.
   Relative entropy is used as a measure of distance between distributions.
   Compound outage probability defined as min (over the transmitted signal
   distribution) -max (over the channel distribution class) outage
   probability is introduced and investigated. This generalizes the
   standard outage probability to the case of partial channel distribution
   information. Compound outage probability characterization (via 1-D
   convex optimization and in a closed form), its properties, and
   approximations are given. It is shown to have two-regime behavior: when
   the nominal outage probability decreases (e. g., by increasing the SNR),
   the compound outage first decreases linearly down to a certain threshold
   (related to the relative entropy distance; this is the nominal
   outage-dominated regime) and then only logarithmically (i.e., very
   slowly; this is the uncertainty-dominated regime) so that no significant
   further decrease is possible. This suggests the following design
   guideline: the outage probability is decreased by increasing the SNR or
   optimizing the transmitted signal distribution (both decrease nominal
   outage) in the first regime and by reducing the channel distribution
   uncertainty (e. g., via better estimation) in the second one. The
   compound outage depends on the relative entropy distance and the nominal
   outage only, all other details (nominal fading and noise distributions)
   being irrelevant. The transmit signal distribution optimized for the
   nominal channel distribution is shown to be also optimal for the whole
   class of distributions. The effect of swapping the distributions in
   relative entropy is investigated and an error floor effect is
   established. The compound outage probability under L-p distance
   constraint is also investigated. The obtained results hold in full
   generality, i.e., for the general channel model with arbitrary nominal
   fading and noise distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Enzyme additives are believed to improve septic tank performance by

   conditions where there is no heating or mixing, quantities of enzymes
   added are small, and they can be washed out quickly. In this study,
   batch reactors and continuous-flow reactors designed and operated as
   septic tanks were used to evaluate whether enzymatic treatment would
   increase the hydrolysis and digestion rates in primary sludge. Total
   solids, volatile solids, total suspended solids, total and soluble
   chemical oxygen demand, concentrations of protein, carbohydrate, ammonia
   and volatile acids in sludge and effluent samples were measured to
   determine the differences in digestion rates in the presence and absence

Abstract = {{During regression testing, a modified system is often retested using an
   existing test suite. Since the size of the test suite may be very large,
   testers are interested in detecting faults in the modified system as
   early as possible during this retesting process. Test prioritization
   attempts to order tests for execution so that the chances of early
   detection of faults during retesting are increased. The existing
   prioritization methods are based on the source code of the system under
   test. In this paper, we present and evaluate two model-based selective
   methods and a dependence-based method of test prioritization utilizing
   the state-based model of the system under test. These methods assume
   that the modifications are made both on the system under test and its
   model. The existing test suite is executed on the system model and
   information about this execution is used to prioritize tests. Execution
   of the model is inexpensive as compared with execution of the system
   under test; therefore, the overhead associated with test prioritization
   is relatively small. In addition, we present an analytical framework for
   evaluation of test prioritization methods. This framework may reduce the
   cost of evaluation as compared with the framework that is based on
   observation. We have performed an empirical study in which we compared
   different test prioritization methods. The results of the empirical
   study suggest that system models may improve the effectiveness of test
   prioritization with respect to early fault detection. Copyright (c) 2011

Abstract = {{The dynamic composition of networked appliances, or virtual devices,
   enables users to generate complex, strong, and specific systems. Current
   MANET-based composition schemes use service discovery mechanisms that
   depend on periodic service advertising by controlled broadcast,
   resulting in the unnecessary depletion of node resources. The assumption
   that, once generated, a virtual device is to remain static is false; the
   device should gracefully degrade and upgrade along with the conditions
   in the user's environment, particularly the network's current
   performance requirements. Presently, schemes for infrastructure-less
   virtual device composition and management do not consider this
   adaptation. We present a distributed constraint satisfaction problem
   (distCSP) for virtual device composition in MANETs that addresses these
   issues together with simulations that show its effectiveness and

Abstract = {{Many prominent musical instrument makers shape their braces into a
   scalloped profile. Although reasons for this are not well known
   scientifically, many of these instrument makers attest that scalloped
   braces can produce superior sounding wooden musical instruments in
   certain situations. The aim of this paper is to determine a possible
   reason behind scalloped shaped braces. A simple analytical model
   consisting of a soundboard section and a scalloped brace is analyzed in
   order to see the effects that changes in the shape of the brace have on
   the frequency spectrum of the brace-soundboard system. The results are
   used to verify the feasibility of adjusting the brace thickness in order
   to compensate for soundboards having different stiffness in the
   direction perpendicular to the wood grain. It is shown that scalloping
   the brace allows an instrument maker to independently control the value
   of two natural frequencies of a combined brace-soundboard system. This
   is done by adjusting the brace's base thickness in order to modify the
   1st natural frequency and by adjusting the scalloped peak heights to
   modify the 3rd natural frequency, both of which are considered along the
   length of the brace. By scalloping their braces, and thus controlling
   the value of certain natural frequencies, musical instrument makers can
   improve the acoustic consistency of their instruments. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Latency is a key element for online game quality and user experience.
   The client-server approach is a widely used system supporting hundreds
   of thousands of players on a regular basis. However, if latency among
   players via an intermediate server is large, timely interaction for them
   could be difficult. In this article, we present a procedure to share
   game states for a group of players within their area of interaction so
   that players can comply with stringent time-constraint and improve their
   game experience. As players move around in a game space, so do their
   virtual positions. In addition, the relative orientation of players
   within an area of interaction is unpredictable which indeed changes
   quite frequently. Because of these facts, we cannot make a predefined
   rule set for message exchange among players. So a message exchange plan
   currently working well might have low efficiency after a while due to
   dynamic changes. In our procedure, considering the importance of
   interaction, relative orientation, and virtual and geographical
   locations, we devise a message exchange plan that works alone in each
   client machine with the local information available. Significant
   performance improvements are noticed through simulations, validating our
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Planetary gearboxes play an important role in wind turbine drive trains.
   Fault diagnosis of planetary gearboxes is a key topic for maintenance of
   wind turbines. Considering the spectral complexity of planetary gearbox
   vibration signals as well as their amplitude modulation and frequency
   modulation (AMFM) nature, we propose a simple yet effective method to
   diagnose planetary gearbox faults based on amplitude and frequency
   demodulations. We use the energy separation algorithm to estimate the
   amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency of modulated signals for
   further demodulation analysis, by exploiting the adaptability of Teager
   energy operator to instantaneous changes in signals and the fine time
   resolution. However, the energy separation algorithm requires signals to
   be mono-components. To satisfy this requirement, we decompose signals
   into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using the ensemble empirical mode
   decomposition (EEMD) method as it can decompose any signal into
   mono-components. We further propose a criterion to guide the selection
   of the most relevant IMF for demodulation analysis according to the
   wavelet-like filter nature of EEMD and the AMFM characteristics of the
   planetary gearbox vibration signals. By matching the dominant peaks in
   the Fourier spectra of the obtained amplitude envelope and instantaneous
   frequency with the theoretical characteristic frequency of each gear, we
   can diagnose planetary gearbox faults. The principle and effectiveness
   of the proposed method are illustrated by simulation and the
   experimental analysis of signals from a planetary gearbox of a wind
   turbine test rig. With the proposed method, both the wear and chipping
   faults can be detected and located for a sun gear of the planetary
   gearbox test rig. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Circulating Angiogenic Cells Can Be Derived from Cryopreserved
   Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cell transplantation for regenerative medicine has become an
   appealing therapeutic method; however, stem and progenitor cells are not
   always freshly available. Cryopreservation offers a way to freeze cells
   as they are generated, for storage and transport until required for
   therapy. This study was performed to assess the feasibility of
   cryopreserving peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the
   subsequent in vitro generation of their derived therapeutic population,
   circulating angiogenic cells (CACs).
   Methods: PBMCs were isolated from healthy human donors. Freshly isolated
   cells were either analyzed immediately or cryopreserved in media
   containing 6\% plasma serum and 5\% dimethyl sulfoxide. PBMCs were
   thawed after being frozen for 1 (early thaw) or 28 (late thaw) days and
   analyzed, or cultured for 4 days to generate CACs. Analysis of the cells
   consisted of flow cytometry for viability and phenotype, as well as
   functional assays for their adhesion and migration potential, cytokine
   secretion, and in vivo angiogenic potential.
   Results: The viability of PBMCs and CACs as well as their adhesion and
   migration properties did not differ greatly after cryopreservation.
   Phenotypic changes did occur in PBMCs and to a lesser extent in CACs
   after freezing; however the potent CD34(+)VEGFR2(+)CD133(+) population
   remained unaffected. The derived CACs, while exhibiting changes in
   inflammatory cytokine secretion, showed no changes in the secretion of
   important regenerative and chemotactic cytokines, nor in their ability
   to restore perfusion in ischemic muscle.
   Conclusion: Overall, it appears that changes do occur in cryopreserved
   PBMCs and their generated CACs; however, the CD34(+)VEGFR2(+)CD133(+)
   progenitor population, the secretion of pro-vasculogenic factors, and
   the in vivo angiogenic potential of CACs remain unaffected by
   cryopreservation.}},

Abstract = {{Demodulation is very important for gear fault detection. However, the
   demodulation is substantially complicated by the non-stationary nature
   of the signal during the speed-up and speed-down processes. As such, we
   propose a new technique to detect gear faults under such conditions
   based on the multi-scale chirplet path pursuit (MSCPP) algorithm and the
   fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) method. With the MSCPP algorithm,
   the instantaneous frequency of the signal component with the largest
   energy in the multi-components gear vibration signal can be estimated.
   Then according to the estimated instantaneous frequency, the vibration
   signal segment whose instantaneous frequency curve approximated as
   either an ascending or descending linear segment can be obtained from
   the original gear vibration signal. In other words, the vibration signal
   segment that can be regarded as a multi-component linear frequency
   modulated (LFM) signal is extracted. As the FrFT is suitable for
   multi-component LFM signal analysis, it is then applied to demodulating
   this vibration signal segment and hence detecting local gear faults
   based on the revealed modulation phenomenon. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method has been demonstrated by both simulation and
   experimental data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A class of axisymmetric horizontal flows dominated by strong heat or
   mass sources are considered here, which systematically arise in
   multiscale atmospheric and oceanic flows in various spatiotemporal
   scales such as hurricane embryos. Various linear and nonlinear
   analytical solutions are proposed, and several examples are given to
   illustrate them. On the basis of the proposed exact solutions, stability
   of the flow under various conditions is examined. The proposed exact
   solutions serve as benchmarks for validation of numerical models. A
   Chebyshev pseudospectral model is also developed for these flows. The
   numerical results are compared with the developed analytical solutions
   as well as a high-resolution numerical solution, which showed an
   excellent performance of the numerical model in terms of numerical
   diffusion and oscillation. The numerical method is also efficient
   because expensive calculations such as LU decomposition are only needed
   once, at the beginning of calculations. The model could be used in
   studying small-scale and multiple-scale phenomena such as hot towers and
   hurricane embryos, which are the subject of future studies. Copyright

Abstract = {{A series of pilot scale freezing bed experiments were conducted to
   evaluate and model the freeze-thaw treatment of septic tank sludge
   (septage). Filtrate quality is similar to a low strength domestic
   wastewater and the sludge cake has a dry matter content of 25\% with E.
   coli numbers below 2.0 x 10(6) CFU/g dry solids. Experimental results
   showed no impact of snow cover on bed performance in a region with
   moderate snowfall (1.3-1.6 m) as new layers of sludge effectively melted
   any accumulated snow; suggesting that it is not necessary to cover the
   bed or remove the snow in areas where sludge dosing exceeds snowfall.
   Both freezing and thawing processes were successfully modelled with
   readily available climatic data. Model output for North American
   climatic conditions indicates that the freezing bed technology can be
   widely applied throughout the northern United States and Alaska and most
   of Canada with the exception of coastal areas and southern Ontario.}},

Title = {{Connected graph searching}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{219}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the graph searching game the opponents are a set of searchers and a
   fugitive in a graph. The searchers try to capture the fugitive by
   applying some sequence of moves that include placement, removal, or
   sliding of a searcher along an edge. The fugitive tries to avoid capture
   by moving along unguarded paths. The search number of a graph is the
   minimum number of searchers required to guarantee the capture of the
   fugitive. In this paper, we initiate the study of this game under the
   natural restriction of connectivity where we demand that in each step of
   the search the locations of the graph that are clean (i.e.
   non-accessible to the fugitive) remain connected. We give evidence that
   many of the standard mathematical tools used so far in classic graph
   searching fail under the connectivity requirement. We also settle the
   question on ``the price of connectivity{''}, that is, how many searchers
   more are required for searching a graph when the connectivity demand is
   imposed. We make estimations of the price of connectivity on general
   graphs and we provide tight bounds for the case of trees. In particular,
   for an n-vertex graph the ratio between the connected searching number
   and the non-connected one is O (log n) while for trees this ratio is
   always at most 2. We also conjecture that this constant-ratio upper
   bound for trees holds also for all graphs. Our combinatorial results
   imply a complete characterization of connected graph searching on trees.
   It is based on a forbidden-graph characterization of the connected
   search number. We prove that the connected search game is monotone for
   trees, i.e. restricting search strategies to only those where the clean
   territories increase monotonically does not require more searchers. A
   consequence of our results is that the connected search number can be
   computed in polynomial time on trees, moreover, we show how to make this
   algorithm distributed. Finally, we reveal connections of this parameter
   to other invariants on trees such as the Horton-Strahler number. (c)

Abstract = {{We propose a novel localized Integrated Location Service and Routing
   (ILSR) scheme, based on the geographic routing protocol GFG, for data
   communications from sensors to a mobile sink in wireless sensor
   networks. The objective is to enable each sensor to maintain a
   slow-varying routing next hop to the sink rather than the precise
   knowledge of quick-varying sink position. In ILSR, sink updates location
   to neighboring sensors after or before a link breaks and whenever a link
   creation is observed. Location update relies on flooding, restricted
   within necessary area, where sensors experience (next hop) change in GFG
   routing to the sink. Dedicated location update message is additionally
   routed to selected nodes for prevention of routing failure. Considering
   both unpredictable and predictable (controllable) sink mobility, we
   present two versions. We prove that both of them guarantee delivery in a
   connected network modeled as unit disk graph. ILSR is the first
   localized protocol that has this property. We further propose to reduce
   message cost, without jeopardizing this property, by dynamically
   controlling the level of location update. A few add-on techniques are as
   well suggested to enhance the algorithm performance. We compare ILSR
   with an existing competing algorithm through simulation. It is observed
   that ILSR generates routes close to shortest paths at dramatically lower
   (90\% lower) message cost.}},

Abstract = {{A novel surface modified polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber
   membrane was fabricated via a dry-wet phased inversion process. A
   surface modifying macromolecule (SMM) was used as an additive in the
   spinning dope. During phase inversion SMM migrates to the membrane
   surface and functions as both a pore former and surface modifier. The
   surface modified PVDF membrane showed large pore size, higher effective
   surface porosity, contact angle and porosity but lower critical water
   entry pressure compared to the PVDF hollow fiber membrane without SMM.
   The performance of the surface modified membrane in contactor
   application for CO2 absorption via distilled water as absorbent was
   studied. The results show that the surface modified PVDF membrane has
   higher performance compared to control PVDF membranes. With the membrane
   prepared from SMM in the spinning dope a maximum CO2 flux of 7.7 x
   10(-4) mol/m(2) s was achieved at 300 ml/min of absorbent flow rate,
   which was almost 93\% more than the other membrane. In a long-term
   stability study, CO2 flux was decreased only about 7.7\% by using
   surface modified PVDF membrane during 150 h operation. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Micro particle image velocimetry (mu PIV) is a common method to assess
   flow behavior in blood microvessels in vitro as well as in vivo. The use
   of red blood cells (RBCs) as tracer particles, as generally considered
   in vivo, creates a large depth of correlation (DOC), even as large as
   the vessel itself, which decreases the accuracy of the method. The
   limitations of mu PIV for blood flow measurements based on RBC tracking
   still have to be evaluated. In this study, in vitro and in silico models
   were used to understand the effect of the DOC on blood flow measurements
   using mu PIV RBC tracer particles. We therefore employed a mu PIV
   technique to assess blood flow in a 15 mu m radius glass tube with a
   high-speed CMOS camera. The tube was perfused with a sample of 40\%
   hematocrit blood. The flow measured by a cross-correlating speckle
   tracking technique was compared to the flow rate of the pump. In
   addition, a three-dimensional mechanical RBC-flow model was used to
   simulate optical moving speckle at 20\% and 40\% hematocrits, in 15 and
   20 mu m radius circular tubes, at different focus planes, flow rates and
   for various velocity profile shapes. The velocity profiles extracted
   from the simulated pictures were compared with good agreement with the
   corresponding velocity profiles implemented in the mechanical model. The
   flow rates from both the in vitro flow phantom and the mathematical
   model were accurately measured with less than 10\% errors. Simulation
   results demonstrated that the hematocrit (paired t tests, p = 0.5) and
   the tube radius (p = 0.1) do not influence the precision of the measured
   flow rate, whereas the shape of the velocity profile (p < 0.001) and the
   location of the focus plane (p < 0.001) do, as indicated by measured
   errors ranging from 3\% to 97\%. In conclusion, the use of RBCs as
   tracer particles makes a large DOC and affects the image processing
   required to estimate the flow velocities. We found that the current mu
   PIV method is acceptable to estimate the flow rate on the condition that
   the measurement takes place at the equatorial plane of the vessel.
   Otherwise, it is not an appropriate method to estimate the shape of the
   velocity profile.}},

Abstract = {{Ethanol and carbon monoxide oxidation in alkaline media is investigated
   on a series of carbon-supported PtSn nanoparticles synthesized using a
   polyol reduction method. The PtSn electrocatalysts include two groups
   where one group is composed of disordered PtSn alloys and the other
   group composed of PtSn alloys intimately mixed with a SnOx phase. All
   catalysts were active during cyclic voltammetry experiments but the
   bi-phase PtSn + SnOx nanoparticles have significantly higher current
   densities at lower overpotentials compared to the pure alloy PtSn
   catalysts. During chronoamperommetry measurements all catalysts
   deactivated with time and only the bi-phase PtSnOx catalysts reached
   steady-state current densities after 3000 s with all others deactivating
   continuously. Catalyst bulk and surface structure were correlated with
   the observed electrochemical performance in alkaline media demonstrating
   that ethanol electrooxidation in 1 M KOH is more facile when
   electrocatalysst contain higher total amounts of both Pt and oxides.
   Alloying of Pt with Sn improves intrinsic, per Pt, catalytic activity
   and plausibly prevents Pt oxidation. Moreover, oxides decrease
   deactivation, possibly through improved CO or other intermediate
   adsorbate oxidation due to enhanced OH surface coverage. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The intent of this paper is to investigate the application of a
   pre-processing method previously validated on glycerol to blood flows in
   microchannels and to compare the accuracy of results obtained when
   applied to a non-homogeneous fluid such as blood with results from
   previously applied processing methods for blood data. Comparisons of
   common processing methods are desired for a clear measure of accuracy in
   order to make recommendations for various flows. It is hypothesized that
   increasing the correlation window overlap improves the profile
   prediction. The amount of correlation window overlap and window shape in
   the processing of data have a significant effect on the results. Image
   pre-processing is explored to improve the correlation using the `image
   overlapping' which is extended to the case of blood and the
   blood-specific pre-processing `base-clipping' or `thresholding'
   technique currently applied to blood. Both pre-processing methods are
   tested with multiple processing methods for two channel geometries: a
   straight rectangular channel and a Y-channel resulting in a controlled
   shear flow. The resulting profiles and calculations demonstrate that
   `image-overlapping' is found to achieve a profile closer to the
   predicted theoretical profile than current blood pre-processing methods
   when both are applied to the same set of data and both are superior to
   conventional cross-correlation on its own. In all cases, pre-processing
   decreases the smoothness of the predicted profile. The use of
   `image-overlapping' is shown to have greater accuracy when calculating
   the shear rate at the wall of the channel as well.}},

Abstract = {{Master Logic Diagram (MLD) depicts the interrelationships among the

   failure detection and recovery mechanisms. The newly developed model
   provides the probability of the system failure, and system mean and

Abstract = {{In this paper, an efficient method is presented for the geometrically
   nonlinear analysis of circulant structures. A structure is called
   regular if its model can be formed as the product of two subgraphs, and
   if one of the subgraphs is a cycle then it is termed circulant. In the
   present method, we deal with the eigensolution of circulant structures
   by simply finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the blocks of the
   stiffness matrix rather than those of the entire structural matrix,
   leading to a considerable reduction in the computational time. The
   developed method utilizes concepts from product graphs and linear
   algebra for the nonlinear analysis of structures. Graph products are
   used to perform the eigensolution of circulant structures through those
   of its constituting subgraphs. Here, using the existing numerical
   methods, nonlinear static and dynamic analyses can be performed. In the
   presented method instead of solving the characteristic equation in each
   iteration of each step, the eigensolution of the structure is obtained
   using the eigensolution of the primary structure (the structure of the
   first iteration of the first step) together with some simple
   mathematical operations. In the present method instead of heavy matrix
   operations such as inverting a matrix and solution of the corresponding
   equations, one needs only to perform simple matrix multiplications and
   additions. The advantage of the presented method becomes more apparent
   when it is applied to the nonlinear analysis of a structure, where
   analysis should be performed many times.}},

Abstract = {{IspC is a novel peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolase that is conserved in
   Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b strains and is involved in virulence.
   The aim of this study was to establish the hydrolytic bond specificity
   of IspC. Purified L. monocytogenes peptidoglycan was digested by
   recombinant IspC and the resulting muropeptides were separated by
   reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure of
   each muropeptide was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption
   ionization (MALDI)-time-of-flight mass spectrometry in combination with
   MALDI-post-source decay mass spectrometry. The structure of muropeptides
   resulting from IspC-mediated hydrolysis indicated that IspC has
   N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. These muropeptides also had a high
   proportion of N-acetylated glucosamine residues. To determine whether
   IspC is more effective at hydrolysing N-acetylated peptidoglycan than
   de-N-acetylated peptidoglycan, a peptidoglycan deacetylase (PgdA)
   in-frame deletion mutant was created. This mutant was shown to have
   fully N-acetylated peptidoglycan and was more susceptible to hydrolysis
   by IspC when compared with the partially de-N-acetylated wild-type
   peptidoglycan. This indicates that IspC is more efficient when
   hydrolysing a fully N-acetylated peptidoglycan substrate. The finding
   that IspC acts as an N-acetylglucosaminidase is consistent with its
   categorization, based on amino acid sequence, as a member of the GH73
   family. As with other members of this family, de-N-acetylation seems to
   be an important mechanism for regulating the activity of IspC.}},

Abstract = {{While the effect of total hip arthroplasty on the operated limb
   mechanics is well documented, little is known on its effect on the
   contralateral limb. The purpose of this study was to measure the joint
   mechanics of both lower limbs during the tasks of sit-to-stand and
   stand-to-sit. Twenty total hip arthroplasty patients and 20 control
   participants performed three trials of each task from which 3D
   lower-limb joint kinematics and kinetics were obtained. Total hip
   arthroplasty patients exhibited lower operated-hip joint flexion,
   extension moments, and power, occurring most frequently near seat-on and
   seat-off. Despite these reduced kinetic variables in the operated hip,
   the joints of the non-operated limb generated similar joint kinetics as
   the matched control participants. These results indicated the patients
   who underwent total hip arthroplasty could adopt a strategy that allowed
   them to reduce moments and power generated at the operated lower-limb
   joints without overcompensating with the non-operated leg. Although such
   a strategy may be desirable given that higher loads can increase
   friction and accelerate wear of the prosthesis, reduced loading may be
   an indication of inadequate muscle strength that needs to be addressed.

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of on-site thermal regeneration of field-spent
   granular activated carbon (GAC) from two municipal drinking water
   facilities was compared with bench-scale electrochemical regeneration, a
   novel regeneration technology. The regeneration method was evaluated
   using aqueous natural organic material (NOM) adsorption, iodine number
   analysis, and surface area analysis. In contrast to the large
   electrochemical regeneration efficiencies reported in the literature for
   GAC loaded with phenolics and other individual organic compounds, the
   electrochemical reactor tested was only able to regenerate 8-15\% of the
   NOM adsorption capacity of the field spent GAC. In contrast, thermal
   reactivation achieved up to 103\% regeneration efficiency. To more
   accurately assess the efficiency of regeneration processes for water
   treatment applications, GAC should be loaded in continuous-flow columns
   and not batch rectors. The iodine number analysis yielded higher
   efficiency values, however it did not give an accurate estimate of the
   regeneration efficiency. The small changes in GAC pore size distribution
   were consistent with the low electrochemical regeneration efficiencies.
   These low efficiencies appear to be related to the low reversibility of
   NOM adsorption and to pH-induced adsorbate desorption being the primary
   mechanism for this type of electrochemical regeneration system. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{While the conventional Fe-C phase diagram predicts negligible solubility

   the supersaturated state exist, however. In this study, experiments have
   been performed using two PVD techniques allowing for the production of
   nanocrystalline films containing between 11 and 16 at\% C. Transmission
   electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy reveal no
   phase other than a nearly body-centred cubic iron in the as-deposited
   films. This result is discussed with respect to the kinetics of carbon

Abstract = {{Biomass gasification is a thriving energy conversion technology with
   many successful demonstrations. However, there are various constraints
   that may be encountered which continue to cause significant problems
   originating from fuel properties. Raw biomass fuels usually have high
   moisture content, low bulk density, low ash melting points, chemical
   composition with potentially high chlorine content, etc. The constraints
   related to gasification can include fuel preparation, handling, storage,
   and feeding problems. In many cases, these constraints can be
   significantly reduced by pretreatment. Some pretreatment processes
   commonly pursued are comminution, drying, and pelletization which alter
   physical properties of biomass that are important to fluid bed

Abstract = {{The effect of bore fluid type on the structure and performance of
   polyetherimide hollow fiber membranes in contactor application was
   investigated. Water was used as phase inversion promoter in spinning
   dope and water and pure NMP were used as bore fluid. SEM micrographs
   show that the major parts of both membranes consist of spongelike
   structure which is related to the high viscosity of spinning dope that
   reduces the diffusion of coagulant (water) into membrane sublayer and
   decreases the rate of phase inversion. In the case of water as bore
   fluid (membrane \#M1) there is skin layer on the inner surface of
   membrane and some drop-shaped voids in the structure of membrane but in
   the case of pure NMP as bore fluid (membrane \#M2), the inner surface of
   membrane is skinless with big pores and there are fingerlike macrovoids,
   originating from the inner surface and extending to the vicinity of
   outer surface which is related to the penetration of bore fluid and
   dissolving the polymer. Furthermore, membrane \#M2 has higher mean pore
   size and effective surface porosity.
   The absorption flux of both fabricated membranes was investigated in the
   case of liquid in lumen side (case \#1) and liquid in shell side (case
   \#2) where in case \#1, membrane \#M1 has higher absorption flux but in
   case \#2, membrane \#M2 has higher absorption flux. The different trend
   in absorption flux confirms that the surface of membrane in contact with
   the gas phase in a membrane contactor should be skinless with big pores
   to facilitates the diffusion of solute gas through membrane but the pore
   size on the surface of membrane in contact with the liquid phase should
   be adjusted to obtain high absorption flux and low wettability. (C) 2012

Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{472-480}},

Abstract = {{Porous asymmetric polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber membranes were
   fabricated via a phase-inversion method using ethanol, glycerol and
   acetone as the additives in the spinning dope. Also, hollow fiber PEI
   membrane without additives was fabricated. An aqueous solution of
   1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (80 wt.\%) was used as bore fluid to prevent
   forming of an inner dense skin layer. The precipitation rate of the
   polymer dopes with the different additives was studied using cloud point
   measurement. The effect of the additives on the resulting membrane
   structure, surface porosity, pore size, critical water entry pressure,
   collapsing pressure and physical and chemical CO2 absorption performance
   by distilled water and NaOH (1 M) solution in a gas liquid membrane
   contactor system were investigated and compared. Cloud point diagrams
   indicated that the precipitation rate of the polymer dopes increased
   following the trend of ethanol > acetone > glycerol. Results of gas
   permeation tests showed that ethanol and glycerol as additives provided
   the membranes with the largest and smallest pore size, respectively.
   Moreover, all the additives resulted in an increase in the effective
   surface porosity. The cross-section of the membranes was examined via a
   scanning electron microscopy. Ethanol in the spinning dope provided the
   membrane structure with a sublayer with finger-like macrovoids,
   originating from the inner and outer surfaces of the hollow fiber and
   extending to the middle section of the hollow fiber wall, which resulted
   in a larger pore size and higher CO2 absorption rate than the other PEI

Title = {{A New Methodology to Derive Objective Quality Assessment Metrics for

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{With the growing demand for 3D video, efforts are underway to
   incorporate it in the next generation of broadcast and streaming
   applications and standards. 3D video is currently available in games,
   entertainment, education, security, and surveillance applications. A
   typical scenario for multiview 3D consists of several 3D video sequences
   captured simultaneously from the same scene with the help of multiple
   cameras from different positions and through different angles. Multiview
   video coding provides a compact representation of these multiple views
   by exploiting the large amount of inter-view statistical dependencies.
   One of the major challenges in this field is how to transmit the large
   amount of data of a multiview sequence over error prone channels to
   heterogeneous mobile devices with different bandwidth, resolution, and
   processing/battery power, while maintaining a high visual quality.
   Scalable Multiview 3D Video Coding (SMVC) is one of the methods to
   address this challenge; however, the evaluation of the overall visual
   quality of the resulting scaled-down video requires a new objective
   perceptual quality measure specifically designed for scalable multiview
   3D video. Although several subjective and objective quality assessment
   methods have been proposed for multiview 3D sequences, no comparable
   attempt has been made for quality assessment of scalable multiview 3D
   video. In this article, we propose a new methodology to build suitable
   objective quality assessment metrics for different scalable modalities
   in multiview 3D video. Our proposed methodology considers the importance
   of each layer and its content as a quality of experience factor in the
   overall quality. Furthermore, in addition to the quality of each layer,
   the concept of disparity between layers (inter-layer disparity) and
   disparity between the units of each layer (intra-layer disparity) is
   considered as an effective feature to evaluate overall perceived quality
   more accurately. Simulation results indicate that by using this
   methodology, more efficient objective quality assessment metrics can be
   introduced for each multiview 3D video scalable modalities.}},

Abstract = {{An all-optical approach to generating phase-coded millimeter-wave
   (mm-wave) waveforms based on optical pulse shaping, using a spatially
   discrete chirped fiber Bragg grating (SD-CFBG) is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. Since no electro-optical modulator is used,
   the system is simpler and less costly. In the proposed system, the
   spectrum of an optical pulse is spectrally sliced by a sinusoidal comb
   filter. The SD-CFBG is then used as a special dispersive element to map
   the shaped spectrum to a temporal waveform based on dispersive Fourier
   transform, and at the same time, to introduce the desired time delay
   jumps, which are translated to phase shifts. A simplified system without
   using the comb filter is also studied, in which a single SD-CFBG is
   employed to simultaneously perform spectral slicing, frequency-to-time
   mapping, and temporal coding. The proposed technique is validated by two
   experiments in which two phase-coded mm-wave waveforms at 28.5 GHz and
   47.2 GHz with, respectively, a 7-bit and 11-bit Barker code are

Abstract = {{In this work, a biomass processing facility is designed and simulated
   for the annual conversion of 77 ktons of sunflower residue into
   electricity and activated carbon. The residue is initially pyrolized to
   produce low hydrocarbon gases (35 wt\%), bio-oils (30 wt\%), and char
   (35 wt\%). The gases and bio-oils are separated and combusted to
   generate high pressure steam, electricity, and steam for conversion of
   char into activated carbon. Assuming 35\% of the char's mass is lost
   during activation, the proposed process produces 15.6 ktons activated
   carbon and 5.5 ktons ash annually, while generating 10.2 MW of
   electricity. Economic analysis of the proposed facility yielded capital
   costs of \$31.64 million, annual operating costs of \$31.58 million, and
   a yearly gross revenue of \$38.9 million. A discounted payback period of
   6.1 years was determined for the current design, extending to 10 years
   if the facility were operated at 75\% capacity. While the proposed
   process appears to be economically viable, profitability is highly
   sensitive to the selling price of electricity and activated carbon,
   highlighting the need for additional research into the pyrolysis reactor
   design, char/ash separation techniques, and the quality of activated
   carbon obtained using char from sunflower residue pyrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, virtualization technology has taken the world over
   by storm. This explosion has led the industry to market already existing
   virtualization technology, also known as infrastructure as a service,
   with the buzz word cloud computing. There has been much promise for
   return on investment, leading to significant research and a myriad of
   innovations in this domain. Despite the best efforts of industry
   leaders, there are still challenges with respect to enterprise security
   and policy management. In this article, we present the fundamentals of
   machine virtualization and simple network virtualization. We then
   provide a brief overview of network policy management throughout the
   evolution of virtualization. We then segue into current industry trends
   and some of its novel innovations. Throughout the article we discuss the
   challenges with respect to policy management. We finalize by analyzing
   existing solutions and building on them and those of the Distributed

Abstract = {{The effects of a non-uniform inlet field on the performance of a
   commercial, transonic, single-stage, high-pressure, axial turbine with a
   curved inlet duct have been investigated numerically by solving the
   unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the shear stress
   transport (SST) turbulence model. By adjusting the alignment of the
   experimentally-based inlet temperature field with respect to the stator
   vanes, two clocking configurations were generated: a Vane-Impinging (VI)
   case, in which each hot streak impinged on a vane and a Mid-Pitch (MP)
   case, in which each hot streak passed between two vanes. An additional
   case with a purely radial (PR) variation of inlet temperature was also
   investigated. In the VI case, it was observed that, as the hot streaks
   impinged on the stator vanes, they spread spanwise due to the actions of
   the casing passage vortices and the radial pressure gradient; this
   resulted in a stream entering the rotor with relatively low temperature
   variations. In the MP case, the hot streaks were convected undisturbed
   past the relatively cool vane section. Relatively high time-averaged
   enthalpy values were found to occur on the pressure side of the blades
   in the MP configuration.}},

Abstract = {{AW Wymore, the founder of the world's first systems engineering

   the advancement of modeling and simulation are explained. The concept of
   model-based simulation was also one of the outcomes of this cooperation.
   This article reviews the emergence of systems-theory-based modeling and
   simulation languages and environments, such as the General System Theory
   implementor and Discrete Event System Specification, and their relation
   to Wymore's concepts. We also discuss the application of powerful

Abstract = {{The GEneral System Theory implementer (GEST) was the first
   system-theory-based simulation model specification language. Even though
   a commercial implementation of GEST was not realized, over the years
   interesting ideas emerged based on it. At the beginning of this sequence
   of developments was the realization of two types of discontinuity in the
   integration of piecewise continuous systems. Afterwards, concepts
   generalized from the discontinuity processing were applied: (a) to
   modeling as a model update, multimodels, model switching, DNA-based
   modeling, dynamic model coupling, and dynamic model composability; (b)
   to simulations as multisimulation; (c) to psychology as a personality
   update and dynamic personality in human behavior simulation; (d) to
   understanding as multiunderstanding, switchable understanding, and
   misunderstanding avoidance; and (e) to emotion understanding as
   multiunderstanding and switchable understanding for better emotional
   intelligence as they are applied to the emotions of self and others.
   Each one of these areas may be the basis for some advanced modeling and
   simulation methodologies. Even though references are given for them, the
   emphasis in this article is the applicability of the same two
   discontinuity concepts to many different areas.}},

Title = {{A two-step approach to multi-damage detection for plate structures}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{73-86}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a two-step approach for detecting multiple damages in
   thin plates. The first step focuses on damage location detection. This
   is done by applying the 2-D wavelet transform to the modal shape to
   reveal singularities and hence the damage locations. The damage
   severities at the identified locations are then assessed in the second
   step using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Both the modal
   shape used in the first step and the severity evaluation database
   required for the second step to reveal the relationships between natural
   frequencies and damage severities are obtained using a wavelet finite
   element method. Our simulation studies of a simply supported plate with
   multiple damages demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in
   multi-damage detection and performed reasonably well even when the
   natural frequencies are not precisely measured. Our analyses also
   suggest that the use of higher natural frequencies could lead to better
   results for damage severity evaluation. We also find that it is
   desirable to include more natural frequencies in order to get more
   accurate severity evaluation results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We developed a diffusive load balancing technique for P2P systems. This
   technique uses the overlay network of a P2P system and results in the
   nodes of the network having similar available capacities; therefore the
   services hosted on these nodes are expected to have similar mean
   response times. In this paper, the technique is presented, including the
   policies, stages of operation, and decision algorithms. The convergence
   of the available capacities to the global average is demonstrated. The
   convergence speed depends on the decision algorithm, the neighborhood
   structure of the underlying overlay network, and the workload
   distribution. When used in a system with churn, the technique keeps the
   standard deviation of available capacities in the system within a bound.
   This bound depends on the amount of churn and the frequency of the load
   balancing operations, as well as on the distribution of node capacities.
   However, the sizes of services have little impact on this bound. The
   paper presents the results of analytical analysis and simulation
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Software Product Line Engineering concerns itself with domain
   engineering and application engineering. During domain engineering, the
   whole product family is modeled with a preferred flavor of feature
   models and additional models as required (e.g., domain models or
   scenario-based models). During application engineering, the focus shifts
   toward a single family member and the configuration of the member's
   features. Recently, aspectual concepts have been employed to better
   encapsulate individual features of a Software Product Line (SPL), but
   the existing body of SPL work does not include a unified reasoning
   framework that integrates aspect-oriented feature description artifacts
   with the capability to reason about stakeholders' goals while taking
   feature interactions into consideration. Goal-oriented SPL approaches
   have been proposed, but do not provide analysis capabilities that help
   modelers meet the needs of the numerous stakeholders involved in an SPL
   while at the same time considering feature interactions. We present an
   aspect-oriented SPL approach for the requirements phase that allows
   modelers (a) to capture features, goals, and scenarios in a unified
   framework and (b) to reason about stakeholders' needs and perform
   trade-off analyses while considering undesirable interactions that are
   not obvious from the feature model. The approach is based on the
   Aspect-oriented User Requirements Notation (AoURN) and helps identify,
   prioritize, and choose products based on analysis results provided by
   AoURN editor and analysis tools. We apply the AoURN-based SPL framework
   to the Via Verde SPL to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
   through the selection of a Via Verde product configuration that
   satisfies stakeholders' needs and results in a high-level,
   scenario-based specification that is free from undesirable feature
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports a new method for gear fault detection under
   time-varying rotating speed. This method is based on the chirplet path
   pursuit and multiscale morphology analysis. The instantaneous rotating
   speed is extracted from the gear vibration signal using the multiscale
   chirplet path pursuit algorithm. According to the extracted rotation
   speed, the gear vibration signal is resampled at constant angle
   increment and as such the nonstationary signal is converted into a
   stationary signal. The fault-induced impulsive features can then be
   extracted from the resampled signal via the multiscale morphology
   analysis, followed by the spectrum analysis to reveal the fault
   characteristic frequency. Because of the low correlations between the
   noise and chirplet functions, the rotational speed can be extracted
   effectively even when the signal-to-noise ratio of the vibration signal
   is relatively low. In addition, the noise effect can be further
   suppressed by averaging the results of morphology analyses of all the
   scales. Therefore, the proposed approach has a good antinoise ability
   and is suitable for gear fault detection under time-varying rotational
   speed. The performance of the method has been validated by both
   simulation and experimental data.}},

   several hundred times greater than before the process. It was concluded

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a class of van der Waals flows with
   non-convex flux functions. In these flows, nonclassical
   under-compressive shock waves can develop. Such waves, which are
   characterized by kinetic functions, violate classical entropy
   conditions. We propose to use a Chebyshev pseudospectral method for
   solving the governing equations. A comparison of the results of this
   method with very high-order (up to 10th-order accurate) finite
   difference schemes is presented, which shows that the proposed method
   leads to a lower level of numerical oscillations than other high-order
   finite difference schemes and also does not exhibit fast-traveling
   packages of short waves which are usually observed in high-order finite
   difference methods. The proposed method can thus successfully capture
   various complex regimes of waves and phase transitions in both elliptic
   and hyperbolic regimes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{High-quality time-frequency representation (TFR) is important for
   reliable signal analysis. The diffusions of the TFR energy along time
   and/or frequency axes lead to ambiguous TFR and hence misleading signal
   analysis results. Synchrosqueezing is an adaptive and invertible
   transform developed to improve the quality or readability of the
   wavelet-based TFR by condensing it along the frequency axis. However,
   the original synchrosqueezing method could be handicapped by
   time-dimension diffusions of the wavelet coefficients. As such, we
   propose a generalized synchrosqueezing transform (GST) approach to deal
   with the diffusions in both time and frequency dimensions. For the
   signal with a constant frequency, we have shown that the wavelet
   diffusion only occurs at frequency dimension. Based on this observation,
   the original signal with time-varying instantaneous frequency is mapped
   to another analytical signal with constant frequency to facilitate the
   synchrosqueezing. A time-scale domain restoration operation is then
   presented to obtain a TFR with concentrated wavelet ridge. The
   performance of the proposed GST for signal TFR enhancement has been
   demonstrated by our simulation study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Commercially pure aluminum and aluminum blended with 50 vol.\% and 75
   vol.\% of the intermetallic Mg17Al12 compound feedstock powders were
   successfully deposited onto as cast AZ91D magnesium substrate using a
   cold spray process that was employed at low working gas pressure and
   temperature. The microstructure, mechanical performance and corrosion
   resistance properties of the Al coatings with and without reinforcement
   particles were investigated and discussed. The results show that under
   the same deposition conditions, the coating porosity level can be
   significantly decreased by adding hard particles into the pure aluminum
   feedstock. Although, only a small fraction (less than 10 vol.\%) of the
   Mg17Al12 particles was retained in the coatings, the hardness, was
   increased from 47 +/- 5 HV0.1 to 58 +/- 3 HV0.1, while the bonding
   strength was 2 to 3 times higher than the pure Al coating. The spherical
   Mg17Al12 particles play a role similar to that of the hard ceramic
   reinforcement particles in the metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings.
   Electrochemical corrosion experiments also demonstrated that the
   composite coatings have similar electrochemical characteristics to the
   bulk Al, and they can provide suitable protection for the as cast AZ91D

Abstract = {{Access networks contribute a significant portion of the energy
   consumption of the telecom network. In this study, the authors propose a
   distributed bandwidth allocation signalling framework for a green hybrid
   Fibre-Wireless (Fi-Wi) access network, which is based on the convergence
   of ethernet passive optical network and third-generation partnership
   project-long-term evolution-advanced technologies. According to the
   proposed framework, the Fi-Wi network is deployed by pairing joint
   optical network unit-base station (ONU-BS) nodes. An ONU-BS that is
   experiencing light load from the end-users sends a SLEEP signal to the
   optical line terminal (OLT), and switches to the stand-by mode whereas
   its BS module forwards the traffic to the peer ONU-BS. The peer ONU-BS
   keeps buffering the requests destined to the sleeping ONU-BS, and sends
   REPORTs for the corresponding packets to the OLT. Through simulations,
   the authors generate various traffic profiles, and show that the
   proposed framework provides significant amount of energy savings at the
   ONUs when compared with regular operation mode. Furthermore, the
   simulation results also show that average packet delay and average
   packet loss do not increase significantly by utilising the active ONU-BS
   devices whereas their corresponding peers are sleeping.}},

Abstract = {{Low wettability is a vital characteristic for the membrane used in
   membrane contactor. Blending surface modifying macromolecule (SMM) in
   spinning dope is an interesting method to enhance the hydrophobicity of
   membrane and in this research, the effect of SMM on the properties and
   structure of polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber membrane in terms of mean
   pore size, liquid entry pressure of water (LEPw), membrane porosity and
   contact angle was investigated and compared with the properties of the
   PEI membrane without SMM.
   Furthermore the performance of PEI surface modified membrane in
   contactor applications in terms of CO2 absorption with distilled water
   was evaluated and compared with the absorption flux of PEI membrane
   without SMM and also, with the absorption flux of commercial and
   in-house made hydrophobic membranes which shows superior performance of
   surface modified PEI membrane e.g. in case of water in lumen side and
   pure CO2 in shell side of contactor and at V-liquid = 0.5 m s(-1), the
   absorption flux of PEI surface modified membrane is 2.94 x 10(-3) mol
   m(-2) s(-1) which is 114\% higher than PEI without SMM and 73\% higher

Abstract = {{Wind tunnel experiments have been used to study the effects of
   free-stream turbulence on the axisymmetric wake behind a disc. The disc
   and its wake were introduced to various turbulent streams having various
   levels of turbulence intensity and length scale. It was found that the
   presence of free-stream turbulence enhances the body's drag and hence
   wake momentum deficit, if it is of sufficient strength, changes the far
   wake's decay rate and prevents the appearance of self-similarity. The
   external turbulence causes a significant transformation in the wake's
   turbulence structure. This gradually evolves towards the character of
   the free-stream turbulence itself and thus is characterised by much
   weaker turbulence (cross-stream) transport processes and a consequent
   dominance of shear stress production, which acts to maintain the shear
   stress and mean velocity profiles.}},

Abstract = {{An all-optical wavelet transformer used to analyze a high-speed and
   broadband electrical signal is proposed and demonstrated for the first
   time to our knowledge. The wavelet transform is implemented based on a
   temporal pulse shaping system incorporating a 2-D array of cascaded
   linearly chirped fiber Bragg gratings (LCFBGs). An electrical signal to
   be analyzed is applied to a Mach-Zehnder modulator to modulate the
   optical spectrum of a time-stretched optical pulse from a mode-locked
   laser. Each individual LCFBG in the 2-D array functions as a wavelet
   filter to filter a specific range of the spectrum, which is equivalent
   to applying a window function to the corresponding section of the
   temporal signal, and at the same time, as a dispersive element to
   perform real-time Fourier transform. A Mexican Hat wavelet is employed
   to implement the optical wavelet transform, which can be achieved based
   on a specially designed LCFBG. A theoretical analysis is performed which
   is verified by a proof-of-concept experiment. The key feature of this
   technique is that it can perform multiresolution time-frequency analysis
   of an ultrahigh-speed electrical signal, which can give good time
   resolution for high-speed signals, and good frequency resolution for
   low-speed signals.}},

Abstract = {{The two-terminal flywheel introduced in Part I is suggested to be

   optimal single-objective performances of both suspensions arecompared to
   each other in actual dynamic parameter ranges. Due to the three
   conflicting and non-commensurable performance objectives, the Chebyshev
   goal programming approach is subsequently applied to find a
   multi-objective compromise for a design case. The non-ideal factors of
   the inverse screw transmission mechanism, which is modeled in Part I,
   are also taken into consideration to discuss the influence on the
   vibration suppression performance. The resultsshow that, owing to the

Abstract = {{Today, many online companies are gathering information and assembling
   sophisticated databases that know a great deal of information about many
   people, generally without the knowledge of those people. Such endeavor
   has resulted in the unprecedented attrition of individual's right to
   informational self-determination. On the one hand, Consumers are
   powerless to prevent the unauthorized dissemination of their personal
   information, and on the other, they are excluded from its profitable
   commercial exchange. This paper focuses on developing
   knowledge-empowered agent information system for privacy payoff as a
   means of rewarding consumers for sharing their personal information with
   online businesses. The design of this system is driven by the following
   argument: if consumers' personal information is a valuable asset, should
   they not be entitled to benefit from their asset as well? The proposed
   information system is a multi-agent system where several agents employ
   various knowledge and requirements for personal information valuation
   and interaction capabilities that most users cannot do on their own. The
   agents in the information system bear the responsibility of working on
   behalf of consumers to categorize their personal data objects, report to
   consumers on online businesses' trust and reputation, determine the
   value of their compensation using risk-based financial models, and
   finally negotiate for a payoff value in return for the dissemination of
   users' information. The details of the system as well as a
   proof-of-concept implementation using JADE (Java Agent Development

   zeolite and Alcan Activated Alumina AA 320-AP have been studied for
   their potential for this separation and compared with Silicalite in
   literature. Pure and mixture adsorption isotherms were determined at 40
   and 100 A degrees C for these adsorbents by constant volume method and
   concentration pulse chromatographic technique, respectively. Mixture
   adsorption isotherms for the binary system of methane and nitrogen gases
   at 40 and 100 A degrees C and 1 atmosphere total pressure have been
   determined by VV-CPM (Van der Vlist and Van der Meijden Concentration
   Pulse Method). The application of Extended Langmuir model for this
   binary system have also been discussed and compared to the experimental
   results. Results show that equilibrium separation factor for silicalite
   is larger than zeolite Ceca 13X and Alcan activated alumina AA320-AP.
   Both Silicalite and Ceca 13X find application in the bulk separation of
   methane from nitrogen when y (CH4) > 0.4, especially in LFG, coal bed
   gas and natural gas.}},

Title = {{Multi-scale autocorrelation via morphological wavelet slices for rolling
   element bearing fault diagnosis}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{428-446}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Fault features of rolling element bearings can be reflected by
   geometrical structures of the bearing vibration signals. These symptoms,
   however, often spread over various morphological scales without a known
   pattern. For this reason, we propose a multi-scale autocorrelation via
   morphological wavelet slices (MAMWS) approach to detect bearing fault
   signatures. The vibration measurement of a bearing is decomposed using
   morphological stationary wavelet with different resolutions of
   structuring elements. The extracted temporal components are then
   transformed to form a frequency-domain view of morphological slices by
   the Fourier transform. Although this three-dimensional representation is
   more intuitive in terms of fault diagnosis, the existence of the noise
   may reduce its readability. Hence the autocorrelation function is
   exploited to produce a multi-scale autocorrelation spectrogram from
   which the maximal autocorrelation values of all frequencies are
   aggregated into an ichnographical spectral representation. Accordingly
   the fault signature is highlighted for easy diagnosis of bearing faults.
   The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by both
   the simulation and experimental signal analyses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We present a new shape skeleton pruning algorithm based on contour
   approximation and the integer medial axis. The algorithm effectively
   removes unwanted branches, conserves the connectivity of the skeleton
   and respects the topological properties of the shape. The algorithm is
   robust to significant boundary noise and to rigid shape transformations,
   it is fast and easy to implement. High accuracy reconstruction of the
   shape is possible from the generated skeleton by means of the integer
   medial axis transform. Our algorithm also produces a vector
   representation of the skeleton. We compare our algorithm with
   state-of-the-art techniques for computing stable skeleton
   representations of shapes including pruning. We test and compare our
   solution using the MPEG-7 CE Shape-1 Part B dataset looking for skeleton
   connectivity, complexity, parameter selection, and accuracy/quality of
   the outcome. The experimental results show that our solution outperforms
   existing solutions according to these criteria. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) enter the environment
   mainly through municipal wastewater effluents, agricultural run-off,

   study was conducted to remove PPCPs through nano-filtration (NF)
   membranes prepared with two different tailor-made polymeric additives.
   The first is a novel charged surface modifying macromolecule (CSMM)
   additive synthesized by reactive diisocyanate and dihydroxy naphthalene
   disulfonate. The second additive was a tailor made hydrophilic SMM
   (LSMM), which was manufactured incorporating poly(ethylene glycol) as
   end groups. Cellulose acetate (CA) membranes with and without 3 wt\%
   CSMM or LSMM were prepared by the phase inversion technique. The
   membranes were characterized by static contact angle, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy
   dispersive spectrometer, and atomic force microscopy. The NF filtration
   studies were conducted at two different operating pressures (150 and 400
   psig). They consisted of pure water flux tests, sodium chloride
   separation tests, and individual PPCP (ppm level carbamazepine,
   ibuprofen, and sulfamethazine) separation tests. The long term NF
   performance for the removal of ibuprofen was also conducted. Significant
   effect of CSMM blending on the separation performance of ibuprofen for
   long hours operation was observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the design of fuzzy control systems (FCSs) with a
   reduced parametric sensitivity using simulated-annealing (SA)
   algorithms. Four generic families of objective functions expressed as
   integral quadratic performance indexes, which depend on the control
   error and squared output sensitivity functions, are suggested. SA
   algorithms are employed to minimize the objective functions in the
   appropriately defined optimization problems. A design method for
   Takagi-Sugeno proportional-integral fuzzy controllers (PI-FCs) is
   proposed. The resulting PI-FCs are intended for a class of plants
   characterized by second-order linearized models with integral component.
   A case study dealing with the angular position control of a dc servo
   system is used as test bed to validate the proposed new controller
   design. Experimental results illustrate the FCS performance.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic rectangular gold nanomonopoles and nanodipoles in a piecewise
   inhomogeneous background, consisting of a silicon substrate and a
   dielectric (aqueous) cover, have been investigated extensively via 3D
   finite-difference time-domain simulations. The transmittance,
   reflectance and absorptance response of the nanoantennas were studied as
   a function of their geometry (length, width, thickness, gap) and found
   to vary very strongly. The nanoantennas were found to resonate in a
   single surface plasmon mode supported by the corresponding rectangular
   cross-section nanowire waveguide, identified as the sa(b)(0) mode
   {[}Phys. Rev. B 63, 125417 (2001)]. We determine the propagation
   characteristics of this mode as a function of nanowire cross-section and
   wavelength, and we relate the modal results to the performance of the
   nanoantennas. An approximate expression resting on modal results is
   proposed for the resonant length of nanomonopoles, and a simple
   equivalent circuit, also resting on modal results, but involving
   transmission lines and a capacitor (modelling the gap) is proposed to
   determine the resonant wavelength of nanodipoles. The expression and the
   circuit yield results that are in good agreement with the full
   computations, and thus will prove useful in the design of nanoantennas.

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the electrochemical hydrogenation of

   The reactor was operated isothermally over the temperature range 20-68

   fed into the anode compartment and o-xylene into the cathode. The
   hydrogenation efficiency was investigated at different current densities
   and temperatures. Results obtained show that the hydrogenation
   efficiency increases with temperature but decreases with current
   density. At low current densities the hydrogenation efficiency
   approaches 100\%. A zero dimensional model was used to fit the data and
   extract a rate constant for the hydrogenation reaction. The activation
   energy for this reaction was found to be 28 kJ/mole. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper was to compare different
   electrochemical reactor configurations for the reactivation of granular
   activated carbon (GAC). Laboratory experiments were conducted using
   phenol as adsorbate: three different GACs as adsorbents; and four
   different reactor configurations (divided-cell batch reactor,
   undivided-cell batch reactor, stainless steel column type reactor, and a
   simple batch reactor). The undivided-cell and divided-cell batch
   reactors were slightly more efficient than the simple batch reactor. The
   divided-cell reactor had slightly higher efficiencies than the undivided
   reactor, however, it had a number of disadvantages that countered the
   slightly better performance. The stainless steel column reactivation
   reactor did not perform as well as the batch reactors with a single
   layer of GAC particles, possibly due to the lower fraction of the GAC
   particles in direct contact with the cathode. However, the stainless
   steel column reactivation reactor performance was slightly better than
   the batch reactors with multi-layer of GAC. Reactivation of different
   numbers of layers of GAC particles showed a significant decrease in the
   reactivation efficiency with increasing number of the GAC layers
   demonstrating the benefit for closer contact between the GAC particles
   and the electrode. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study presents a novel method to prepare nano-scale
   energetic materials with high reactivity, low porosity and controllable
   shape. The experiments have been focused on the Ni-Al system. To
   increase the reactivity, an initial mechanical activation was achieved

   achieved via the use of the Cold Gas Dynamic Spray (also known as Cold
   Spray) technique, where the particles are accelerated to high speeds and
   consolidated via plastic deformation upon impact, forming activated
   nanocomposites in arbitrary shapes with porosity levels close to zero.
   This technique permits to retain the powder microstructure in the
   coatings and prevents any reactions during the consolidation phase. The
   material reactivity is addressed through the flame propagation velocity,
   which showed an increase in the flame speed of the cold sprayed samples
   by up to one order of magnitude compared to their cold pressed

   without using any electronic microwave filters is proposed and

   of the microwave filter is a function of the wavelength spacing of the

   either the channel spacing of the sliced broadband optical source or the
   chromatic dispersion of the dispersive element. A proof-of-concept
   experiment is performed. An optoelectronic oscillator with a tunable
   frequency range of 9.7 GHz is achieved. The generated microwave signal

Title = {{A Protocol for the Secure Linking of Registries for HPV Surveillance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: In order to monitor the effectiveness of HPV vaccination
   in Canada the linkage of multiple data registries may be required. These
   registries may not always be managed by the same organization and,
   furthermore, privacy legislation or practices may restrict any data
   linkages of records that can actually be done among registries. The
   objective of this study was to develop a secure protocol for linking
   data from different registries and to allow on-going monitoring of HPV
   vaccine effectiveness.
   Methods: A secure linking protocol, using commutative hash functions and
   secure multi-party computation techniques was developed. This protocol
   allows for the exact matching of records among registries and the
   computation of statistics on the linked data while meeting five
   practical requirements to ensure patient confidentiality and privacy.
   The statistics considered were: odds ratio and its confidence interval,
   chi-square test, and relative risk and its confidence interval.
   Additional statistics on contingency tables, such as other measures of
   association, can be added using the same principles presented. The
   computation time performance of this protocol was evaluated.
   Results: The protocol has acceptable computation time and scales
   linearly with the size of the data set and the size of the contingency
   table. The worse case computation time for up to 100,000 patients
   returned by each query and a 16 cell contingency table is less than 4
   hours for basic statistics, and the best case is under 3 hours.
   Discussion: A computationally practical protocol for the secure linking
   of data from multiple registries has been demonstrated in the context of
   HPV vaccine initiative impact assessment. The basic protocol can be
   generalized to the surveillance of other conditions, diseases, or
   vaccination programs.}},

   for application in a variety of different fields. Most recently,
   microalgae are established as the most promising species for biofuel

Abstract = {{Enzymatic hydrolysis of pre-treated lignocellulosic biomass is an ideal
   alternative to acid hydrolysis for bio-ethanol production, limited
   primarily by pre-treatment requirements and economic considerations
   arising from enzyme production costs and specific activities. The quest
   for cheaper and better enzymes has prompted years of bio-prospecting,
   strain optimization through genetic engineering, enzyme characterization
   for simple and complex lignocellulosic feedstock, and the development of
   pre-treatment strategies to mitigate inhibitory effects. The recent
   shift to systematic characterizations of de novo mixtures of purified
   proteins is a promising indicator of maturation within this field of
   study, facilitating progression towards feedstock assay-based rapid
   enzyme mixture optimization. It is imperative that international
   standards be developed to enable meaningful comparisons between these
   studies and the construction of a database of enzymatic activities and
   kinetics, aspects of which are explored here-in. Complementary efforts
   to improve the economic viability of enzymatic hydrolysis through
   process integration and reactor design are also considered, where
   membrane-confinement shows significant promise despite the associated
   technological challenges. Significant advancements in enzyme technology
   towards the economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass should be
   expected within the next few years as systematic research in enzyme
   activities conforms to that of traditional reaction engineering. (C)

Abstract = {{Biomaterial-guided regeneration represents a novel approach for the
   treatment of myopathies. Revascularisation and the intramuscular
   extracellular matrix are important factors in stimulating myogenesis and
   regenerating muscle damaged by ischaemia. In this study, we used an
   injectable collagen matrix, enhanced with sialyl Lewis(X) (sLe(X)), to
   guide skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration. The elastic
   properties of collagen and sLe(X)-collagen matrices were similar to
   those of skeletal muscle, and culture of pluripotent mESCs on the
   matrices promoted their differentiation into myocyte-like cells
   expressing Pax3, MHC3, myogenin and Myf5. The regenerative properties of
   matrices were evaluated in ischaemic mouse hind-limbs. Treatment with
   the sLe(X)-matrix augmented the production of myogenic-mediated factors
   insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and IGF binding protein-2 and -5
   after 3 days. This was followed by muscle regeneration, including a
   greater number of regenerating myofibres and increased transcription of
   Six1, M-cadherin, myogenin and Myf5 after 10 days. Simultaneously, the
   sLe(X)-matrix promoted increased mobilisation and engraftment of bone
   marrow-derived progenitor cells, the development of larger arterioles
   and the restoration of tissue perfusion. Both matrix treatments tended
   to reduce maximal forces of ischaemic solei muscles, but sLe(X)-matrix
   lessened this loss of force and also prevented muscle fatigue. Only
   sLe(X)-matrix treatment improved mobility of mice on a treadmill.
   Together, these results suggest a novel approach for regenerative
   myogenesis, whereby treatment only with a matrix, which possesses an
   inherent ability to guide myogenic differentiation of pluripotent stem
   cells, can enhance the endogenous vascular and myogenic regeneration of
   skeletal muscle, thus holding promise for future clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{When a structure is subjected to dynamic or static loads, cracks may
   develop and the modal shapes and frequencies of the cracked structure
   may change accordingly. Based on this, a new method is proposed to
   locate beam cracks and to estimate their depths. The fault-induced modal
   shape and frequency changes of cracked structures are taken into account
   to construct a new hybrid crack detection method. The method includes
   two steps: crack localization and depth estimation. The locations of the
   cracks are determined by applying the wavelet transform to the modal
   shape. Using the measured natural frequencies as inputs, the depths of
   the cracks are estimated from a database established by wavelet finite
   element method. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid two-step method
   is demonstrated by numerical simulation and experimental investigation
   of a cantilever beam with two cracks. Our analyses also indicate that
   the proposed method performed reasonably well at certain level of noise.}},

Abstract = {{There is only one manipulation terminal for a flywheel in terms of the
   topology, which remains a potential bottleneck for its application in
   mechanical systems. This paper presents a two-terminal manipulation
   approach for the flywheel using the inverse screw transmission which
   yields the relative translation between two terminals resulting from the
   rotation of the flywheel. A dynamics model is accordingly put forward to
   describe both an ideal two-terminal mass and a non-ideal case including
   factors such as structure mass, friction, backlash and elastic effect. A
   prototype device is manufactured and subsequently characterized using a
   vibration rig to identify the model parameters. The results show that,
   in the commonly used frequency band, the effect of non-ideal factors is
   insignificant and thus the device can be regarded as an ideal
   two-terminal mass. However, the impact of the non-ideal factors should
   be taken into account in the other frequency ranges. The proposed
   two-terminal approach releases the ground terminal of the flywheel and
   has a great application potential in vibration control.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of model-driven software development brings new
   opportunities and challenges for rapid prototyping. On the one hand, the
   modeling process is inherently abstract, removing the prototyper from
   details, and letting him or her focus on exploring design alternatives
   for various aspects of the system. On the other hand, the most popular
   modeling languages and tools entirely omit the modeling and generating
   of user interfaces. As a result, the benefit of user interface
   prototypes as a medium for interaction with the user and customer is
   lost. This paper presents a model-oriented technology called Umple that
   can be used for prototyping and also supporting model driven
   engineering. Umple allows end users to quickly create class and state
   machine models and to incrementally embed implementation artifacts. At
   any point in the modeling process, users can quickly generate a fully
   functional prototype that exposes modeling implications on the user
   interface, and allows stakeholders to get a feel of how the full system
   will behave. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Flow behaviour of slags from coal and petroleum coke blends}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{321-328}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Petroleum coke may be used as a fuel for entrained-flow slagging
   gasification. It may be blended with coal to provide a more attractive
   feedstock. The coal provides the benefits of enhancing reactivity and
   increasing the amount of slag coating the gasifier walls, while the
   petroleum coke increases the heating value of the fuel blend. The
   slagging behaviour of the petroleum coke or blend must be known to
   determine if it is a suitable feedstock. In the present study, the slag
   viscosities of coal, petroleum coke and coal/petroleum coke blends were
   measured in the temperature range of 1175-1650 degrees C. Two different
   viscosity measurement apparatuses were used in separate laboratories.
   Some viscosity measurements were repeated to test reproducibility of the
   results. Also, slags with and without sulphur were tested to determine
   whether the effect of sulphur can be neglected. The largest deviation
   between repeated log (viscosity in Pa s) measurements is 0.11. Both
   petroleum coke slags tested are suitable for operation at or above 1275
   degrees C. The temperature range of operability for one coal slag tested
   increased when blended with petroleum coke ash, but did not
   significantly change for other coal slags tested. Some effects of
   blending on viscosity behaviour can be explained by network former and
   modifier theory. Other effects are attributed to solids formation which
   was investigated via slag quenching experiments and FactSage
   predictions. Below 1300 degrees C, vanadium, a major component of
   petroleum coke ashes, promotes the formation of spinel which increases
   slag viscosity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are several workability test methods proposed to evaluate
   workability of self-consolidating concrete (SCC). Most of these methods
   are not standard, and their reliability is still under question. In this
   study, a comprehensive experimental program and statistical analysis
   were performed to evaluate the repeatability, responsiveness and
   relative cost of commonly used SCC workability test methods. Ten
   different tests including the slump flow, V-funnel, J-ring, L-box,
   U-box, column segregation, segregation probe, flow trough, sieve
   stability and surface bleeding tests were considered herein. For
   evaluating the suitability of these tests, each test was repeated
   several times on SCC mixtures with different workability levels. The
   obtained results show that the slump flow and the J-ring tests are well
   suited for evaluating the flowability, and the segregation probe, column
   segregation and surface bleeding tests are appropriate tests for
   assessing the stability of SCC. Furthermore, when SCC is planned for use
   in congestly reinforced members, it is recommended to use the U-box and
   the V-funnel tests in addition to the former ones to ensure the passing
   ability of SCC mixture and avoid any blockage.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an advanced deinterlacing method which uses

   procedures. The fuzzy if-then rules are employed to conduct the
   determining edge direction. The use of a different membership function
   for different direction enables the filter to independently characterize
   separate influences on pixel variation. Simulation results demonstrate
   that the proposed method has an enhanced performance, both visually and

Abstract = {{This paper suggests the performance improvement of fuzzy control systems

   nonlinear processes. An IFT algorithm characterized by setting the step
   size to guarantee the FCS stability is proposed. The theoretical
   approaches are applied in a case study that deals with the IFT-based
   stable design of fuzzy controllers dedicated to the level control of a
   cylindrical three tank system as a representative MIMO system. A set of

   Continuously tunable microwave frequency multiplication with a

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the performance of some finite volume schemes
   for linear shallow water equations on a rotating frame. It is shown here
   that some well-known upwind schemes, which perform well for gravity
   waves, lead to a high level of damping or numerical oscillation for
   Rossby waves. We present a modified five-point upwind finite volume
   scheme which leads to a low level of numerical diffusion and oscillation
   for Rossby waves. The method uses a high-order upwind method for the
   calculation of the numerical flux and a fourth-order Adams method for
   time integration of the equations and is considerably more efficient
   than the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method that is usually used for
   temporal integration of shallow water equations in the presence of the
   Coriolis term. In the method proposed here, the Coriolis term is treated
   analytically in two stages: before and after calculation of
   computational fluxes. It is shown that the energy dissipation of the
   proposed method is considerably less than other upwind methods that are
   widely used, such as the third-order upwind method. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A continuously tunable microwave fractional Hilbert transformer (FHT)
   implemented based on a nonuniformly spaced photonic microwave delay-line

   shift between 0 and pi at the center frequency. A seven-tap photonic
   microwave delay-line filter with nonuniformly spaced taps is designed to
   provide such a frequency response. The advantage of using nonuniform
   spacing is that an equivalent negative coefficient can be achieved by
   introducing an additional time delay leading to a pi phase shift,
   corresponding to a negative coefficient. An FHT operating at a center
   frequency around 8.165 GHz with a tunable order between 0.24 and 1 is
   implemented. A classical HT operating at a center frequency of 7.573 GHz
   with a bandwidth greater than 4.5 GHz is also implemented. The use of
   the classical HT to perform temporal Hilbert transform of a

Abstract = {{The re-occurrence pattern of major extremes in hydrology, such as the
   timing and intensity of river floods, is related to a variety of natural
   and anthropogenic factors. In this study, the particular temporal
   regional influence of similar to 11 year solar radiation cyclicities on
   the maximum annual streamflow (MAS) records from six stations from four
   eco-zones in Southern Canada were investigated. Wavelet analysis
   decomposition and re-composition techniques were applied to extract the
   similar to 11 year signals in the hydrological records. An similar to 11
   year cyclicity is evident in all eco-zones but it is superimposed by
   non-periodic variability in the 2 to 18 year wavebands that are due to
   El Nino/Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation related
   precipitation variability or random components in the records. The
   similar to 11 year MAS cyclicity is strong in the Mountain ecozone
   (Rocky Mountains) and less strong in the Boreal Shield. In these
   eco-zones, it was found that years that experienced major floods were
   most likely to occur during low sunspot number years, in the spring time
   approximately 6-7 years after the last solar maximum. The results of the
   wavelet analysis demonstrate that major floods are more likely to occur
   during sunspot cycles with relatively low sunspot numbers after the last
   maximum. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical power grid has recently been embracing the advances in
   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for the sake of
   improving efficiency, safety, reliability and sustainability of
   electrical services. For a reliable smart grid, accurate, robust
   monitoring and diagnosis tools are essential. Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs) are promising candidates for monitoring the smart grid, given
   their capability to cover large geographic regions at low-cost. On the
   other hand, limited battery lifetime of the conventional WSNs may create
   a performance bottleneck for the long-lasting smart grid monitoring
   tasks, especially considering that the sensor nodes may be deployed in
   hard to reach, harsh environments. In this context, recent advances in
   Radio Frequency (RF)-based wireless energy transfer can increase
   sustainability of WSNs and make them operationally ready for smart grid
   monitoring missions. RF-based wireless energy transfer uses
   Electromagnetic (EM) waves and it operates in the same medium as the
   data communication protocols. In order to achieve timely and efficient
   charging of the sensor nodes, we propose the Sustainable wireless
   Rechargeable Sensor network (SuReSense). SuReSense employs mobile
   chargers that charge multiple sensors from several landmark locations.
   We propose an optimization model to select the minimum number of
   landmarks according to the locations and energy replenishment
   requirements of the sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The past few years have witnessed increased interest among researchers

   each stage of cluster head selection, cluster formation, data
   aggregation and data communication. We summarize the techniques and
   methods used in these categories, while the weakness and strength of
   each protocol is pointed out in details. Furthermore, taxonomy of the
   protocols in each phase is given to provide a deeper understanding of
   current clustering approaches. Ultimately based on the existing

Abstract = {{Matching dependencies (MDs) are used to declaratively specify the
   identification (or matching) of certain attribute values in pairs of
   database tuples when some similarity conditions on other values are
   satisfied. Their enforcement can be seen as a natural generalization of
   entity resolution. In what we call the pure case of MD enforcement, an
   arbitrary value from the underlying data domain can be used for the
   value in common that is used for a matching. However, the overall number
   of changes of attribute values is expected to be kept to a minimum. We
   investigate this case in terms of semantics and the properties of data
   cleaning through the enforcement of MDs. We characterize the intended
   clean instances, and also the clean answers to queries, as those that
   are invariant under the cleaning process. The complexity of computing
   clean instances and clean query answering is investigated. Tractable and
   intractable cases depending on the MDs are identified and characterized.}},

Abstract = {{A novel photonic approach to generating a frequency-quadrupled
   millimeter-wave (mm-wave) signal with a tunable phase shift is proposed
   and demonstrated. Two second-order optical sidebands are generated by
   using a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) that is biased at the maximum
   transmission point and an optical notch filter. A
   polarization-maintaining fiber Bragg grating (PM-FBG) is then utilized
   to make the two sidebands orthogonally polarized, which are then sent to
   a polarization modulator (PolM). By aligning the two orthogonally
   polarized sidebands with the two principal axes of the PolM,
   complementary phase modulation is thus achieved. By beating the two
   phase-modulated sidebands at a photodetector, an mm-wave signal is
   generated and its phase is continuously tunable by tuning the bias
   voltage to the PolM. An experiment is performed. An mm-wave signal with

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: In acute lung injury (ALI), the application of positive
   end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is known to prevent the alveoli from
   cyclic collapse and reopening and to homogenize ventilation. The setting
   of adequate PEEP could be optimized by the knowledge of regional lung
   opening and closing pressures at the bedside. The aim of our study was
   to determine regional opening and closing pressures in ventilated
   patients by electrical impedance tomography (EIT).
   Materials and Methods: Eight patients with healthy lungs and 18 patients
   with ALI were studied. A low-flow inflation and deflation maneuver with
   constant gas flow was performed. Regional opening and closing pressures
   were calculated for every pixel of the EIT scan. These pressures were
   defined as those values of global airway pressure at which the lung
   areas opened up or started to close.
   Results: Injured lungs exhibited significantly higher regional opening
   pressures compared with healthy lungs (P < .05). In ALI, significantly
   higher opening pressures were found in the dependent lung regions.
   Regional closing pressures did not significantly differ between healthy
   and injured lungs.
   Conclusions: Regional lung opening and closing pressures can be assessed
   by EIT. This information may facilitate the setting of adequate PEEP
   levels in patients in future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Wind-driven waves and currents exert shear stress on the bed of a
   tailings pond. A semi-empirical approach for estimating this bed shear
   stress is presented in this paper. For the first time in a mine tailings
   storage facility, the current-induced component of the bed shear stress
   was obtained using 1,200-kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler
   measurements of in situ currents and a log-law fit to the mean velocity
   profiles, while the wave-induced portion was calculated using empirical
   wave hindcasting equations. The total bed shear stress was obtained by
   non-linear addition of wave and current components using a wave-current
   interaction approach. The study was conducted in the middle cell of the
   Shebandowan tailings storage facility, northern Ontario, Canada. The
   measured currents facilitated the visualization of the complex near-bed
   circulatory flow pattern in the pond. The estimated combined
   wave-current bed shear stress varied from 0.0006 to 0.16 Pa with an
   average value of 0.028 Pa. The results also showed that linear addition
   of bed shear stresses due to waves and currents could underestimate the
   total bed shear stress. A comparison of the results of the present work
   to those of previous studies suggests that it is more reliable to obtain
   current-induced bed shear stress from field measurements than to
   estimate it from empirical equations.}},

Abstract = {{Current noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement methods, such as the
   oscillometric method, estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure
   (SBP and DBP) at two random instants in time and do not take into
   account the natural variability in BP. The standard for automated BP
   devices sets a maximum allowable system error of +/- 5 mmHg, even though
   natural BP variability often exceeds these limits. This paper proposes a
   new approach using simultaneous recordings of the oscillometric and
   continuous arterial pulse waveforms to augment the conventional
   noninvasive measurement by providing (1) the mean SBP and DBP over the
   measurement interval and the associated confidence intervals of the
   mean, (2) the standard deviation of SBP and DBP over the measurement
   interval, which indicates the degree of fluctuation in BP and (3) an
   indicator as to whether or not the oscillometric reading is an outlier.
   Recordings with healthy subjects demonstrate the potential utility of
   this approach to characterize BP, to detect outlier measurements, and
   that it does not suffer from bias relative to the conventional
   oscillometric method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the design and implementation of a framework that
   automatically extracts andmonitors the shape deformations of soft
   objects from a video sequence and maps them with force measurements with
   the goal of providing the necessary information to the controller of a
   robotic hand to ensure safe model-based deformable object manipulation.
   Measurements corresponding to the interaction force at the level of the
   fingertips and to the position of the fingertips of a three-finger
   robotic hand are associated with the contours of a deformed object
   tracked in a series of images using neural-network approaches. The
   resulting model captures the behavior of the object and is able to
   predict its behavior for previously unseen interactions without any
   assumption on the object's material. The availability of such models can
   contribute to the improvement of a robotic hand controller, therefore
   allowing more accurate and stable grasp while providing more elaborate
   manipulation capabilities for deformable objects. Experiments performed
   for different objects, made of various materials, reveal that the method
   accurately captures and predicts the object's shape deformation while
   the object is submitted to external forces applied by the robot fingers.
   The proposed method is also fast and insensitive to severe contour
   deformations, as well as to smooth changes in lighting, contrast, and
   background.}},

Abstract = {{An optical approach to generating continuously tunable chirped microwave
   waveforms using a tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) written in an
   erbium/ytterbium (Er/Yb) codoped fiber is proposed. By pumping the TFBG,
   the magnitude and group delay responses of the cladding mode resonances
   are changed, which can be used to implement a photonic microwave
   delay-line filter with increasing or decreasing tap spacing. If an
   ultranarrow pulse is sent to the photonic microwave delay-line filter, a
   pulse burst with increasing or decreasing pulse spacing is generated.
   The photodetection of the pulse burst would lead to the generation of a
   chirped microwave waveform. The proposed technique is demonstrated by an
   experiment in which a chirped microwave waveform with a tunable chirp
   rate from 1.8 to 7 GHz/ns is generated.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate Diagnosis of lung disease depends on understanding the sounds
   emanating from lung and its location. Lung sounds are of significance as
   they supply precise and important information on the health of the
   respiratory system. In addition, correct interpretation of breath sounds
   depends on a systematic approach to auscultation; it also requires the
   ability to describe the location of abnormal finding in relation to bony
   structures and anatomic landmark lines. Lungs consist of number of
   lobes; each lung lobe is further subdivided into smaller segments. These
   segments are attached to each other. Knowledge of the position of the
   lung segments is useful and important during the auscultation and
   diagnosis of the lung diseases. Usually the medical doctors give the
   location of the infection a segmental position reference. Breath sounds
   are auscultated over the anterior chest wall surface, the lateral chest
   wall surfaces, and posterior chest wall surface. Adventitious sounds
   from different location can be detected. It is common to seek
   confirmation of the sound detection and its location using invasive and
   potentially harmful imaging diagnosis techniques like x-rays. To
   overcome this limitation and for fast, reliable, accurate, and
   inexpensive diagnose a technique is developed in this research for
   identifying the location of infection through a computerized
   auscultation system.}},

Abstract = {{The most important goal in event-driven wireless sensor networks is to
   transmit the event information to users as soon as possible. One of the
   most important factors that would make it possible to reach this goal is
   the design of efficient detecting protocols. In this paper, we present
   an efficient event detecting protocol (EEDP) specified for event
   monitoring applications. In the event occuring area, each node
   broadcasts its primary detection result to make a decision corporately.
   And then the decision-made node will choose the next hop using the
   underlying routing protocol to forward a single alarm packet. To improve
   the reliable transmission of the single alarm packet, we use a dynamic
   multicopy scheme similar as conventional multipath routing for
   continuous flow. The simulation results validate that EEDP is a
   practical and efficient protocol for event detection applications where
   the constraints of end-to-end delay and reliability are stringent.}},

   The influence of the nature of the feedstock material on the

   The PGDS process provides an opportunity to preserve the phase of the

   between deformed particles and good adhesion to the substrate. High dry
   sliding wear resistance was observed when cryomilled composite material

Abstract = {{Commercially pure aluminum (CP-Al) powder was deposited by the cold
   spray process onto AZ91D magnesium (Mg) substrates that had been
   subjected to three different heat-treatment conditions: namely, as-cast
   (F), homogenized (T4), and artificially aged (T6). The substrate
   hardness was measured to be 80.7 +/- A 1.8, 73.7 +/- A 4.0, and 103.6
   +/- A 7.4 HV0.025 for the F-, T4-, and T6-Mg alloy substrates
   respectively. Thick (similar to 400 mu m) and dense (below 1\% porosity)
   Al coatings have been obtained. After post-deposition heat treatment at
   400 A degrees C, the intermetallic Mg17Al12 (beta) and Al3Mg2 (gamma)
   phases with different thicknesses were found to have formed at the
   coating/substrate interface depending on the holding time. While no
   significant thickness differences of the intermetallic layers were
   detected in the cases of F- and T6-AZ91D substrates, thicker layers
   formed on the T4-AZ91D substrate. It is believed that the higher Al
   concentration in the T4-AZ91D solid solution within the alpha-Mg could
   diffuse and contribute more easily to the growth of the intermetallic
   phases. The hardness of the beta- and gamma-phase was measured to be
   260.5 +/- A 10.7 HV0.025 and 279.6 +/- A 13.7 HV0.025, respectively.
   Shear strength test results revealed lower adhesion strength after heat
   treatment, which is attributed to the presence of brittle intermetallic
   layers at the coating/substrate interface.}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the role played by diffusion in detonation structure,
   two-dimensional numerical simulations are performed by solving the
   Navier-Stokes equations and considering the single step Arrhenius
   kinetic as reaction model. The effect of diffusion on the generation of
   vortices produced by hydrodynamic instabilities (Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM)
   and Kelvin Helmholtz (KH) instabilities) is investigated. Mixtures with
   both low and high activation energies, characterized by their regular
   and irregular detonation structures, are considered. The computations
   are performed with resolutions ranging from 25 to 10(3) cells per half
   reaction length of the ZND structure. Resolution studies of the
   Navier-Stokes solution for irregular detonations in moderate activation
   energy mixtures shows that to capture a proper structure, to be at least
   in qualitative agreement with experimental observations, resolution more
   that 300 cells per half reaction length is required. However, in
   mixtures with low activation energy a resolution of 25 cells per half
   reaction length gives a reasonable physical structure of the detonation.
   Results provided by very high resolution for irregular structure
   detonations reveal that the major effect of diffusion occurs at shear
   layers and unburned pockets boundaries. Diffusion suppresses the
   small-scale vortices produced by KH instabilities and decreases the
   turbulent mixing rate of burned and partly burned gases at shear layers.
   However, behind the shock front, where less concentration of small-scale
   vortices exist, the diffusion of heat and mass from neighboring hot
   regions of burned material to the unreacted gases increases the burning
   rate of the un-reacted pockets. Comparison of the structure obtained by
   solving the Euler equations with the solution of the Navier-Stokes
   equations shows that, the strength of the shock front in Navier-Stokes
   solution is higher than that in Euler solution. Due to the absence of
   hydrodynamic instabilities behind the main front of regular structure
   detonations, the results obtained by solving the Euler equations and
   Navier-Stokes equations are similar for detonations with regular
   structure even in high resolution simulations. (C) 2012 The Combustion

Abstract = {{We consider the fault identification problem, also known as the
   system-level self-diagnosis, in multiprocessor and multicomputer systems
   using the comparison approach. In this diagnosis model, a set of tasks
   is assigned to pairs of nodes and their outcomes are compared by
   neighboring nodes. Given that comparisons are performed by the nodes
   themselves, faulty nodes can incorrectly claim that fault-free nodes are
   faulty or that faulty ones are fault-free. The collections of all
   agreements and disagreements, i.e., the comparison outcomes, among the
   nodes are used to identify the set of permanently faulty nodes. Since
   the introduction of the comparison model, significant progress has been
   made in both theory and practice associated with the original model and
   its offshoots. Nevertheless, the problem of efficiently identifying the
   set of faulty nodes when not all the comparison outcomes are available
   to the diagnosis algorithm at the beginning of the diagnosis phase,
   i.e., partial syndromes, remains an outstanding research issue. In this
   paper, we introduce a novel diagnosis approach using neural networks to
   solve this fault identification problem using partial syndromes. Results
   from a thorough simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   neural-network-based self-diagnosis algorithm for randomly generated
   diagnosable systems of different sizes and under various fault
   scenarios. We have then conducted extensive simulations using partial
   syndromes and nondiagnosable systems. Simulations showed that the
   neural-network-based diagnosis approach provided good results making it
   a viable addition or alternative to existing diagnosis algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is responsible for
   increased global warming of our planet. The increasing concentration of
   carbon dioxide mainly from flue gas, automobile and landfill gas (LFG)
   emissions are major contributors to this problem. In this work, CO2, CH4
   and N2 adsorption was studied on Ceca 13X zeolite by determining pure
   and binary mixture isotherms using a constant volume method and a
   concentration pulse chromatographic technique at 40 and 100 degrees C.
   The experimental data were then compared to the predicted binary
   behaviour by extended Langmuir model. Results showed that the extended
   Langmuir theoretical adsorption model can only be applied as an
   approximation to predict the experimental binary behaviour for the
   systems studied. Equilibrium phase diagrams were obtained from the
   experimental binary isotherms. For these systems, the integral
   thermodynamic consistency tests were also conducted. It was found that
   Ceca 13X exhibits large CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity and could find
   application in landfill gas purification, CO2 removal from natural gas
   and CO2 removal from ambient air or flue gas streams. (C) 2011 Canadian

Abstract = {{Some new nonlinear analytical solutions are found for axisymmetric
   horizontal flows dominated by strong heat sources. These flows are

   benchmark problems for validating numerical models. A central weighted
   essentially non-oscillatory (CWENO) reconstruction is also employed for
   numerical simulation of the corresponding integro-differential
   equations. Due to the use of the same polynomial reconstruction for all
   derivatives and integral terms, the balance between those terms is well
   preserved, and the method can precisely reproduce the exact solutions,
   which are hard to capture by traditional upwind schemes. The developed
   analytical solutions were employed to evaluate the performance of the
   numerical method, which showed an excellent performance of the numerical

   Pichia pastoris: A review}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{91-105}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Pichia pastoris is currently one of the most effective and versatile
   systems for the expression of heterologous proteins. Its success is due
   to its powerful methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter,
   capacity to perform post-translational modifications and pathways
   leading to recombinant products secretion. Despite its advantages, P.
   pastoris cultivation is plagued by high protease expression levels, high
   sensitivity to methanol levels, nutrient-deficiency when grown on
   defined media, difficulties in systematic study due to product-specific
   effects, and health and safety concerns associated with the storage of
   large quantities of methanol. Difficulties also arise that are specific
   to the cultivation methods and control strategies used.
   The present review discusses several bioprocess engineering aspects
   related to P. pastoris cultivation, including the different promoters
   available, both constitutive and inductive, on- and off-line process
   parameter monitoring methods, fed-batch and continuous cultivation
   control strategies, proteolytic degradation of products and methods to
   minimize associated yield reductions, and the different models devised
   to describe cell growth and protein production. The economics of P.
   pastoris cultivation, through a case-study involving recombinant phytase
   production, are also discussed. The study of yeast fermentation is
   currently very dynamic, and P. pastoris is on its way towards becoming a
   standard expression system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Endex calcium looping is a novel early-stage technology for separating
   CO2 from flue gases that shows great potential for reducing the high
   cost of the regeneration step because the calcination temperature is
   significantly lower. In this work an Endex calcium looping system is
   modelled as a train of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) elements
   mass-coupled in series and thermally coupled in parallel. A novel
   simulator was developed that incorporates object-oriented design to
   describe the Endex reactor and its components, and used to study the
   effects of varying the most important design and operating parameters.
   From a reactor design point of view, varying the heat transfer
   coefficient and the sorbent flow rate amounts to testing the classic
   tradeoff between capital and running costs: we may choose between higher
   capital costs (larger heat transfer coefficient) and lower running costs
   (low sorbent flow rate) or vice versa, for similar scrubbing and

Abstract = {{In this article an attempt was made to fabricate defect-free asymmetric
   polysulfone (PSf) membranes for the separation of oxygen and nitrogen.
   The approach is based on the enhanced delayed demixing by blending
   surface modifying macromolecules (SMMs) in the casting solution and by
   immersing the cast film in isopropanol for a certain period before it is
   immersed in water. Different SMMs, including hydrophobic and charged
   SMMs, were synthesized, characterized, and blended to the host PSf. It
   was found that the charged SMM could indeed contribute to the removal of
   defective pores from the skin layer and enhancement of oxygen/nitrogen
   selectivity. The experimental results were further interpreted based on
   the shift of the phase boundary line on the polymer/solvent/nonsolvent
   triangular diagram, which occurred when SMMs were blended to PSf, due to
   the change in the polymer/nonsolvent interaction. (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{Integrally skinned asymmetric membranes for the separation of O2 and N2
   were fabricated by the phase inversion technique from polysulfone,
   polyetherimide, and polyimide. Two types of surface modifying
   macromolecules (SMMs) including hydrophilic SMM (LSMM) and charged SMM
   (cSMM) were synthesized and blended with the casting solution to modify
   the membrane surface. The cast film was then immersed in the first
   coagulant alcohol (methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol) for a
   predetermined period, before being immersed in the second coagulant
   (water). The SMMs used in these experiments were laboratory synthesized
   by the two-step process of polyurethane prepolymer synthesis and end
   capping, before being characterized by differential scanning
   calorimetry. Their molecular structure was determined from the molecular
   weight obtained by gel permeation chromatography. The membranes were
   characterized by contact angle measurement and O2 and N2 gas permeation
   performance. Attempts were made to interpret the gas permeation data by
   delayed demixing affected by solubility parameters of polymer, solvent,
   and nonsolvent. Furthermore, the permeation performance of cSMM
   membranes was interpreted by the solvation of the charged sulfonate
   groups present in cSMM. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A two-dimensional direct numerical simulation study of the linear
   instability in a laminar plane wall jet is presented. The evolution of
   the wall jet disturbances is in reasonable agreement with predictions by
   spatial linear stability theory only with regard to the wavelength and
   the amplitude shape of the disturbance, whereas significant differences
   in the linear growth rate are noticed. As a consequence, the ``stable
   island{''} on the instability map based on linear stability theory turns
   out to be connected with the outer stable region in the simulations,
   thus taking the form of a ``stable peninsula{''}. The failure of the
   theory is attributed to the rapid streamwise spread and decay of the
   wall jet, which is incompatible with the assumption of parallel flow. We
   also assess the maximum possible transient linear amplification of
   two-dimensional disturbances in the plane wall jet, using the concept of
   optimal initial disturbances. The transient energy growth relies on the
   Orr mechanism, and the upper bound of the disturbance energy increases
   linearly in time for the present flow configuration. The optimal
   disturbances exhibit local maxima near the edge of the jet and close to
   the wall, where sites of effective receptivity are hence expected. We
   find that the outer region of the plane wall jet is more receptive to
   time periodic forcing than the inner region. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{This paper highlights the role of plant volatile organic compounds,
   found in essential oils, for the treatment of bacteria related
   inflammation. This report is focused on tea tree oil, particularly its
   main compound terpinen-4-ol. Analysis of the published literature shows
   that many essential oils have significant antibacterial, antifungal and
   anti-inflammatoiy effects. Some of their major components, such as
   terpinen-4-ol, act by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression
   while stimulating production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Such
   observations may be exploited to encourage biotherapy against mastitis.
   The use of synthetic antibiotics is being increasingly discouraged
   because their presence in dairy milk may have potential downstream
   effects on population health and the agri-food chain. In the context of
   inflammation and related mammalian responses, understanding the
   interplay between volatile organic compounds, especially terpinen-4-ol,
   and cytokines during bacteria related inflammation should clarify their

Abstract = {{Batch codes, introduced by Ishai et al. in {[}11], are methods for
   solving the following data storage problem: n data items are to be
   stored in m servers in such a way that any k of the n items can be
   retrieved by reading at most t items from each server, and that the
   total number of items stored in m servers is N. A combinatorial batch
   code (CBC) is a batch code where each data item is stored without
   change, i.e., each stored data item is a copy of one of the n data
   items.
   One of the basic yet challenging problems is to find optimal CBCs, i.e.,
   CBCs for which total storage (N) is minimal for given values of n, m, k,
   and t. In {[}13], Paterson et al. exclusively studied CBCs and gave
   constructions of some optimal CBCs.
   In this article, we give a lower bound on the total storage (N) for
   CBCs. We give explicit construction of optimal CBCs for a range of
   values of n. For a different range of values of n, we give explicit
   construction of optimal and almost optimal CBCs. Our results partly
   settle an open problem of {[}13].}},

Abstract = {{The basic design equations for symmetrical sub-reflectarrays are
   derived. These provide the required phase-distribution on the
   sub-reflectarray surface. Both ellipsoidal-type and hyperboloidal-type
   sub-reflectarrays are designed and fabricated using single-layer
   rectangular patch elements. Measured amplitude and phase patterns are
   shown for both types of sub-reflectarray, and compared to predictions.
   The behaviour of the ellipsoidal-type sub-reflectarray is furthermore
   compared to measured patterns of its solid subreflector counterpart.
   These experimental results show that the sub-reflectarrays indeed
   emulate the behaviour of their solid subreflector counterparts, and the
   validity of the basic design equations is thus established.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach to implementing a narrow-passband and frequency-tunable
   microwave photonic filter (MPF) based on phase-modulation to
   intensity-modulation conversion in a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating
   (PS-FBG) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In the proposed
   MPF, a phase-modulated signal is sent to a PS-FBG. If one of the
   sidebands falls in the notch of the PS-FBG, the phase-modulated signal
   is converted to an intensity-modulated signal. Due to the ultra-narrow
   notch of the PS-FBG, a microwave filter with an ultra-narrow passband is
   realized. The tunability of the microwave filter is achieved by tuning
   the wavelength of the optical carrier. A theoretical analysis is
   performed in which the value of the phase shift and the location of the
   phase shift in the PS-FBG on the frequency response of the MPF are
   studied. Two PS-FBGs with different reflection bandwidths and different
   phase-shift values introduced at the center of the gratings are

Abstract = {{Growth patterns vary in space and time as an organ develops, leading to
   shape and size changes. Quantifying spatiotemporal variations in organ
   growth throughout development is therefore crucial to understand how
   organ shape is controlled. We present a novel method and computational
   tools to quantify spatial patterns of growth from three-dimensional data
   at the adaxial surface of leaves. Growth patterns are first calculated
   by semiautomatically tracking microscopic fluorescent particles applied
   to the leaf surface. Results from multiple leaf samples are then
   combined to generate mean maps of various growth descriptors, including
   relative growth, directionality, and anisotropy. The method was applied
   to the first rosette leaf of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and
   revealed clear spatiotemporal patterns, which can be interpreted in
   terms of gradients in concentrations of growth-regulating substances. As
   surface growth is tracked in three dimensions, the method is applicable
   to young leaves as they first emerge and to nonflat leaves. The
   semiautomated software tools developed allow for a high throughput of
   data, and the algorithms for generating mean maps of growth open the way
   for standardized comparative analyses of growth patterns.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and demonstrate an optically tunable photonic fractional
   temporal differentiator using a tilted fiber Bragg grating written in an
   erbium/ytterbium (Er-Yb) co-doped fiber. Thanks to the high absorption
   of the Er-Yb co-doped fiber, when it is pumped the refractive index is
   changed, and thus the phase of a cladding mode resonant wavelength is
   changed continuously by continuous tuning of the pumping power. By
   locating the wavelength of the input light wave at the location of a
   cladding mode resonant wavelength, a temporal differentiator with a
   tunable fractional order is achieved. The proposed technique is
   experimentally evaluated. A temporal differentiator with a tunable
   fractional order is demonstrated. The use of the fractional
   differentiator to implement temporal differentiation of a Gaussian pulse

Abstract = {{The coupled evolution of the main performance properties (thermal,
   hydraulic, mechanical) of underground cemented paste tailings that
   contain sodium silicate as chemical admixture are studied by means of
   unsaturated column experiments. Two columns have been built to simulate
   the thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) behaviour of the aforementioned
   cemented paste tailings (called gelfill. CF) under drained and undrained
   conditions. The GF columns are cured at room temperature for 28 days.
   The suction and temperature developments during the hydration process
   are monitored. When the curing phase has been completed, the cylindrical
   samples are taken out from the columns to evaluate the thermal,
   hydraulic and mechanical properties of CF. Uniaxial compressive strength
   (UCS), saturated hydraulic conductivity, and thermal conductivity tests
   are conducted. The results show that the mechanical, hydraulic and
   thermal properties of CF columns are coupled. The UCS values of CF are
   strongly coupled to heat development, saturation and suction development
   within the CF. In addition, the UCS outcomes, saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, and thermal conductivity tests for samples obtained from
   the CF columns show higher values than small samples. This study has
   demonstrated that the coupled THM effect on GFs is an important factor
   for consideration in the designing of cost-effective, safe and durable
   CF structures. The results presented in this paper will contribute to a
   better understanding of the THM behaviour of underground CF structures.

Abstract = {{Corrugated reactors are known for their use in applications requiring
   exposure of a reaction medium or catalyst to UV radiation. During

   curvature on UV absorption patterns, spatial absorption/incidence
   patterns and the total absorption efficiency are explored for a broad
   range of fold curvatures and film angles using a conservative,
   finite-element based discrete-ordinate model. The presence of curvature
   was found to redistribute radiation from the deepest confines of the
   V-shaped geometry to surfaces closer to the light source. The
   simulations performed suggest that at small film angles, moderate
   curvature can be incorporated within the fold of the film without
   significantly affecting the overall absorption efficiency. Detailed
   absorption data is included for use as a boundary condition for

Abstract = {{An organic template assisted synthesis was developed to obtain highly
   ordered porous LiFePO4 cathode material. The developed synthesis enabled
   the use of polystyrene (PS) as template by modifying its surface with a
   surfactant (Brij 78) to render it hydrophilic. The material was
   synthesized in high yield and purity as confirmed by X-ray powder
   diffraction. The TEM and SEM images clearly confirmed the presence of a
   highly ordered porous structure and the latter showed that the structure
   has an average pore diameter of 400 nm and a wall thickness and depth of
   similar to 100 nm. Thermal scans and elemental analysis showed that the
   material contains a high amount of carbon reaching 23-28\% by weight.
   The surface area was calculated using the BET method and found to be
   7.71 m(2) g(-1). Li/LiFePO4 half cells were tested and gave satisfactory
   discharge capacities; an initial capacity (158 mAh g(-1)) close to the
   theoretical value and recoverable capacities at high C-rates (2-5 C).

Abstract = {{HC-128 is an eSTREAM final portfolio stream cipher. Several authors have
   investigated its security and, in particular, distinguishing attacks
   have been considered. Still, no one has been able to provide a
   distinguisher stronger than the one presented by Wu in the original
   HC-128 paper. In this paper we first argue that the keystream
   requirement in Wu's original attack is underestimated by a factor of
   almost 2(8). Our revised analysis shows that the keystream complexity of
   Wu's original attack is 2(160.471) 32-bit keystream blocks. We then go
   on to investigate two new types of distinguishers on HC-128. One of
   them, a distinguisher counting the number of zeros in created blocks of
   bits, gives a biased distribution that requires 2(143.537) such
   constructed block samples (2(152.537) 32-bit keystream blocks). For
   fairness, the same metric is used to compare our attack to Wu's, and our
   improvement is significant compared to Wu's original result.
   Furthermore, the vector-based methodology used is general and can be
   applied to any cryptographic primitive that reveals a suitable
   probability distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A super-convergent finite element is developed for the steady state
   analysis of circular cylinders under general harmonic forces based on
   thin shell theory. Simplifying assumptions in previous thin-shell
   formulations for straight cylinders are avoided. The resulting model is
   capable of capturing general in-plane and out-of-plain cross sectional
   distortions including ovalization, warping, radial extensibility, etc. A
   series of shape functions are then developed based on the exact solution
   of the field equations and used to formulate a cylindrical finite
   element capable of capturing thin shell behaviour with very few degrees
   of freedom. Through examples, the element is shown to efficiently model
   cylinders subject to in-phase and out-of phase harmonic loading and
   support excitation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun nanofiber membranes consisting of poly(vinylidene fluoride)

   Various compositions of PVDF-clay nanocomposite nanofiber membranes

   transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry,
   scanning electron microscopy and investigated for DCMD. The
   incorporation of clay nanocomposites increase the hydrophobicity of the
   membranes, which increase as the concentration of clay nanocomposite
   increases in the mixture. The highest water contact angle achieved was
   154.20 +/- 3.04 degrees. The melting point of the PVDF-clay electrospun
   nanofiber membrane increases with the increasing concentration of clay
   indicating that the clay particles influence the crystallization process
   of the nanocomposite membrane. The PVDF-clay NNMs showed improved
   performance in DCMD applications and provide a way to prevent pore

Abstract = {{The introduction of 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP) into sulfonated
   poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK)/Cloisite15A(R) nanocomposite membranes
   were investigated for the purpose of maintaining low methanol
   permeability and suppressing swelling in direct methanol fuel cell
   (DMFC). SPEEK with 63\% of degree of sulfonation (DS) was prepared by
   sulfonation of PEEK. Cloisite15A (7.5 wt \%) along with various weight
   loading of TAP was incorporated into SPEEK matrix via solution
   intercalation method. The effect of TAP loading on the
   SPEEK/Cloisite15A/TAP morphology was studied. The beneficial impact of
   the SPEEK/Cloisite15A/TAP morphology on the physicochemical properties
   of the membrane was further discussed. Swelling behavior, ion exchange
   capacity (IEC), proton conductivity, and methanol permeability of the
   resultant membranes were determined as a function of Cloisite15A and TAP
   loadings. Uniform distribution of Cloisite15A particles in the SPEEK
   polymer matrix in the homogenous SPEEK/Cloisite15A/TAP nanocomposite
   membranes was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray
   diffraction. The water uptake of the SPEEK nanocomposite membranes
   decreased dramatically in the presence of TAP. The significant
   selectivity of SP/7.5/7.5 nanocomposite membranes could indicate a
   potential feasibility as a promising electrolyte for DMFC. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In the field of tissue engineering there is always a need for new
   engineered polymeric biomaterials which have ideal properties and
   functional customization. Unfortunately the demands for many biomedical
   applications need a set of properties that no polymers can fulfill. One
   method to satisfy these demands and providing desirable new biomaterials
   is by mixing two or more polymers. In this work, random nanofibrous
   blends of poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and polyglycolic acid (PGA)
   with various PCL/PGA compositions (100/0, 80/20, 65/35, 50/50, and
   0/100) were fabricated by electrospinning method and characterized for
   soft-tissue engineering applications. Physical, chemical, thermal, and
   mechanical properties of PCL/PGA blend nanofibers were measured by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), porosimetry, contact angle
   measurement, water uptake, attenuated total reflectance Fourier
   transform-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   differential scanning calorimetric (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal
   analysis (DMTA), and tensile measurements. Morphological
   characterization showed that the addition of PGA to PCL results in an
   increase in the average diameter of the nanofibers. According to these
   results, when the amount of PGA in the blend solution increased, the
   hydrophilicity and water uptake of the nanofibrous scaffolds increased
   concurrently, approaching those of PGA nanofibers. Differential scanning
   calorimetric studies showed that the PCL and PGA were miscible in the
   nanofibrous structure and the mechanical characterization under dry
   conditions showed that increasing PGA content results in a tremendous
   increase in the mechanical properties. In conclusion, the random
   nanofibrous PCL/PGA scaffold used in this study constitutes a promising
   material for soft-tissue engineering. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

   latex-based PSA films with similar polymer microstructures. The effect
   of the heat treatment depended on the polymer microstructure of the

   films, or both very small (i.e., M-x < 2M(e)) and very large sol

   to treated PSA films with significantly better performance. (Note: M-e
   is the molecular weight between two adjacent entanglement points in a

   polymer molecular weight (M-w) as well as the size of the chain segments

   investigate the effects of 4 months of exposure to 4 degrees C on
   nitrifying biofilm and biomass. These molecular and microscopic methods
   were modified to minimize loss of mass and distortion of in situ
   perspectives. Environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed that
   nitrifying biofilm did not exhibit significant changes in volume with
   exposure to 4 degrees C. Confocal laser scanning microscopy in
   combination with FISH showed that the number of ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB) cells present in the biofilm was statistically consistent
   during exposure to 4 degrees C. The RNA content of AOB cells remained
   sufficient for FISH enumeration. The number of nitrite-oxidizing
   bacteria cells remained steady during exposure to 4 degrees C; however,
   the RNA content of the cells appeared to decrease with exposure to 4
   degrees C, thereby preventing their enumeration using FISH. Water

Abstract = {{Photocatalyst, lead sulfide (PbS)-intercalated layer perovskite-type
   compound (K2La2Ti3O10), was synthesized via ion-exchange reaction,
   butylamine pillaring and sulfuration processes under the assistance of
   the microwave irradiation. The structure of the photocatalysts was
   determined by means of powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscope, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectra and
   photoluminescence measurement. And the photocatalytic activity of the
   composite compound for hydrogen production was also investigated. The
   experimental results showed that the intercalation of PbS in the layered
   space of K2La2Ti3O10 greatly improved the absorption edge and the
   photocatalytic activity. Hydrogen production of the PbS-K2La2Ti3O10 was
   127.19 mmol/(g cat) after 3 h irradiation of ultraviolet light. (C)

Abstract = {{Passive elements operating with long-range surface plasmon polaritons

   theoretically and experimentally at wavelengths near 1310 nm. The
   elements investigated consist of straight waveguides, S-bends,

   performance of these devices is close to theoretical expectations,
   although uniformity issues were noted, likely because of fabrication
   imperfections. Cytop is a low-index polymer suitable for biosensing
   applications involving aqueous buffers. The elements demonstrated thus
   could form the basis of integrated biosensing devices operating with
   long-range surface plasmons. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an edge-based junction detector. In addition
   to detecting the locations of junctions, this operator specifies their
   orientations as well. In this respect, a junction is defined as a
   meeting point of two or more ridges in the gradient domain into which an
   image can be transformed through Gaussian derivative filters. To
   accelerate the detection process, two binary edge maps are produced; a
   thick-edge map is obtained by imposing a threshold on the gradient
   magnitude image, and another thin-edge map is obtained by calculating
   the local maxima. Circular masks are centered at putative junctions in
   the thick-edge map, and the so-called circumferential anchors or CA
   points are detected in the thin map. Radial lines are scanned to
   determine the presence of junctions. Comparisons are made with other
   well-known detectors. This paper proposes a new formula for measuring
   the detection accuracy. In addition, the so-called junction coordinate
   systems are introduced. Our operator has been successfully used to solve
   many problems such as wide-baseline matching, 3-D reconstruction, camera
   parameter enhancing, and indoor and obstacle localization.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of molecular weight of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and sodium
   chloride on the gelation temperature of methylcellulose (MC) was studied
   with the objective to develop a MC based formulation for sustained
   delivery of ketorolac tromethamine a model ophthalmic drug. Pure MC
   showed sol-gel transition at 61.2 degrees C. In order to reduce the
   gelation temperature of MC and to increase the drug release time, PVA
   was used. Different techniques such as test tube tilting method, UV-vis
   spectroscopy, viscometry and rheometry were used to measure gelation
   temperature of all the binary combinations of MC and PVA. It was
   observed that the gelation temperature of MC was reduced with the
   addition of 4\% PVA and also the extent of reduction of the gelation
   temperature of MC was dependent on the molecular weight of PVA. The
   strong interactions between MC and PVA molecules were established using
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. To study the in vitro drug
   release properties of the MC-PVA binary combinations, 6\% sodium
   chloride was used to reduce the gelation temperature further up to
   physiological temperature. It was observed that the drug release time
   increased from 5 to 8 h with the increase of molecular weight of PVA
   from 9 x 10(3) to 1.3 x 10(5) and this was due to the higher viscosity,
   better gel strength and greater interactions between the drug and PVA
   molecules in case of PVA (1.3 x 10(5)) compared to PVA (9 x 10(3)). In
   order to have an idea about the nature of interactions between the
   functional moieties of the drug and the polymer unit of PVA, a
   theoretical study was carried out. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{On the Compound Capacity of a Class of MIMO Channels Subject to Normed

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{The compound capacity of uncertain multiple-input multiple-output
   channels is considered, when the channel is modeled by a class described
   by a (known) nominal channel and a constrained-norm (unknown)
   uncertainty. Within this framework, two types of classes are
   investigated with additive and multiplicative uncertainties subject to a
   spectral norm constraint, using the singular value decomposition and
   related singular value inequalities as the main tools. The compound
   capacity is a maxmin mutual information, representing the capacity of
   the class, in which the minimization is done over the class of channels
   while the maximization is done over the transmit covariance. Closed-form
   solutions for the compound capacity of the classes are obtained and
   several properties related to transmit and receive eigenvectors are
   presented. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the compound
   capacity of the class is equal to the worst-case channel capacity, thus
   establishing a saddle-point property. Explicit closed-form solutions are
   given for the worst-case channel uncertainty and the capacity-achieving
   transmit covariance matrix: the best transmission strategy achieving the
   compound capacity is a multiple beamforming on the nominal (known)
   channel eigenmodes with the beam power distribution via the water
   filling at a degraded SNR. As the uncertainty increases, fewer
   eigenmodes are used until only the strongest one remains active so that
   transmit beamforming is an optimal robust transmission strategy in this
   large-uncertainty regime, for which explicit conditions are given. Using
   these results, upper and lower bounds of the compound capacity are
   constructed for other bounded uncertainties and some generic properties
   are pointed out. The results are extended to compound multiple-access
   and broadcast channels. In all considered cases, the price to pay for
   channel uncertainty is an SNR loss (or, equivalently, the nominal
   channel degradation) commensurate with the uncertainty set radius
   measured by the spectral norm and the optimal signaling strategy is the
   transmission on the degraded nominal channel.}},
