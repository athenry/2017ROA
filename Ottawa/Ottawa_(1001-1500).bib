Abstract = {{Multiagent systems are commonly used for the study and implementation of
   distributed systems and virtual online societies. Trust has long been
   recognized as a vital notion in multiagent systems, where agents can be
   self-centred, miscellaneous, and misleading. Most existing trust models
   focus on creating algorithms for trusters to model the honesty of
   trustees in order to make effective decisions about which trustees to
   interact with. If agents' interactions are based on trust, trustworthy
   trustees will have a greater impact on interactions' results. This work
   describes a fuzzy logic based trust establishment model for intelligent
   agents using indirect feedback (FTE) that goes beyond trust evaluation
   to outline actions to guide trustees (instead of trusters). The model
   uses the retention of trusters and a fuzzy logic engine to model
   trusters' behaviors. The model uses both the retention behavior of the
   partnering truster and the average retention rate of all trusters in the
   society to adjusts the utility gain the trustee provides when
   interacting with each truster. The proposed model does not depend on
   direct feedback, nor does it rely on current reputation of trustees in
   the environment. Simulation results indicate that trustees empowered
   with the proposed model can be selected more by rational trusters.}},

Abstract = {{In received signal strength (RSS) based localization problems, the
   accuracy of the position information obtained is closely associated with
   the RSS model used. Therefore, positioning success can be improved with
   a more accurate RSS model. In this study, to analyze the effect of RSS
   model in localization performance, lognormal mixture shadowing model is
   used that provides a more accurate RSS model than the classical
   lognormal shadowing model. For the corresponding mixture model, a tight
   upper bound for Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) based on Jensen's
   inequality is derived. The obtained expressions are used in CRLB
   analyses that are employed in determination of the best estimates in
   localization. The improved localization accuracy with lognormal mixture
   shadowing model is demonstrated by means of examining various numerical
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The low-power, low-rate ZigBee wireless sensor networks are vulnerable
   to the interference of collocated Wi-Fi wireless local area networks
   (WLAN). The results acquired through our extensive experimental studies
   on ZigBee-WLAN coexistence indicate that ZigBee connections may
   experience severe packet losses, caused by combined effect of
   interference and relatively long receive to transmit (RX-TX) turnaround
   time in ZigBee devices, even when the Wi-Fi and ZigBee devices are able
   to detect each other's signal and apply CSMA/CA algorithm accordingly.
   This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Preamble Padding with
   Retransmission Control (APPRC) technique for ZigBee devices to address
   this issue, meet certain packet loss rate (PLR) requirement, and improve
   packet transmission efficiency when they are suffering time varying
   interference from the collocated WLAN. The experimental performance
   evaluation results showed that the proposed APPRC technique can achieve
   significantly higher transmission efficiency while satisfying PLR
   requirements of sensing applications than packet retransmission. The
   technique described in this paper is patent pending.}},

Abstract = {{In Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks, beacon is generated periodically to provide
   adequate awareness of the surrounding vehicles and environment.
   Generating periodic beacons at the same rates for all vehicles,
   typically high rates for safety applications, consume sizeable resources
   on communication channel. This is in turn presents a challenge to a
   reliable and successful delivery. This problem gains a lot of attention
   and researchers started to come up with many fundamentally different
   solutions to adjust beacons rate for better scalability. However,
   adjusting beacon rate without a good estimate of beacon data lifetime
   may impact the accuracy of the awareness of the surrounding vehicles.
   Particularly, for the applications and protocols that require knowledge
   about network topology. Accordingly, we propose a new mathematical
   formula, Adaptive Expiry Time (AET), to determine the lifetime of beacon
   data. It is independent of beacon scheduling interval and based on
   neighbour position, speed and orientation. It has been evaluated using
   proposed Dynamic Beacon Scheduling (DBS) that adjusts beacon interval
   according vehicle speed. Furthermore, it has been compared to different
   approaches of expiry time, such as Constant Expiry Time (CET), Variable
   Expiry Time (VET).
   Results are obtained using an actual road map with realistic road
   scenarios. The results demonstrate that for better awareness of the
   surrounding vehicles, controlling beacon rate should be performed in
   sync with adaptive expiry time that determine the lifetime of beacon
   data according to vehicle mobility information.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Delay-Tolerant Sensor Networks often experience high
   unpredicted latency, dynamic wireless channel status and a lack of
   end-to-end connections. During the rare transmission opportunity in
   which connections can be found, the sensors seek the best strategies for
   improving transmission throughput and for reducing energy consumption.
   An effective way of improving transmission efficiency is to adjust the
   MAC frame size. This paper presents an efficient energy-aware MAC frame
   size adjustment scheme, which adapts the frame size to wireless channel
   conditions and possibility of collisions. Improved data throughput and
   energy consumption are the main matrices for evaluating transmission
   performance. Our simulation results show that this scheme can improve
   transmission time and significantly reduce energy consumption using
   adaptive frame size adjustment.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that the low-power ZigBee based wireless
   sensor networks (WSN) are vulnerable to the interference generated by
   nodes of Wi-Fi wireless local area networks (WLAN). Mutual interference
   can be mitigated at nodes of either technology when energy detection
   (ED) is enabled in clear channel assessment (CCA). From our experimental
   studies on ZigBee and Wi-Fi coexistence issue, it is determined that a
   significant amount of ZigBee packet losses occur due to the Wi-Fi
   interference induced corruption of the physical layer header of ZigBee
   packets, which could happen even when the ED mechanisms of the Wi-Fi and
   ZigBee devices are able to detect each other's signal and CSMA/CA
   algorithms are applied accordingly. To study this phenomenon, a series
   of experiments were carried out, followed by thorough analysis of the
   recorded data. The study led to the design of a simple but effective
   technique named Protective Dummy-byte Preamble Padding (PDBPP) that
   improves the performance of ZigBee packet transmission in terms of
   packet loss rate (PLR) and transmission efficiency. The experimental
   performance evaluation results confirmed the effectiveness of PDBPP in
   improving PLR and transmission efficiency of a ZigBee network exposed to
   interference generated by collocated WLAN. Some material in this paper
   is part of a pending patent.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a semantic and self-decision geocast routing protocol for
   disseminating safety and non-safety information over VANET (SAS-GP) is
   presented. SAS-GP initially executes an algorithm for locally

   the information in three phases: Spread, Preserve, and Assurance, which
   utilize the traffic information system and the digital map. SAS-GP
   principally employs timer-based techniques in order to avoid overhead;
   nonetheless, novel factors are enhanced to calculate the values of each
   timer in the three phases. Simulation results demonstrate effective and
   reliable dissemination in terms of delivery ratio and number of false
   warning compared to existing protocols when evaluated in high scale and
   realistic scenarios. Also, SAS-GP performs faster in notifying vehicles

Abstract = {{Network partition is an inevitable phenomena that prohibits existence of
   unified robust networks. Partition in static networks occur mainly due
   to uneven traffic. In mobile networks, a member of the network can be
   defined using n-dimensions. These dimensions account for the member
   profile and properties. A multi-dimensional profile can partition the
   network in multiple ways. Aeronautical ad hoc network (AANET) is a
   multi-dimensional network. It has a 3D topology spread across the
   airspace. The high ground speed of the airborne elements changes the
   network topology rapidly. In this paper, we present an `in-air' network
   monitoring system for the dynamic AANET environment. The monitoring
   system deals with the problem of network partitions in AANET by
   observing the network in n-dimensions. The partitions in the network are
   identified using multi-dimensional clustering. Multi-dimensional
   clustering spots the directional behavior in the mobility plane and
   congestion in the data plane of the network. The dynamic partition
   detection mitigates the effect of network disruption and accounts for
   isolated members in the network. The system uses a mixed network design
   and a quasi-stationary network of higher altitude platforms for
   achieving ubiquitous network monitoring in the AANET.}},

Abstract = {{Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to be
   beneficial as a potential treatment of several disorders such as
   depression, addiction and chronic pain. Despite promising results
   reported in research, there is variability in responsiveness to tDCS
   among subjects. However, the source of this variability is still
   unknown. Creating a mechanism of determining non-responders (vs.
   responders) is a crucial step in order to either understand the
   physiology behind tDCS or increase the effectiveness of treatment. This
   work proposes a versatile method to predict whether a subject responds
   to tDCS by analyzing the voltage measured between anode and cathode
   during a tDCS session. Two groups of subjects are determined as
   responders and non-responders by assessing the effect of tDCS on their
   motor potential evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
   Voltage measurements are modeled by a double Debye model and two
   relaxation times are extracted for each measurement. A quadratic
   classifier is trained to recognize responders and non-responders based
   on these relaxation times. Our classification results show that there is
   a significant correlation between relaxation times extracted from
   voltage and responsiveness to tDCS determined through motor evoked
   potentials. These results suggest that the relative speed of
   polarization processes occurring in electrodes and tissue may be
   associated the amount of current delivered to the brain.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to design, implement, and validate a
   methodology to determine baseline measures during the preparation phase
   (PREP) of seated weight-bearing locomotion. In order to evaluate this
   methodology this study investigated the external movement produced by
   the shoulder joint-centre of the upper limb through a seated downward
   poling motion. A solid-static anatomically correct prototype was
   designed to produce isolated dynamic movement about a human's shoulder
   joint-centre; this particular investigation replicated the average male
   weighing 80kg having fixed elbow (135 degrees) and wrist-stick (45
   degrees) angles, and dynamic shoulder start angles (-10 degrees, 0
   degrees and +10 degrees to the horizon). The prototype was tasked to
   produce PREP; a phase identified in seated locomotion produced through a
   double poling fashion. Trajectory and reaction forces created through
   PREP were evaluated using a standard Newton-Euler mathematical model in
   conjunction with a 3-dimensional motion capture system and force plate.
   Trajectory data concluded that the prototype was of reliable and valid
   mechanical design producing near identical curves for all trials
   individually as well as combined averages. Evidence also indicated that
   all trials displayed similar reaction forces, which produced torque in
   an anticlockwise direction about the shoulder. Since the prototype is
   solid and designed to mimic the male upper limb data can be used to
   describe minimal reaction forces onto the shoulder joint produced from
   PREP. Understanding external forces at baseline measures allows for
   valid assumptions to be made or dismissed concerning internal forces
   within the human body. Dynamic biomechanical analysis requires
   assumptions involving internal and external parameters when producing a
   movement. The addition of PREP to the seated propulsion cycle is unclear
   identifying the need to investigate the biomechanics produced through
   this phase; full arm extension to pick-plant. This study has developed
   an improved model of the upper limb during seated double poling.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless communication systems, finding a model to describe shadow
   fading that is easy-to-work and has a good fidelity with the observed
   phenomena is a topic that is receiving the attention of several studies.
   This is because the well-known lognormal model, discussed in the
   literature, does not describe accurately what is experienced in the real
   world. Because gamma distribution has closed form expressions a few
   authors have proposed the use of the gamma PDF in order to model
   shadowing effect, since it facilitates the mathematical analysis of the
   system being designed. Other authors have proposed the use of lognormal
   mixture model to approximate the probability distribution of the local
   mean received power. This last approach yielded good results when
   compared to the distribution of actual measurements. Motivated by these
   facts, we present in this paper a study on the approximation of
   arbitrary PDFs by Gaussian, gamma, and lognormal mixture models using
   Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the necessary
   parameters. We show the results of our implementation of the algorithms
   and discuss important insights about them.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed virtual simulation are prone to load oscillations, as well
   as load imbalances during run-time. Detecting such imbalances and
   responding accordingly using load redistribution can be of great utility
   in keeping execution performance close to the aimed optimal. A dynamic
   balancing scheme can introduce a reactive approach, but a predictive
   scheme can prevent imbalances before they occur. Several models can be
   employed for predicting load, but due to the characteristics in which
   the load is collected and presented, time series offer reasonable load
   forecasting in a short time. However, the Holt's model, well known model
   for time series representation, shows limitations on the forecasting of
   load. In order to correct this issue, a genetic algorithm approach is
   introduced to dynamically adjust the model based on the recent
   modifications on the load behaviour. The convergence of the algorithm
   can substantially influence the response time of the predictive
   balancing system, so an analysis is conducted to identify the minimum
   number of iterations for generating a reasonable adjustment.}},

Abstract = {{LTE uplink has two major scheduling algorithms, namely, Best CQI (BCQI)
   algorithm and Proportional Fairness (PF) algorithm. PF algorithm
   provides less system throughput than BCQI algorithm, however, unlike
   BCQI algorithm it considers users with poor channel condition for
   allocation process. In this paper, a new scheduling algorithm called as
   Opportunistic Dual Metric (ODM) Scheduling Algorithm is proposed for LTE
   uplink. The objective of the algorithm is to prioritize the users with
   good channel condition for resource allocation, at the same time not to
   starve the users with poor channel conditions. The proposed algorithm
   has two resource allocation matrices which are effectively used to
   allocate the resources to the users. The performance of ODM is measured
   in terms of throughput, fairness and transmit power. From the results it
   is observed that the proposed algorithm has better trade-off in terms of
   all the three performance parameters than PF scheduler and BCQI
   scheduler.}},

Abstract = {{Today's data centers host wide variety of applications which generate
   diverse mix of internal data center traffic. In a data center
   environment 90\% of the traffic flows, though they constitute only 10\%
   of the data carried around, are short flows with sizes up to a maximum
   of 1MB. The rest 10\% constitute long flows with sizes in the range of
   1MB to 1GB. Throughput matters for the long flows whereas short flows
   are latency sensitive. Research studies point out that data center
   internal traffic often exhibit predefined patterns with respect to the
   traffic flow mix. We show that we could leverage insights into the
   internal data center traffic composition to achieve better throughput
   for long flows. We propose a smart ECN adaptation scheme based on
   Software Defined Networking paradigm, which offers the ability to
   dynamically adapt the network configuration parameters based on network
   observations. Prototype based test results demonstrate up to 22\%
   improvement in long flow throughput in comparison to plain vanilla ECN
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Virtually interconnected objects with unique identifiers and computing,
   communication and sensing functionalities form the Internet of Things
   (IoT) architecture. In the cloud-centric IoT concept, IoT objects can
   provide sensing services based on a cloud-inspired business model. Smart
   mobile devices have a great potential to improve the performance of IoT
   applications by enabling access to their built-in sensor data through
   cloud servers based on the pay-as-you-go fashion. Such an architecture
   requires effective sensing service provider search techniques
   accompanied with effective recruitment algorithms for sensing service
   providers. Moreover, reliability and trustworthiness of sensing service
   provisioning is a crucial challenge. This paper provides a brief survey
   of the state of the art in sensing services over cloud-centric IoT, and
   presents recent research that addresses the challenges that are
   mentioned above. Moreover, the paper aims at defining a taxonomy of the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a stochastic scheme for modeling a
   multi-species prey-predator artificial ecosystem in order to investigate
   the influence of energy flow on ecosystem lifetime and stability.
   Inhabitants of this environment are a few species of herbivore and
   carnivore birds. In this model, collective behavior emerges in terms of
   flocking, breeding, competing, resting, hunting, escaping, seeking, and
   foraging. Ecosystem is defined as a combination of prey and predator
   species with inter-competition among species within the same level of
   the food chain, and intra-competition among those belonging to different
   levels of the food chain. Some energy variables are also introduced as
   functions of behaviors to model the energy within the ecosystem.
   Experimental results of 11,000 simulations analyzed by Cox univariate
   analysis and hazard function suggest that only five corresponding energy
   variables out of eight aforementioned behaviors influence the ecosystem
   lifetime. Also, results of survival analysis show that among pairwise
   interactions between energy factors, only two interactions affect the
   system lifetime, including interaction between flocking and seeking
   energies, and interaction between flocking and hunting energies. These
   results match the observations of real life birds, which use flocking
   behavior for flexible movements, efficient foraging, social learning,
   and reducing predation risks.}},

Abstract = {{Creating 3D animation is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process
   requiring designers to learn and utilize a complex combination of menus,
   dialog boxes, buttons and manipulation interfaces for a given
   stand-alone animation design software. On the other hand, conceptual
   simplicity and naturalness of visualizing imaginations from lingual
   descriptions motivates researchers for developing automatic animation
   generation systems using natural language interfaces. In this research,
   we introduce an interactive and adaptive animation generation system
   that utilizes data-driven techniques to extract the required
   common-sense and domain-specific knowledge from web. This system is
   capable of creating 3D animation based on user's lingual commands. It
   uses the user interactions as a relevance feedback to learn the implicit
   design knowledge, correct the extracted knowledge, and manipulate the
   dynamics of the virtual world in an active and incremental manner.
   Moreover, system is designed based on a multi-agent methodology which
   provides it with distributed processing capabilities and cross-platform
   characteristics. In this paper, we will focus on information retrieval
   agent which is responsible for extracting numeric data utilized in
   object attributes, spatiotemporal relations, and environment dynamics
   using web mining techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Simple, unobtrusive, and reliable estimation of cardiovascular
   parameters is a challenge. We present a novel, simple, and noninvasive
   method called Ratio2 that provides expected ranges for systolic and
   diastolic blood pressure values (SBP, DBP) estimated by any algorithm,
   and an evaluation of vessel compliance. Ratio2 was developed in the
   frame of the oscillometric blood pressure estimation and it exploits the
   equality between the arterial blood pressure and the cuff pressure at
   the mean arterial pressure (MAP). This method is based on the
   observation that the brachial arterial blood pressure pulses, with MAP
   used as baseline, are characterized by a peak to trough ratio close to
   2. This ratio is employed to characterize expected ranges for estimates
   of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Any SBP or DBP measurement
   which is not contained in these intervals is deemed untrustworthy, and
   it is marked as such. Ratio2 also provides parameters that are used in a
   mathematical model of arterial blood pressure (BP) to evaluate vessel
   stiffness. We tested the performance of the Ratio2 method on 150
   oscillometric recordings and their corresponding Omron BP estimates
   obtained from 10 healthy subjects. Results are encouraging, whereby, (a)
   out-of-range values obtained with the maximum amplitude algorithm (MAA)
   and the maximum/minimum slope algorithm (MMSA) methods were successfully
   detected, and (b) linear correlation between age and vessel compliance
   is -85\% (p<0.005). Therefore, we conclude that the proposed work shows
   promise towards providing noninvasive BP monitors with an inbuilt
   mechanism for assessing the fidelity of their BP estimates along with an
   indicator of vessel compliance.}},

Abstract = {{Human Activity Recognition (HAR) allows healthcare specialists to obtain
   clinically useful information about a person's mobility. When
   characterizing immobile states with a smartphone, HAR typically relies
   on phone orientation to differentiate between sit, stand, and lie. While
   phone orientation is effective for identifying when a person is lying
   down, sitting and standing can be misclassified since pelvis orientation
   can be similar. Therefore, training a classifier from this data is
   difficult. In this paper, a hierarchical classifier that includes the
   transition phases into and out of a sitting state is proposed to improve
   sit-stand classification. For evaluation, young (age 26 +/- 8.9 yrs) and
   senior (age 73 +/- 5.9yrs) participants wore a Blackberry Z10 smartphone
   on their right front waist and performed a continuous series of 16
   activities of daily living. Z10 accelerometer and gyroscope data were
   processed with a custom HAR classifier that used previous state
   awareness and transition identification to classify immobile states.
   Immobile state classification results were compared with (WT) and
   without (WOT) transition identification and previous state awareness.
   The WT classifier had significantly greater sit sensitivity and Fscore
   (p<0.05) than WOT. Stand specificity and F-score for WT were
   significantly greater than WOT for seniors. WT sit sensitivity was
   greater than WOT for the young population, though not significantly. All
   outcomes improved for the young population. These results indicated that
   examining the transition period before an immobile state can improve
   immobile state recognition. Sit-stand classification on a continuous
   daily activity data set was comparable to the current literature and was
   achieved without the use of computationally intensive feature spaces or
   classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Humans sense of touch consists in a complexity of sensors and nervous
   system. The information inferred by this system enables the daily

   instincts and data gathered by previous movements. The development of
   artificial systems tries to mimic such systems with engineered sensors
   and strategies for movement selection. This paper presents a data-driven
   analysis to the problem of sensor selection in the contour following for
   shape discrimination task. This task consists of a 4-DOF robotic finger
   exploring a set of 7 synthetic shapes. The data collected from the
   motors, inertial measurement unit, and magnetometer was analyzed
   applying principal component analysis and a multilayer perceptron neural
   network. Results show the variation of classification rate depending on
   the fingertip material and sensor considered. It is worth to observe
   that the magnetometer was the most robust in both cases.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous service adaptation in cloud environments requires both
   location-awareness and the acquisition and utilization of contextual
   information. Statically configured service adaptation frameworks lack
   the ability to adapt to changing network conditions and geographical
   locations. This paper presents a framework that continuously derives
   updated configuration policies with respect to service selection and
   handover to third party cloud service providers. Location tracking and
   prediction empower the system to provide ongoing robust services for
   cloud service subscribers. To achieve this goal, the proposed work
   relies on a policy-based real-time simulator to evaluate possible new
   service provider handover configurations before actually applying them
   to the real network. Preliminary performance evaluation results
   demonstrate the significant enhancement of the outcome of the proposed
   framework in terms of continuous services for subscribers and load

Abstract = {{Cloud computing and Vehicular Communications are profoundly emerging
   fields towards realization of smart cities. While cloud computing is
   stage of development, vehicular cloud computing combines the benefits of
   Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) and vehicular communications. Recent
   studies expect that vehicular cloud computing will be the gateway to the
   future of transportation systems. However, the development process still
   reveal on several issues and challenges that need to be carefully
   addressed in such environment. Privacy, service cost and provisioning
   delay are identified as the most crucial challenges to be addressed.
   State of the art includes several proposals to address these issues. In
   this position paper, we will gather and present a comprehensive study of
   vehicular cloud computing architecture, applications, and approaches.
   More importantly, we will discuss the current possible services
   provisioning solutions with their drawbacks, then, we will provide a
   thorough discussion on the benefits of using the concept of Quality of
   Experience (QoE) in such environment.}},

Abstract = {{Demand response programs are implemented by the utilities to manage the
   energy consumption at consumer side. Demands are managed in response to
   supply conditions as opposed to the traditional grid. The existing
   programs focus mainly on achieving system objectives such as minimizing
   peaks and reducing the cost of power generation. Consequently, users'
   electrical bills will be reduced but the question of fairness has barely
   been discussed in the literature. In this paper, the issue of fairness
   within demand response programs is addressed. In this context, a fair
   pricing model based on the contribution of each user toward attaining
   the aggregated system cost is proposed. In addition, the proposed system
   considers a more realistic scenario that consists of multiple energy
   sources within a microgrid as opposed to existing ones that use only one
   shared energy source. We first employ the concept of Shapley value in
   the pricing model to evaluate the fairness of existing works. Then, we
   use an approximation of this value to drive our proposed demand response
   program. Finally, we evaluate the use of the approximate Shapley within
   our proposed demand response algorithm and compare it to existing works.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach is proposed in this paper for estimating the resilient
   modulus (M-R) of pavement subgrade soils taking account of the influence
   of the soil suction (psi). This approach includes two steps: step (i)
   estimating the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) using one-point
   method, and step (ii) predicting the M-R - psi relationships using a
   simple model and the estimated SWCC from step (i). Estimations of the
   SWCC and the M-R for two different subgrade soils using (i) the proposed
   approach, and (ii) the widely used mechanistic-empirical pavement design
   guide (MEPDG) approach are compared with the experimental measurements.
   The comparison results suggest that the proposed new approach provides
   reliable estimations of both the SWCC and the M-R - psi relationships.
   The proposed approach in this paper is relatively simple and is
   promising for use in the design of pavements.}},

Abstract = {{Most electric power companies employs power meter reader to collect data
   on the customer's energy consumption. Usually, this task is carried out
   manually, which can lead to high cost and errors, causing financial
   losses. Some approaches trying to minimize these problems, such as:
   discover the minimal route or use a car to perform the readings.
   However, errors associated the manual readings can still occurs and cars
   suffer with congestions and a high costs of the fuel consumption and to
   maintaining. In this work, we go further and propose an architecture to
   Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) system using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
   (UAV). The main challenge of the solution is design a robust and
   lightweight protocol that is able to deal with the wireless
   communication collisions. Therefore, the main contribution of this work
   is the design a new protocol to ensure wireless communication from UAV
   to the power meters. We validated and evaluated the architecture in an
   urban scenario and the results show a decrease of time and distance
   respectively when compared to car approach. Our collision mechanism
   reaches an improved of 98\% in reducing the messages collisions.}},

Abstract = {{In multi-hop dissemination, timer-based and probabilistic methods are
   high performing methods in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), owing to
   their simplicity, low overhead and high efficiency. However, such
   approaches neglect the fact that vehicle transmission ranges are
   typically heterogeneous, which could be due to dynamic adjustment of the
   transmission power value. In our previous work, we introduced a new
   timer-based method that considers heterogeneous transmission power: area
   defer transmission (ADT). ADT proves its efficiency over distance-based
   versions by its high delivery ratio, high propagation speed and
   reachability. We have extended this work to introduce a probabilistic
   approach to reduce unnecessary redundancy in heterogeneous environments.
   We have also examined the integration of the timer area-based and
   probabilistic area-based methods. Moreover, we have thoroughly
   investigated the influence of the parameter T-max in the defer time
   formula on both approaches. We evaluated the performance of the proposed
   methods using an actual road map with complex road scenarios and real
   movement traces.
   The simulation results show that the probabilistic area-based approach
   is very fast at disseminating data. It also achieves a reduction in
   redundancy, but at the expense of reaching more vehicles and long
   distances. Redundancy and retransmission are reduced more with
   controlling defer time parameters in timer area-based approaches,
   without compromising reachability in the network and the same delivery
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Active learning is a common solution for reducing labeling costs and
   maximizing the impact of human labeling efforts in binary and
   multi-class classification settings. However, when we are faced with
   extreme levels of class imbalance, a situation in which it is not safe
   to assume that we have a representative sample of the minority class, it
   has been shown effective to replace the binary classifiers with a
   one-class classifiers. In such a setting, traditional active learning
   methods, and many previously proposed in the literature for one-class
   classifiers, prove to be inappropriate, as they rely on assumptions
   about the data that no longer stand.
   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to active learning designed
   for one-class classification. The proposed method does not rely on many
   of the inappropriate assumptions of its predecessors and leads to more
   robust classification performance. The gist of this method consists of
   labeling, in priority, the instances considered to fit the learned class

Abstract = {{This work examines the application of machine learning to an important
   area of medicine which aims to diagnose paediatric patients with
   beta-thalassemia minor, iron deficiency anemia or the co-occurrence of
   these ailments. Iron deficiency anemia is a major cause of microcytic
   anemia and is considered an important task in global health. Whilst
   existing methods, based on linear equations, are proficient at
   distinguishing between the two classes of anemia, they fail to identify
   the co-occurrence of this issues. Machine learning algorithms, however,
   can induce non-linear decision boundaries that enable accurate
   classification within complex domains. Through a multi-label
   classification technique, known as problem transformations, we convert
   the learning task to one that is appropriate for machine learning and
   examine the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms on this domain.
   Our results show that machine learning classifiers produce good overall
   accuracy and are able to identify instances of the co-occurrence class
   unlike the existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Content delivery through cloud networks has gained popularity due to its
   effectiveness and reliability. Much progress has been made to allow for
   the easy integration of heterogeneous systems to compose services on the
   fly. Despite all efforts, the task of fast service composition has made
   the assumption of the presence of static searchable and updatable
   central repositories within cloud data centers. With today's dynamic and
   mobile environments, service providers' movements are unpredictable,
   thus a rejuvenated service composition mechanism for cloud environments
   is needed. This paper presents a cloudlet-supported service composition
   solution in cloud networks that can find a suitable mechanism to
   discover mobile media processing functions and seamlessly integrate them
   into media delivery sessions. Furthermore, the established sessions are
   monitored by a novel client-side QoS measurement collection mechanism
   and adapted dynamically to network, user, and service providers'
   changing conditions. Simulation results showcase the effectiveness of
   the presented solution in terms of composed service stability and QoS
   measurement collection accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its challenges, cloud gaming is growing its share in the gaming
   market by attracting more players. This has led to an increasing number
   of researches trying to overcome cloud gaming's challenges, including
   the required high bandwidth and low latency, to make cloud gaming more
   practical and profitable. To perform this research, researchers need a
   testbed to evaluate their ideas and find the best solutions. Currently,
   Gaming Anywhere is the only open source platform and testbed to serve
   this goal. However, it cannot be used to stream all video games, since
   it depends on hooking APIs which might be incompatible with some video
   games. In this paper, we introduce a new open source cloud gaming
   testbed. In this testbed, the screen capturing module is fundamentally a
   DirectShow filter and, hence, can be tuned for any DirectShow compatible
   video game. The testbed also facilitates the measurement of delay and
   quality as the video is processed through its modules.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a novel algorithm destined to estimate systolic
   and diastolic blood pressures from lumen area oscillations of vessel
   underneath the cuff by using automated oscillometric method. This
   algorithm is composed of three procedures which process only the
   diastolic region information of oscillometric waveform (OMW) from 80
   mmHg to 20 mmHg, a domain which is considered a low cuff pressure
   region. The standard oscillometric methods need inflating the cuff to
   Supra Systolic Pressure (SSBP) and, as such, require a deflation time
   proportionally longer than our method. Because of the relative low
   inflation pressure, our method represents a viable option for patients
   who need to be monitored continuously, since, in such circumstances, the
   cuff is not allowed to be inflated to higher pressures for longer
   periods of time.
   We developed a unified algorithm composed of three integrated procedures
   which are all based on the arterial lumen area oscillation model at
   diastolic region to estimate blood pressure. The first procedure
   estimates the compliance c of the blood vessel. The second procedure
   uses c and estimates the maximum lumen area (Am), lumen area at mean
   arterial pressure - MAP (A0) and the systolic arterial pressure (SBP)
   from the peaks of the OMW pulses. The third procedure uses c, Am, A0
   found above to estimate diastolic arterial pressure (DBP) from the
   troughs of the OMW pulses. The OMW is obtained by filtering the cuff
   deflation curve (CDC) with a 2nd order Butterworth band pass filter and
   which has cut-off frequencies of 0.5 to 20 Hz. The proposed method
   avoids using empirical systolic and diastolic ratios for estimation of
   blood pressure (like the popular maximum amplitude algorithm - MAA), but
   rather employs the least square method to optimize the lumen area
   oscillations model for targeted parameters.
   We applied this method on 150 oscillometric traces recorded from 10
   healthy subjects composed of males and females from 25 to 63 years old,
   and validated the results with values measured by an Omron device that
   served as reference for each recording. Results are encouraging as mean
   absolute errors of estimated values from the Omron references over 150
   recordings are 5.13 mmHg in terms of SBP and 3.18 mmHg for DBP with the
   standard deviation of errors of 3.60 mmHg and 2.58 mmHg respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper propose a distributed game where energy is traded between
   multiple smart grid users. More precisely, a number of geographically
   distributed consumers may have a surplus of energy for sale while others
   need to buy energy to meet their local demands. Sellers make profit by
   selling their surplus of energy stored in storage devices such as
   electric vehicle batteries. Buyers can save on their energy bill by
   buying energy from their neighbors, instead of the grid, at a lower
   price, which also decreases the load on the grid. Under this proposed
   approach, buyers play a game by deciding how much energy they will buy
   from each seller in order to minimize their energy bill while taking
   into consideration energy transmission cost. The proposed approach is
   evaluated through a set of simulations, where the attained energy bill
   of buyers as well as the convergence rate are shown for different
   scenarios. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed game, we compare
   the results to those of a centralized optimization model.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) denotes a shared pool of computing
   resources in a set of wirelessly connected vehicles, which are available
   for on-demand and rapid access based on the pay-as-you-go fashion. VCC
   consolidates the benefits of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) and vehicular
   communications. Prior to the VCC concept being widely adopted, several
   research issues and challenges need to be carefully addressed in such
   environment. Privacy, service cost and provisioning delay are identified
   as the most crucial challenges to be addressed. State of the art
   includes several proposals to address these issues however a combined
   solution that aims to address these requirements holistically does not
   exist. This paper refines our recently presented frameworks in
   {[}1]{[}2], and extends it by building a generalized multi-objective
   framework, namely Auction-driven QoE Provisioning (AQoEP). A Trusted
   Third Party (TTP) approach has been adopted to address such challenges.
   Simulations results are extensively studied to proof the concept of the
   proposed framework. Through simulations, we proof that AQoEP in a
   vehicular cloud better fulfils the vehicular service requirements than
   any other proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The secrecy capacity of compound wiretap channels is studied. Using the
   known lower bounds for non-degraded discrete memoryless channels and
   establishing the converse, the secrecy capacity is established under the
   less capable and noisier conditions. The compound capacity is shown to
   be equal to the worst-case channel capacity when there exists a
   saddle-point in the mutual information difference.
   Earlier results on the secrecy capacity of compound Gaussian MIMO
   wiretap channels under the spectral norm constraint are extended to the
   case of rank-deficient eavesdroppers (which may model a massive MIMO
   base station) without the degradedness assumption. Its compound secrecy
   capacity is established in a closed form and the optimal signaling is
   identified: the compound capacity equals the worst-case channel capacity
   thus establishing the saddle-point property; the optimal signaling is
   Gaussian and on the eigenvectors of the legitimate channel and the
   worst-case eavesdropper is omnidirectional (i.e. isotropic over the
   sub-space spanned by the active eigenmodes of the legitimate channel).
   The case of additive uncertainty in the legitimate channel, in addition
   to the unknown eavesdropper channel, is also studied and its compound
   secrecy capacity is established.}},

Abstract = {{The new and improved smart grid allows energy to flow back from
   customers into the grid. Customers can sell their excess of energy to
   the grid or to other customers. While the former has been extensively
   researched in the literature and is known as Vehicule-to-Grid (V2G)
   {[}1], the latter is broadly referred to as energy trading. In this
   paper, we propose a game theoretic approach that allows customers in the
   grid to buy energy from other customers offering their surplus at a
   discounted price. The proposed approach is based on a modified regret
   matching procedure {[}2] and enables users to trade energy. Sellers make
   profit by selling their surplus of energy gathered from renewable
   resources and stored in energy storage devices such as batteries. Buyers
   can save on their energy bill by buying cheap energy from their
   neighbors instead of the grid, therefore decreasing the load on the grid
   and making use of clean renewable energy. The proposed approach is
   evaluated through a set of simulations, which show that the proposed
   approach encourages the use of clean energy and provides energy bill
   savings to buyers.}},

Abstract = {{Decision support systems (DSSs) are playing an increasingly important
   role in the characterization of suspicious activities in an area of
   interest given their proved ability to turn vast amounts of raw data
   into actionable intelligence that is easy to understand by human
   operators. Although risk management is an integral component of the
   decision making process that directly contributes towards improved
   situational awareness and response assessment, an active end-to-end
   consideration of the underlying risk sources in the environment is still
   an important feature that most DSSs currently lack. Additionally,
   deciding on an appropriate course of action (COA) to mitigate emerging
   threats in the system is a challenging task even for domain experts
   given that (1) the number of potential responses to analyze could be
   overwhelmingly large; (2) seldom are those responses judged in terms of
   the risks associated with their enactment and (3) assessing the
   effectiveness of the potential responses in the real world is usually
   time-consuming and simulation-driven.
   In this paper, we formalize the adaptation of a recently proposed Risk
   Management Framework to account for behavioral intents associated with
   the objects of interest (OOIs) in the monitoring environment and their
   link to automatic response generation. The intent of the objects is
   inferred from high-level cognitive and behavioral knowledge in the form
   of anomalies. When an OOI has crossed a permissible risk threshold, we
   demonstrate how responses to that situation can be automatically
   elicited by the COA recommendation module of a risk-aware DSS.
   Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is used to judge a diverse set of
   plausible responses according to different operational objectives. We
   illustrate the application of the proposed framework in the context of
   maritime surveillance operations by triggering a corporate search for a
   missing vessel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
   that risk features are synthesized from anomalies and integrated into a
   more comprehensive RMF engine for knowledge (response) elicitation.}},

   The Google Congestion Control (GCC) algorithm has been proposed as

   due to using a fixed incoming rate decrease factor, known as alpha
   (alpha). In this paper, we propose a dynamic alpha model to reduce the
   available receiving bandwidth estimate during overuse as indicated by
   the over-use detector. Experiments using our specific testbed show that
   our proposed model achieves a 33\% higher incoming rate and a 16\% lower

   structure of various binary descriptors in order to boost feature
   matching by conserving descriptor properties (e.g., rotational and scale
   invariance, robustness to illumination variations and real-time
   performance). Unlike state-of-the-art methods, our novel naive
   classifiers only require a database with a small memory footprint
   because we store efficiently encoded features. In addition, we also
   improve the indexing scheme to speed up the matching process. Because
   our database is built from powerful descriptors, only a few images need
   to be `learned' and constructing a database for a new object is highly

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a high efficient local spatiotemporal descriptor,
   called gradient boundary histograms (GBH). The proposed GBH descriptor
   is built on simple spatio-temporal gradients, which are fast to compute.
   We demonstrate that it can better represent local structure and motion
   than other gradient-based descriptors, and significantly outperforms
   them on large realistic datasets. A comprehensive evaluation shows that
   the recognition accuracy is preserved while the spatial resolution is
   greatly reduced, which yields both high efficiency and low memory usage.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a balance control scheme is introduced for hopping robots
   using neural networks. The control strategy uses a trade-off strategy to
   achieve both hip and body angle control simultaneously with a single
   controller, which yields reduced complexity. Hence, the proposed
   controller allows the hopping robot to track a pre-defined state
   trajectory in flight-phase despite its modeling uncertainties. The
   overall dynamics complexity is decreased so that a conventional PID
   controller can be used for leg extension's length tracking. Unlike other
   control techniques, no velocity sensor, gyroscope, camera, or body
   location estimation is needed. Furthermore, no offline learning or a
   priori system dynamics knowledge is required. Results for different
   situations highlight the performance of the proposed control approach in
   compensating for nonlinearities and disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Shear modulus is one of the key properties required for interpretation
   of the dynamic behavior of soils. In engineering practice applications,
   soils are typically found to be in a state of unsaturated condition.
   Since experimental determination of the shear modulus of unsaturated
   soils is difficult, several investigators proposed empirical models or
   relationships to predict or estimate the initial shear modulus, G(max)
   of unsaturated soils. In this paper, various models and relationships
   available in the literature for predicting the G(max) of unsaturated
   soils are classified into four groups. Comparisons are provided between
   the measured and predicted G(max) values for two unsaturated
   fine-grained soils using one representative model from each of the four
   groups. The strengths and limitations of the models used are discussed
   based on the results summarized in the present study. In addition, the
   strong relationship between the G(max) and the soil-water characteristic
   curve (SWCC) for unsaturated soils is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Today's cloud datacenters host wide variety of applications which
   generate diverse mix of internal datacenter traffic. In a cloud
   datacenter environment 90\% of the traffic flows, though they constitute
   only 10\% of the data carried around, are short flows with sizes up to a
   maximum of 1MB. The rest 10\% constitute long flows with sizes in the
   range of 1MB to 1GB. Throughput matters for long flows whereas short
   flows are latency sensitive. Datacenter Transmission Control Protocol
   (DCTCP) is a transport layer protocol that is widely deployed at
   datacenters nowadays. DCTCP aims to reduce the latency for short flows
   by keeping the queue occupancy at the datacenter switches under control
   while ensuring throughput requirements are met for long flows. But,
   DCTCP congestion control algorithm treats short flows and long flows
   equally. We demonstrate that treating them differently, by reducing the
   congestion window for short flows at a lower rate compared to long flows
   at the onset of congestion, we could improve the flow completion time
   for short flows by up to 25\%, thereby reducing their latency up to
   25\%. We have implemented a modified version of DCTCP for cloud
   datacenters, based on the DCTCP patch available for Linux, which
   achieves better flow completion time for short flows while ensuring that
   throughput of long flows are not affected.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of devising a computationally
   tractable procedure for representing the natural language understanding
   (NLU). It approaches this goal, by using distributional models of
   meaning through a method from graph-based digital signal processing
   (DSP) which only recently grabbed the attention of researchers from the
   field of natural language processing (NLP) related to big data analysis.
   The novelty of our approach lies in the combination of three domains:
   advances in deep learning algorithms for word representation, dependency
   parsing for modeling inter-word relations and convolution using
   orthogonal Hadamard codes for composing the two previous areas,
   generating a unique representation for the sentence. Two types of
   problems are resolved in a new unified way: sentence similarity given by
   the cos function of the corresponding vectors and question-answering
   where the query is matched to possible answers. This technique resembles
   the spread spectrum methods from telecommunication theory where multiple
   users share a common channel, and are able to communicate without
   interference. In the content of this paper the case of individual words
   play the role of users sharing the same sentence. Examples of the method
   application to a standard set of sentences, used for benchmarking the
   accuracy and the execution time is also given.}},

Abstract = {{Privacy-preserving record linkage is a valuable tool in various domains

   available in parts at more than one health organization. Given its
   sensitive nature, and the laws that protect patient privacy, these
   organizations cannot simply identify their patients to one another in
   order to complete their medical records. Yet, complete medical records
   lead to more informed decisions by doctors, therefore resulting in a
   higher quality of care. There are many methods in the literature that
   attempt to represent the identity of an individual in a
   privacy-preserving way to allow privacy-preserving record linkage.
   However, most of these techniques are subject to frequency attacks. We
   present a novel scheme for representing the name of an individual in a
   privacy-preserving manner that guards against frequency attacks, allows
   for small typing mistakes, and is efficient when linking large datasets.}},

   view is needed to capture early requirements about who are the
   stakeholders, what goals and quality criteria they have and how the
   various enabling technologies can be combined to meet these goals. A
   particular case is made for the use of the Goal-oriented Requirement
   Language (GRL), which covers the above and enables trade-off analysis as
   well as the introduction of indicators for measurement activities. GRL
   also has the potential of being used to guide some run-time decisions in
   ODR systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper suggests a novel high capacity audio watermarking technique
   by using the high frequency band of the wavelet decomposition, for which
   the human auditory system is not very sensitive to variation. The high
   frequency band, DD, is divided into four parts and, then, in each step,
   a single sample from each part is selected. The sum of the selected
   wavelet samples is used for embedding the secret bits. The robustness
   and imperceptibility of the proposed scheme are adjustable by varying a
   tuning parameter. The outstanding feature of the suggested technique is
   the capacity to limit the changes of the wavelet samples, which
   guarantees the transparency of the embedding method. The experimental
   results show that the technique has very high capacity (about 2756 bps),
   without significant perceptual distortion (ODG in {[}-1, 0] and SNR
   about 42.1 dB) and provides robustness against MPEG compression (MP3).}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the issue of in-band interference encountered where

   the WLAN interference namely, the 5.2 and 5.8 GHz frequencies. The
   electrical model of the BPF has been synthesized using Hourglass
   function. The notch was integrated by cascading the BPF with a rejection
   cell to cancel the undesired band (5-6 GHz). The final circuit has been
   implemented in 0.18-mu m CMOS technology and the simulation exhibits
   good performance, i.e., enhanced selectivity, large bandwidth covering
   the entire frequency range (3.1-10.6 GHz), avoidance of WLAN
   interference since the 5-6 GHz band is suppressed, good matching and
   flatness in the desired band, as well as small variation group delay.
   Besides of these interesting features, the final circuit of proposed
   notched UWB BPF is found optimized which can lead to compact size chip.}},

Abstract = {{Distance is a key measure when implementing timer-based dissemination
   protocols in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANets). In which the
   transmission is deferred proportional to distance, aiming to order
   vehicles transmission, such that the farthest vehicle gets the highest
   opportunity to relay the message. This will ensure long hops along the
   road to speed up the dissemination and cover more nodes. However, in
   case of heterogeneous transmission ranges, the farthest distance will
   not ensure a proper choice of relay nodes to disseminate the message.
   Vehicles, whose transmission area enclosed by the sender or have small
   non-covered transmission area, might be chosen as relay vehicle. This
   may inhabit other nodes from relaying the message and end the
   dissemination process early and before it reach the required region. In
   this paper, we propose the Area Defer Transmission (ADT) dissemination
   algorithm. ADT enables each vehicle to independently decide to transmit
   or suppress transmission considering heterogeneous transmission ranges
   and the amount of area that would be covered by potential new
   transmission.
   The performance of the proposed ADT algorithm has been evaluated using
   an actual road map with complex road scenarios and real movement traces.
   It has also been thoroughly investigated and compared with other
   distance-based algorithms. The results demonstrate that ADT achieves
   high delivery ratio, high propagation speed and less relay ratio with
   fewer hops that reach long distances.}},

   the high performing methods in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), due
   to simplicity, low overhead, and high efficiency. However, such
   approaches neglect the fact that vehicles transmission ranges are
   typically heterogeneous due to different transmission power values. In
   our previous work, we introduce new area-based methods for heterogeneous
   transmission ranges in vehicle networks, i.e. Area Defer Transmission
   (ADT), Area-based Probabilistic Transmission (APT), and an integration
   of area-based timer and probabilistic transmission methods. ADT proves
   it efficiency over distance-based methods, and the probabilistic version
   due to high delivery ratio, high propagation speed and reachability. The
   work is extended and we introduce an enhancement of ADT defer time
   formula. The enhancement gives vehicles with larger potential coverage
   area high opportunity to relay the message than the one with small
   potential coverage area or small communication range. The performance of
   the proposed enhancement is compared to ADT and evaluated using an
   actual road map with complex road scenarios and real movement traces.
   The simulation results show that the dissemination speed improves
   dramatically, with better saved-retransmission and delivery ratio.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate traffic model is a key factor in the research and design of
   5G heterogeneous networks. The literature on mixture of non-uniform and
   uniform traffic models is very limited. The mixed traffic model includes
   the non-uniform UEs and uniform UEs at the same time, which represents a
   more realistic traffic distribution. In this paper, we give a mixed
   traffic model that is based on the available K-tier heterogeneous
   network, in which each tier has its own transmit power, density, signal
   to interference ratio (SIR) coverage threshold and path loss exponent.
   This model also contains an adjustable parameter p which represents the
   correlation between BS and UE on non-uniform situation and an adjustable
   parameter r which represents the density ratio of non-uniform UEs to
   uniform UEs. This traffic model is more realistic because some UEs are
   spread uniformly and some UEs are clustered around the cell center
   non-uniformly, especially for the small cells. The expression of the
   performance metric of coverage probability is derived. The results
   obtained by analytical expressions and simulations align closely.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of a smart transportation infrastructure is of
   paramount importance to establish a safe and secure transportation
   system. An imperative component of this system is a reliable, secure and
   delay-sensitive wireless communication protocol that allows the exchange
   of data between vehicles and the neighbouring infrastructure in an
   efficient way. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Service Time
   Control (ASTC) scheme in Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) network. ASTC
   aims to adaptively compensate the additional delay introduced in the
   Road Side Unit (RSU) queue, by changing the size of the buffer at the
   vehicle MAC layer. In our proposed scheme, we rely on an enhanced IEEE
   802.11p-based protocol, we consider an unsaturated traffic condition and
   we take into account the security-related processing overhead. ASTC
   demonstrates higher average throughput and lower average end-to-end
   delay compared to the conventional IEEE 802.11p protocol.}},

   operation by exhibiting good performance, i.e., enhanced selectivity,
   large bandwidth covering the entire frequency range (3.1-10.6GHz), good
   matching and flatness in the desired band, as well as small variation
   group delay. Furthermore, applied to the 0.18-mu m CMOS technology, the

Abstract = {{The use of a haptic-based handwritten signatures has an intrinsic
   biometric nature and an important potential in user
   identification/authentication because it incorporates tactile
   information. However, in order to exploit this potential for
   constructing decision systems, it is necessary to gain an appropriate
   understanding of the internal structure of the data, which in relational
   representations tend to be very highly dimensional. Most machine
   learning techniques i) are affected by the curse of dimensionality, ii)
   use algorithms involving distances (usually Euclidean), but in high
   dimensional spaces they suffer from the concentration phenomenon.
   This paper explores the behavior of different strategies for distance
   deconcentration of haptic data when used for nonlinear unsupervised
   mappings into low dimensional spaces. An aposteriori use of class
   information shows that deconcentration transformations improve class
   cohesion and separation, which can improve the performance of machine
   learning algorithms.}},

   I-frames. The singular values of the I-frames are modified with the
   singular values of the visual watermark. Meanwhile, the watermark
   embedding strength is adjusted adaptively using the noise visibility
   function (NVF) with local properties. The approach is efficient and
   appropriate for real-time applications. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed approach has good performance in
   preserving high quality of the video, and the watermark can be extracted

Abstract = {{In a chroma keying system, the foreground objects are recorded in front
   of background with solid color, which is used as side information to
   efficiently and accurately separate the foreground from the background.
   Although the technique of chroma keying has been widely used for
   decades, there is little work on its application to stereoscopic
   images/videos in either industry or academia fields. We propose a new
   chroma key matting method to generate high quality matting results.
   Specifically, the colors of foreground objects to be chroma keyed are
   histogram analysed in CIECAM02 color space, which can provide better
   hue/saturation consistency compared to previous human visual system
   (HVS) based color spaces such as HSV, CIELab and IPT. The color of
   background region, which is occluded by foreground objects, is estimated
   by spatial affinity. With the estimated foreground/background color for
   each pixel, the foreground objects can be accurately extracted along
   with its transparency map alpha. By doing this, we can generate depth
   map with accurate and sharp boundary, which is essential for post 3D
   processing such as depth image based rendering (DIBR).}},

   identify the first pixel on the hand contour within this space. Starting
   from this pixel, a directional search algorithm allows for the
   identification of the entire hand contour and the k-curvature algorithm
   is then employed to locate the fingertips over it. Dynamic time warping
   (DTW) guides the selection of gesture candidates and also recognizes
   gestures by comparing an observed gesture with a series of pre-recorded
   reference gestures. The comparison of results with state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{A compact planar monopole antenna with dimensions of 34mm x 25mm x
   1.6mm, which could provide an ultra-wide impedance bandwidth with the
   range from 2.40 GHz to 11.88 GHz is presented in this paper. The antenna
   consists of a small-sized ground plane, a hexagonal radiating patch, and
   two L-shaped parasitic strips close to the microstrip-line. Resorting to
   the two parasitic strips, two additional resonant modes are created
   successfully to aid the impedance match improvement in the lower
   frequency range, which accomplishes the significant bandwidth
   enhancement accordingly. The simulated results demonstrated that, the
   proposed antenna exhibits relatively stable radiation characteristics
   within such wideband frequency range. Benefitting from its compact
   configuration and wideband characteristic, the proposed antenna is quite
   suitable for WLAN, WiMAX and UWB wireless communication application.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) bridges between
   consumers, utilities, and market. Its operation relies on large scale
   communication networks. At the lowest level, information are acquired by
   smart meters and sensors. At the highest level, information are stored
   and processed by smart grid control centers for various purposes. The
   AMI conveys a big amount of sensitive information. Prevention of
   unauthorized access to these information is a major concern for smart
   grid operators. Encryption is the primary security measure for
   preventing unauthorized access. It incurs various overheads and
   deployment costs. In recent times, the security as a service (SECaaS)
   model has introduced a number cloud-based security solutions such as
   encryption as a service (EaaS). It promises the speed and
   cost-effectiveness of cloud computing. In this paper, we propose a
   framework named encryption service for smart grid AMI (ES4AM). The ES4AM
   framework focuses on lightweight encryption of in-flight AMI data. We
   also study the feasibility of the framework using relevant simulation
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are expected to be widely utilized in
   the near future if issues related to the availability of charging
   infrastructure are resolved and if PEVs are efficiently integrated with
   the smart grid. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system is an emerging
   technology that enables the communication and control between PEVs and
   the smart grid. This promising concept is designed to provide the
   vehicles with information about where and when to charge their
   batteries, and allows the smart grid to acquire power from a PEV. An
   essential element to the success of V2G systems is reliable and secure
   communication system. Wireless communications in highly mobile V2G
   environment introduce serious challenges, such as reliability and
   real-time communication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
   analysis of the impact of speed on the end-to-end delay and throughput
   in V2G communication scenarios. We focus on situations where
   authentication is performed when essential information such as payment
   data is exchanged between PEVs and its charging infrastructure.
   Furthermore, we present realistic delay analysis of the proposed
   communication infrastructure. Our simulation results show the impact of
   traffic density and speed on both the end-to-end delay and the
   throughput. We draw recommendations based on our test scenarios and
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has been receiving a growing attention due to its
   features on the provisioning of computing resources for distributed
   processing. A lot of interest lays on the enabled benefits of flexible
   and elastic management of cheap and reliable computing sources though
   virtualization. The cheap characteristic brought from virtualization
   helps data centers to host more than one operating system on any
   machine. However, the time-sharing nature of virtualization and the
   existence of more software layers lead to larger delays in execution and
   network communications. The bundling of network messages directed to the
   same destination can be used as means to reduce the number of network
   transfers. In this paper, the effect of different message bundling
   aspects closely related to cloud applications is investigated. Analysis
   shows that message bundling effectively enhances communication
   efficiency; however, it is directly influenced by parameters such as
   number of messages, length of the bundling cycle, and number processing
   units. Thus, the highest performance gain is achieved by flexibly
   adjusting according bundling parameters towards data communication in
   large-scale cloud environments.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents aspects related to the design and implementation of a
   Takagi-Sugeno (TS) proportional-derivative (PD) + integral (I) fuzzy
   controller for processes with variable moment of inertia. A two-step
   design method for the TS PD+I fuzzy controller applied to position
   control systems is proposed. The first step concerns the Extended
   Symmetrical Optimum method-based tuning of the parameters of linear PID
   controllers organized in a parallel scheme. The second step deals first
   with the fuzzification of the linear PD component in the PID controller
   scheme resulting in the TS PD fuzzy block (TS PD FB). The modal
   equivalence principle is next employed to tune the parameters of TS PD
   FB that operates as a bump-less interpolator between separately tuned PD
   controllers placed in the rule consequents. The presentation is focused
   on the position control of a representative mechatronics application
   with variable moment of inertia, namely the laboratory equipment built
   around the Model 220 Industrial Plant Emulator. Experimental results are
   given to validate the PID controllers and design method in several case
   studies. The comparison of TS PD+I fuzzy controller versus PID
   controllers is supported by experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Anomaly detection algorithms face several challenges including
   computational complexity and resiliency to noise in input data. In this
   paper, we propose a fast and noise-resilient cluster-based anomaly
   detection method using collective labelling approach. In the proposed
   Collective Probabilistic Anomaly Detection method, first instead of
   labelling each new sample (as normal or anomaly) individually, the new
   samples are clustered, then labelled. This collective labelling
   mitigates the negative impact of noise by relying on group behaviour
   rather than individual characteristics of incoming samples. Second,
   since grouping and labelling new samples may be time-consuming, we
   summarize clusters using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Not only does GMM
   offer faster processing speed; it also facilitates summarizing clusters
   with arbitrary shape, and consequently, reducing the memory space
   requirement. Finally, a modified distance measure, based on
   Kullback-Liebner method, is proposed to calculate the similarity among
   clusters represented by GMMs. We evaluate the proposed method on various
   datasets by measuring its false alarm rate, detection rate and memory
   requirement. We also add different levels of noise to the input datasets
   to demonstrate the performance of the proposed collective anomaly
   detection method in the presence of noise. The experimental results
   confirm superior performance of the proposed method compared to
   individually-based labelling techniques in terms of memory usage,
   detection rate and false alarm rate.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering sensor nodes into groups is an efficient topology control
   approach for achieving long-term operation of Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs). The performance of clustering is greatly influenced by the
   selection of Cluster Heads (CHs), which are in charge of creating
   clusters and controlling member nodes. Finding the optimal set of CHs is
   known to be non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problem for a WSN.
   Evolutionary computation approaches can be applied to find fast and
   efficient solutions to such problems. In this paper, the problem of CHs
   election is formulated as a single-objective optimization problem,
   aiming to obtain clusters that maximize the network energy efficiency
   and link quality. The formulated problem has been solved using three
   Evolutionary approaches: Genetic Algorithms (GA), Differential Evolution
   (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Their performance has been
   compared in terms of the achieved fitness value. In addition, the
   performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated and compared to
   well-known cluster-based sensor network protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Due to accretion demand and size of the contents makes today's Internet
   architecture inefficient. This host centric model does not seem
   effective to cater current communication needs where users focus on
   desired content. As a result, translation between content information
   and networking domain should take place, typically consisting of an
   establishment of a delivery path between the content provider and the
   content consumer. This translation is generally an inefficient
   constraint, as data location and data popularity are neglected, which
   leads to over consumption of network resources. The increasing demands
   of highly scalable and efficient distribution of contents have motivated
   the development of future Internet architecture based on named data
   objects. Currently, Content Centric Networking (CCN) is gaining
   attention as the future Internet architecture where contents themselves
   are the primary focus, rather than the location of the content. This
   paper provides an insight into efficient caching management policies
   used currently for large file caching, our proposed approach along with
   its justification and validation behind the idea for designing the best
   caching strategy in CCN. However, caching policies can be misused if
   attackers use cache as storage to make their own content available for
   attacks or privacy leaks. We conclude with the need for security
   mechanisms for protecting the cache and the security measures to prevent
   any misuse of it.}},

Abstract = {{With exponential growth of the Internet traffic, Internet Service
   Providers (ISPs) have started to look for alternatives to meet the
   Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that have been promised to the
   customers. ISPs and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) when merged
   together can deliver the content much faster and efficient by making the
   best use of the resources and also reduces the traffic within the
   network. Implementing a CDN on a Software Defined Network (SDN) provides
   better control and granularity over the type of content that each server
   holds or distributes. A centralized approach on top decoupled control
   plane and data plane reduces overhead, better user experience and cost
   by using CDN. SDN also provides better user experiences, and a dramatic
   decrease in network systems and equipment costs. Following the
   advantages of SDN architecture, we propose the CDN-SDN architecture and
   discuss the logic behind SDN Server/Controller and its functions needed
   to achieve the SDN-based CDN approach.}},

Abstract = {{The modern automobile is controlled by networked computers. The security
   of these networks was historically of little concern, but researchers
   have in recent years demonstrated their many vulnerabilities to attack.
   As part of a defence against these attacks, we evaluate an anomaly
   detector for the automotive controller area network (CAN) bus. The
   majority of attacks are based on inserting extra packets onto the
   network. But most normal packets arrive at a strict frequency. This
   motivates an anomaly detector that compares current and historical
   packet timing. We present an algorithm that measures inter-packet timing
   over a sliding window. The average times are compared to historical
   averages to yield an anomaly signal. We evaluate this approach over a
   range of insertion frequencies and demonstrate the limits of its
   effectiveness. We also show how a similar measure of the data contents
   of packets is not effective for identifying anomalies. Finally we show
   how a one-class support vector machine can use the same information to
   detect anomalies with high confidence.}},

Abstract = {{EEG is the most frequently applied method for capturing the brain
   activity due to its high temporal resolution and portability, and its
   low cost and health risks. However, EEG signals have very low signal to
   noise ratio due to the effects of scalp, skull, and many other layers as
   well as noise generated by physiological and non-physiological
   artifacts. Furthermore, preparation of EEG monitoring equipment and
   making proper contact between skin and electrodes is a tedious and
   time-consuming task due to presence of hair and different skull shapes.
   In this paper, we report the experimental attempts on improving the
   accuracy of EEG acquisition using a semi-invasive approach which
   utilizes acupuncture-based needle penetration to alleviate the effect of
   sculpt on the EEG signals and enhance the preparation efficiency. High
   level cluster analysis and low level signal analysis on real-life data
   recorded for nine physical, lingual, and motor imagery tasks suggest
   that contrary to our expectations, the proposed method is not effective.}},

Abstract = {{A new design is proposed to enhance an existing architecture for
   delivering future millimeter-waveband (mmWB) Radio-over-Fibre (RoF) for
   wireless services with the use of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
   (DWDM) architecture over a Passive Optical Network (PON). For the
   conceptual illustration, we deployed the original DWDM RoF-PON system
   then redesigned its infrastructure. In the downlink, the mm-WB RF signal
   is obtained at each Optical Network Unit (ONU) by using optical Remote
   Heterodyning Detection (RHD) between two optical carriers
   simultaneously, which is generated using a single laser source. The
   generated RF modulated signal has a frequency of 12.5 GHz. Such RoF
   system is simple, cost-effective, low-maintenance and is immune to laser
   phase noise in principle.}},

   frequency-modulated optical pulse, to directly modulate the LD using an
   injection current with a parabolic current shape that is controlled by a
   microwave waveform generated by a low-speed arbitrary waveform generator
   (AWG). The frequency-modulated optical waveform is then sent to an
   unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) to get two time-delayed
   replicas of the input waveform. A chirped microwave waveform is then
   generated by beating the time-delayed waveforms at a high speed
   photodetector (PD). The proposed technique is theoretically studied and
   experimentally demonstrated. Using an AWG with sampling rate of 100 MS/s
   and an MZI with an arm length difference of 144 m, we experimentally
   generate a linearly chirped microwave waveform with a long time duration

   frequency-tunable microwave photonic filter (MPF) based on
   phase-modulation to intensity-modulation conversion in an optically
   pumped silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microring resonator (MRR). In the
   proposed MPF, a phase-modulated optical signal is filtered by an SOI
   MRR, to have one first-order sideband suppressed by the MRR notch. The
   phase-modulated optical signal is converted to an intensity-modulated
   single-sideband (SSB) signal and detected at a photodetector (PD). The
   entire operation is equivalent to a single passband MPF with the central
   frequency determined by the wavelength difference between the optical
   carrier and the MRR notch. The frequency tunability is achieved by
   tuning the resonance wavelength of the MRR, which is realized by
   optically pumping the MRR using an optical pumping source with its
   wavelength located at one resonant wavelength of the MRR. The thermal
   effect due to the free carrier absorption (FCA) and free carrier
   dispersion (FCD) resulted from the two photon absorption (TPA) in the
   MRR leads to a net redshift in the resonance wavelength, enabling the
   tuning of the frequency of the MPF. The approach is experimentally
   evaluated. An all-optically tunable single passband MPF with a tunable
   frequency from 16 to 23 GHz is experimentally demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{A symmetrical radio over a colorless wavelength-division multiplexing
   passive optical network with wavelength reuse based on polarization
   multiplexing and coherent detection incorporating digital phase noise
   cancellation is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. For the
   downlink, two optical signals are intensity modulated by two different
   16-QAM downstream microwave vector signals that are polarization
   multiplexed at the optical line terminal (OLT). Then, the two
   orthogonally polarized optical signals are transmitted to the optical
   network unit (ONU). At the ONU, one of the two orthogonally polarized
   optical signals is selected to be reused for the uplink transmission.
   Then, the reused optical signal is split into two channels by a 3-dB
   coupler. One portion of the reused optical signal is phase modulated by
   a 16-QAM upstream microwave vector signal, while the other portion is
   intensity modulated by another 16-QAM upstream microwave vector signal.
   Again, the two portions of the optical signals are polarization
   multiplexed and transmitted back to the OLT. At the OLT, a coherent
   receiver with a digital signal processing (DSP) unit is used to detect
   the upstream optical signals. Two DSP algorithms are developed to
   recover the two 16-QAM upstream microwave vector signals. The
   transmission of two 2.5-Gb/s 16-QAM downstream microwave vector signals
   and two 2.5-Gb/s 16-QAM upstream microwave vector signals over a 10.5-km
   single-mode fiber is experimentally demonstrated. The error vector
   magnitudes for both the down and upstream transmissions are measured to
   be 7.3\% and 8.65\%, which are good enough to achieve error-free

Abstract = {{Photonic generation of a linearly chirped microwave waveform with a

   spectral shaper is reported. The on-chip optical spectral shaper has a
   Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) structure in which two linearly
   chirped waveguide gratings (LC-WBGs) with opposite chirp rates are
   incorporated into the two arms. The LC-WBGs are fabricated on two rib
   waveguides by linearly varying the rib widths along the gratings to
   generate linear chirps. By controlling the length difference between the
   two arms in the MZI, the spectral response of the shaper can be
   controlled to have a symmetrical, linearly increasing or linearly
   decreasing free spectral range (FSR), which is needed for the generation
   of a linearly chirped microwave waveform based on spectral-shaping and
   wavelength-to-time (SS-WTT) mapping. The proposed device is fabricated

Abstract = {{This paper suggests an optimal behavior prediction mechanism for a

   called primitives. The optimality of the behavior is formulated as a

   library of pairs of reference input/controlled output signals. The
   reference input primitives are optimized in a Model-Free Iterative
   Learning Control framework without using knowledge of the controlled
   process. The new complex trajectories to be tracked are decomposed into
   the output primitives regarded as basis functions. The optimal reference
   input fed to the control system in order to track the desired new
   trajectory is then recomposed from the reference input primitives. The
   efficiency of this approach is demonstrated on a case study concerning
   the position control of a two-axis positioning mechanism in a laboratory

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel architecture for a hierarchical Wireless
   Networked Control System (WNCS). It consists of three cascaded workcells
   each containing 30 sensors, 30 actuators and one controller. The
   wireless communication protocol used is IEEE 802.11g with multicasting.
   The hierarchy of the system is such that the lowest level is that of the
   sensors and actuators, the intermediate level is the controllers, and
   the highest level is a supervisory node. This supervisor can be either
   active or passive. System performance is measured using OPNET
   simulations and the results are confirmed analytically. The system is
   shown to tolerate all possible controller failure scenarios. The
   supervisor can handle the entire control load of all three controllers,
   should the need arise. The system exhibits zero packet drops and delay
   constraints are met in all scenarios. The effect of interference is then
   investigated and the maximum interference that can be tolerated by the
   system is quantified.}},

Abstract = {{The dependability of computing system is a major concern of academia and
   industry. In the post-silicon era, it is almost impossible to develop
   fully fault-tolerant hardware, while maintaining high dependability, low
   power and high performance. Thus, software dependability computing
   techniques are preferred to complement the hardware's dependability
   inadequacy. Cross-layer approach, where language, compiler, operating
   system, instruction set architecture (ISA), circuit, and device
   cooperates with each other, promises low cost dependability solutions
   compared to a single-layer solution. As ISA bridges the hardware and
   software, this paper surveys the software dependability techniques from
   ISA's viewpoint, including dependability-oriented instruction set
   design, analytical vulnerability model and compiler techniques to
   enhance dependability. In conclusion, this paper calls for further ISA
   design and compiler-based research work targeting dependability.}},

Abstract = {{Handheld devices are becoming increasingly common, and they have varied
   range of resources. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) allows resource
   constrained devices to offload computation and use storage capacities of
   more resourceful surrogate machines. This enables creation of new and
   interesting applications for all devices. We propose a scheme that
   constructs a high-performance decentralized system by a group of
   volunteer mobile devices which come together to form a resourceful unit
   (cloudlet). The idea is to design a model to operate as a
   publicre-source between mobile devices in close geographical proximity.
   This cloudlet can provide larger storage capability and can be used as a
   computational resource by other devices in the network. The system needs
   to watch the movement of the participating nodes and restructure the
   topology if some nodes that are providing support to the cloudlet fail
   or move out of the network. We achieve this by leveraging the concept of
   virtual dominating set to create an overlay in the broads of the network
   and distribute the responsibilities in hosting a cloudlet server. We
   propose an architecture, called DRAP, for such a system and develop
   algorithms that are requited for its operation.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing technologies are becoming increasingly used for
   humanitarian aid and disaster prediction and management purposes.
   Originally designed for military and government-use, today's
   proliferation of smaller, light -weight, intelligent, network connected
   and sometimes autonomous remote sensors are now finding their way into
   daily use by civilian authorities, universities and commercial entities
   as accurate and relatively cheap means of providing functions such as
   disaster prediction, mitigation and for damage assessment. In this paper
   we present an overview of the trends in remote sensing technologies,
   with emphasis on the capabilities of existing and planned space and
   airborne radar and hyperspectral sensors for humanitarian applications.
   In addition to that, we present a case study for crop health monitoring
   where remote sensing assets coupled with commercial telematics for
   example Radio Frequency Identifiers (RFIDs) deployed in support of
   narcotics interdiction through agricultural interventions in
   Afghanistan.}},

Abstract = {{Feature selection is based on the notion that redundant and/or
   irrelevant variables bring no additional information about the data
   classes and can be considered noise for the predictor. As a result, the
   total feature set of a dataset could be minimized to only few features
   containing maximum discrimination information about the class.
   Classification accuracy is used as the evaluation measure in guiding the
   feature selection process. At the same time, such measure does not take
   into account the privacy of the resulting dataset. In this work, we
   incorporate privacy considerations into the very evaluation measure that
   is used to evaluate and select feature subsets. We consider privacy
   ``during{''} the feature selection process and as such introduce a
   two-dimensional measure in automatic feature selection that takes into
   account both objectives of privacy and efficacy (e.g. accuracy)
   simultaneously and provides the data user with the flexibility of
   trading-off one for another.}},

   of nine peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and state-of-the-art
   studies on business process compliance to examine Information Technology
   artifacts used in the compliance of business processes to laws and
   regulations. Results from the 342 unique studies covered by these
   reviews demonstrate that eight types of Information Technology artifacts
   are used in the design, execution and after-execution lifecycle phases
   of regulatory compliance to perform compliance modeling, checking,
   analysis and enactment tasks. The results also demonstrate with
   statistical evidence that compliance enactment (which involves putting
   mechanisms in place to address changes in the compliance
   representations, business processes or regulatory requirements) has
   received the least attention. This is a worrisome situation given the
   dynamic environment in which businesses operate. We argue that the
   findings in this work are relevant toward understanding the current

Abstract = {{Trust plays a vital role in the decision to initiate any interaction.
   Rational agents may use past experiences and other agents' opinions to
   decide to trust, but due to the nature of open multi-agent systems,
   agents can dynamically join and leave the system at any time where
   agents may find themselves dealing with complete strangers whom neither
   they nor their friends have encountered before. This situation forces
   the agents to choose partners randomly, which significantly increases
   the risk of encountering unreliable agents. In this paper, we address
   that issue by creating a Trust Certificate model that allows agents to
   retrieve reputation information and make initial trust evaluations when
   evidence is unavailable. It also helps agents to avoid the need to make
   a random partner selection due to the information scarcity. We show how
   this model enhances the interaction process between agents by evaluating
   it in the context of a simulated multi-agent system.}},

   framework with policy-based processing of streaming event data using a
   general publish/subscribe model in a business-to-business (B2B)
   healthcare network. The testing of such systems is difficult to manage
   and difficult to implement using general purpose languages because of
   intensive interleaved behaviors. We propose several TTCN-3 solutions to
   the interleave problem both at the level of actors behavior and at the
   level of the end-to-end behavior of the process. Finally, we discuss how
   TTCN-3 can be used at the design stage to simulate the behavior of
   actors by an abstract test component behavior emulation in parallel.}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of assistive technologies for enhancing human
   mobility, there has been a high demand for compact, lightweight,
   powerful and energy efficient actuator. The Pneumatic Artificial Muscle
   (PAM) is a distinctive compliant pneumatic actuator, which has
   properties similar to the biological skeletal muscle, making it a great
   candidate for applications in human mobility assistive devices. Whereas
   the PAMs can be used actively or passively, until now, it has been
   mostly used in active applications to power various mechanisms, such as
   robotic arms, most notably the Shadow Robot Company Dextrous hand. For
   those applications, static and dynamic models of PAM have been developed
   by researchers to fairly accurately predict the muscle-force carrying
   capabilities and muscle contraction distance behavior, respectively.
   However, limited passive models have been developed, with results
   varying from acceptable to poor in terms of accuracy. Recognizing the
   significance of characterizing the PAM passive behavior, especially for
   legged locomotion application, this paper proposes a PAM stiffness model
   that is based on Newtonian mechanics and considers geometric, mechanical
   and material properties of the muscle. The proposed stiffness model is
   experimentally validated for a wide range of operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We present Hybrid Key, an automatic tool using chromatic information as
   the key signal for compositing multiple video layers together. This tool
   is based on our recently proposed chroma-keying mechanism which
   simulates human perception by utilizing a hybrid color space and reaches
   the minimum criteria of real-time high-definition video processing
   {[}1]. In this paper, we improve the quality of our perception-based
   algorithm, and optimized the implementation with a hybrid GPU/CPU
   architecture. Our new system introduces the task prioritizing and
   asynchronous processing without jeopardizing the quality. It efficiently
   distributes computational burdens between different processing units and
   therefore leaving more room for final alpha and foreground estimation as
   well as the newly added alpha optimization. In addition, our
   implementation can make use of GPU specified optimizations to further
   improve its efficiency. These advantages not only ensure the best
   overall quality in comparison to other state-of-the-art chroma keyers,
   but also provide a cost-efficient real-time 4K high-definition chroma
   keying solution and create the first iPad/iPhone application for high

   explored in this paper is: how easy is it to add a textual concrete
   syntax to an existing language that offers only a concrete graphical
   syntax? To answer this question, this paper reports on lessons learned
   during the creation of a textual syntax (supported by an editor and
   transformation tool) for the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL),
   which is part of the User Requirements Notation standard. Our experiment
   shows that although current technologies help create textual modelling
   languages efficiently with feature-rich editors, there are important
   conflicts between the reuse of existing metamodels and the usability of
   the resulting textual syntax that require attention.}},

Abstract = {{Business Process Management (BPM) applications in the medical domain
   pose challenging testing problems that result from parallel execution of
   test behaviors performed by different actors. Hospitals nowadays
   function with the principle of pools of personnel. Each pool addresses a
   specific functionality and each member of the pool can pick any task
   that is proposed to the pool. The challenge for BPM testing is in the
   existence of dependencies between actors and the corresponding test
   description where the stimuli sent to the BPM that is the system under
   test (SUT) by one actor produces responses that affect a selected number
   of other actors belonging to a pool. Unit testing of such systems has
   proven to be of limited efficiency in detecting faults that can be
   detected only during parallel execution of test components representing
   actors. We propose an architecture based on the TTCN-3 model of
   separation of concern and its intensive parallel test component (PTC)
   concept which provides solutions that are beyond traditional
   telecommunication systems testing and which have revealed opportunities
   for improving TTCN-3.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose exploiting ASK-PSK modulated stamp in
   receiving path selection technique to lessen the phase cancellation
   effect in augmented ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio frequency
   identification (RFID) indoor localization system (AURIS). In AURIS, a
   tag-like semi-passive RFID component (referred as sensatag) can capture
   backscatter signal of other proximal tags with presence of RF source.
   According to the principle of backscatter radio link, the received
   signal at sensatag antenna is the superposition of backscatter signal of
   tags and continuous carrier wave (CW) from RF source. However, due to
   phase difference between tag's backscatter signal and RF CW, the
   modulated backscatter signal could be cancelled. We refer this effect as
   phase cancellation effect. Exploiting the spatial diversity of
   dual-antenna's two receiving paths, the likelihood of phase cancellation
   occurrence could be reduced. But the developed technique with two
   co-operating paths is not energy efficient. Therefore, this paper
   proposes to inject a ASK-PSK modulated stamp sequence in the pilot tone
   of backscatter signal as a signature of phase cancellation for ASK
   modulated data frame, which could be identified by the receiving
   sensatag. With the knowledge of occurrence of phase cancellation,
   sensatag could activate the alternative receiving path. This technique
   fully exploits the space diversity of dual-antenna, and also reduces the
   power consumption by reducing one receiving path in operation. We
   demonstrate the performance of stamp based receiving path selection
   technique with data obtained from computer simulation. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Increasingly, healthcare is provided by a team of care providers from
   different organizations. Cross-organizational healthcare data sharing is
   a major issue in interoperable healthcare organizations. Studies have
   shown that quality of care can be put at risk when patients are
   transferred from one organization to another, while the need for
   protecting patient privacy is sometimes an inhibitor to providing
   information computing technology (ICT) solutions. This paper presents a
   systematic literature review of cross-organizational healthcare data
   sharing. The review includes research related to laws and regulations as
   well as proposed methodological and ICT solutions. Our methodology for
   querying, filtering and selecting relevant papers from scientific,
   academic and general repositories is explained and the selected papers
   are categorized and compared in terms of scope, contributions, and
   future directions. Based on this analysis, we outline a possible
   research direction for developing ICT solutions that healthcare
   providers and regulators would be willing to adopt. Based on our review,
   we concluded that inspite of the liberal regulations around data sharing
   among authorized healthcare providers, these organizations are utterly
   reluctant to collaborate on patient information. Fear of a breech of
   personal health information, and the shortage of technological
   facilitators that are compatible with the existing health information
   systems, are the main causes of the cross-organizational
   interoperability problems in the healthcare sector. The existing
   collaborative technologies require considerable initial investments that
   the current healthcare system is not willing to spend funds on. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Tissue resistance changes upon application of DC current. We posit that
   in a similar fashion, that scalp and skull resistances during
   trancranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are variable, resulting in
   changes to intracranial dose. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
   electoencephelogram (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) and functional near
   infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are technologies used to measure
   individual neural reponse to tDCS. These technologies are complex and
   may not be directly correlated to intracranial dose. We therefore
   present a bioimpedance spectroscopy method of measuring changes to the
   intracranial dose in vivo. Scalp resistance changes are measured during
   tDCS. Current flow through the scalp is calculated as the ratio of
   voltage measured on the scalp and scalp resistance. Variation of
   intracranial current is indirectly calculated from changes in the
   current shunted through the scalp. We thus demonstrate a novel
   methodology of on-line monitoring of scalp resistance and current as an
   objective feedback of estimated individual tDCS dose.}},

Abstract = {{TCP suffers degradation in wireless networks, which is caused by the
   improper, static definitions on the lower layers. In order to improve
   the TCP performance in wireless networks, the strategy of the lower
   layer should be reconsidered. In this paper, the TCP transmission is
   flattened in order to combine the TCP segment transmission and TCP
   Acknowledgement (ACK) transmission into one transmission. The
   performance of TCP is also analyzed, in order to find out the
   corresponding parameters affecting the TCP throughput. Based on the
   analysis, contention window size shows as one of the parameters that
   greatly affects the TCP performance. A discrete-time Markov decision
   process is adopted in order to solve the TCP throughput maximization.
   Based on the analysis, a TCP-distributed algorithm is proposed. Several
   simulations are conducted to verify the improvements of TCP-distributed
   by comparing both TCP Reno and TCP Vegas. Simulation results show that
   TCP-distributed can perform better than the two TCP variants, and it

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an SU controller based on the H2H infinity norm
   formulation to address the data traffic control issues in the Transport
   Layer of the AQM Network. The SU controller arises from the
   incorporation of the S (Sensitivity) function and the U (Input
   Sensitivity) function along with their associated weight functions. It
   keeps the robust steady-state performance of the H-infinity controller,
   but uses H-2 formulation in addition to improve the transient
   performance. We have evaluated the robustness and transient performances
   of this controller to show the improvement over the same controller with
   the H-infinity formulation only. We have also compared it with the
   PIcontroller.}},

Abstract = {{Location privacy is an important issue in vehicular networks since
   knowledge of a vehicle's location can result in leakage of sensitive
   information. A way to protect vehicles' location privacy is to have them
   change their pseudonyms in predetermined regions known as mix-zones.
   However, selfish users may not change their pseudonyms because of the
   overhead occurring in this process. This could jeopardize the location
   privacy of those users who are in need of changing their pseudonyms. In
   order to encourage users to cooperate in changing their pseudonyms, we
   propose a method named Reputation-based Pseudonym Change for Location
   Privacy (RPCLP). With RPCLP, users earn reputation ``credit{''} by
   implementing a change of pseudonym. Performance analysis shows that the
   RPCLP scheme not only motivates selfish users to cooperate with each
   other, but also reduces overhead while maintaining the desired location
   privacy.}},

   distributed mode selection strategies that cater for the time-varying
   needs of the network terminals. It is shown that these strategies give

Abstract = {{The temporal component of social networks is often neglected in their
   analysis, and statistical measures are typically performed on a
   ``static{''} representation of the network. As a result, measures of
   importance (like betweenness centrality) cannot reveal any temporal role
   of the entities involved. Our goal is to start filling this limitation
   by proposing a form of temporal betweenness measure, and by using it to
   analyse a knowledge mobilization network. We show that this measure,
   which takes time explicitly into account, allows us to detect centrality
   roles that were completely hidden in the classical statistical analysis.
   In particular, we uncover nodes whose static centrality was considered
   negligible, but whose temporal role is instead important to accelerate
   mobilization flow in the network. We also observe the reverse behaviour
   by detecting nodes with high static centrality, whose role as temporal
   bridges is instead very low. By revealing important temporal roles, this
   study is a first step towards a better understanding of the impact of
   time in social networks, and opens the road to further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Blind or semi-blind channel estimation techniques, such as subspace
   decomposition, often use second order statistics which can provide
   channel estimates that are multiplied by an unknown complex constant,
   known as the ambiguity. Determination of this ambiguity can be achieved
   by the insertion of a small number of pilot symbols within a data block.
   The goal of this paper is to investigate the bit error rate performance
   of single carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) based
   transmissions using different pilot insertion rates, with the goal of
   determining the ambiguity without sacrificing spectral efficiency. Using
   Monte Carlo simulation, our results show, for the conditions presented
   in this paper, the insertion of 4 pilot symbols per 64 symbol block (or
   a ratio of 1 pilot per 15 information symbols) achieves a BER of 10(-3)
   with a power loss of 1dB or 1.5 dB (depending on the channel order)
   compared to a system with perfect ambiguity resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid is a modern electrical grid that utilizes Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) and information networks. Growing
   attraction in Electric Vehicles (EV) shall likely provide a fundamental
   shift not only in transportation sector but also in the existing
   electrical grid infrastructure. In Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network,
   participating EVs can be used to store energy and supply this energy
   back to the power grid when required. To realize proper deployment of
   V2G network, charging infrastructure having various entities such as
   charging facility, clearinghouse, and energy provider has to be
   constructed. So use of Public key infrastructure (PKI) is indispensable
   for provisioning security solutions in V2G networks. The ISO/IEC 15118
   standard is ascribed that incorporates X.509 PKI solution for V2G
   network. However, as traditional X.509 based PKI for V2G network has
   several shortcomings, we have proposed a multi-domain PKI model for V2G
   network that is built on elliptic curve cryptography and a
   self-certified public key technique having implicit certificate. We
   illustrate that the proposed solutions outperform the existing ones.}},

Title = {{An Elicitation Study on Gesture Preferences and Memorability Toward a
   Practical Hand-Gesture Vocabulary for Smart Televisions}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{543-555}},
Abstract = {{With the introduction of new depth-sensing technologies, interactive
   hand-gesture devices (such as smart televisions and displays) have been
   rapidly emerging. However, given the lack of a common vocabulary, most
   hand-gesture control commands are device-specific, burdening the user
   into learning different vocabularies for different devices. In order for
   hand gestures to become a natural communication for users with
   interactive devices, a standardized interactive hand-gesture vocabulary
   is necessary. Recently, researchers have approached this issue by
   conducting studies that elicit gesture vocabularies based on users'
   preferences. Nonetheless, a universal vocabulary has yet to be proposed.
   In this paper, a thorough design methodology for achieving such a
   universal hand-gesture vocabulary is presented. The methodology is
   derived from the work of Wobbrock et al. and includes four steps: 1) a
   preliminary survey eliciting users' attitudes; 2) a broader user survey
   in order to construct the universal vocabulary via results of the
   preliminary survey; 3) an evaluation test to study the implementation of
   the vocabulary; and 4) a memory test to analyze the memorability of the
   vocabulary. The proposed vocabulary emerged from this methodology
   achieves an agreement score exceeding those of the existing studies.
   Moreover, the results of the memory test show that, within a 15-min
   training session, the average accuracy of the proposed vocabulary is
   90.71\%. Despite the size of the proposed gesture vocabulary being
   smaller than that of similar work, it shares the same functionality, is
   easier to remember and can be integrated with smart TVs, interactive
   digital displays, and so on.}},

Title = {{Delay Critical Smart Grid Applications and Adaptive QoS Provisioning}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1367-1378}},
Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are anticipated to be widely adopted in
   the various monitoring and control applications due to their versatility
   and low cost. One of the most promising and emerging WSNs applications
   is their use in monitoring smart grid assets. Although WSNs can provide
   cost efficient and reliable solutions, they are not suitable for delay
   critical application, because they were initially designed for low data
   rate applications and they may be challenged when sudden faults or
   failures occur in the monitored environments. Therefore, to prevent
   extensive delays of critical data, appropriate quality of service (QoS)
   techniques should be used. In this paper, we present an adaptive QoS
   scheme (AQoS) and an adaptive guaranteed time slot (AGTS) allocation
   scheme for IEEE 802.15.4-based WSNs used in high traffic intensity smart
   grid monitoring applications. Both AQoS and AGTS schemes can adaptively
   reduce the end-to-end delay and flexibly tune the GTS to provide the
   required QoS differentiation to delay critical smart grid monitoring
   applications.}},

Title = {{Cascading Failures in Smart Grid: Joint Effect of Load Propagation and
   Interdependence}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{2520-2530}},
Abstract = {{The smart grid mainly suffers from two types of cascading failures: 1)
   interdependence cascading failure and 2) load propagation cascading
   failure. The former one happens due to the interdependence between power
   grid and communication networks. The latter one is caused by the load
   propagation in the single power grid. A tiny failure leads to the
   simultaneous occurrence of these two cascading failures. In this paper,
   we study the system robustness by considering the interdependence and
   load propagation. First, we develop a mathematical tool to analyze the
   load propagation in single network. Then, a percolation based method is
   proposed to calculate the remaining fractions of survivals after the
   cascading failures stop. We estimate the node tolerance parameter T (the
   ratio of capacity to initial workload) threshold T-c', below which the
   entire system may suffer from the cascading failure. The effect of
   interdependence on is also studied, where lower T-c', is required for
   the less compact interdependence. We prove that the system performance
   approaches to the upper bound once the tolerance parameter T ->
   infinity. Our analysis indicates that the fraction of survivals in the
   power grid is always greater than that in communication network,
   although the initial failure occurs in the power grid. The extensive
   simulations validate our mathematical analysis, and demonstrate that the
   relation between the number of initial failures and tolerance parameter
   threshold is super-linear.}},

Title = {{Smart Meters Big Data: Game Theoretic Model for Fair Data Sharing in
   Deregulated Smart Grids}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{2743-2754}},
Abstract = {{Aggregating fine-granular data measurements from smart meters presents
   an opportunity for utility companies to learn about consumers' power
   consumption patterns. Several research studies have shown that power
   consumption patterns can reveal a range of information about consumers,
   such as how many people are in the home, the types of appliances they
   use, their eating and sleeping routines, and even the TV programs they
   watch. As we move toward liberalized energy markets, many different
   parties are interested in gaining access to such data, which has
   enormous economical, societal, and environmental benefits. However, the
   main concern is that many such beneficial uses of smart meter big data
   would be severely curtailed if the data were excessively protected due
   to individuals' privacy. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic
   mechanism that balances between beneficial uses of data and individuals'
   privacy in deregulated smart grids. Our mechanism solves the problem of
   access control by fairly compensating consumers for their participation
   in the data market based on the concept of differential privacy. The
   results of our experiments show the importance of taking consumers'
   attitudes toward privacy as a crucial element in designing balanced
   markets for fair data sharing. Furthermore, the experiments provide a
   principled way to choose reasonable values for privacy levels that are
   more relevant to real-world scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a symbolic computer algebra toolbox for the
   computation of two dimensional (2D) Fourier transforms in polar

   used in image processing, tomographic reconstructions and in fact any

   The implementation of the 2D Fourier transform in polar coordinates
   within the toolbox via the combination of two significantly simpler
   transforms.
   The modular approach along with the idea of lookup tables implemented
   help avoid the issue of indeterminate results which may occur when
   attempting to directly evaluate the transform.
   The concept also helps prevent unnecessary computation of already known

Abstract = {{With the increasing number of the epilepsy patients (EPs) and their
   growing need for continuous monitoring and immediate respond to their
   seizures, the Epilepsy Patients Monitoring System (EPMS) is proposed to
   be the fit solution for the healthcare monitoring applications
   especially for the EPs monitoring application. This paper focuses on the
   use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for the healthcare monitoring
   applications. The main objective of this system is to decrease the
   response time for the sudden seizure, protect patients from possible
   severe consequences and help them become comfortable with the monitoring
   process. Our EPMS consists of five regular nodes placed at specific
   sites on the patient's body, as well as a coordinator node and a
   receiver node. The regular nodes detect seizures and forward the data to
   the coordinator, which collects the data and transmits it to the
   receiver. The Sensor Medium Access Control (SMAC) (a new MAC protocol
   specifically designed for WSNs) protocol has been used to decrease the
   generated delays and to achieve the highest throughput for the proposed
   system. We evaluate our proposed system via NS-2 simulations, and based
   on the numerical results, we show that SMAC-based system gives
   appropriate response time which achieves the expected objectives.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new approach to summarize clusters by finding
   dense regions, and representing each cluster as a Gaussian Mixture Model
   (GMM). The GMM summarization allows us to summarize a cluster
   efficiently, then regenerate the original data with high accuracy.
   Unlike the classical representation of a cluster using a radius and a
   center, the proposed approach keeps information of the shape, as well as
   distributions of the samples in the clusters. Considering the GMM as a
   parametric model (number of Gaussian mixtures in each GMM), we propose a
   method to find number of Gaussian mixtures automatically. Each GMM is
   able to summarize a cluster generated by any kind of clustering
   algorithms and regenerate the original data with high accuracy.
   Moreover, when a new sample is presented to the GMMs of clusters, a
   membership value is calculated for each cluster. Then, using the
   membership values, the new incoming sample is assigned to the closest
   cluster. Employing the GMMs to summarize clusters offers several
   advantages with regards to accuracy, detection rate, memory efficiency
   and time complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on a variety of
   datasets, both synthetic dataset and real datasets from the UCI
   repository. We examine the quality of the summarized clusters generated
   by the proposed method in terms of DUNN, DB, SD and SSD indexes, and
   compare them with that of the well-known ABACUS method. We also employ
   the proposed algorithm in anomaly detection applications, and study the
   performance of the proposed method in terms of false alarm and detection
   rates, and compare them with Negative Selection, Naive models, and
   ABACUS. Furthermore, we evaluate the memory usage and processing time of
   the proposed algorithms with other algorithms. The results illustrate
   that our algorithm outperforms other well-known anomaly detection
   algorithms in terms of accuracy, detection rate, as well as memory usage
   and processing time.}},

Title = {{A Mathematical Model of a Direct Propane Fuel Cell}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A rigorous mathematical model for direct propane fuel cells (DPFCs) was
   developed. Compared to previous models, it provides better values for
   the current density and the propane concentration at the exit from the
   anode. This is the first DPFC model to correctly account for proton
   transport based on the combination of the chemical potential gradient
   and the electrical potential gradient. The force per unit charge from
   the chemical potential gradient (concentration gradient) that pushes
   protons from the anode to the cathode is greater than that from the
   electrical potential gradient that pushes them in the opposite
   direction. By including the chemical potential gradient, we learn that
   the proton concentration gradient is really much different than that
   predicted using the previous models that neglected the chemical
   potential gradient. Also inclusion of the chemical potential gradient
   made this model the first one having an overpotential gradient
   (calculated from the electrical potential gradient) with the correct
   slope. That is important because the overpotential is exponentially
   related to the reaction rate (current density). The model described here
   provides a relationship between the conditions inside the fuel cell
   (proton concentration, overpotential) and its performance as measured
   externally by current density and propane concentration.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a gradient-based optimization procedure consisting of two

   at this local minimum in order to find another point on the other side
   of the barrier where the function value is approximately the same. In
   the next cycle the search for the global optimum commences again using
   this new found point as the starting state. The search continues until
   no improvement in function the result is found. Results from the

Abstract = {{Porous polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and polyetherimide (PEI) hollow
   fiber mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were spun under the same spinning
   conditions for CO2 absorption experiment via membrane contactor. The
   effects of montmorillonite (MMT) loading on thermodynamic and kinetic
   aspects of phase inversion as well as the membrane properties were
   investigated using various analytical characterization methods. MMT
   embedment into PVDF lowered the thermodynamic stability while making the
   solvent/nonsolvent exchange in the phase inversion faster, which
   resulted in the formation of thinner skin layer, thicker finger-like
   layer and thinner sponge-like layer. As a result, the N-2 gas permeance
   increased considerably. As for the PEI, the high hydrophobicity of the
   incorporated clay particles slowed down the rate of solvent/nonsolvent
   exchange and subsequently thicker skin layer as well as more compact
   sublayer structure with narrower finger-like pores was formed. Hence, a
   considerable reduction in the rate of gas permeation for the PEI MMMs
   was observed. In addition, both PVDF and PEI membranes experienced
   significant increase in the contact angle and LEPw by the presence of
   hydrophobic MMT in the system. Physical CO2 absorption with distilled
   water was performed using the hollow fiber gas-liquid membrane
   contactor. The absorption flux was enhanced by the MMT embedment for
   both PVDF and PEI but the flux enhancement of PEI was more pronounced
   than the PVDF. However, the long-term absorption stability test over 15
   days revealed that the flux of the MMT incorporated PEI hollow fiber
   deteriorates considerably with time due to the intrinsically high
   hydrophilicity of PEI material.}},

   were used to develop a fibre reinforced unsaturated polyester resin
   nanocomposite. The composite behavior was investigated systematically by
   using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential
   scanning calorimetry, etc. Among all of the composites tested, the
   nanocopper particle impregnated strong and durable fibre (30\%)
   reinforced unsaturated polyester resin composite was demonstrated to
   have the highest mechanical strength. The change of weight gain follows
   typical Fickian diffusion behavior. To predict the strength of the
   nanocomposite, standard micromechanical models were analyzed and the
   trends were seen as mixed success. The observed properties of the
   developed nanocomposites indicate that they can be considered for indoor
   to outdoor applications.}},

Title = {{Overestimation of the number of elements in a three-dimensional stimulus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Observers' numerosity judgments in binocular stereopsis were examined in
   four experiments, using random-dot stereograms (RDSs) that depicted a
   two-dimensional (2-D) stimulus side-by-side with a three-dimensional
   (3-D) stimulus. When the RDSs were correctly fused, a single surface and
   two (or three) transparent surfaces were observed for the 2-D and 3-D
   stimuli, respectively. Observers completed a numerosity discrimination
   task, where they judged which of the two stimuli had a greater number of
   dot elements. Results showed that (a) the 3-D stimulus was judged to
   contain more elements than the 2-D stimulus, even when both had the same
   number of elements, (b) the amount of overestimation increased as a
   function of the number of elements and the binocular disparity between
   the front and back surfaces of the 3-D stimulus, (c) the ratio of the
   physical number of elements in the front surface to that in the back
   surface of the 3-D stimulus had no effect on the magnitude of
   overestimation, and (d) when the number of elements for the two surfaces
   were judged separately, the ratio had more effect on the judged number
   of elements in the back surface than in the front surface. These results
   indicate that the extent of overestimation in the numerosity judgment of
   a set of elements in a stimulus depends on the number of depth layers in
   which the elements are embedded.}},

Title = {{Effective Transmission Coverage Area-Based Link Dynamics
   Characterization of VANET in Highway Scenario}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{This paper uses the concept of effective transmission coverage area as a
   model for the derivation of analytic expressions in order to
   characterize the dynamic statistics of link lifetime, new link arrival
   rate, new link interarrival time, link breakage interarrival time, and
   so forth. Extensive simulations have been undertaken to verify the
   derived analytical expressions via generated mobility traces. Results
   demonstrate that the proposed analytical model can characterize the
   dynamic statistics well. Furthermore, the mathematical results of
   expected link life and expected new link arrival rate are provided to be
   used in analyzing the network connectivity. Combining with queueing
   theory, the upper bound connectivity of a VANET is obtained. This work
   thus provides a fundamental guideline on designing new mobility models,
   new routing protocols, and the corresponding performance analysis in

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor and robot networks (WSRNs) are an integration of
   wireless sensor network (WSNs) and multi-robot systems. They are
   comprised of networked sensor and mobile robots that communicate via
   wireless links to perform distributed sensing and actuation tasks in a
   region of interest (ROI). In addition to gathering and reporting data,
   sensors may also report failures of neighboring sensors or lack of
   coverage in certain neighbourhood to a nearby mobile robot. We propose a
   solution, called Election-Based Deployment (EBD), for simultaneous
   sensor deployment and coverage maintenance in multi-robot scenario in
   failure-prone environment. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first
   carrier-based localized algorithm that is able to achieve 100 \%
   coverage in a ROI of any shape with multiple robots in failure-prone
   environment since it combines both sensor deployment and coverage
   maintenance process. We can observe from the simulation results that EBD
   outperforms the existing algorithms while reducing the communication
   overhead to a great extent.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{113}},
Pages = {{93666-93675}},
Abstract = {{Metals currently used for prosthetic reconstructions enjoy a relatively
   good success rate, but post-surgical infections still remain an
   important challenge. In addition, there are still no such metals that
   are able to respond to any deterioration of their relationship with the
   host tissue, in particular to an acidification of the local environment,
   an event associated to bone remodeling, tissue inflammation and
   bacterial infection. Distinctive from previous work that employed
   anodization of titanium to engender nanotubular structures, we exploited
   this technique to create a nanospongy surface that behaved as a
   non-eroding drug-eluting template for the extended release of
   vancomycin, a model antibiotic. Successively, as a proof of concept, we
   employed a chitosan-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coating to provide
   pH-dependent release kinetics of vancomycin molecules stored in the
   underlying 3-dimensional network of nanometric pores. A physicochemical
   characterization of the polymeric blend by ATR-FTIR and DPFM-AFM
   unveiled its morphological and nanomechanical characteristics and
   permitted to link them to its stability and swelling behavior in aqueous
   solutions at three different pHs. This study demonstrates the ability of
   nanospongy titanium surfaces to provide extended elution of vancomycin,
   one of the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria,
   for over one week, thus becoming a valid alternative to existing
   drug-eluting metallic platforms. In addition, our results show how the
   elution profiles can be modulated to respond to an acidification of the
   surrounding environment by exploiting uncross-linked and cross-linked
   chitosan-PEG coatings, ultimately paving the way for their broader use
   as a versatile coating for nanoporous drug-delivery platforms.}},

Abstract = {{In order to overcome the limitations of the adsorption process, a new
   type of nanocomposite ultrafiltration (UF) membrane consisting of
   polyethersulfone (PES) and titanate nanotubes (TNTs) was fabricated in
   this work via the phase inversion technique and used for adsorptive
   arsenate (As(V)) removal. The effects of impregnating TNTs on the
   structural morphology, hydrophilicity, porosity, pure water permeability
   and As(V) uptake capacity of the nanocomposite membranes were studied
   for different weight ratios of TNT:PES in the membrane matrix, ranging
   from 0 to 1.5. Of the membranes studied, an As(V) uptake capacity as
   high as 125 mg g(-1) was achieved using the membrane containing the
   highest amount of TNTs (designated as PES/TNT 1.5) and the performance
   of this membrane is comparable to most of the available adsorbents and
   other As removal systems. Increasing the TNT:PES weight ratio from 0 to
   1.5 led to an increase of membrane pure water permeability from 39.4 to
   1250 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1) with the water contact angle decreased from
   69.5 degrees to 5.2 degrees. The experimental findings from the
   continuous UF process revealed that the nanocomposite membrane of the
   highest TNT content could generate a permeate of high quality to meet
   the maximum As level set by the World Health Organization (WHO), i.e.
   <10 mu g L-1. Furthermore, the adsorptive performance of the
   nanocomposite membrane could be easily regenerated using alkaline
   solution.}},

Title = {{Detection of leukemia markers using long-range surface plasmon

Abstract = {{A novel optical biosensor based on long-range surface plasmon-polariton
   (LRSPP) waveguides is demonstrated for the detection of leukemia markers
   in patient serum using a functionalization strategy based on Protein G.
   The sensor consists of thin straight Au waveguides (5 mu m x 35 nm x 3.2
   mm) embedded in fluoropolymer CYTOP (TM) with a fluidic channel etched
   into the top cladding. B-cell leukemia is characterized by a high B-cell
   count and abnormal distribution of immunoglobulin G kappa (IgG kappa)
   and lambda (IgG lambda) light chains in serum. The detection of leukemic
   abnormalities in serum was performed based on determining IgG
   kappa-to-IgG lambda ratios (kappa : lambda). Three patient sera were
   tested: high kappa (HKS, kappa : lambda similar to 12.7 : 1), high
   lambda (HLS, lambda : kappa similar to 6.9 : 1) and normal (control)
   sera (NS, kappa : lambda similar to 1.7:1). Au waveguides were
   functionalized with Protein G and two complementary immobilization
   approaches were investigated: a) the reverse approach, where the Protein
   G surface is functionalized with patient serum and then tested against
   goat anti-human IgG light chains in buffer, and b) the direct approach,
   where the Protein G surface is functionalized with goat anti-human IgGs
   first and then tested against patient serum. The reverse approach was
   found to be more effective and robust because Protein G-functionalized
   surface performs as an ``immunological filter{''} by capturing primarily
   IgGs out of the pool of serum proteins. For the reverse approach, the
   ratios measured were 3.7 : 1(kappa : lambda), 9.7 : 1(lambda : kappa)
   and 1.9 : 1(kappa : lambda) for HKS, HLS and NS, respectively, which
   compare favorably with corresponding protein densitometry measurements.
   The respective ratios for the direct approach were 2.6 : 1(kappa :
   lambda), 2.6 : 1(lambda : kappa) and 1.7 : 1(kappa : lambda). The
   binding strength and cross-reactivity of goat anti-human IgGs light
   chains were also determined using pure solutions. The LRSPP biosensor
   along with the innovative ``reverse approach{''} can provide a low-cost
   and compact solution to B-cell leukemia screening.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to develop a Computational Fluid
   Dynamics (CFD) model to simulate and characterize the fiber suspension
   in flow in rectangular cavities. The model is intended to describe the
   temperature profile and to predict the fiber orientation. The flow was
   considered to be incompressible, and behave as Newtonian fluid
   containing suspensions of short-fibers. The numerical model for
   determination of temperature profile and fiber orientation during
   mold-filling stage of injection molding process was solved using finite
   volume method. The governing equations, of this problem are: the
   continuity, the momentum and the energy. The obtained results were
   compared to available experimental findings. A good agreement between
   the numerical results and the experimental data was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion, a pervasive aspect of human experience, has long been of
   interest to social and behavioural sciences. It is now the subject of
   multi-disciplinary research also in computational linguistics. Emotion
   recognition, studied in the area of sentiment analysis, has focused on
   detecting the expressed emotion. A related challenging question, why the
   experiencer feels that emotion, has, to date, received very little
   attention. The task is difficult and there are no annotated English
   resources. FrameNet refers to the person, event or state of affairs
   which evokes the emotional response in the experiencer as emotion
   stimulus. 1 We automatically build a dataset annotated with both the
   emotion and the stimulus using FrameNet's emotions-directed frame. We
   address the problem as information extraction: we build a CRF learner, a
   sequential learning model to detect the emotion stimulus spans in
   emotion-bearing sentences. We show that our model significantly
   outperforms all the baselines.}},

   person may have both negative and positive opinions about different
   aspects of the subject of interest, and these aspect-specific opinions
   can be independent of the overall opinion. Being able to identify,
   collect, and count these nuanced opinions in a large set of data offers
   more insight into the strengths and weaknesses of competing products and
   services than does aggregating overall ratings. We contribute a new
   confidence-based co-training algorithm that can identify product aspects
   and sentiments expressed about such aspects. Our algorithm offers better
   precision than existing methods, and handles previously unseen language
   well. We show competitive results on a set of opinionated sentences
   about laptops and restaurants from a SemEval-2014 Task 4 challenge.}},

   Therefore, techniques for extracting the location entities from the

   in a similar manner to the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task focused
   only on locations, but we address a deeper task: classifying the
   detected locations into names of cities, provinces/states, and
   countries. We approach the task in a novel way, consisting in two
   stages. In the first stage, we train Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
   models with various sets of features; we collected and annotated our own
   dataset or training and testing. In the second stage, we resolve cases
   when there exist more than one place with the same name. We propose a
   set of heuristics for choosing the correct physical location in these
   cases. We report good evaluation results for both tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Monoclinic BiVO4 powders were synthesized via a novel route using
   potassium metavanadate (KVO3) prepared by calcination of K2CO3 and V2O5
   as a starting material and followed by hydrothermal treatment and were
   investigated for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible
   light irradiation. The synthesized BiVO4 particles were characterized by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-Visible (UV-Vis) light diffuse
   reflectance spectrophotometry. The synthesis produced puremonoclinic
   BiVO4 particles with multimorphological features containing flower-like,
   flake-ball, flake, cuboid-like, and plate-like shapes and exhibited
   strong absorption in the visible light range. The BiVO4 prepared via
   KVO3 possessed excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of
   RhB under visible light. The performance of this catalyst was found to
   be superior to other BiVO4 photocatalysts prepared via ammonium
   metavanadate (NH4VO3) using coprecipitation, combustion, and calcination
   methods reported in literature, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new approach for updating clusters
   incrementally. The proposed incremental approach preserves comprehensive
   statistical information of the clusters in form of Gaussian Mixture
   Models (GMM). As each GMM needs the number of Gaussian (component) as an
   input parameter, we proposed a method to determine the number of
   components automatically with introducing the concept of core points. In
   the updating phase, instead of processing each new sample individually,
   we collect the new incoming samples and cluster them. By employing the
   concepts of core points and GMMs, we build a number of GMMs for the new
   samples and we label the new GMMs based on their similarity to the
   already existing GMMs. To find the similarity among GMMs, we introduce a
   new modified version of Kullback-Leibler as a distance function. For
   merging the current GMMs and the new GMMs, we proposed a new merging
   mechanism in which the closest components in both GMMs are merged to
   create a new GMM. Since GMM structure is a compact representation of
   clusters, there is no increase in the time neither in clustering side
   nor in updating phase. We measured the accuracy of clusters based on
   different clustering validity metrics (DB, Dunn, SD and purity) and the
   results show that our algorithm outperforms other incremental clustering
   algorithms in terms of quality of the final clusters.}},

Abstract = {{This talk will focus on machine learning methods for detecting locations
   from Twitter messages. There are two types of locations that we are
   interested in: location entities mentioned in the text of each message
   and the physical locations of the users. For the first type of
   locations, we detected expressions that denote locations and we
   classified them into names of cities, provinces/states, and countries.
   We approached the task in a novel way, consisting in two stages. In the
   first stage, we trained Conditional Random Field models with various
   sets of features. We collected and annotated our own dataset for
   training and testing. In the second stage, we resolved cases when more
   than one place with the same name exists, by applying a set of
   heuristics. For the second type of locations, we put together all the
   tweets written by a user, in order to predict his/her physical location.
   Only a few users declare their locations in their Twitter profiles, but
   this is sufficient to automatically produce training and test data for
   our classifiers. We experimented with two existing datasets collected
   from users located in the U.S. We propose a deep learning architecture
   for the solving the task, because deep learning was shown to work well
   for other natural language processing tasks, and because standard
   classifiers were already tested for the user location task. We designed
   a model that predicts the U.S. region of the user and his/her U.S.
   state, and another model that predicts the longitude and latitude of the
   user's location. We found that stacked denoising auto-encoders are well
   suited for this task, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art.}},

   information from an air-gapped high-security system to systems on a
   low-security network, using ultrasonic and audible audio covert channels

   office. Our results show that malware installed on unmodified commodity

   frequency range from 20 kHz to 20.5 kHz at a rate of 140 bps and at a
   rate of 6.7 kbps using the audible spectrum from 500 Hz to 18 kHz.
   Additionally, we show that data can be communicated using ultrasonic
   communication at distances up to 11m with bit rates over 230 bps and a
   bit error rate of 2 \%. Given our results, our attacks are able to leak
   captured keystrokes in real-time using ultrasonic signals and, using
   audible signals when nobody is present in the environment - the

Title = {{A Core Model for Parts Suppliers Selecting Method in Manufacturing
   Supply Chain}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Service-oriented manufacturing is the new development of manufacturing
   systems, and manufacturing supply chain service is also an important
   part of the service-oriented manufacturing systems; hence, the optimal
   selection of parts suppliers becomes one of key problems in the supply
   chain system. Complex network theories made a rapid progress in recent
   years, but the classical models such as BA model and WS model can not
   resolve the widespread problems of manufacturing supply chain, such as
   the repeated attachment of edge and fixed number of vertices, but edges
   increased with preferential connectivity, and flexible edges'
   probability. A core model is proposed to resolve the problem in the
   paper: it maps the parts supply relationship as a repeatable core; a
   vertex's probability distribution function integrating the edge's rate
   and vertex's degree is put forward; some simulations, such as the growth
   of core, the degree distribution characteristics, and the impacting of
   parameter, are carried out in our experiments, and the case study is set
   also. The paper proposed a novel model to analyze the manufacturing
   supply chain system from the insights of complex network.}},

Abstract = {{XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) is a declarative
   access control policy language that has unique language constructs for
   factoring out access control logic. These constructs make the
   specification of access control requirements more compact than decision
   trees, which can be considered the most natural way to specify access
   control logic. However, many publications report that performance of
   XACML policy decision point (PDP) engines is greatly affected by the
   structure of policy sets. In this paper we first explore the causes of
   potential inefficiencies of XACML policies, and then propose a procedure
   to re-structure policy sets vertically by modifying the distribution of
   access control logic among different configurations of structural
   elements, in order to remove much of this inefficiency. This is in
   contrast to horizontal re-ordering of constant structural elements. Our
   procedure can be applied regardless of the complexity and structure of
   the original policy set. We also compare the performance of policy sets
   that take advantage of the expressive power of XACML targets to decision
   trees.}},

Pages = {{779-784}},
Abstract = {{The presence of microconstituents (MCs) in the environment has become an
   emerging concern to scientists and engineers. Sorption is one of the
   important removal mechanisms for MCs in wastewater treatment plants
   (WWTPs) since there is significant sludge production. The purpose of
   this study is to explore sorption kinetics and isotherms of MCs onto
   primary sludge. Three MCs, bisphenol-A (BPA), 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol
   (EE2) and triclosan (TCS), were chosen for this study. They are
   hydrophobic and have low vapor pressure, which makes sorption a
   potential removal mechanism. Both sorption kinetics and isotherm
   experiments were conducted using primary sludge collected from a local
   municipal WWTP. The time to equilibrium was around 7 h for all chosen
   MCs. A pseudo second-order rate model was better at describing the
   sorption rate than a pseudo first-order rate model. Linear sorption
   isotherm models were found to fit the experimental data, and the
   solid-liquid partitioning coefficients for BPA, EE2 and TCS were 81, 728
   and 6,407 L/kg.}},

   new combinatorial structure for polygons, the directed dual, which
   encodes the visibility properties of deflated polygons. We also show
   that any two deflated polygons with the same directed dual can be

Abstract = {{Intelligent virtual agents function in dynamic, uncertain, and
   uncontrolled environments, and animating them is a chaotic and
   error-prone task which demands high-level behavioral controllers to be
   able to adapt to failures at lower levels of the system. On the other
   hand, the conditions in which space robotic systems such as spacecraft
   and rovers operate, inspire by necessity, the development of robust and
   adaptive control software. In this paper, we propose a generic
   architecture for developing autonomous virtual agents that let them to
   illustrate robust deliberative and reactive behaviors, concurrently.
   This architecture is inspired by onboard autonomous frameworks utilized
   in interplanetary missions. The proposed architecture is implemented
   within a discrete-event simulated world to evaluate its deliberative and
   reactive behaviors. Evaluation results suggest that the architecture
   supports both behaviors, consistently.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous localization and mapping is a situation in which a mobile
   robot travels through an environment and concurrently makes a momentary
   map of the environment and uses that map to localize. The simultaneous
   localization and mapping is currently one of the most challenging
   problems in the field of autonomous mobile robots and providing a
   solution to SLAM may open doors to the world of truly autonomous robots.
   This paper provides a novel approach to Simultaneous Localization and
   Mapping problem based on estimation approach. The new approach is called
   Unscented HybridSLAM filter which addresses the linearization process of
   an autonomous mobile robot utilizing the second order Sterling
   polynomial interpolation specifically used for Unscented HybridSLAM
   algorithm. Using computer simulations, Unscented HybridSLAM and the
   associated theoretical interpolation is examined for a double-loop

Abstract = {{Our research is devoted to developing a methylcellulose (MC) based in

   i-carrageenan and potassium chloride of definite wt\% effectively
   reduces the gel temperature of the virgin MC solution from 60 degrees C
   to 33.5 degrees C which is below physiological temperature. The
   conventional methods like test tube tilting, and viscosity measurements
   are used to determine the gelation temperature while the gels are
   subjected to swelling as well as a gel dissolution study. Subsequently,
   the outcome from in vitro and in vivo studies confirms that the present

Abstract = {{A solid super desiccant was developed based on the concept of
   impregnating a super liquid hygroscopic agent in a superabsorbent
   polymer to take advantage of the vast vapour absorption capacity of the
   hygroscopic agent and the liquid withholding capacity of the
   superabsorbent polymer. The maximum hygroscopic salt loading was
   determined based on different salt concentrations in sodium
   polyacrylate. The newly developed desiccant showed a vapor absorption
   capacity of 276 +/- 20\%, which is superior in comparison to that of
   conventional solid desiccants such as silica gel, activated alumina and
   molecular sieves. Thus they have great potential in applications
   requiring solid desiccants such as desiccant cooling, air conditioning,
   storage of moisture sensitive materials, and dehydration of natural gas.}},

   environment consists of a 180 degree projection screen used to display a

   freedom actuated platform equipped with a dual-belt treadmill and two
   force plates. The goal of this article was to investigate the
   performance characteristics associated with a ``treadmill-motion
   platform{''} configuration and how system operation can affect the data
   collected. Platform static and dynamic characteristics were evaluated by
   translating or rotating the platform over progressively larger distances
   and comparing input and measured values. Treadmill belt speed was
   assessed with and without a person walking on the platform and at
   different orientations. Force plate measurements were examined when the
   treadmill was in operation, during ambulation, and over time to observe
   the baseline drift. Platform acceleration was dependent on the distance
   travelled and system settings. Treadmill speed variability was greatest
   at faster speeds. Force plate measurements were affected by platform and
   treadmill operation, contralateral impact forces during gait, and
   baseline drift. Knowledge of performance characteristics and their
   effect on outcome data is crucial for effective design of CAREN research

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{60}},
Pages = {{48442-48455}},
Abstract = {{This study focuses on the effect of a silicon rubber coating technique
   on the hollow fiber membrane contactor for the purpose of CO2 removal.
   The polymer and the coating agent used were polyetherimide (PEI) and
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) respectively. The hollow fibers were
   fabricated via a simple wet spinning technique. The surfaces of the
   hollow fibers were coated by means of PDMS dissolved in n-hexane
   applying different protocols. An effort was made to keep the silicon
   rubber coating layer porous. The membranes were characterized by
   applying a gas permeation test (GPT) via pure helium, critical entry
   pressure of water (CEPw), contact angle, a gas absorption test and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the observations, the
   coating technique resulted in drastic changes in the contact angle and
   CEPw of the coated membranes for the inside and outside coated hollow
   fiber membranes. Disregarding the method of coating and even the polymer
   concentration, the contact angle was enhanced dramatically. The CO2
   absorption results revealed that by blowing nitrogen (600 kPa) through
   the lumen side of the hollow fibers during the PDMS coating process onto
   the outside surface, the absorption flux of the membranes was increased.
   A slight decrease in the CO2 absorption flux for the other cases was
   outweighed by a substantial enhancement in the membrane wetting
   resistance due to the high contact angle and CEPw. These observations
   showed the high influence of the silicon rubber layer on the CO2 gas
   absorption, which emphasizes the role of this key-parameter in
   controlling the ultimate membrane contactor performance.}},

Title = {{Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of BiOBr/ZnO Heterojunction
   Semiconductors Prepared by Facile Hydrothermal Method}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Hexagonal wurtzite pure ZnO and BiOBr-ZnO composites were synthesized by
   facile hydrothermal method. The amount of BiOBr as dopant was adjusted
   from 5 wt.\% to 75 wt.\%, and correspondingly the morphologies and
   crystal structures of the as-prepared composites were measured and
   discussed. Specifically, according to XRD patterns and SEM images, the
   main crystalline structure of ZnO was not destroyed after doping, but
   growth of ZnO crystals was inhibited by doping BiOBr. Meanwhile, the
   optical properties of the composites were measured by the diffuse
   reflectance spectra (DRS). The band gap of composites was also
   calculated using the classical Tauc equation and it was found to be
   around 3.0 eV. In the test of photocatalytic activation, the ZnO-BiOBr
   photocatalysts exhibited high photocatalytic efficiencies in the
   degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. It was
   ascribed to not only the small size of crystalline, but also the
   reduction in the recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers for
   the enhancement effect of p-n heterojunction. This work sheds light on
   improving the photocatalytic performance by establishing the
   heterojunction and contributes to the development of a commercially
   competitive photocatalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess tunable characteristics that
   allow various modifications to be practiced and suitability for specific
   applications. In this study, zeolitic imidazole framework 8 (ZIF-8) was
   synthesized and subjected to ammonia modification under different
   temperatures and ammonia solution loading. The presence of the N-H group
   observed after the modification indicates the successful modification of
   ZIF-8. The modified ZIF-8 showed notable changes with increased phase
   crystallinity, micropore volume and BET surface area. The unmodified and
   modified ZIF-8s were then dispersed into a polysulfone (PSf) matrix, and
   the MMMs were prepared via dry/wet phase inversion. No apparent
   differences in the membrane's morphology and thermal stability were
   noticed between the neat PSf membrane and the MMMs. The MMMs were
   further subjected to pure CO2 and CH4 gas permeation experiments. CO2
   permeance decreased while CO2/CH4 selectivity increased as a result of
   ZIF-8 modification, due to the decrease in mesopore contribution and the
   increase in micropore contribution to the gas permeation path. The
   affinity of the N-H group in the modified ZIF-8 to CO2 also contributed
   to the increase of CO2 permeance. For example, when the ZIF-8 modified
   in 25 mL ammonia solution at 60 degrees C (Z25c) was dispersed in the
   PSf matrix, the CO2/CH4 selectivity increased to 72\% and CO2
   permeability to 43\% compared to the neat PSf membrane.}},

Abstract = {{Through channels in thin polymer/nanohybrid films have been made by
   irradiating with high energy swift heavy ions (SHI) followed by
   selective chemical etching of the amorphous zone in the latent track
   created by SHI during the bombardment. The average size of the
   nanochannels (30-65 nm) was controlled by varying the fluence of SHI
   along with the nanohybrid preparation of the polymer, by dispersing a
   few percent of two-dimensional nanoclay in the matrix. Grafting was
   applied within the nanochannels through polymerization of conducting
   poly(3-hexyl thiophene) which was further functionalized to make the
   channels ion conducting. Nanoclay alters the crystalline phase to the
   piezoelectric all-trans beta-phase in the nanohybrid whose extent has
   increased further after irradiation, grafting and sulphonation.
   Structural alteration has also been reflected in its thermal behavior
   (similar melting behavior in the pure polymer against the considerably
   higher melting point in the functionalized nanohybrid). The bulk dc
   conductivity of the functionalized membrane increased 13 orders of
   magnitude compared to the unirradiated specimens and activation energies
   also increased for the functionalized hybrid membrane (20 and 32 kJ
   mol(-1) for the functionalized pure polymer and its nanohybrid,
   respectively) suggesting better stability of the functionalized
   membranes at higher temperature. Water uptake and proton conductivities
   of the functionalized hybrid membranes are similar to those of the
   standard Nafion membrane while the higher selectivity parameter along
   with significantly lower methanol permeability of the functionalized
   hybrid membrane strongly suggests that it is a better membrane for fuel
   cell applications. A membrane electrode assembly has been prepared to
   measure the performance of direct methanol fuel cells indicating a
   significantly higher value of power density of the developed
   functionalized hybrid membranes.}},

Abstract = {{We present here our results on using liquid crystals in experiments with
   nonclassical light sources: (1) single-photon sources exhibiting
   antibunching (separation of all photons in time), which are key
   components for secure quantum communication systems, and (2) entangled
   photon source with photons exhibiting quantum interference in a
   Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. In the first part, cholesteric liquid
   crystal hosts were used to create definite circular polarization of
   antibunched photons emitted by nanocrystal quantum dots. If the photon
   has unknown polarization, filtering it through a polarizer to produce
   the desired polarization for quantum key distribution with bits based on
   polarization states of photons will reduce by half the efficiency of a
   quantum cryptography system. In the first part, we also provide our
   results on observation of a circular polarized microcavity resonance in
   nanocrystal quantum dot fluorescence in a 1-D chiral photonic bandgap
   cholesteric liquid crystal microcavity. In the second part of this paper
   with indistinguishable, time-entangled photons, we demonstrate our
   experimental results on simulating quantum-mechanical barrier tunnelling
   phenomena. A Hong-Ou-Mandel dip (quantum interference effect) is shifted
   when a phase change was introduced on the way of one of entangled
   photons in pair (one arm of the interferometer) by inserting in this arm
   an electrically controlled planar-aligned nematic liquid crystal layer
   between two prisms in the conditions close to a frustrated total
   internal reflection. By applying different AC-voltages to the
   planar-aligned nematic layer and changing its refractive index, we can
   obtain various conditions for incident photon propagation - from total
   reflection to total transmission. Measuring changes of tunnelling times
   of photon through this structure with femtosecond resolution permitted
   us to answer some unresolved questions in quantum-mechanical barrier
   tunnelling phenomena.}},

Title = {{Synthesis, Analysis, and Testing of BiOBr-Bi2WO6 Photocatalytic
   Heterojunction Semiconductors}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{In photocatalysis, the recombination of electron-hole pairs is generally
   regarded as one of its most serious drawbacks. The synthesis of various
   composites with heterojunction structures has increasingly shed light on
   preventing this recombination. In this work, a BiOBr-Bi2WO6
   photocatalytic heterojunction semiconductor was synthesized by the
   facile hydrothermal method and applied in the photocatalytic degradation
   process. It was determined that both reaction time and temperature
   significantly affected the crystal structure and morphologies of the
   photocatalysts. BiOBr (50 at\%)-Bi2WO6 composites were prepared under
   optimum synthesis conditions (120 degrees C for 6 h) and by
   theoretically analyzing theDRS results, itwas determined that they
   possessed the suitable band gap (2.61 eV) to be stimulated by
   visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic activities of the
   as-prepared photocatalysts were evaluated by the degradation of
   Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. The experimental
   conditions, including initial concentration, pH, and catalyst dosage,
   were explored and the photocatalysts in this system were proven stable
   enough to be reused for several runs. Moreover, the interpreted
   mechanism of the heterojunction enhancement effect proved that the
   synthesis of a heterojunction structure provided an effective method to
   decrease the recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs, thereby
   improving the photocatalytic activity.}},

Abstract = {{The wide spread of sensor networks enforces the need to provide a new
   technology that supports the emerging characteristics of sensors. This
   has geared IEEE 802.15.4 standards committee toward working on the
   physical and data link layers in cooperation with ZigBee Alliance that
   has worked on the network and application layers. The new cooperation,
   named ZigBee, considers sensors characteristics in the full design.
   Numerous home applications are guiding the need for communication
   protocols supporting the new emergent characteristics of Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSN), which demand ultra low rate, low power consumption and
   low cost. ZigBee operates in the license-free 2.4 GHz Industrial,
   Scientific and Medical (ISM) band that is used by many other standards
   such as, Bluetooth IEEE 802.15.1, and WLAN IEEE 802.13 b.
   This paper proposes two smart schemes that enable the communication in
   environments with ZigBee and WLAN devices in order to achieve higher
   delivery ratios while maintaining acceptable end-to-end delay values.
   The proposed schemes carryout essential predictions to achieve fairness
   among ZigBee and WLAN transmissions, therefore, attain better load
   balancing among devices of different networks. Simulation results show
   that the proposed smart and opportunistic schemes increase the packet
   delivery ratio of ZigBee devices for different scenarios. In addition,
   the proposed schemes enhance the performance of WLAN devices by
   increasing the packet delivery ratio, while maintaining an acceptable
   level of end to end delay values.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of multiple sensors into active radio frequency
   identification (RFID) system is a technology trend. Currently, sensing
   RFID (SRFID) systems face a number of challenges including description
   of characteristics of nonsmart sensors, management of sensor-related

   objective is to improve interoperability and compatibility of the
   sensing RFID system with off-the-shelf active RFID readers or novel
   sensing RFID open-loop systems in the future. This paper also proposes a
   data table storage mode for management of sensor-related data, in the
   system based on virtual TEDS. The paper analyses the operational
   mechanism and procedure of the sensor-sampling system that is equipped
   with these two proposed techniques. Several experiments were carried out

Abstract = {{Asymmetric mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) were synthesized by
   incorporating zeolitic imidazole framework 8 (ZIF-8) into polysulfone
   (PSf) polymer matrix for CO2/CH4 separation. ZIF-8 was synthesized in
   aqueous media at room temperature with a base-type additive,
   triethylamine (TEA). The prepared ZIF-8 shows high crystallinity with a
   surface area of 1032 m(2) g(-1) and a particle size of similar to 133
   nm. MMMs were then prepared by incorporating the synthesized ZIF-8 up to
   10 wt\% (total solids) into PSf via a dry/wet phase inversion. The
   prepared MMMs exhibit significant improvement in thermal and mechanical
   stability even at a filler loading as low as 0.25 wt\%. Uniform
   dispersion of ZIF-8 throughout the PSf matrix was evident via SEM, up to
   1 wt\% filler loading. The permeation behavior of MMMs varies with the
   ZIF-8 loading; i.e. insignificant change was observed at the low filler
   loading (0.25 wt\%), while severe performance deterioration occurred at
   high filler loading (10 wt\%). At an optimal ZIF-8 loading of 0.5 wt\%,
   CO2 permeance was enhanced by 37\% and CO2/CH4 selectivity was also
   enhanced by 19\% as compared to that of neat PSf membrane.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the problem of image completion where the
   goal is to fill large missing parts (holes) in an image, video or a
   scene in a visually-plausible and a computationally-efficient manner.
   Recently the literature on hole filling was dominated by exemplar-based
   (patch-based) filling techniques with a two-stage unified pipeline that
   starts by building a bag of significant patches (BoSP), and then uses
   that bag to fill the hole. In this paper, we propose a new framework
   which addresses the inherent limitations of the state-of-the-art
   techniques. Our method capitalizes on a newly-developed technique for
   image skimming, followed by a novel procedure to propagate the
   constructed skim to within the hole. Experimental results show that our
   method compares favourably with the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we are concerned with unsupervised natural image matting.
   Due to the under-constrained nature of the problem, image matting
   algorithms are usually provided with user interactions, such as
   scribbles or trimaps. This is a very tedious task and may even become
   impractical for some applications. For unsupervised matte calculation,
   we can either adopt a technique that supports an unsupervised mode for
   alpha map calculation, or we may automate the process of acquiring user
   interactions provided for a matting algorithm. Our proposed technique
   contributes to both approaches and is based on spectral matting. The
   latter is the only technique in the literature that supports automatic
   matting but it suffers from critical limitations among which is the
   unreliable unsupervised operation. Stressing on that drawback, spectral
   matting may produce erroneous mattes in the absence of guiding scribbles
   or trimaps. Using the Gestalt laws of grouping, we propose a method that
   automatically produces more truthful mattes than spectral matting. In
   addition, it can be used to generate trimaps, eliminating the required
   user interactions and making it possible to harness the powers of
   matting techniques that are better than spectral matting but don't
   support unsupervised operation.The main contribution of this research is
   the introduction of the Gestalt laws of grouping to the matting problem.}},

Abstract = {{In a wireless sensor network, concealing the location privacy of the
   sink is critical. Location of the sink can be revealed (or at least
   guessed with a high probability of success) through traffic analysis. In
   this paper, we propose a Sink Privacy Protection (SPP) scheme that is
   capable of defending sink's location privacy and identity when the
   network is subjected to traffic analysis attack. SPP designs the
   network's area of coverage multiple spots generating traffic that
   resembles the traffic behavior that is expected to be observed in the
   area where the sink is located. To achieve this we select some sensors
   away from the actual sink to act as sink's neighbors by generating dummy
   messages. Performance evaluation results prove that SPP can reduce
   energy cost while protecting sink's location privacy.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid has modernized the way electricity is generated, transported,
   distributed, and consumed by integrating advanced sensing,
   communications, and control in the day-to-day operation of the grid.
   Electricity is a core utility for the functioning of society and for the
   services provided by information and communication technologies (ICTs).
   Several concepts of the smart grid, such as dynamic pricing, distributed
   generation, and demand management, have significantly impacted the
   operation of ICT services, in particular, communication networks and
   data centers. Ongoing energy-efficiency and operational expenditures
   reduction efforts in communication networks and data centers have gained
   another dimension with those smart grid concepts. In this paper, we
   provide a comprehensive survey on the smart grid-driven approaches in
   energy-efficient communications and data centers, and the interaction
   between smart grid and information and communication infrastructures.
   Although the studies on smart grid, energy-efficient communications, and
   green data centers have been separately surveyed in previous studies, to
   this end, research that falls in the intersection of those fields has
   not been properly classified and surveyed yet. We start our survey by
   providing background information on the smart grid and continue with
   surveying smart grid-driven approaches in energy-efficient communication
   systems, followed by energy, cost and emission minimizing approaches in
   data centers, and the corresponding cloud network infrastructure. We
   discuss the open issues in smart grid-driven approaches in ICTs and
   point some important research directions such as the distributed
   renewable energy generation capability-coupled communication
   infrastructures, optimum energy-efficient network design for the smart
   grid environment, the impact of green communication techniques on the
   reliability and latency requirements of smart grid data, workload
   consolidation with smart grid-awareness, and many more.}},

Pages = {{2641-2650}},
Abstract = {{Cathodic electrodeposition is a bottom up process that is emerging as a
   simple yet efficient strategy to engineer thin polymeric films with
   well-defined physicochemical properties. In particular, this technique
   offers the distinctive advantage of an easy control over composition,
   thickness, and morphology of the films by simply adjusting treatment
   parameters. In this work, cathodic electrodeposition was exploited to
   engender blends composed by chitosan (CH) and poly-ethylene-oxide (PEO)
   with different weight ratios. The physicochemical and nanomechanical
   properties of the resulting films were successively characterized by
   integrating Raman and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
   with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Our findings demonstrate that
   electro-deposition is an effective technique for the co-deposition of
   CH:PEO blends. Moreover, spectroscopic and AFM analyses correlated the
   physicochemical (i.e. structural organization, bond formation and
   cross-linking) and nanomechanical properties of the blends to the PEO
   content, ultimately unveiling the molecular interactions and mechanisms
   involved in the cathodic deposition of CH:PEO films.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique to generate a frequency-doubled millimeter-wave (mm-W)
   vector signal that is immune to fiber chromatic-dispersion-induced power
   fading and free from inter-band beating interferences (IBBIs) based on a
   bi-directional use of a polarization modulator (PolM) in a Sagnac loop
   is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The fundamental concept of
   the proposed approach is to use a PolM that is incorporated in a Sagnac
   loop at which a light wave is modulated by an intermediate-frequency
   vector signal along one direction and with no modulation along the
   opposite direction due to the traveling-wave nature of the PolM. The
   combination of the modulated and un-modulated signals at a photodetector
   will generate an mm-W signal that is immune to the fiber
   chromatic-dispersion-induced power fading and free from the IBBIs. The
   generation of a 100 and a 500 MSym/s 16-QAM signal at 31.5 GHz and the
   transmission of the signals over a 25-km single-mode fiber are
   evaluated. An error-free transmission of the 100 MSym/s signal and the
   transmission of the 500 MSym/s signal with a bit-error-rate below the
   forward error correction threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3) are achieved.}},

Pages = {{555-587}},
Abstract = {{The flow around a wall-mounted square cylinder of side d is investigated
   by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS). The effect of inflow
   conditions is assessed by considering two different cases with matching
   momentum-thickness Reynolds numbers Re-theta similar or equal to 1000 at
   the obstacle: the first case is a fullyturbulent zero pressure gradient
   boundary layer, and the second one is a laminar boundary layer with
   prescribed Blasius inflow profile further upstream. An auxiliary
   simulation carried out with the pseudo-spectral Fourier-Chebyshev code
   SIMSON is used to obtain the turbulent time-dependent inflow conditions
   which are then fed into the main simulation where the actual flow around
   the cylinder is computed. This main simulation is performed, for both
   laminar and turbulent-inflows, with the spectral-element method code
   Nek5000. In both cases the wake is completely turbulent, and we find the
   same Strouhal number St similar or equal to 0.1, although the two wakes
   exhibit structural differences for x > 3d downstream of the cylinder.
   Transition to turbulence is observed in the laminar-inflow case, induced
   by the recirculation bubble produced upstream of the obstacle, and in
   the turbulent-inflow simulation the streamwise fluctuations modulate the
   horseshoe vortex. The wake obtained in our laminar-inflow case is in
   closer agreement with reference particle image velocimetry measurements
   of the same geometry, revealing that the experimental boundary layer was
   not fully turbulent in that dataset, and highlighting the usefulness of
   DNS to assess the quality of experimental inflow conditions.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{27594-27602}},
Abstract = {{Sulfonated poly(ether imide) (SPEI) and charged surface modifying
   macromolecules (cSMM) were synthesized, characterized and blended into
   the casting solution of poly (ether imide) (PEI) with different
   compositions to develop surface modified ultra-filtration (UF) membranes
   by means of improved hydrophilicity. The membranes were prepared by a
   phase inversion technique and subjected to characterization experiments
   such as water permeation tests, equilibrium water content (WC), membrane
   hydraulic resistance (R-m) and protein rejection. Among others, a blend
   membrane containing 20 wt\% SPEI and 5 wt\% cSMM in PEI (called M12)
   exhibited the highest water permeation (440.6 L m(-2) h(-1) at 345 kPa),
   highest WC (86.3\%) and lowest R-m (0.7 kPa/L m(-2) h(-1)). The M12
   membrane also exhibited the highest fluxes of 364.1 L m(-2) h(-1) and
   230.3 L m(-2) h(-1) (at 345 kPa) with rejections of 31.3\% and 62.1\%,
   respectively, when the feed was aqueous trypsin and bovine serum albumin
   solution (1000 ppm). The difference in contact angle between the top and
   bottom surface confirmed surface migration of cSMM to the membrane top
   surface. SEM, AFM and tensile strength measurement revealed that the
   surface became more porous and rougher, and the mechanical strength was
   lowered by the blending of SPEI and addition of cSMM. That the M12
   membrane achieved a lower internal fouling of 6\% and 3.8\% and higher
   flux recovery ratio (FRR) of 94\% and 96.2\% after UF of trypsin and
   bovine serum albumin solution explained its better antifouling
   properties as compared to a pristine PEI membrane.}},

Title = {{Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo Simulations, and Langevin Dynamics: A
   Computational Review}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Macromolecular structures, such as neuraminidases, hemagglutinins, and
   monoclonal antibodies, are not rigid entities. Rather, they are
   characterised by their flexibility, which is the result of the
   interaction and collective motion of their constituent atoms. This
   conformational diversity has a significant impact on their
   physicochemical and biological properties. Among these are their
   structural stability, the transport of ions through the M2 channel, drug
   resistance, macromolecular docking, binding energy, and rational epitope
   design. To assess these properties and to calculate the associated
   thermodynamical observables, the conformational space must be
   efficiently sampled and the dynamic of the constituent atoms must be
   simulated. This paper presents algorithms and techniques that address
   the abovementioned issues. To this end, a computational review of
   molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, Langevin dynamics, and free
   energy calculation is presented. The exposition is made from first
   principles to promote a better understanding of the potentialities,
   limitations, applications, and interrelations of these computational
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Digital cameras capture images through different Color Filter Arrays and
   then reconstruct the full color image. Each CFA pixel only captures one
   primary color component; the other primary components will be estimated
   using information from neighboring pixels. During the demosaicking
   algorithm, the two unknown color components will be estimated at each
   pixel location. Most of the demosaicking algorithms use the RGB Bayer
   CFA pattern with Red, Green and Blue filters. The least-Squares
   Luma-Chroma demultiplexing method is a state of the art demosaicking
   method for the Bayer CFA. In this paper we develop a new demosaicking
   algorithm using the Kodak-RGBW CFA. This particular CFA reduces noise
   and improves the quality of the reconstructed images by adding white
   pixels. We have applied non-adaptive and adaptive demosaicking method
   using the Kodak-RGBW CFA on the standard Kodak image dataset and the
   results have been compared with previous work.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of strength-based optimum signal
   detection model has been presented for concentration-encoded molecular
   communication (CEMC) with spike (i.e., impulsive) transmission based on
   amplitude-shift keying (ASK) and on-off keying (OOK) modulations.
   Strength-based optimum signal detection problem in diffusion-based CEMC
   system has been investigated in detail in the presence of both diffusion
   noise and intersymbol interference (ISI). The receiver for optimum
   signal detection has been developed theoretically and explained with
   both analytical and simulation results of binary signal detection.
   Results show that the receiver thus developed can detect CEMC symbols
   effectively; however, the performance is influenced by three main
   factors, namely, communication range, transmission data rate, and
   receiver memory. For both ASK and OOK receivers, exact and approximate
   detection performances have been derived analytically depending on the
   probabilistic nature of molecular availability and the relationship
   between mean and variance of signal strengths. Correspondingly, bit
   error rate (BER) performance of the optimum receiver in a single CEMC
   link is further evaluated under various scenarios through extensive
   simulation experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a data-driven Iterative Reference Input Tuning
   (IRIT) algorithm that solves a reference trajectory tracking problem
   viewed as an optimization problem subjected to control signal saturation
   constraints and to control signal rate constraints. The IRIT algorithm
   incorporates an experiment-based stochastic search algorithm formulated
   in an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) framework in order to combine the
   advantages of model-free data-driven control and of ILC. The reference
   input vector's dimensionality is reduced by a linear parameterization.
   Two neural networks (NNs) trained in an ILC framework are employed to
   ensure a small number of experiments in the gradient estimation. The
   IRIT algorithm is validated by two case studies concerning the position
   control of a nonlinear aerodynamic system. The results prove that the
   IRIT algorithm offers the significant control system performance
   improvement by few iterations and experiments conducted on the
   real-world process. The paper successfully merges the use of ILC in both
   model-free reference input tuning and NN training.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new type of thin film nanocomposite (TFN) reverse
   osmosis (RO) membranes was prepared by incorporating different amounts
   of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) into the polyamide (PA) selective layer
   via in situ interfacial polymerization. The effect of HNTs incorporation
   into the PA selective layer on the surface morphology, separation
   performance and antifouling properties of the membranes were thoroughly
   investigated and discussed. The presence of HNTs in PA layer was
   verified using EDX, XRD and FTIR analysis. The ``leaf-like{''} outgrowth
   morphology of PA layer was observed using FESEM. Upon addition of HNTs,
   the hydrophilicity, surface roughness and water flux of TFN membranes
   have all increased. The water flux enhancement can be ascribed to higher
   hydrophilicity and additional water pathways through porous HNTs in TFN
   membranes. It is noteworthy that the TFN membrane that was embedded with
   0.05 wt/v\% HNTs (labeled as TFN0.05) could exhibit water flux as high
   as 36 L m(-2) h(-1) (at 15 bar gauge) with NaCl rejection maintained at
   95.6\%. In comparison to the control thin film composite (TFC) membrane,
   the water flux of TFN0.05 membrane was 90\% higher. Although further
   increase in HNTs loading to 0.1 wt/v\% could result in greater water
   flux, its RO performance was compromised by a significant decrease in
   NaCl rejection. Besides offering greater water flux, the TFN0.05
   membrane also showed better antifouling affinity than HNTs-free TFC
   membrane. It is most probably due to the increase in hydrophilicity as
   well as surface negative charge upon addition of HNTs. Based on the
   results obtained in this work, it can be concluded that incorporating an
   appropriate amount of HNTs into PA rejection layer could potentially
   improve the performance of TFC membrane during RO applications.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophobic montmorillonite (MMT)-filled polyvinylideneflouride (PVDF)
   hollow fiber mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were fabricated by means of
   wet phase inversion method to meet the requirements of stripping process
   via membrane contactor at elevated absorbent temperatures. The effects
   of MMT incorporation into polymer matrix in different loadings (1, 3, 5
   wt\% of polymer) on the membrane properties and CO2 stripping flux and
   efficiency were investigated. The incorporation affected the phase
   inversion process and accelerated the exchange rate of
   solvent/coagulant, resulting in formation of membranes with longer
   finger-like pores and higher surface porosity. In addition, the MMMs
   exhibited higher contact angle and wetting resistance than plain
   membrane. As a result, physical CO2 stripping flux from water and
   process efficiency became significantly higher than the plain PVDF
   hollow fiber with maximum achieved when 5 wt\% MMT (coded as M5) was
   embedded in the polymer. The highest stripping flux of 4.19 x 10(-3) mol
   m(-2) s(-1) was achieved by M5 at the tested temperature of 27 degrees C
   and the liquid velocity of 2.8 m s(-1), which was 38\% higher than the
   plain PVDF hollow fiber at the same operating conditions. A significant
   stripping performance enhancement was also observed by increasing the
   temperature of CO2 rich liquid from 27 to 45 and 80 degrees C. These
   results suggest that the impregnation of polymeric membranes by
   inorganic hydrophobic clay particles can be an effective method to
   improve the morphology and performance of PVDF hollow fibers in CO2
   stripping via gas-liquid membrane contactor.}},

Abstract = {{With the popularity of mobile social applications, the requirements of
   rapid and energy efficient become the great challenges for neighbor
   discovery protocols. In mobile social applications, mobile nodes usually
   play different roles (active and passive). This relationship between
   mobile nodes is a characteristic in neighbor discovery problem. In the
   daily life, the start time and duration of a neighbor detection are
   determined by the node which launches the application. In other words,
   the neighbor discovery will occur suddenly at any time in the network.
   So timelimit is another characteristic in neighbor discovery. This paper
   proposes a new neighbor discovery protocol called ERUPT that takes two
   characteristics above into account. In the ERUPT protocol, the mobile
   nodes which launch applications in the network are named sponsor nodes,
   and those nodes that participate applications following the sponsor
   nodes are named participant nodes. The core idea of ERUPT neighbor
   discovery protocol depends on the common phenomenon that the sponsor
   nodes will spend more energy to invite more participant nodes into
   applications as soon as possible. More efficient of discovering
   neighbors for the sponsor nodes than existing approaches is validated by
   the theoretical analysis and simulation in this paper. We evaluate the
   ERUPT protocol through NS2 network simulator, and show almost 26\% -
   30\% improvement in discovery latency while at almost the same energy
   consumption over existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The inefficiency of one-to-one matching of user requirements to a single
   service has given rise to service composition. Service composition
   allows simple services to be dynamically combined into more complex
   services. In mobile environments, service discovery and integration
   involves cooperation between various service nodes where reliance on a
   centralized service registry introduces efficiency and single point of
   failure problems. Plan-and workflow-based composition solutions restrict
   service discovery to defined abstract models. Semantic similarity
   measurements play an important role in service integration. In this
   paper we introduce a semantic similarity and semantic nearness service
   composition method. The objective of our work is to free service nodes
   from adherence to restrictive composition plans. Our work also enables
   compositions to succeed in dynamic environments through a decentralized
   solution even when nodes are unaware of nearby service nodes. This paper
   presents a service composition solution that semantically advances
   composition paths towards users' needs with each service hop while
   guaranteeing a user-acceptable QoS level. Simulation results showcase
   the effectiveness of the presented solution and its compatibility with
   underlying service discovery methods.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of banana stem fiber (BSF) as a low cost biosorbent for
   Hg(II) removal was studied. HCl treatment increased the cellulose
   accessibility which led to an enhanced interaction of Hg(II) and BSF.
   Activation of BSF-HCl in vacuo at 373 K increased the maximum
   biosorption capacity from 28 to 372 mg g(-1) and altered the activation
   energy from 3.5 to 76.9 kJ mol(-1) showing an increase in Hg(II)
   chemisorption. FTIR and ESR results confirmed the large amount of
   structural defects on the activated BSF-HCl which led to the increase in
   Hg(II) uptake. Batch biosorption models showed that the kinetics follow
   pseudo-second-order and the equilibrium uptake fitted to all
   three-parameter models showing the Hg(II) biosorption behaves as a
   Langmuir isotherm. The non-linear regression method exhibited higher
   coefficient of determination values for isotherm and kinetic analyses
   compared to the linear method. The thermodynamic functions indicated
   that the nature of Hg(II) biosorption is an exothermic and
   non-spontaneous process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the potential of a novel flat sheet nanocomposite
   titanium dioxide (TiO2)-halloysite nanotubes (HNTs)/polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) membrane as a photocatalytic separator in the
   photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR). The photocatalytic nanocomposite
   membrane acted the roles of both degradation and separation for bilge
   water. Both TiO2-HNTs photocatalyst and photocatalytic nanocomposite
   membranes were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) combined energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The hydrocarbon degradation and
   removal efficiency of the PMR was evaluated by gas chromatography mass
   spectroscopy (GC-MS). It was found that 99.9\% of hydrocarbons were
   removed by the PMR within 8 h, which is likely due to uniform
   distribution and high effectiveness of the TiO2-HNTs photocatalyst in
   the PVDF polymer matrix. The TiO2 leaching from the nanocomposite
   membrane during the membrane permeation was analyzed using flame atomic
   adsorption spectrophotometer (AAS), which recorded 1.0 ppb of TiO2

Abstract = {{Few studies have paid close attention to a regional (provincial scale)
   healthcare waste management, particularly in Iran. An inventory of all
   58 healthcare facilities in the province of Isfahan was performed and
   the results were analyzed using statistical procedures. The results
   indicated that 36.2, 4.6, and 59.2 \% of total wastes produced were
   infectious, sharp, and general wastes, respectively. Only 20.7 \% of
   medical centers had designated collection vehicles. As for the treatment
   of medical wastes, only 6.9 \% of centers were equipped with autoclave.
   In terms of tonnage about 10 \% of infectious and sharp wastes were
   treated by incinerators. Collected wastes from 70.7 \% of facilities
   were landfilled in separate trenches, while collected wastes from the
   remaining 29.3 \% centers were disposed together (mixed) with the
   municipal wastes at the same landfill trenches. The waste generation
   rates for total waste, general waste, infectious, and sharp wastes were
   3.03, 1.84, 0.75, and 0.17 kg/active bed/day, respectively. The main
   drawbacks of the existing waste management system are the lack of any
   program for waste minimization, commingling of hazardous and
   non-hazardous portions of wastes generated at healthcare centers, and
   the lack of resources (appropriate treatment equipment such as
   autoclaves and incinerators) and trained personnel.}},

Abstract = {{The present work investigates the structure of fast supersonic turbulent
   flames typically observed as precursors to the onset of detonation.
   These high speed deflagrations are obtained after the interaction of a
   detonation wave with cylindrical obstacles. Two mixtures having the same
   propensity for local hot spot formation were considered, namely
   hydrogen-oxygen and methane-oxygen. It was shown that the methane
   mixture sustained turbulent fast flames, while the hydrogen mixture did
   not. Detailed high speed visualizations of nearly two-dimensional flow
   fields permitted to identify the key mechanism involved. It was found
   that the shock reflections in methane permitted to drive strong jets
   behind periodically formed Mach shocks on the front of the deflagration.
   These provided local enhancement of the reactivity through mixing,
   conducive to new hot spot formation. The hot spot formation forward
   sustained the shock reflection processes conducive to further jetting
   action. The subsequent organization of the front in stronger fewer modes
   eventually lead to the transition to detonation. In the hydrogen system,
   for similar thermo-chemical parameters, the absence of these jets did
   not permit to establish such fast flames. This jetting slip line
   instability in shock reflections (and lack thereof in hydrogen) was
   correlated with the value of the isentropic exponent and its control of
   Mach shock jetting (Mach \& Radulescu, PROCI, 2011). (C) 2014 Published

Abstract = {{A coherent review on the advanced proton exchange membranes (PEMs) for
   direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) application and the future direction in
   the development of a high performance polymeric membrane for DMFC were
   discussed in this paper. PEMs have a profound influence on performance
   of DMFC. The PEMs are categorized into five groups which are partially
   fluorinated, perfluorinated ionomers, acid-base complexes,
   non-fluorinated ionomers, hydro carbon and aromatic polymers. Many
   researchers have investigated the functionalization methods on the PEMs
   to solve methanol crossover problem while obtaining low electronic
   conductivity, high proton conductivity, low electro osmotic drag
   coefficient, high mechanical properties and good chemical and thermal
   stability. Including in this review, fabrication of PEM using
   electrospinning process coupled with the promising functionalized
   polymeric materials which were known to be the most important
   initiatives at present in order to further expand the full potential of
   DMFC performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The charged surface modifying macromolecule (cSMM) was blended into the
   casting solution of poly(ether imide) (PEI) to prepare surface modified
   ultrafiltration membranes by phase inversion technique. The separation
   of proteins including bovine serum albumin, egg albumin, pepsin and
   trypsin was investigated by the fabricated membranes. On increasing cSMM
   content, solute rejection decreases whereas membrane flux increases. The
   pore size and surface porosity of the 5 wt\% cSMM blend PEI membranes
   increases to 41.4 A and 14.8\%, respectively. Similarly, the molecular
   weight cut-off of the membranes ranged from 20 to 45 kDa, depending on
   the various compositions of the prepared membranes. The toxic heavy
   metal ions Cu(II), Cr(III), Zn(II) and Pb(II) from aqueous solutions
   were subjected to rejection by the prepared blended membrane with
   various concentration of polyethyleneimine (PETIM) as water soluble
   polymeric ligand. It was found that the rejection behavior of metal ion
   depends on the PETIM concentration and the stability complexation of
   metal ion with ligand. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{According to the geometric relational expression of binocular
   stereopsis, for a given viewing distance the magnitude of the perceived
   depth of objects would be the same, as long as the disparity magnitudes
   were the same. However, we found that this is not necessarily the case
   for random-dot stereograms that depict parallel, overlapping,
   transparent stereoscopic surfaces (POTS). The data from five experiments
   indicated that (1) the magnitude of perceived depth between the two
   outer surfaces of a three- or a four-POTS configuration can be smaller
   than that for an identical pair of stereo surfaces of a two-POTS
   configuration for the range of disparities that we used (5.2-19.4
   arcmin); (2) this phenomenon can be observed irrespective of the total
   dot density of a POTS configuration, at least for the range that we used
   (1.1-3.3 dots/deg(2)); and (3) the magnitude of perceived depth between
   the two outer surfaces of a POTS configuration can be reduced as the
   total number of stereo surfaces is increased, up to four surfaces. We
   explained these results in terms of a higher-order process or processes,
   with an output representing perceived depth magnitude, which is weakened
   when the number of its surfaces is increased.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of osseous structures from clinical MR images is difficult
   due to acquisition artifacts and variable signal intensity of bones.
   Segmentation of femoral head is required for evaluation of hip joint
   abnormalities such as cam- type femoroacetabular impingement. A
   parametric deformable model (PDM) framework was developed for
   segmentation of 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images of the hip.
   A two-phase segmentation scheme was implemented: (i) Radial basis
   function interpolation was performed for semi-automatic piecewise
   registration of a proximal femur atlas model to an MRI scan region of
   interest. User-defined control points on the mesh model were registered
   to the corresponding landmarks on the image. (ii) An active PDM was then
   used for coarse-to-fine level segmentation. The segmentation technique
   was tested using 3D synthetic image data and clinical MR scans of the
   hip with varying resolution.
   The segmentation method provided a mean target overlap of 0.95 and
   misclassification error of 0.035 for the synthetic data. The average
   target overlap was 0.88, and misclassification error rate was 0.12 for

   A framework for segmentation of proximal femur in hip MRI scans was
   developed and tested. This method is robust to artifacts and intensity
   inhomogeneity and resistant to leakage into adjacent tissues. In
   comparison with slicewise segmentation techniques, this method features
   inter-slice consistency, which results in a smooth model of the proximal

Abstract = {{Microfluidic interconnects act as bridges to connect microscopic
   channels with macroscopic environments, enabling the microfluidic device
   to perform its designed functions. In this study, we report a new method
   to prepare a reliable PDMS interconnect that is able to handle high
   throughput applications and can be easily incorporated into PDMS
   microfluidic devices. Using a regular glass plate as an assisting
   component, we prepare a reliable PDMS interconnect that establishes a
   strong connection between PDMS surface and an externally inserted
   stainless steel tubing coupler by using oxygen plasma and epoxy
   adhesives. In characterizing the resulting PDMS interconnect, we
   demonstrate that this new PDMS interconnect shows outstanding
   performances, withstanding flow pressures up to 1.8 MPa in leak-proof
   tests and pull-out forces up to 100 N, both of which are much higher
   than previously reported values for PDMS interconnects. In addition, we
   show that this new epoxy-assisted interconnect is free of contamination
   and clogging, which results in a highly reproducible fabrication process
   to prepare a reliable PDMS interconnects. Taken together, we believe
   that the outstanding performances of the new PDMS interconnect make it a
   promising candidate for both high throughput and multi-inlet/outlet PDMS
   microfluidic system applications.}},

Abstract = {{Botnets have become major engines for malicious activities in cyberspace
   nowadays. To sustain their botnets and disguise their malicious actions,
   botnet owners are mimicking legitimate cyber behavior to fly under the
   radar. This poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection. In this
   paper, we use web browsing on popular web sites as an example to tackle
   this problem. First of all, we establish a semi-Markov model for
   browsing behavior. Based on this model, we find that it is impossible to
   detect mimicking attacks based on statistics if the number of active
   bots of the attacking botnet is sufficiently large (no less than the
   number of active legitimate users). However, we also find it is hard for
   botnet owners to satisfy the condition to carry out a mimicking attack
   most of the time. With this new finding, we conclude that mimicking
   attacks can be discriminated from genuine flash crowds using second
   order statistical metrics. We define a new fine correntropy metrics and
   show its effectiveness compared to others. Our real world data set
   experiments and simulations confirm our theoretical claims. Furthermore,
   the findings can be widely applied to similar situations in other
   research fields.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A k-queue layout of a graph consists of a total order of the vertices,
   and a partition of the edges into k sets such that no two edges that are
   in the same set are nested with respect to the vertex ordering. A
   k-track layout of a graph consists of a vertex k-colouring, and a total
   order of each vertex colour class, such that between each pair of colour
   classes no two edges cross. The queue-number (track-number) of a graph
   G, is the minimum k such that G has a k-queue (k-track) layout. This
   paper proves that every n-vertex planar graph has track number and queue
   number at most O(log n). This improves the result of Di Battista, Frati,
   and Pach (2013) {[}5] who proved the first sub-polynomial bounds on the
   queue number and track number of planar graphs. Specifically, they
   obtained O(log(2) n) queue number and O(log(8) n) track number bounds
   for planar graphs.
   The result also implies that every planar graph has a 3D crossing-free
   grid drawing in O(n log n) volume. The proof uses a non-standard type of
   graph separators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel gas and liquid flow rate measurement method is proposed for use
   in vertical upward and downward gas-liquid pipe flows. This method is
   based on the analysis of the time history of area-averaged void fraction
   that is measured using a conductivity wire-mesh sensor (WMS). WMS
   measurements were collected in vertical upward and downward air-water
   flows in a pipe with an internal diameter of 32.5 mm at nearly
   atmospheric pressure. The relative frequencies and the power spectral
   density of area-averaged void fraction were calculated and used as
   representative properties. Independent features, extracted from these
   properties using Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component
   Analysis, were used as inputs to artificial neural networks, which were
   trained to give the gas and liquid flow rates as outputs. The present
   method was shown to be accurate for all four encountered flow regimes
   and for a wide range of flow conditions. Besides providing accurate
   predictions for steady flows, the method was also tested successfully in
   three flows with transient liquid flow rates. The method was augmented
   by the use of the cross-correlation function of area-averaged void
   fraction determined from the output of a dual WMS unit as an additional
   representative property, which was found to improve the accuracy of flow
   rate prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Video streaming over best-effort networks, such as the Internet, is now
   a significant application used by most Internet users. However,
   best-effort networks are characterized by dynamic and unpredictable
   changes in the available bandwidth, which adversely affect the quality
   of video. As such, it is important to have real-time detection
   mechanisms of bandwidth changes to ensure that video is adapted to the
   available bandwidth and transmitted at the highest quality. In this
   paper, we propose a Bayesian instantaneous end-to-end bandwidth change
   prediction model and method to detect and predict one-way bandwidth
   changes at the receiver. Unlike existing congestion detection
   mechanisms, which use network parameters such as packet loss
   probability, round trip time (RTT), or jitter, our approach uses
   weighted interarrival time of video packets at the receiver side.
   Furthermore, our approach is continuous, since it measures available
   bandwidth changes with each incoming video packet, and therefore detects
   congestion occurrence in <200 ms, on average, which is significantly
   faster than existing approaches. In addition, it is a one-way scheme,
   since it only takes into account the characteristics of the incoming
   path and not the outgoing path, as opposed to other approaches, which
   use RTT and are hence less accurate. In this paper, we provide extensive
   experimental simulations and real-world network implementation. Our
   results indicate that the proposed detection method is superior to
   existing solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Class imbalance is a crucial problem in machine learning and occurs in
   many domains. Specifically, the two-class problem has received interest
   from researchers in recent years, leading to solutions for oil spill
   detection, tumour discovery and fraudulent credit card detection,
   amongst others. However, handling class imbalance in datasets that
   contains multiple classes, with varying degree of imbalance, has
   received limited attention. In such a multi-class imbalanced dataset,
   the classification model tends to favour the majority classes and
   incorrectly classify instances from the minority classes as belonging to
   the majority classes, leading to poor predictive accuracies. Further,
   there is a need to handle both the imbalances between classes as well as
   address the selection of examples within a class (i.e. the so-called
   within class imbalance). In this paper, we propose the SCUT hybrid
   sampling method, which is used to balance the number of training
   examples in such a multi-class setting. Our SCUT approach oversamples
   minority class examples through the generation of synthetic examples and
   employs cluster analysis in order to undersample majority classes. In
   addition, it handles both within-class and between-class imbalance. Our
   experimental results against a number of multi-class problems show that,
   when the SCUT method is used for pre-processing the data before
   classification, we obtain highly accurate models that compare favourably
   to the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{Trust is a complex, multifaceted concept that includes more than just
   evaluating others' honesty. Many trust evaluation models have been
   proposed and implemented in different areas; most of them focused on
   creating algorithms for trusters to model the honesty of trustees in
   order to make effective decisions about which trustees to select, where
   a rational truster is supposed to interact with the trustworthy ones. If
   interactions are based on trust, trustworthy trustees will have a
   greater impact on the results of interactions' results. Consequently,
   building a high trust may be an advantage for rational trustees. This
   work describes a Reinforcement Learning based Trust Establishment model
   (RLTE) that goes beyond trust evaluation to outline actions to direct
   trustees (instead of trusters). RLTE uses the retention of trusters and
   reinforcement learning to model trustors' behaviors. A trustee uses
   reinforcement learning to adjust the utility gain it provides when
   interacting with each truster. The trustee depends on the average number
   of transactions carried out by that truster, relative to the mean number
   of transactions performed by all trusters interacting with this trustee.
   The trustee accelerates or decelerates the adjustment of the utility
   gain based on the increase or decrease of the average retention rate of
   all trusters in the society, respectively. The proposed model does not
   depend on direct feedback, nor does it depend on the current reputation

Abstract = {{Over the last decade there has been a growing interest in `conceptual
   modeling' for simulation. This is signified by a greater intensity of
   research and volume of papers on the topic. What is becoming apparent,
   however, is that when it comes to conceptual modeling there are quite
   different views and opinions. These differences may be beneficial for
   creating a debate that takes the field forward, but they can also lead
   to confusion. The purpose of this panel is for leading researchers to
   identify and discuss their views on conceptual modeling. In particular
   we will debate the definition, purpose and benefits of conceptual
   modeling for the field of simulation. Through the discussion we hope to
   highlight common ground and key areas of difference.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies, we synthesized the first organic light emitting
   diode (OLED) using boron subphthalocyanines (BsubPcs) based polymers.
   When designing new polymer materials for organic electronic applications
   such as OLEDs or organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices it is important to
   consider not only the contribution of each monomer but also the polymer
   chain ends. In this paper we establish a post-polymerization strategy to
   couple BsubPcs onto either the alpha- or the omega-chain end using
   chemically selective BsubPc derivatives. We outline how the chain ends
   of two representative polymers, poly(styrene) (PS) and
   poly(n-butylacrylate) (BA), synthesized by nitroxide mediated
   polymerization (NMP), using BlocBuilder-MA as the initiating species,
   can be chemically modified by the incorporation of BsubPc chromophores.
   The addition of the BsubPc chromophore was confirmed through the use of
   a photodiode array detector (PDA) connected in-line with a gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC) setup. These findings represent the
   first reported method for the controlled and selective placement of a
   BsubPc chromophores on either end of a polymer produced by NMP. This
   strategy will therefore be utilized to make next generation BsubPc
   polymers for OLEDs and OPV devices. The extremely high molar extinction
   coefficient of BsubPc also make these polymers ideally suited for
   dye-labelling of polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Health information technology (HIT) offers great potential for
   supporting healthcare delivery, particularly collaborative care delivery
   that is provided across multiple settings and providers. To date much of
   HIT design has focused on digitizing data or processes on a departmental

   scaled well for supporting community based care across disparate
   providers or settings because of the lack of boundaries (e.g. disprate
   data and processes) that exist in community based care. Cloud computing
   approaches that leverage mobile form applications for developing
   integrated HIT solutions have the potential to support collaborative
   healthcare delivery in the community. However, to date there is a
   shortage of methods that describe how to develop integrated cloud
   computing solutions to support community based care delivery. In
   particular there is a need for methods that identify how to incorporate
   boundaries into cloud computing systems design. This paper uses a three

Title = {{Reducing the phase cancellation effect in augmented RFID system}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL EMERGENT AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{494-514}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes to use the spatial diversity of dual-antenna to
   counter the phase cancellation effect in an augmented radio frequency
   identification (RFID) system, which is developed for accurate indoor
   localization. In the augmented RFID system, a tag-like semi-passive RFID
   component (referred as sensatag) senses the backscattering communication
   between standard ISO 18000-6C compliant RFID reader and passive tags
   within its proximity. However, due to the superposition of reader's
   carrier wave (CW), the amplitude difference in the tag's backscattering
   signal is significantly attenuated at the sensatag's antenna. We refer
   to such effect as phase cancellation. To counter the destructive phase
   cancellation effect, two techniques are proposed based on dual-antenna
   diversity. In the first one called simple combination technique, simple
   addition of signals from two antennas is performed; in the second one
   called receiving path selection technique, signals from both antennas
   are converted into baseband and then conduct the selection in digital
   domain. Then we demonstrate the performance of these two techniques in a
   newly developed Proximity-detection-based augmented RFID system
   simulator (PASS) framework. The result shows that dual-antenna-based
   implementations are better than the simple antenna implementation in
   reducing phase cancellation effect. Moreover, receiving path selection
   technique reduces the probability of phase cancellation significantly
   with higher hardware complexity compared with simple combination
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental setup using 2-D overtopping tests on noncohesive earth
   embankment models was conducted in the Hydraulic Laboratory at the
   University of Ottawa. The novelty of this experimental setup is
   attributed to the instrumentation by which the transient
   pore-water-pressures are captured and subsequently recorded: miniature
   (2 mm in diameter) tensiometer assemblies. The erosion rate and
   subsequent slope retreat of the sand bed was captured by digital photo
   cameras and later digitized into bed profiles. Water surface profiles
   were similarly digitized from the captured images. Apart from
   investigating the influence of initial soil-water state on overtopping
   erosion, an experimental-numerical hybrid approach was developed to
   estimate an empirical mobility relationship taking into account the
   boundary seepage mechanism. Using the recorded pore-water-pressures, a
   transient flownet, comprising the exit hydraulic gradient, seepage angle
   and interstitial discharge velocity, was established throughout the
   embankment model body at 2-second intervals. Hydraulic parameters such
   as flow depth, bed slope angle and depth-averaged overtopping velocity
   were also extracted at 2-second intervals using the free water surface
   and bed profiles and the measured overtopping discharge. Using the
   one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations, an analytical expression for the
   bed shear stress was derived to take into account the effects of
   unsteady flow, boundary seepage and steep slopes. The Shields parameter
   was also revisited to account for the effects of unsteady and
   supercritical flow on a downstream steep slope in the presence of
   boundary seepage. This novel transient flownet approach will lead to the
   development of new sediment mobility relationships for breach flows,
   instead of the sediment transport-capacity formulations which are based
   on steady, subcritical and normal flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Rivers provide essential habitat for aquatic organisms including fish.
   The interactions between erosion, sedimentation, and morphological
   changes may negatively affect the availability of habitat in these
   ecological systems. Over the past few decades, there have been attempts
   to predict the influence of morphological and hydraulic variables on
   available habitat. The main focus of this study is to investigate the
   habitat availability for young-of-year Northern Pike (Esox lucius), an
   important game fish, in a meandering clay-bed creek in the city of
   Ottawa, Canada. Suitability curves for this species were firstly
   established based on the bed substrate and hydraulic habitat variables.
   A fuzzy-based habitat suitability model, employing suitability indices
   of habitat variables, was also developed. The results of the habitat
   suitability model were then compared to the distribution of fish in the
   creek assessed using backpack electrofishing. The results predicted by
   the fuzzy-based habitat suitability model, were in good agreement with
   the fish sampling results. Moreover, it was also shown that the bed
   substrate played an important role in predicting utilization of the
   available habitat for young-of-the-year and juvenile Northern Pike.}},

Abstract = {{Man-induced hazards such as dam or dike breaches as well as natural ones
   such as tsunamis have often generated unprecedented consequences for
   humans and the infrastructure. In the context of the extreme flooding
   generated by such disastrous phenomena, it is of major importance to
   quantify the time-history of forces which occur during the interaction
   of the rapidly transient flow with various structures and the
   characteristics of the induced flow patterns. To investigate this topic,
   an idealized infrastructure by means of a free-standing,
   free-surface-piercing structure is exposed to flow conditions resembling
   onland tsunami-induced flow. The flow is physically modeled in a tsunami
   flume through long leading depression waves which run up and down a 1:
   40 smooth and impermeable sloping beach. The flow in the flume was
   generated by a volume-driven wave maker and horizontal forces in the
   x-and y-directions were measured by a 2-axis force transducer. The area
   around the structure was monitored with two CCD cameras. Recorded images
   were analyzed by Particle Image Velocimetry ( PIV) and were also used to
   reconstruct the time series of the water levels on the cylinder surface.
   To determine the stream-wise total drag force exerted on the structure
   and to compare it with the total measured base force, preparatory
   steady-state experiments were accomplished. These tests allowed
   determining the drag force coefficient of the square cylinder at various
   water depths. Estimated drag force coefficients were used to calculate
   the drag force share of the total forces on the cylinder during the
   transient flow experiments. The flow acting on the structure resulted in
   distinct flow pattern which was characteristic for this type of
   flow-structure interaction. Besides shock wave propagating upstream, a
   standing or partially-standing wave was observed in front of the
   structure together with a wake formation downstream, while a transient
   von Karman vortex street developed during the deceleration phase of the
   flow motion and during draw-down. Force measurements indicated a sudden
   increase in the stream-wise total force starting with the arrival of the
   flow front during initial run-up. Lateral velocities showed significant
   oscillations in correlation with the transient von Karman vortex street
   development. A comparison of the total measured base force with the
   analytically-calculated share of the drag force revealed that forces
   were clearly drag-dominated. Inertial forces were only of minor
   importance for the configurations presented and discussed in this

Abstract = {{In recent years, the world has witnessed several major tsunamis that
   became unprecedented natural catastrophes in terms of human casualties
   and economic losses. Reconnaissance missions in the aftermath of the
   2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami, carried out by
   researchers from the University of Ottawa, Canada, have revealed that
   many structures previously thought to be capable of withstanding
   tsunami-induced forces were heavily damaged and, in some cases, even
   completely destroyed. In response to these findings, an ongoing
   comprehensive interdisciplinary (hydraulic-structural engineering)
   research effort was initiated at the University of Ottawa, Canada, with
   the intent of advancing the current understanding of tsunami
   wave-structure interaction and to review and improve existing design
   codes accordingly. In the current study, a multi-phase three-dimensional
   numerical model was developed using OpenFOAM. This model was further
   applied to investigate hydrodynamic loading on a three-dimensional
   structural model caused by the inland intrusion of a broken tsunami
   wave. For model validation, a qualitative and quantitative comparison of
   numerical and physical measurements was performed using results from
   extensive laboratory experiments conducted at the National Research
   Council's Ocean, Coastal and River Engineering facilities (NRC-OCRE) in
   Ottawa. A recent analytical solution derived from the shallow-water wave
   theory was used to predict the bore profile and its results shows
   excellent agreement with the numerical ones. An analysis of key moments
   during the bore-structure interaction was also performed to better
   understand how water surface profiles and flow velocities are correlated
   to the forces exerted on surface-piercing structures. Of particular
   interest, the effect of entrained and entrapped air during the initial
   impact is captured by the model, augmenting the current understanding of
   its role in the loading process. In addition, results of a single-phase
   three-dimensional weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics
   (WCSPH) model, previously developed within the aforementioned research
   program, were further analyzed and compared to the OpenFOAM results.
   Finally, results obtained using a method proposed by a recent design
   guideline which provides guidance for estimating tsunami loading, FEMA
   P646 (2012), were compared to the numerical results to provide
   additional support in establishing updated design practices for
   tsunami-resistant structures.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) morphodynamic models are now readily available
   for prediction of velocity fields and erosion/deposition processes.
   These models can be applied to challenging flows such as tortuously
   meandering clay-bed rivers. Typically, calibration of such models is
   achieved by adjusting channel roughness to obtain observed flow stage
   for a given discharge. However, the complex three-dimensional flow field
   that drives sediment entrainment and transport is not usually validated.
   In this paper we utilize a spatially distributed velocity field obtained
   by intensive surveying with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp)
   to improve calibration and validation of a Delft3D morphodynamic model
   of a torturously meandering clay-bed river. Sensitivity analysis on
   model parameters showed that eddy viscosity is useful for model
   calibration. Horizontal eddy viscosity is adjusted to minimize
   differences between individual measured and modelled point velocities.
   The predicted results of erosion/sedimentation show how sediment
   transport processes can be affected by changes in the horizontal eddy
   viscosity. The validated model can be utilized to estimate boundary
   shear stress and bed erosion/deposition. The value of
   calibration/validation using spatially distributed aDcp data is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments on the evaporation of single droplets of a refined fraction
   of a liquid fuel produced by fast pyrolysis of chicken litter are
   presented. A computational model for the evaporation of the fuel is
   devised using the techniques of continuous thermodynamics, with
   distribution functions selected to represent the five main chemical
   groups in the fuel (n-paraffins, 1-alkenes, n-alkylbenzenes, n-alkyl
   fatty acids and n-diols) as determined through Py-FIMS and other
   analyses. The distribution parameters are determined directly from these
   analyses. This model is found to give accurate predictions of droplet
   temperature and diameter histories during evaporation. At ambient
   temperatures of 500 degrees C and above bubbling and disruption of the
   droplet surface was observed, with the bubbles exhibiting a thin skin
   like that of a balloon. This was attributed to polymerization of the
   surface layer, causing the underlying liquid to reach higher
   temperatures. Under most conditions a solid residue remained after
   evaporation, believed also to be the product of polymerization, and, at
   higher temperatures, of pyrolysis as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are an emerging technology that
   allows vehicles to form self-organized networks without the need of
   permanent infrastructure. VANETs have attracted the attention of the
   research community recently as they have opened up a myriad of on the
   road applications and increased their potential by providing intelligent
   transport systems. The envisaged applications, as well as some inherent
   VANET characteristics make data dissemination an essential service and a
   challenging task in these networks. Many data dissemination protocols
   have been proposed in the literature. However, most of these protocols
   were designed to operate exclusively in urban or highway scenarios and
   under dense or sparse networks. In addition, the existing solutions for
   data dissemination do not effectively address broadcast storm and
   network partition problems simultaneously. To tackle these problems, we
   propose a novel Data dissemination pRotocol In VEhicular networks
   (DRIVE) that relies exclusively on local one-hop neighbor information to
   deliver messages under dense and sparse networks. In dense scenarios,
   DRIVE selects vehicles inside a sweet spot to rebroadcast messages to
   further vehicles. Moreover, the protocol employs implicit
   acknowledgements to guarantee robustness in message delivery under
   sparse scenarios. DRIVE eliminates the broadcast storm problem and
   maximizes data dissemination capabilities across network partitions with
   short delays and low overhead. Simulation results show that DRIVE
   performs data dissemination with better efficiency than other
   algorithms, outperforming them in different scenarios in all the
   evaluations carried out. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An insight into the electronic interaction between platinum
   nanoparticles and ionically conductive yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)
   support is reported. To this end, Pt nanoparticles with four different
   crystallite sizes ranging from 1.9 to 6.7 nm were interfaced with YSZ
   resulting in <= 1 wt\% Pt on YSZ. The obtained four Pt/YSZ systems were
   studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the changes of the
   recorded spectra are discussed in details. Pt4f peak is detected in all
   cases at lower binding energies compared to the position of the peak of
   a platinum foil. More specifically, the Pt4f peak in the case of the
   smallest nanoparticles shifts 0.9 eV compared to the peak position of
   the Pt foil. Furthermore, small changes are detected on the Zr3d, Y3d
   and O1s spectra after Pt nanoparticle deposition. The XPS results are
   interpreted on the basis of charge transfer that occurs from the oxide
   support to the platinum nanoparticles, which may be responsible for the
   observed strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and
   ionically conducting ceramics reported earlier for various catalytic
   reactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{8-15}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Up to now, the ability of mesh free methods has been demonstrated by
   simulating various open channel flows; however, the prediction of
   non-hydrostatic pressure variation due to change in flow direction has
   not been studied. For purpose of illustration, flow over flip buckets is
   considered in the present paper. A novel feature of this paper is
   employing new technique for refining the solid boundary particles to
   reduce pressure fluctuations in computation. The presented technique is
   very efficient computationally since only the bed solid particles are
   refined. To simulate the curve path and geometry of the bucket
   accurately a gradually changing particle size technique is used for the
   bucket invert. A new method is also used to impose the constant flow
   discharge on the inlet without considering any additional particles to
   enter the flow domain. Free surface elevation along the bucket, lower
   and upper takeoff angles and trajectory of the jet, dynamic pressure
   distribution and location of maximum pressure along the flip bucket were
   then calculated in different approach Froude numbers and ratio of flow
   depth to bucket radius of curvature. Comparison of the numerical model
   with experimental data and results of empirical equations showed a good
   agreement. These results show the ability of the present developed model
   to simulate non-hydrostatic free surface flows particularly where
   complex geometries are involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Exploiting surface plasmon polaritons to enhance interactions between
   graphene and light has recently attracted much interest. In particular,
   nonlinear optical processes in graphene can be dramatically enhanced and
   controlled by plasmonic nanostructures. This work demonstrates Raman
   scattering enhancement in graphene based on plasmonic resonant
   enhancement of the Stokes emission, and compares this mechanism with the
   conventional Raman enhancement by resonant pump absorption. Arrays of
   optical nanoantennas with different resonant frequency are utilized to
   independently identify the effects of each mechanism on Raman scattering
   in graphene via the measured enhancement factor and its spectral
   linewidth. We demonstrate that, while both mechanisms offer large
   enhancement factors (scattering cross-section gains of 160 and 20 for
   individual nanoantennas, respectively), they affect the graphene Raman
   spectrum quite differently. Our results provide a benchmark to assess
   and quantify the role and merit of each mechanism in
   surface-plasmon-mediated Raman scattering in graphene, and may be
   employed for design and realization of a variety of graphene
   optoelectronic devices involving nonlinear optical processes.}},

Abstract = {{A shear deformable thin-walled beam theory is developed for the analysis
   of steel beams reinforced with a GFRP plate to one of the flanges.
   Starting with the principle of stationary potential energy, the
   governing equilibrium equations and boundary conditions are formulated
   for the problem. The theory results in two sets of fully coupled systems
   of equilibrium equations. The first system describes the
   longitudinal-flexural response of the system and involves four
   generalized displacement fields and the second system governs the
   lateral-torsional response and involves six generalized displacement
   fields. The resulting coupled systems are then solved numerically for
   practical problems. Detailed comparisons with three dimensional and
   shell solutions under ABAQUS show that the present theory provides
   reliable predictions for displacements and stresses. A comparison with
   results from a non-shear deformable theory illustrates the necessity of
   incorporating shear deformation effects in cases involving predominantly
   twisting responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethersulfone (PES) was sulfonated by chlorosulfonic acid and
   concentrated sulfuric acid. The pure sulfonated PES (SPES) and modified
   SPES membranes were prepared by blending with different charged surface
   modifying macromolecules (cSMMs) namely, SPES/DEG-HBS, SPES/PEG-HBS, and
   SPES/PPG-HBS. Membranes were characterized for their morphology,
   physical properties, and electrochemical properties in order to evaluate
   these membranes as cation exchange membranes. The blended membranes
   showed an increase in hydrophilicity, water uptake, and proton
   conductivity compared to the pure SPES membranes. The highest values of
   water uptake and proton conductivity were obtained for the SPES/PPG-HBS
   blended membrane. Morphological studies revealed that the nodule size
   and surface roughness also influenced the water uptake, apart from the
   additional -SO3H group. Among the modified membranes, the SPES/DEG-HBS
   blended membrane exhibited a lower methanol permeability value of 8.895
   x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1) than the corresponding SPES membrane. The other two
   cSMM blended membranes showed higher methanol permeability values than
   SPES but still a smaller value than Nafion 117. The highest selectivity
   ratio (i.e., ratio of proton conductivity to methanol permeability) was
   obtained with the SPES/DEG-HBS cSMM blended membrane. These results
   showed that the SPES/cSMM blended membranes have promise for possible
   use as a cation exchange membrane in fuel cells and electrolyzer
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the presence and
   impregnation of iron oxide nanoparticles with the polysulfone membrane
   matrix. The nanoparticles were synthesized via co-precipitation method
   and were added to the membrane structure through blending with the
   polymeric matrix (Blended Nanocomposite Membranes (BNM)), deposition by
   photopolymerization (PhotoPolymerized Nanocomposite Membranes (PPNM))
   and deposition by interfacial polymerization (Interfacially Polymerized
   Nanocomposite Membranes (IPNM)). FTIR analysis proved the presence of
   nanoparticles in all of the three types of membranes. According to AFM
   images, nanoparticles enhance the membrane roughness. On the account of
   SEM images obtained from the membrane surface, nanocomposite membranes
   have a more uniform surface compared to neat polymeric membranes. In
   addition, the cross-sectional SEM images of the membrane revealed that
   the blending method provides the opportunity of controlling the membrane
   morphology by means of nanoparticles. Contact angle analysis confirmed
   the development of nanocomposite membrane hydrophilicity versus neat
   polymeric membranes. The filtration experiments including permeation
   flux, dye rejection, and molecular weight cut off were done to compare
   all of the nanocomposite membranes. The results indicated that the
   blending method can improve the membrane structural properties and the
   deposition method can improve their separation yield. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The cyclic oxidation behavior of four high-temperature alloys (two NiAl
   alloys and two NiCr alloy) is studied utilizing an existing
   micromechanics-based model, in which Al2O3 and Cr2O3 are formed on the
   alloys as protective layers. For each alloy, the model parameters are
   determined based on one `complete' experimental curve of weight change,
   which is obtained under a high-temperature cyclic oxidation test where
   the weight change experiences a maximum value and then drops down to a
   zero point. The model is first tested on two metals which have
   experimental data available for comparison. It is found that the model
   parameter, oxide crack density exponent, can be assumed constant within
   a range of high temperature for each metal, thus with the `complete'
   experimental curve of weight change, the model can predict the oxidation
   behavior of the metal at different temperatures. The determination of
   model parameters, accuracy, and limitations of the model for NiAl and
   NiCr alloys is analyzed and discussed.}},

   Semi-Lagrangian Schemes Potentially Applicable to Atmospheric Models}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, theoretical and numerical analyses of the properties of
   some complex semi-Lagrangian methods are performed to deal with the
   issues of the instability associated with the treatment of the nonlinear
   part of the forcing term. A class of semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit
   schemes is proposed using a modified TR-BDF2 method, which is the
   combination of the trapezoidal rule (TR) and the second-order backward
   differentiation formula (BDF2). The process used for the nonlinear term
   includes two stages as predictor and corrector in the trapezoidal method
   and one stage for the BDF2 method. For the treatment of the linear term,
   the implicit trapezoidal method is employed in the first step, the
   explicit trapezoidal method in the second step, and the implicit BDF2
   method in the third step. The combination of these techniques leads to a
   family of schemes that has a large region of absolute stability,
   performs well for the purely oscillatory cases, and has good qualities
   in terms of accuracy and convergence. The use of the explicit method for
   the linear term in the second step makes the proposed class of schemes
   competitive in terms of efficiency compared to some well-known schemes
   that use two steps. Numerical experiments presented herein confirm that
   the proposed class of schemes performs well in terms of stability,
   accuracy, convergence, and efficiency in comparison with other,
   previously known, semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit schemes and
   semi-implicit predictor-corrector methods. The potential practical
   application of the proposed class of schemes to a weather prediction
   model or any other atmospheric model is not discussed and could be the
   subject of other forthcoming studies.}},

Volume = {{58}},

Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Land-use conversion models elucidate the complexities and spatial
   interdependencies of components of land use systems and provide insights
   into future land-use configurations. In this paper, the 2012-2050 future
   land-use patterns in the South Nation (SN) River basin, located in
   eastern Ontario, Canada, were generated with a modified version of the
   CLUE model and a 2011 reference map. The SN is an example of a basin
   where some water quality endpoints have dropped below acceptable limits
   because of a combination of intensive agriculture, urbanization, and
   climate change. Five historical land-use maps were used to identify the
   historical trends in generalized land-use classes. Seven demographic and
   geographic factors were used to derive the spatial distribution of land
   suitability to each land-use class. The methodology was first validated
   by simulating land-use changes from 1991 to 2011 starting from the 1991
   reference map, and comparing the simulated 2011 map to the 2011
   reference map. Then, the 2012-2050 land-uses were generated, assuming
   historical trends derived from historical reference maps will continue
   in the future. Environmental impacts of the projected land-use changes
   were discussed.

   Les modeles de reaffectation des sols permettent de decortiquer les
   complexites et les interdependances spatiales des elements de base des
   systemes d'occupation des sols et donnent un apercu des formes
   d'occupation des sols a venir. Dans cet article, l'evolution des modes
   d'occupation des sols de 2012 a 2050 dans le bassin de la riviere Nation
   Sud (NS), situe dans l'est de l'Ontario, Canada, est decrite a partir
   d'une version modifiee du modele CLUE (modele de reaffectation des sols
   et de leurs effets) et d'une carte de reference de 2011. La NS constitue
   un exemple de bassin pour lequel certains parametres de qualite de l'eau
   sont inferieurs au seuil acceptable en raison de l'effet cumulatif de
   l'agriculture intensive, de l'urbanisation et des changements
   climatiques. Cinq cartes historiques de l'occupation des sols ont permis
   d'identifier les tendances historiques des categories generales. Sept
   facteurs demographiques et geographiques ont servi a determiner la
   distribution spatiale de l'adequation des sols pour chacune des
   categories d'occupation. La methodologie a ete validee en simulant des
   changements d'occupation des sols de 1991 a 2011 a partir de la carte de
   reference de 1991, et en comparant la carte simulee de 2011 a la carte
   de reference de 2011. Puis, l'evolution de l'occupation des sols de 2012
   a 2050 est simulee en tenant pour acquis que les tendances issues des
   cartes historiques persisteront. Il s'ensuit une discussion sur les
   impacts environnementaux des changements d'occupation des sols prevus.}},

Title = {{Measurement of gas and liquid flow rates in two-phase pipe flows by the
   application of machine learning techniques to differential pressure
   signals}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{106-117}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new method for the determination of gas and liquid flow rates in
   vertical upward gas-liquid pipe flows has been proposed. This method
   consists of an application of machine learning techniques on the
   probability density function (PDF) and the power spectral density (PSD)
   of the normalized output of a differential pressure transducer connected
   to two axially separated wall pressure taps in the pipe. The two-phase
   flow regime was first identified by the application of the elastic maps
   method on the differential pressure PDF. The transducer signal was then
   pre-processed using Principal Component Analysis, and independent
   features were extracted using Independent Component Analysis. The
   extracted features were used as inputs to multi-layer back-propagation
   neural networks, which gave the phase flow rates as output. The present
   method was used to calibrate a differential pressure sensor to estimate
   the flow rates of both phases in air-water flow in a vertical pipe of
   diameter 32.5 mm and in the pressure range from 100 to 140 kPa.
   Predictions of the present method were in good agreement with direct
   flow rate measurements. Compared to previously used methods of feature
   extraction from differential pressure signals, the present method was
   the only one to have a good, consistent performance over all flow
   regimes and for all flow conditions encountered in this study. (C) 2014

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that the stiffness properties of diaphragms and lateral
   load resisting elements (LLREs) influence the load distribution between
   LLREs under lateral load induced by earthquake or wind. Where a more
   sophisticated method of calculating the load distribution in a lateral
   load resisting system is used, often it is based on the concept of a
   beam on an elastic foundation. This approach could be tedious to apply
   in design when there are more than a few LLREs. A multiple-spring model
   (MSM), whereby the translational springs are used to model the diaphragm
   stiffnesses and the stiffnesses of the LLREs, is proposed. The model was
   validated with test and finite-element results of a particular benchmark
   building. The lateral load distribution between LLREs with various
   stiffness ratios of diaphragm to LLRE was also investigated. The results
   show that, contrary to common belief, the forces transferred by a
   semirigid diaphragm to supporting LLREs may be higher than those
   predicted by flexible and rigid-diaphragm assumptions. Therefore, using
   the envelope force approach may lead to underestimation of the design
   forces in the shear walls.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely preferred measurement and
   monitoring tools for a large variety of industrial and environmental
   applications thanks to their low-cost, energy-efficiency, flexibility,
   and ease of deployment. However, the use of WSNs for measuring and
   monitoring industrial applications generating data at high rates, such
   as online monitoring of partial discharge activities in high voltage
   equipment in the power grid, presents a significant challenge for the
   system operators. In such applications, packet arrival rates could
   increase rapidly due to the occurrence of cascaded faults in the
   monitored environment. The WSNs with multihop topologies could
   experience excessive delays and an increase in packet drop of vital data
   due to the overwhelming increase in the packet arrival rates. Therefore,
   there should be an optimum operating point of the network where high
   packet arrival rates and low latency can be maintained at the same time.
   Thus, there is an immediate need for carefully designed quality of
   service (QoS) differentiation schemes that can guarantee the delivery of
   critical data with minimum latency and least loss. In this paper, we
   present a QoS differentiation scheme for high priority data in multihop
   WSNs based on an optimization scheme. Analytical and simulation results
   show that our proposed scheme significantly reduces the delay while
   maintaining high data delivery ratios and energy efficiency of the
   network.}},

   vulnerability researches on climate change have experienced a rapid
   growth since 2006, and the publications are widely distributed in a
   large number of source journals, while the top two productive
   institutions are the University of East Anglia and Potsdam Institute for
   Climate Impact Research; (2) the cooperation at author level is on the
   rise, and there are closer relationships in institutional and national
   levels; (3) the most widely focused research topics in this field
   include health issues in the socioeconomic system, food security in the
   field of agricultural system and the issue of water resource management,
   etc.; (4) according to the papers from the top journals, we find that
   the research areas for climate change vulnerability in those
   publications are located in the ecological diversity, ecosystem service,
   water resource management and electric power supply, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Many soil-structure interaction problems require the knowledge of the
   shear resistance and behavior between the soil and construction
   materials. Although sensitive marine clay deposits are widely found in
   Canada (Leda clay) and many regions in the world (e.g., Scandinavia),
   and steel is a common construction material for many civil engineering
   structures, our understanding of the interface shear behavior between
   sensitive marine clay and steel is still limited. This paper presents
   the results of an experimental study on the interface shear behavior
   between Leda clay and steel. In this research, direct shear tests (DSTs)
   are conducted to investigate the interface shear strength parameters and
   behavior between Leda clay and steel, and the effect of several factors
   (e.g., steel surface roughness, properties of the Leda clay) on the
   interface shear behavior and parameters. All tests have been carried out
   with a standard DST apparatus at normal loads which range from 250 to
   450 kPa. The results show that the Leda clay interface shear behavior
   can be significantly affected by the steel surface roughness, the Leda
   clay's OCR, dry density, and salt content. The results presented in this
   paper will contribute to a more cost-effective design of geo-technical
   structures in Leda clay.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphate is critical for mineralization and deficiencies in the
   regulation of free phosphate lead to disease. Inorganic polyphosphates
   (polyPs) may represent a physiological source of phosphate because they
   can be hydrolyzed by biological phosphatases. To investigate whether
   exogenous polyP could be utilized for mineral formation, mineralization
   was evaluated in two osteogenic cell lines, Saos-2 and MC3T3, expressing
   different levels of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (tnALP).
   The role of tnALP was further explored by lentiviral-mediated
   overexpression in MC3T3 cells. When cells were cultured in the presence
   of three different phosphate sources, there was a strong mineralization
   response with -glycerophosphate (GP) and orthophosphate (Pi) but none of
   the cultures sustained mineralization in the presence of polyP (neither
   chain length 17-Pi nor 42-Pi). Even in the presence of mineralizing
   levels of phosphate, low concentrations of polyP (50M) were sufficient
   to inhibit mineral formation. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   confirmed the presence of apatite-like mineral deposits in MC3T3
   cultures supplemented with GP, but not in those with polyP. While von
   Kossa staining was consistent with the presence or absence of mineral,
   an unusual Alizarin staining was obtained in polyP-treated MC3T3
   cultures. This staining pattern combined with low Ca:P ratios suggests
   the persistence of Ca-polyP complexes, even with high residual ALP
   activity. In conclusion, under standard culture conditions, exogenous
   polyP does not promote mineral deposition. This is not due to a lack of
   active ALP, and unless conditions that favor significant processing of
   polyP are achieved, its mineral inhibitory capacity predominates. J.

   fusing when applicable, currently holds records of the best known upper

Abstract = {{Starting with Hamilton's variational principle, the governing field
   equations for the steady state response of thin-walled beams under
   harmonic forces are derived. The formulation captures shear deformation
   effects due to bending and warping, translational and rotary inertia
   effects and as well as torsional flexural coupling effects due to the
   cross section mono-symmetry. The equations of motion consist of four
   coupled differential equations in the unknown displacement field
   variables. A general closed form solution is then developed for the
   coupled system of equations. The solution is subsequently used to
   develop a family of shape functions which exactly satisfy the
   homogeneous form of the governing field equations. A super-convergent
   fmite element is then formulated based on the exact shape functions. Key
   features of the element developed include its ability to (a) isolate the
   steady state response component of the response to make the solution
   amenable to fatigue design, (b) capture coupling effects arising as a
   result of section mono-symmetry, (c) eliminate spatial discretization
   arising in commonly used fmite elements, (d) avoiding shear locking
   phenomena, and (e) eliminate the need for time discretization. The
   results based on the present solution are found to be in excellent
   agreement with those based on fmite element solutions at a small
   fraction of the computational and modelling cost involved.}},

Title = {{An R-D optimized transcoding resilient motion vector selection}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Selection of motion vector (MV) has a significant impact on the quality
   of an encoded, and particularly a transcoded video, in terms of
   rate-distortion (R-D) performance. The conventional motion estimation
   process, in most existing video encoders, ignores the rate of residuals
   by utilizing rate and distortion of motion compensation step. This
   approach implies that the selected MV depends on the quantization
   parameter. Hence, the same MV that has been selected for high bit rate
   compression may not be suitable for low bit rate ones when transcoding
   the video with motion information reuse technique, resulting in R-D
   performance degradation. In this paper, we propose an R-D optimized
   motion selection criterion that takes into account the effect of
   residual rate in MV selection process. Based on the proposed criterion,
   a new two-piece Lagrange multiplier selection is introduced for motion
   estimation process. Analytical evaluations indicate that our proposed
   scheme results in MVs that are less sensitive to changes in bit rate or
   quantization parameter. As a result, MVs in the encoded bitstream may be
   used even after the encoded sequence has been transcoded to a lower bit
   rate one using re-quantization. Simulation results indicate that the
   proposed technique improves the quality performance of coding and
   transcoding without any computational overhead.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple one-pot co-assembly method for the synthesis of
   hierarchically structured pigment particles consisting of silica
   inverse-opal bricks that are doped with plasmonic absorbers. We study
   the interplay between the plasmonic and photonic resonances and their
   effect on the visual appearance of macroscopic collections of photonic
   bricks that are distributed in randomized orientations. Manipulating the
   pore geometry tunes the wavelength-and angle-dependence of the
   scattering profile, which can be engineered to produce angle-dependent
   Bragg resonances that can either enhance or contrast with the color
   produced by the plasmonic absorber. By controlling the overall
   dimensions of the photonic bricks and their aspect ratios, their
   preferential alignment can either be encouraged or suppressed. This
   causes the Bragg resonance to appear either as uniform color travel in
   the former case or as sparse iridescent sparkle in the latter case. By
   manipulating the surface chemistry of these photonic bricks, which
   introduces a fourth length-scale (molecular) of independent tuning into
   our design, we can further engineer interactions between liquids and the
   pores. This allows the structural color to be maintained in oil-based
   formulations, and enables the creation of dynamic liquid-responsive
   images from the pigment. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Continuously tunable slow and fast light generation using a
   silicon-on-insulator microring resonator (MRR) incorporating a multimode
   interference (MMI) coupler is proposed and experimentally demonstrated.
   The MMI coupler is optimized for the transverse-magnetic mode. By
   changing the input polarization state, the self-coupling coefficient and
   the loss factor of the MRR are changed. The depth and the bandwidth of
   the MRR are tunable by tuning the self-coupling coefficient and the loss
   factor; thus, a tunable phase shift can be achieved at the resonance
   wavelength, which leads to the generation of a tunable slow and fast
   light. The proposed scheme is experimentally evaluated. A tunable slow
   light with a maximum time delay of 35 ps and a slow-to-fast light with a
   continuously tunable range of 102 ps are achieved for a 13.5-GHz
   Gaussian optical pulse by using a double-MMI coupler MRR and a
   single-MMI coupler MRR, respectively.}},

Pages = {{7223-7234}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an intelligent bearing fault detection method
   based on a calculus enhanced energy operator (CEEO). The main purpose is
   to extract the bearing fault signatures in the presence of strong noise
   and multiple vibration interferences without prior information of the
   resonance excited by the bearing fault. This new energy operator
   exploits both the interference handling capability of a differentiation
   step and the noise suppression nature of the integration process. It
   also shares the simplicity, computational efficiency, and the ability to
   reveal signal impulsiveness of the energy operator. All these elements,
   i.e., differentiation, integration and energy operator, are implemented
   by a simple formula in a single step. Another advantage of the CEEO
   method is that, unlike the popular high frequency resonance methods, it
   does not require a bandpass filtering step and hence eliminates the
   burden to acquire the resonance information. As such, it is suited to
   on-line bearing fault detection in a noisy environment with multiple
   vibration interferences. Our simulation studies have shown that the CEEO
   method outperforms the conventional energy operator and the enveloping
   methods in handling both noise and interferences. Its performance has
   also been examined using our experimental data and the data from the
   literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent subgraph mining is a useful method for extracting meaningful
   patterns from a set of graphs or a single large graph. Here, the graph
   represents all possible RNA structures and interactions. Patterns that
   are significantly more frequent in this graph over a random graph are
   extracted. We hypothesize that these patterns are most likely to
   represent biological mechanisms. The graph representation used is a
   directed dual graph, extended to handle intermolecular interactions. The
   graph is sampled for subgraphs, which are labeled using a canonical
   labeling method and counted. The resulting patterns are compared to
   those created from a randomized dataset and scored. The algorithm was
   applied to the mitochondrial genome of the kinetoplastid species
   Trypanosoma brucei, which has a unique RNA editing mechanism. The most
   significant patterns contain two stem-loops, indicative of gRNA, and
   represent interactions of these structures with target mRNA.}},

Abstract = {{Using the concept of parity-time symmetry in optics, we propose a
   spatially non-reciprocal Bragg grating at near infrared wavelengths,
   operating with long-range surface plasmon polaritons, by employing
   balanced modulation of index and gain/loss in a step-in-width
   configuration. The index perturbation is created by stepping the width
   of an Ag stripe supporting long-range plasmons. Gain/loss modulation is
   generated by periodically doping the top polymer cladding of the
   structure with IR-140 dye molecules and pumping the grating optically
   from top. Loss exists inherently in the undoped regions due to plasmonic
   propagation loss. The transmission matrix method was employed as an
   accurate modeling technique to compute the reflectance and transmittance
   spectra of the proposed structures. Simulation results exhibit a strong
   reflectance from one end of the grating at about 880 nm as opposed to
   nearly no reflectance from the other end at the same wavelength. (C)

Abstract = {{This work describes a 3-D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)
   computational approach for the optical characterization of an opal
   photonic crystal. To fully validate the approach we compare the computed
   transmittance of a crystal model with the transmittance of an actual
   crystal sample, as measured over the 400 divided by 750 nm wavelength
   range. The opal photonic crystal considered has a face-centered cubic
   (FCC) lattice structure of spherical particles made of polystyrene (a
   non-absorptive material with constant relative dielectric permittivity).
   Light-matter interaction is described by numerically solving Maxwell's
   equations via a parallelized FDTD code. Periodic boundary conditions
   (PBCs) at the outer edges of the crystal are used to effectively enforce
   an infinite lateral extension of the sample. A method to study the
   propagating Bloch modes inside the crystal bulk is also proposed, which
   allows the reconstruction of the omega-k dispersion curve for k sweeping
   discretely the Brillouin zone of the crystal. (C) 2014 Optical Society

   Thanks to the mutual injection locking, the operation stability of the
   fiber laser and the OEO are substantially improved. A microwave signal
   at 11.8 GHz with a phase noise of -105 dBc/Hz at a 10-kHz offset

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Previous in vitro studies have shown that trivalent chromium ions (Cr3+)
   can induce cell death and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In
   addition, chemokines such as MCP-1 and MIP-1 alpha have been observed in
   the presence of implant wear particles. Therapeutic approaches to
   minimize the inflammatory response to metal ions leading to
   periprosthetic osteolysis and other adverse tissue reactions could help
   mitigate some of the concerns associated with metal ions from hip
   replacements. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the
   effects of Cr3+ on macrophage mortality and morphology, as well as on
   the release of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and RANTES,
   with and without simvastatin. J774A.1 macrophages were exposed to 50-500
   ppm Cr3+ with and without 5 or 10 mu M simvastatin for 24 h, in
   rotation. Mortality results showed that Cr3+ induced macrophage
   mortality in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, simvastatin at 10 mu
   M effectively prevented Cr3+-induced vacuolization and cell swelling.
   Results also showed that while high concentrations of Cr3+ (particularly
   500 ppm) may be too toxic to stimulate TNF-a and CC chemokine release,
   lower concentrations of Cr3+ are capable of inducing TNF-a and selective

   dose-dependent, except for TNF-alpha and reduced the release of

Abstract = {{Hydropower plays a major role in the Canadian electricity generation
   industry. Few attempts have been made, however, to assess the efficiency
   of hydropower generation in Canada. This paper analyzes the overall
   efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada from comprehensive
   viewpoints of electricity generating capability, its profitability, as
   well as environmental benefits and soda! responsibility using the TOPSIS
   (the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)
   method. The factors that influence the efficiency of the hydropower
   generation are also presented to help to the sustainable hydropower
   production in Canada. The most important results of this study concern
   (1) the pivotal roles of energy saving and of the social responsibility
   in the overall efficiency of hydropower corporates and (2) the lower
   hydropower generation efficiency of some of the most important economic
   regions in Canada. Other results reveal that the overall efficiency of
   hydropower generation in Canada experienced an improvement in 2012,
   following a downtrend from 2005 to 2011. Amidst these influencing
   factors, energy saving and social responsibility are key factors in the
   overall efficiency scores while management (defined herein by the number
   of employees and hydropower stations of a corporation) has only a
   slightly negative impact on the overall efficiency score. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Porous PVDF-hydrophobic montmorillonite (MMT) mixed matrix membranes
   (MMMs) were fabricated via wet spinning method and used in membrane gas
   absorption process. The effects of hydrophobic MMT nano-clay loadings
   (1, 3 and 5 wt\% of polymer) on the structure and performance were
   investigated. The fabricated membranes showed both finger-like and
   sponge-like structure with an increase in the length of finger-like
   pores in their cross-section, which resulted in higher permeability and
   lower mass transfer resistance compared to plain PVDF membrane. Also,
   significant improvements for surface hydrophobicity, critical entry
   pressure of water and porosity with the addition of filler were
   observed. The CO2 absorption test was conducted through the gas-liquid
   membrane contactor and demonstrated a significant improvement in the CO2
   flux with MMT loading and the membrane with 5 wt\% MMT presented highest
   performance. For example, at the liquid water velocity of 0.5 m s(-1),
   CO2 flux of the MMM with 5 wt\% MMT of 9.73 x 10(-4) mol m(-2) s(-1) was
   approximately 56\% higher than the PVDF membrane without nano-filler. In
   conclusion, MMMs with improved absorption properties can be a promising
   candidate for CO2 absorption and separation processes through membrane
   contactors. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Abstract = {{A toolbox approach for the transfer of batch to continuous chemical
   synthesis is presented. The approach considers reaction kinetics (Type
   A, B, C), reacting phases (single phase, liquidliquid, gasliquid and
   liquidsolid), and the reaction network (parallel and consecutive
   reactions) in order to select the most appropriate reactor module
   (Plate, Coil, or CSTR) for continuous operation. Then, three case
   studies using these three fundamental reactors are presented but require
   special considerations. For the reaction of dimethyl-oxalate with
   ethylmagnesium chloride, a plug-flow multi-injection technology must be
   used to decrease the local heat generation and improve yield. For the
   nitration of salicylic acid, a Plate reactor with mixing elements
   favoring some back-mixing followed by a plug-flow system at elevated
   temperatures is used instead of a tandem mixed-flow CSTR and plug-flow
   Coil reactor in order to minimize the risk of thermal decomposition of
   intermediates with a reduced volume penalty. Finally, a ring-closing
   metathesis reaction is discussed for which the utilization of a CSTR
   allows the removal of catalyst-poisoning ethylene formed during the
   reaction and keeps the substrate concentration low to increase the yield
   above that of a batch or plug-flow system.}},

Abstract = {{Boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are structural analogs of carbon
   nanotubes formed from hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) sheets. h-BN
   exhibits strong phonon resonances which result in a negative
   permittivity band in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) part of the
   electromagnetic spectrum. Recently, we have experimentally demonstrated
   that BNNTs can support one-dimensional surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs)
   in the mid-IR. In this work, we thoroughly study the modal
   characteristics of the SPhP modes of BNNTs with respect to their
   structural attributes, such as diameter, hollowness, and ellipticity, as
   well as dispersion as a function of frequency. As is discussed in detail
   throughout the paper, the SPhP modes of BNNTs offer deep-subwavelength
   field confinement and large field enhancement and provide a viable means
   for nanophotonics, near-field optics, and thermo-optics at mid-IR
   wavelengths.}},

Abstract = {{The sensing performance of straight long-range surface plasmon
   waveguides consisting of a thin gold stripe embedded in Cytop is
   explored theoretically as a function of the metal stripe cross-sectional
   dimensions and the length of the sensing channel, and as a function of
   the sensing medium refractive index. The surface sensitivity and
   detection limit of such waveguides for attenuation-based biosensing are
   assessed. We find that changes in coupling efficiency between the
   sensing waveguide and the access waveguides, and changes in attenuation
   constant, due to adlayer formation, can contribute additively to the
   sensing performance. We observed a trade-off between the insertion loss
   and the change in insertion loss occurring during sensing. Optimum
   designs leading to compact, sensitive, and cost-effective biosensors are
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{At present, companies and standards organizations are enhancing Ethernet
   as the unified switch fabric for all of the TCP/IP traffic, the storage
   traffic and the high performance computing traffic in data centers.
   Backward congestion notification (BCN) is the basic mechanism for the
   end-to-end congestion management enhancement of Ethernet. To fulfill the
   special requirements of the unified switch fabric, i.e., losslessness
   and low transmission delay, BCN should hold the buffer occupancy around
   a target point tightly. Thus, the stability of the control loop and the
   buffer size are critical to BCN. Currently, the impacts of delay on the
   performance of BCN are unidentified. When the speed of Ethernet
   increases to 40 Gbps or 100 Gbps in the near future, the number of
   on-the-fly packets becomes the same order with the buffer size of
   switch. Accordingly, the impacts of delay will become significant. In
   this paper, we analyze BCN, paying special attention on the delay. We
   model the BCN system with a set of segmented delayed differential
   equations, and then deduce sufficient condition for the uniformly
   asymptotic stability of BCN. Subsequently, the bounds of buffer
   occupancy are estimated, which provides direct guidelines on setting
   buffer size. Finally, numerical analysis and experiments on the NetFPGA
   platform verify our theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive hybrid test vector compression
   method for very large scale integration (VLSI) circuit testing,
   targeting specifically embedded cores-based system-on-chips (SoCs). In
   the proposed approach, a software program is loaded into the on-chip
   processor memory along with the compressed test data sets. To minimize
   on-chip storage besides testing time, the test data volume is first
   reduced by compaction in a hybrid manner before downloading into the
   processor. The method uses a set of adaptive coding techniques for
   realizing lossless compression. The compaction program need not to be
   loaded into the embedded processor, as only the decompression of test
   data is required for the automatic test equipment (ATE). The developed
   scheme necessitates minimal hardware overhead, while the on-chip
   embedded processor can be reused for normal operation on completion of
   testing. This paper reports results on studies of the problem and
   demonstrates the feasibility of the suggested methodology with
   simulation runs on the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems
   (ISCAS) 85 combinational and ISCAS 89 full-scan sequential benchmark

Abstract = {{Doubly symmetric steel I-section members with thin webs and stocky
   flanges have a tendency to buckle in a so-called distortional buckling
   mode, involving distortion of the web of the I-section in the plane of
   its cross-section. As this mode is more complicated than the local or
   global buckling, analytical expressions take empirical forms and vary in
   between different proposals. This paper has two main objectives. The
   first objective is to propose a complex finite strip method for
   distortional buckling analysis of I-section beams with slender webs and
   check the suitability for such analysis by comparing its accuracy with
   other methods and the second objective is to propose a simple method for
   predicting the distortional buckling loads of I-beams. The latter
   objective is superior to current methods with respect to the weight of
   the sections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper suggests new evolving Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy models
   dedicated to crane systems. A set of evolving TSK fuzzy models with
   different numbers of inputs are derived by the novel relatively simple
   and transparent implementation of an online identification algorithm. An
   input selection algorithm to guide modeling is proposed on the basis of
   ranking the inputs according to their important factors after the first
   step of the online identification algorithm. The online identification
   algorithm offers rule bases and parameters which continuously evolve by
   adding new rules with more summarization power and by modifying existing
   rules and parameters. The potentials of new data points are used with
   this regard. The algorithm is applied in the framework of the
   pendulum-crane system laboratory equipment. The evolving TSK fuzzy
   models are tested against the experimental data and a comparison with
   other TSK fuzzy models and modeling approaches is carried out. The
   comparison points out that the proposed evolving TSK fuzzy models are
   simple and consistent with both training data and testing data and that
   these models outperform other TSK fuzzy models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper suggests a new generation of optimal PI controllers for a
   class of servo systems characterized by saturation and dead zone static
   nonlinearities and second-order models with an integral component. The
   objective functions are expressed as the integral of time multiplied by
   absolute error plus the weighted sum of the integrals of output
   sensitivity functions of the state sensitivity models with respect to
   two process parametric variations. The PI controller tuning conditions
   applied to a simplified linear process model involve a single design
   parameter specific to the extended symmetrical optimum (ESO) method
   which offers the desired tradeoff to several control system performance
   indices. An original back-calculation and tracking anti-windup scheme is
   proposed in order to prevent the integrator wind-up and to compensate
   for the dead zone nonlinearity of the process. The minimization of the
   objective functions is carried out in the framework of optimization
   problems with inequality constraints which guarantee the robust
   stability with respect to the process parametric variations and the
   controller robustness. An adaptive gravitational search algorithm (GSA)
   solves the optimization problems focused on the optimal tuning of the
   design parameter specific to the ESO method and of the anti-windup
   tracking gain. A tuning method for PI controllers is proposed as an
   efficient approach to the design of resilient control systems. The
   tuning method and the PI controllers are experimentally validated by the
   adaptive GSA-based tuning of PI controllers for the angular position
   control of a laboratory servo system.}},

   on the road due to their high mobility rate. For these reasons, we seek
   new solutions that will aid in speeding up the process of certificate
   validation. In this article, we propose a certificate revocation status
   validation scheme using the concept of clustering from data mining that
   can meet the aforementioned requirements. We employ the technique of
   k-Means clustering to boost the efficiency of certificate validation,
   thereby enhancing the security of a vehicular ad hoc network.
   Additionally, a comprehensive security analysis for this scheme is
   presented; the analysis shows that this scheme can effectively improve
   the validation of certificates and thus increase the communication
   security in vehicular ad hoc networks. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Design and implementation of an effective surveillance system is a
   challenging task. In practice, a large number of CCTV cameras are
   installed to prevent illegal and unacceptable activities where a human
   operator observes different camera views and identifies various alarming
   cases. But reliance on the human operator for real-time response can be
   expensive as he may be unable to pay full attention to all camera views
   at the same time. Moreover, the complexity of a situation may not be
   easily perceivable by the operator for which he might require additional
   support in response to an adverse situation. In this paper, we present a
   Decision Support Engine (DSE) to select and schedule most appropriate
   camera views that can help the operator to take an informed decision.
   For this purpose, we devise a utility based approach where the utility
   value changes based on automatically detected events in different
   surveillance zones, event co-relation, and operator's feedback. In
   addition to the selected camera views, we propose to synthetically embed
   extra information around the camera views such as event summary and
   suggested action plan to globally perceive the current situation. The
   experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed decision
   support system.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed mobile energy storage (DMES) units, which have been recently
   available in the form of Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) batteries,
   provide unique opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the smart
   grid. On the other hand, without communications, uncoordinated supply
   may risk the stability of the grid, while mobility and variable
   availability of the batteries make the planning task challenging for the
   utilities. In this paper, we propose a four-way handshake protocol and a
   token-based energy forwarding network model for the electricity
   distribution system that allows energy to be supplied in a
   store-and-forward fashion similar to packet delivery in delay-tolerant
   networks. Based on this model, we develop a novel vehicle-to-grid power
   flow coordination approach, where the power acquired by the
   delay-tolerant loads is aggregated into tokens which are then matched
   with the available capacity of the PEV batteries. Energy transactions
   between delay-tolerant loads and PEVs rely on their communications with
   the energy management system at the distribution level. Our four-way
   handshake protocol assures tokens coming from loads and grants coming
   from storage are matched properly at the distribution level. Our
   approach provides a convenient supply for loads via PEV batteries while
   addressing the mobility of vehicles and preserving fairness. We provide
   a mathematical analysis of the proposed approach and conduct simulations
   showing that the proposed protocol is able to provide fair access
   opportunity to PEV owners. Furthermore, by introducing the queuing
   theory perspective, we enhance the planning capabilities of utilities.

Abstract = {{A magnetic adsorptive photocatalyst composite Ag/AgCl-magnetic activated
   carbon (A-MAC) was proposed and investigated. Magnetic activated carbon
   was prepared by impregnation of AC with silica-coated magnetite
   particles synthesized via chemical co-precipitation and a modified
   Stober process, and was then used to synthesize Ag/AgCl-MAC composites
   by a facile deposition-precipitation-photoreduction method. The prepared
   composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission and
   scanning electron microscopies, respectively, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, N-2 sorption, and ultraviolet-visible light diffuse
   reflectance spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the composites were
   studied by superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, and
   they were found to exhibit quasi-superparamagnetic behaviour. The
   visible light induced photoactivities of the samples were studied for
   the degradation of model organic pollutants, methyl orange and phenol,
   and cyclic degradation experiments were performed by recovering the
   composite by magnetic separation between runs. The prepared composites
   were also found to possess good activity for photocatalytic
   disinfection, inducing a 3-log reduction in Escherichia coli K-12 in 40
   min under irradiation. The incorporation of silica-coated magnetite into
   AC was thought to influence morphology in the final
   photocatalyst-adsorbent composites, and the role of silica in preventing
   iron oxide dissolution in the photoreactive system was investigated and
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of a denser and more viscous secondary liquid phase may
   impact the fluid dynamic behaviour of industrial ebullated bed reactors
   such as hydroprocessors. This study investigates the effects of particle
   size, shape and material on the global fluid dynamic behaviour of
   gas-liquid-liquid-solid fluidized beds subject to particle
   agglomeration. Ebullated bed experiments were carried out in a 152.4 mm
   diameter column at atmospheric conditions with biodiesel as the
   continuous liquid, 5 wt.\% of glycerol as the denser and more viscous
   dispersed liquid, and nitrogen. Glass spheres with diameters of 4 and
   1.5 mm were compared to aluminum cylinders with equivalent volume to
   surface area ratios, where the sphericity of both larger and smaller
   cylinders was approximately 0.8. In a liquid-solid fluidized bed, the
   previous particles were in the intermediate settling flow regime (0.2 <
   Re-LT infinity <500) in biodiesel; nonetheless, coalescing and dispersed
   bubble flow regimes were obtained with the smaller and larger particles,
   respectively, at the introduction of gas. Liquid-liquid-solid fluidized
   bed results established that particle size, shape and material had
   considerable impacts on agglomeration behaviour. In the
   gas-liquid-liquid-solid ebullated bed, the 1.5 mm glass beads
   transitioned from coalesced to dispersed bubble flow due to increased
   particle inertia from agglomeration. Larger glass beads experienced a
   reduced bed expansion due to agglomeration since the bubble flow regime
   remained constant The studied aluminum cylinders did not agglomerate to
   the same extent as the glass beads due to differing material wetting
   properties, where negligible clustering occurred with the larger
   cylinders and an axial agglomerate size distribution was observed with
   the smaller cylinders. Preliminary experiments in a slurry bubble column
   using 100 to 150 mu m glass beads were inoperable at a relatively low
   glycerol concentration of 0.7 wt.\% due to considerable sedimentation on
   the distributor. Interparticle forces relevant to
   gas-liquid-liquid-solid fluidized beds are discussed, with an emphasis
   on the relation between fluid and particle properties with respect to
   attractive forces due to liquid bridging. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In a peer-to-peer data management system (P2PDMS) peers exchange data in
   a pair-wise fashion on-the-fly in response to user queries without any
   centralized control. When peers exchange highly confidential data over
   an insecure communication channel, the data might be intercepted and
   read by intruders. As there is no centralized control for data exchange
   among peers in a P2PDMS, we cannot assume any central third party
   security infrastructure (e.g. PKI) to protect confidential data. This
   paper proposes a security protocol for data exchange in P2PDMSs based on
   pairing-based cryptography and data exchange policy. The protocol allows
   the peers to compute their secret session keys dynamically during data
   exchange session by computing a pairing on an elliptic curve, that is
   based on the policies between them. We show using a formal verification
   tool that the proposed protocol is safe, and is robust against different
   attacks including man-in-the middle, the masquerade, and the reply.
   Furthermore, the computational and communication overhead of the
   protocol are analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Photonic generation of a linearly chirped microwave waveform with an
   increased time-bandwidth product (TBWP) based on a frequency-tunable
   optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) and a recirculating phase modulation
   loop (RPML) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated, for the first
   time to the best of our knowledge. In the proposed system, a
   continuous-wave (CW) light wave is divided into two parts: one is sent
   to the tunable OEO to generate a frequency-tunable microwave signal and
   the other is intensity-modulated by a switching signal at an intensity
   modulator to form a chirp-free optical pulse, which are then sent to the
   RPML, in which the chirp-free pulse is phase modulated by a parabolic
   waveform to generate a linearly chirped optical waveform. The
   recirculation of the linearly chirped optical waveform inside the loop
   would lead to the waveform to experience multiple phase modulations,
   thus multiplying its chirp rate. By beating the chirped waveform and an
   optical sideband from the OEO at a high-speed photodetector (PD), a
   linearly chirped microwave waveform is obtained. The key significance of
   the approach is that the chirp rate is significantly increased, leading
   to a significantly increased TBWP. In addition, the approach allows the
   generation of a linearly chirped frequency-tunable microwave waveform
   without using a separate microwave source. The technique is
   experimentally verified. The generation of a linearly chirped microwave
   waveform with an increased TBWP by 16 times is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{An optical microwave waveform generator using a polarization modulator
   (PolM) in a Sagnac loop is proposed and experimentally demonstrated.
   Microwave waveforms including a triangular waveform, a sawtooth
   waveform, and a square waveform, can be generated using a sinusoidal
   signal to modulate a light wave at a PolM in a Sagnac loop. In the
   proposed microwave waveform generator, a sinusoidal microwave signal is
   applied to the PolM in the Sagnac loop. Due to the velocity mismatch,
   only the clockwise light wave in the Sagnac loop is effectively
   modulated by the sinusoidal microwave signal at the PolM, and the
   counter-clockwise light wave is not modulated. Along the clockwise
   direction, the powers of the odd-and even-order sidebands can be
   controlled separately by tuning a polarization controller after the
   PolM. In addition, the output power of the optical carrier can be
   independently controlled by combining the counter-clockwise and
   clockwise optical carriers at the output of a polarization beam
   splitter. As a result, a modulated signal with controllable odd-and
   even-order sidebands is generated. By applying the modulated signal to a
   photodetector, a microwave signal with fully controllable odd-and
   even-order harmonics is generated, which corresponds to a desired
   microwave waveform. A theoretical analysis is developed, which is
   validated by an experiment. A triangular, sawtooth, and square waveform
   with a repetition rate tunable from 2 to 4 GHz is experimentally
   generated.}},

Abstract = {{A photonic temporal integrator with an ultra-wide integration time
   window implemented based on a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) in an
   InP-InGaAsP material system consisting of semiconductor optical
   amplifiers (SOAs) and current-injection phase modulators (PMs) is
   proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The proposed photonic
   integrated integrator employs a ring structure coupled with two bypass
   waveguides. The tunable coupling between the ring and the waveguides is
   realized by a multi-mode interference (MMI) Mach-Zehnder interferometer
   coupler. Within the ring, two SOAs are incorporated to compensate for
   the insertion loss. In addition, there is a current injection PM in the
   ring for wavelength tuning. The use of the device provides a photonic
   temporal integrator with an ultra-wide integration time window and a
   tunable operation wavelength in a single PIC. The proposed integrator is
   fabricated and experimentally verified. The integration time window as
   wide as 6331 ps is achieved, which is an order of magnitude longer than
   that provided by the previously reported photonic integrators.}},

Abstract = {{The spurious noises of a narrow-bandpass microwave photonic filter (MPF)
   using phase modulation to intensity modulation (PM-IM) conversion and an
   optical notch filter are analyzed in theory and demonstrated
   experimentally. Due to the difference between the nonlinear filtering
   effect of PM-IM conversion and the linear one of finite impulse response
   or infinite impulse response, additional spurious noises will be
   generated in the former filter. Analysis models with two input microwave
   tones are developed for revealing the spurious noises in the MPF based
   on PM-IM conversion under small-signal and large-signal modulations,
   which are then verified by simulations and experiments, respectively.
   The results show that, besides the target microwave signal to be
   selected, the inter-modulation noise and the harmonic noises also
   coexist at the output of the MPF, wherein the 2nd-order inter-modulation
   noises and the 2nd-order harmonic noise of the target signal are the
   dominant spurious ones. Therefore, an excellent agreement among the
   results from analysis models, the simulations, and the experiments is
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a technique to generate broadband chaotic and breather
   signals employing an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) comprising a phase
   modulator (PM) and a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating (LCFBG). The
   joint operation of the PM and the LCFBG forms a broadband microwave
   photonic filter (MPF), which allows the OEO to generate chaotic signals
   and breathers taking advantage of the interplay between the broadband
   MPF and the time-delayed feedback loop provided by a long optical fiber
   delay line. The breather excitations are characterized by nanosecond
   chaotic oscillations breathing periodically at a significantly lower
   time-scale determined by the OEO large delay time. A theoretical
   analysis based on a modified Ikeda time-delayed model to include the
   effect of the broadband filtering process is provided. The analysis is
   verified by an experiment. The proposed LCFBG-based OEO and the
   possibility to control in the optical domain its broadband bandpass
   characteristics considering the flexibility, accuracy, and precision in
   FBG fabrication can find applications in chaos-based communications and
   in fast optical processing systems, such as random number generation, or

Abstract = {{Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes
   consisted of TiO2 and different molecular weight (M-w) of
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (i.e., 10, 24, 40, and 360 kDa) were prepared
   to treat synthesized oily wastewater. The membrane performances were
   characterized in terms of pure water flux, permeate flux, and oil
   rejection while their morphological properties were studied using SEM,
   AFM, and tensile tester. Results show that the PVDF-TiO2 composite
   membrane prepared from PVP40k was the best performing membrane owing to
   its promising water flux (72.2 L/m(2).h) coupled with good rejection of
   oil (94\%) when tested with 250 ppm oily solution under submerged
   condition. It is also found that with increasing PVP M-w, the membrane
   tended to exhibit higher PVP and protein rejection, greater mechanical
   strength, smaller porosity, and a smoother surface layer. Regarding the
   effect of pH, the permeate flux of the PVDF-PVP40k membrane was reported
   to increase with increasing pH from 4 to 7, followed by decrease when
   the pH was further increased to 10. Increasing oil concentration in the
   feed solution was reported to negatively affect the water flux of
   PVDF-PVP40k membrane, owing to the formation of thicker oil layer on the
   membrane surface which increased water transport resistance. A simple
   backflushing process on the other hand could retrieve approximately 60\%
   of the membrane original flux without affecting the oil separation
   efficiency. Based on the findings, the PVDF-TiO2 membrane prepared from
   PVP40k can be potentially considered for oily wastewater treatment
   process due to its good combination of permeability and selectivity and
   reasonably high water recovery rate.}},

Abstract = {{Blades are among the key components of wind turbines. Blade damage is
   one of the most common types of structural defects and can cause
   catastrophic structural failure. Therefore, it is highly desirable to
   detect and diagnose blade damage as early as possible. In this paper, we
   propose a method for blade damage detection and diagnosis. This method
   incorporates finite element method (FEM) for dynamics analysis (modal
   analysis and response analysis) and the mode shape difference curvature
   (MSDC) information for damage detection/diagnosis. Finite element models
   of wind turbine blades have been built and modified via frequency
   comparison with experimental data and the formula for the model updating
   technique. Our numerical simulation results have demonstrated that the
   proposed technique can detect the spatial locations of damages for wind
   turbine blades. Changes in natural frequencies and modes for smaller
   size blades with damage are found to occur at lower frequencies and
   lower modes than in the larger sized blade case. The relationship
   between modal parameters and damage information (location, size) is very
   complicated especially for larger size blades. Moreover, structure and
   dynamic characters for larger size blades are different from those for
   smaller sized blades. Therefore, dynamic response analysis for a larger
   sized wind turbine blade with a multi-layer composite material based on
   aerodynamic loads' (including lift forces and drag forces) calculation
   has been carried out and improved the efficiency and precision to damage
   detection by combining (MSDC) information. This method provides a low
   cost and efficient non-destructive tool for wind turbine blade condition
   monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of common RNA secondary structure motifs is an important
   problem in bioinformatics. The presence of such motifs is usually
   associated with key biological functions. However, the identification of
   structural motifs is far from easy. Unlike motifs in sequences, which
   have conserved bases, structural motifs have common structure
   arrangements even if the underlying sequences are different. Over the
   past few years, hundreds of algorithms have been published for the
   discovery of sequential motifs, while less work has been done for the
   structural motifs case. Current structural motif discovery algorithms
   are limited in terms of accuracy and scalability. In this paper, we
   present an incremental and scalable algorithm for discovering RNA
   secondary structure motifs, namely IncMD. We consider the structural
   motif discovery as a frequent pattern mining problem and tackle it using
   a modified a priori algorithm. IncMD uses data structures, trie-based
   linked lists of prefixes (LLP), to accelerate the search and retrieval
   of patterns, support counting, and candidate generation. We modify the
   candidate generation step in order to adapt it to the RNA secondary
   structure representation. IncMD constructs the frequent patterns
   incrementally from RNA secondary structure basic elements, using nesting
   and joining operations. The notion of a motif group is introduced in
   order to simulate an alignment of motifs that only differ in the number
   of unpaired bases. In addition, we use a cluster beam approach to select
   motifs that will survive to the next iterations of the search. Results
   indicate that IncMD can perform better than some of the available
   structural motif}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address
   assignment architecture for heterogeneous wireless IP devices network.
   The IP device could be a sensor device, a laptop, a cell phone, or any
   wireless device using IP communications. The proposed architecture
   introduces security and service reliability to the consumer while
   reducing the operational expenditure for the service providers.
   According to the proposed scheme, each node maintains an IP address pool
   storing the current occupancy of each IP address. Each node advertises
   its database whenever the ratio of negative acknowledgments from the
   domain name server to the total number of requests at a given node
   exceeds a certain threshold. We evaluate our IP assignment scheme under
   two traffic intensity scenarios, namely the uniform traffic intensity
   and the heterogeneous traffic intensity. Performance evaluation is
   carried out with respect to blocking probability and average IP list
   utilization. We define three types of blocking probability for the user
   requests as follows: The real blocking, the unjustified acceptance, and
   the unjustified rejection. We observe that the proposed scheme
   outperforms the uniform assignment as long as the threshold is below
   1.5\% for the uniform intensity scenario and 1\% for the heterogeneous
   scenario. Furthermore, this architecture considers the security aspect
   of the wireless network by allowing only registered devices to
   communicate with other registered devices. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley

   aimed at limiting the growth of the computational cost with the increase

   used to represent the circuit response in each random variable. The
   proposed method is based on deriving a closed form for the structure of
   the augmented matrices generated by the PC approach. It then develops an
   algorithm to decouple the large augmented matrices into independent
   matrices that can be factorized in parallel. Several numerical examples

Abstract = {{Context awareness, intended as providing the current execution
   environment at the service level, is a fundamental capability in future
   mobile systems. Unfortunately, the real-world realization of such
   scenarios is currently undermined by inefficient context data delivery
   mechanisms, which introduce excessive overhead over
   bandwidth-constrained wireless fixed infrastructures. To efficiently
   offload context access from fixed infrastructures to mobile nodes, this
   paper presents a new data caching algorithm that exploits peculiar
   aspects of context distribution, mainly limited data lifetime and
   interests similarity between nodes in physical proximity, to properly
   select the data to evict when necessary. Our solution considers a
   history over past data accesses and information over data replication to
   better exploit the limited available space. Extensive simulation
   results, collected in NS2 simulator, support our assumptions and
   demonstrate that our caching solution improves system scalability while
   adding a limited management overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Small particle size (1.1 nm) Ru nanoparticles were supported on a mixed
   ionic-electronic conductor, CeO2, with a low metal loading (1 wt\%),
   interfaced with a YSZ electrolyte. A pronounced enhancement (up to about
   2.5 times) of the catalytic rate for the complete oxidation of ethylene
   was observed for negative polarization. The opposite effect was observed
   for positive polarization. Apparent Faradaic efficiencies up to 96 were
   determined, indicating a non-Faradaic effect. The modification of the
   cerium oxidation state (i.e., reduction from Ce4+ to Ce3+) is proposed
   to enhance the catalytic performance of the Ru nanoparticles. XPS
   analysis was performed to confirm this reduction of ceria. The
   enhancement of catalytic activity is attributed to the presence of more
   oxygen vacancies in the ceria interlayer causing a stronger
   metal-support interaction. Results demonstrate the feasibility of
   in-situ modification of the metal support-interaction between Ru
   nanoparticles and CeO2 catalytic support by a small current (-2 mu A)

Abstract = {{Objectives: Aortic valve (AV) repair (AVr) has become an attractive
   alternative to AV replacement for the correction of aortic
   insufficiency; however, little clinical evidence exists in determining
   which biomaterial at AVr would be optimal. Cusp replacement in AVr has
   been associated with increased long-term AVr failure. We measured the
   hemodynamic and biomaterial properties using an ex vivo porcine AVr
   model with clinically relevant biomaterials and generated a finite
   element model to ascertain which materials would be best suited for
   valve repair.
   Methods: Porcine aortic roots with intact AVs were placed in a left
   heart simulator mounted with a high-speed camera for baseline valve
   assessment. The noncoronary cusp was excised and replaced with
   autologous porcine pericardium, glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardial
   patch (Synovis), extracelluar matrix scaffold (CorMatrix), or
   collagen-impregnated Dacron (Hemashield). The hemodynamic parameters
   were measured for a range of cardiac outputs (2.5-6.5 L/min) after
   repair. The biomaterial properties and St Jude Medical pericardial patch
   were determined using pressurization experiments. Finite element models
   of the AV and root complex were constructed to determine the hemodynamic
   characteristics and leaflet stresses.
   Results: The geometric orifice areas after repair were significantly
   reduced in the Hemashield (P < .05) and CorMatrix (P = .0001) groups.
   Left ventricular work increased with increasing cardiac output (P =
   .001) in unrepaired valves, as expected, and was similar among all
   biomaterial groups. Finite element modeling of the biomaterials
   displayed differences in the percentage of changes in total Von Mises
   stress for both replaced (noncoronary cusp) and nonreplaced left and
   right cusps with the St Jude Medical pericardial patch (+4\%, +24\%) and
   autologous porcine pericardium (+5, +26\%), with a lower percentage of
   changes than for the bovine pericardial patch (+12\%, +27\%), Hemashield
   (+30\%, +9\%), and CorMatrix (+13\%, +32\%).
   Conclusions: The present study has shown that postrepair left
   ventricular work did not increase despite a decrease in geometric
   orifice areas in the Hemashield and CorMatrix groups. The autologous
   porcine pericardium and St Jude Medical pericardial patch had the
   closest profile to normal AVs; therefore, either biomaterial might be
   best suited. Finally, the increased stresses found in the bovine
   pericardial patch, Hemashield, and CorMatrix groups might, after
   prolonged tensile exposure, be associated with late repair failure.}},

Abstract = {{With recent advances in computing and communication technologies,
   ubiquitous access to high quality multimedia content such as high
   definition video using smartphones, netbooks, or tablets is a fact of
   our daily life. However, power consumption is still a major concern for
   portable devices. One approach to address this concern is to control and
   optimize power consumption using a power model for each multimedia
   application, such as a video decoder. In this paper, a generic,
   comprehensive and granular decoder complexity model for the baseline
   profile of H.264/AVC decoder has been proposed. The modeling methodology
   was designed to ensure a platform and implementation independent
   complexity model. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model
   estimates decoder complexity with an average accuracy of 92.15\% for a
   wide range of test sequences using both the JM reference software and
   the x264 software implementation of H.264/AVC, and 89.61\% for a
   dedicated hardware implementation of the motion compensation module. It
   should be noted that in addition to power consumption control, the
   proposed model can be used for designing a receiver-aware H.264/AVC
   encoder, where the complexity constraints of the receiver side are taken
   into account during compression. To further evaluate the proposed model,
   a receiver-aware encoder has been designed and implemented. Our
   simulation results indicate that using the proposed model the designed
   receiver aware encoder performs similar to the original encoder, while
   still being able to satisfy the complexity constraints of various
   decoders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The release of the organochlorine pesticide lindane
   (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) from several types of contaminated
   building materials was studied to assess inhalation hazard and
   decontamination requirements in response to accidental and/or
   intentional spills. The materials included glass, polypropylene carpet,
   latex-painted drywall, ceramic tiles, vinyl floor tiles, and gypsum
   ceiling tiles. For each surface concentration, an equilibrium
   concentration was determined in the vapour phase of the surrounding air.
   Vapor concentrations depended upon initial surface concentration,
   temperature, and type of building material. A time-weighted average
   (TWA) concentration in the air was used to quantify the health risk
   associated with the inhalation of lindane vapors. Transformation
   products of lindane, namely alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane and
   pentachlorocyclohexene, were detected in the vapour phase at both
   temperatures and for all of the test materials. Their formation was
   greater on glass and ceramic tiles, compared to other building
   materials. An empiric Sips isotherm model was employed to approximate
   experimental results and to estimate the release of lindane and its
   transformation products. This helped determine the extent of

Abstract = {{Oscillometry is the most common measurement method used in electronic
   blood pressure (BP) monitors. However, most of the existing
   oscillometric algorithms employ empirical ratios on the oscillometric
   waveform envelope (OMWE) to determine the systolic pressure (SP) and
   diastolic pressure (DP). As these algorithms do not consider the
   cardiovascular system parameters that may vary due to health conditions
   or age, the pressure estimates are not always reliable. In this paper,
   we develop a new mathematical model for the OMWE by incorporating an
   existing model of the cuff-arm-artery system. The unique feature of our
   developed model is that it explicitly represents the relationship
   between the OMWE and the SP and DP. Based on our developed model, we
   propose a new ratio-independent oscillometric BP estimation method. The
   proposed method is based on minimizing the sum of the squared errors
   between our model and the OMWE using the trust-region-reflective
   algorithm. Our proposed method is validated in a pilot study against
   Omron HEM-790IT and BpTRU BMP-100 BP monitors. It is found that the mean
   absolute error of the proposed method in estimating SP and DP is 4.60
   and 4.53 mmHg, respectively, relative to the Omron monitor, and 3.66 and
   2.84 mmHg, respectively, relative to the BpTRU monitor. The proposed
   model thus shows promise toward developing robust BP estimation methods.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic mechanical thermoanalysis (DMTA) was conducted on compacted
   specimens of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H), 1.4 nm tobermorite,
   jennite, and compacted hydrated Portland cement paste powders, as well
   as hardened cement paste. The synthetic silicates are key elements for
   compositional models of the hydrated calcium silicates present in cement
   paste. The study focuses on the nanostructural effects due to the
   removal of water from the 11 \% RH condition. The DMTA results (E' and
   tana, versus temperature curves) in the 25-110 A degrees C range
   mimicked those of DMA (E' and tana, versus mass loss curves) conducted
   at room temperature for C-S-H and cement paste. In addition, the DMTA
   curves for 1.4 nm tobermorite and jennite in the temperature range
   110-300 A degrees C were sensitive to phase changes including the
   transition of 1.4 nm tobermorite to 1.1 nm tobermorite and other forms,
   as well as the transition of jennite to metajennite. The DMTA curves of
   a 50/50 mixture of 1.4 nm tobermorite and jennite exhibit similarities
   and differences to that of hydrated cement paste that are influenced by
   porosity and the amorphous nature of C-S-H in the cement paste. The

Abstract = {{The widespread availability of broadband internet access and the growth
   in server-based processing have provided an opportunity to run games
   away from the player into the cloud and offer a new promising service
   known as cloud gaming. The concept of cloud gaming is to render a game
   in the cloud and stream the resulting game scenes to the player as a
   video sequence over a broadband connection. To meet the stringent
   network bandwidth requirements of cloud gaming and support more players,
   efficient bit rate reduction techniques are needed. In this paper, we
   introduce the concept of game attention model (GAM), which is basically
   a game context-based visual attention model, as a means for reducing the
   bit rate of the streaming video more efficiently. GAM estimates the
   importance of each macro-block in a game frame from the player's
   perspective and allows encoding the less important macro-blocks with
   lower bit rate. We have evaluated nine game video sequences, covering a
   wide range of game genre and a spectrum of scene content in terms of
   details, motion and brightness. Our subjective assessment shows that by
   integrating this model into the cloud gaming framework, it is possible
   to decrease the required bit rate by nearly 25 \% on average, while
   maintaining a relatively high user quality of experience. This clearly
   enables players with limited communication resources to benefit from
   cloud gaming with acceptable quality.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that the cold-gas dynamic spraying process, or simply
   cold spray, is a suitable technique to manufacture nanoscale energetic
   materials with high reactivity and low porosity. The current study
   focuses on the Ni-Al system, for which the reactivity has been increased
   by an initial mechanical activation achieved by the ball-milling
   technique, leading to lamellar nanostructured composite particles. The
   consolidation of this nanoscale energetic material using the cold-gas
   dynamic spray technique permits to retain the feedstock powder nanoscale
   structure in the coatings, which in turn retain the high reactivity
   features of the powder. However, it has been noticed that the stagnation
   temperature during the spray can lead to partial reaction of the highly
   reactive feedstock powder, which directly influences the reactivity of
   the coatings. In this study, different stages of the spray process were
   investigated: (i) the in-flight behavior of the nanoscale energetic
   material (powder) at different stagnation temperatures (from 300 to 800
   A degrees C); (ii) the substrate-temperature evolution as the function
   of gas temperature; and (iii) the impact of the powder on the substrate,
   related to particle's velocity and its influence on the nanostructure of
   the particles.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Estimating the body shape and posture of a dressed human subject in
   motion represented as a sequence of (possibly incomplete) 3D meshes is
   important for virtual change rooms and security. To solve this problem,
   statistical shape spaces encoding human body shape and posture
   variations are commonly used to constrain the search space for the shape
   estimate. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses a
   posture-invariant shape space to model body shape variation combined
   with a skeleton-based deformation to model posture variation. Our method
   can estimate the body shape and posture of both static scans and motion
   sequences of human body scans with clothing that fits relatively closely
   to the body. In case of motion sequences, our method takes advantage of
   motion cues to solve for a single body shape estimate along with a
   sequence of posture estimates. We apply our approach to both static
   scans and motion sequences and demonstrate that using our method, higher
   fitting accuracy is achieved than when using a variant of the popular
   SCAPE model {[}2,18] as statistical model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we optimized the performance of a 2.4 GHz variable gain

   then the tunable on-chip switching stage method was applied to control
   the amplifier gain when the input signal increases. The optimization was
   performed in terms of gain, noise figure (NF), IIP3 and power
   dissipation. The LNA has achieved a variable gain from 16.55 to 20.45 dB
   with excellent NF between 1.63 and 1.74 dB. Furthermore, the proposed
   circuit achieves a third order input intercept point of 6.6 dBm. It

Abstract = {{Regarding the carbon emissions allocation principles, whether historical
   responsibility can be and how to be incorporated into the global climate
   framework is still under heated discussions. Here we argue that the
   permits share of most developed countries will sharply shrink when
   historical responsibilities are taken in through our assessment and
   comparison of six selected allocation proposals. To find a more
   convincing way of responsibility shift, we modify the existing method by
   giving each participant an independent year, decided by comparing its
   economic development with reference to China, as the start point to
   calculate its own responsibilities quantified by the historical
   cumulative emissions. Then we obtain carbon emission accounts of 137
   countries and regions on the basis of per-capita cumulative emissions.
   Compared with the conventional method, there is an average 2.5\%
   increase in emission deficits of the U.S.A, Canada and Japan, however, a
   50\% decline in emission deficits of OECD Europe; emission revenues of
   China, India and Brazil decrease by 39\%. This paper presents a
   systematic and quantitative method to achieve a common but
   differentiated responsibility shift, not only between developed and
   developing countries but also within industrialized countries, in the
   hope of providing the framework for rational allocation of carbon
   emissions to be deliberated in the forthcoming climate change program of
   the United Nations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria in real-world samples, in which
   low concentration target bacteria usually coexist with a large quantity
   of interfering particles, is very important in many areas related to
   public health. In this study, we present our recent efforts in detecting
   low concentration bacteria in complex media that contain interfering
   particles and background noise using a microchip-based flow cytometer
   (i.e., microcytometer). To achieve this goal, low concentration 1.00 mu
   m YG fluorescent beads, model particles for bacteria, were first
   detected in the presence of both a great number of polystyrene beads and
   fluorescence background noise using a microcytometer developed in this
   study. The microcytometer was further used to detect low concentrations
   of FITC labeled bacteria E. coli DH5 alpha in the presence of a large
   quantity of interfering beads and FITC fluorescence background noise. We
   show that the FITC labeled E. coli DH5 alpha cells at concentrations as
   low as 431 cells/mL were detected by the microcytometer with
   efficiencies of over 86\% in complex media that contained high
   concentration (i.e., 4.89 x 10(7) particles/mL) blank interfering beads
   (d=4.50 mu m) with 0.5 mu M FITC fluorescein as fluorescence background.
   This translates to detection of one target bacterial cell from
   approximately 1 x 105 interfering particles. Unlike other reports, this
   is the first report that studied detection of low concentration bacteria
   by a microcytometer in complex sample media. The outstanding detection
   performances of the microcytometer demonstrated by this study strongly
   suggest that microcytometers are indeed very promising candidate for
   detection of pathogenic bacteria in real-world samples. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We consider a flexible bio-inspired slender mechanism, modeled as a
   Timoshenko beam. It is coupled to the environment by a continuous
   distribution of compliant elements. We derive a reduced order model by
   projecting the governing partial differential equations along the linear
   modal basis of the Timoshenko beam. The coupling with the substrate
   allows us to formulate the problem in a control framework, and
   eventually to treat the system as a sensor to reconstruct the profile of
   the substrate through the deformation of the body. The coupling is
   modeled in the framework of two parameters elastic foundations. The
   convergence of the reduced order model with increasing number of basis
   functions is addressed in a suitable H-1 error norm. A closed loop force
   control is simulated for shape morphing when the system is coupled with
   a smooth substrate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vibration signals from complex structures such as wind turbine (WT)
   planetary gearboxes are intricate. Reliable analysis of such signals is
   the key to success in fault detection and diagnosis for complex
   structures. The recently proposed iterative atomic decomposition
   thresholding (IADT) method has shown to be effective in extracting true
   constituent components of complicated signals and in suppressing
   background noise interferences. In this study, such properties of the
   IADT are exploited to analyze and extract the target signal components
   from complex signals with a focus on WT planetary gearboxes under
   constant running conditions. Fault diagnosis for WT planetary gearboxes
   has been a very important yet challenging issue due to their harsh
   working conditions and complex structures. Planetary gearbox fault
   diagnosis relies on detecting the presence of gear characteristic
   frequencies or monitoring their magnitude changes. However, a planetary
   gearbox vibration signal is a mixture of multiple complex components due
   to the unique structure, complex kinetics and background noise. As such,
   the IADT is applied to enhance the gear characteristic frequencies of
   interest, and thereby diagnose gear faults. Considering the spectral
   properties of planetary gearbox vibration signals, we propose to use
   Fourier dictionary in the IADT so as to match the harmonic waves in
   frequency domain and pinpoint the gear fault characteristic frequency.
   To reduce computing time and better target at more relevant signal
   components, we also suggest a criterion to estimate the number of sparse
   components to be used by the IADT. The performance of the proposed
   approach in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis has been evaluated through
   analyzing the numerically simulated, lab experimental and on-site
   collected signals. The results show that both localized and distributed
   gear faults, both the sun and planet gear faults, can be diagnosed
   successfully. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Bedrock erosion in rivers sets the pace of landscape evolution,
   influences the evolution of orogens and determines the size, shape and
   relief of mountains(1,2). A variety of models link fluid flow and
   sediment transport processes to bedrock incision in canyons. The model
   components that represent sediment transport processes are increasingly
   well developed(3-5). In contrast, the model components being used to
   represent fluid flow are largely untested because there are no
   observations of the flow structure in bedrock canyons. Here we present a
   524-kilometre, continuous centreline, acoustic Doppler current profiler
   survey of the Fraser Canyon in western Canada, which includes 42
   individual bedrock canyons. Our observations of three-dimensional flow
   structure reveal that, as water enters the canyons, a high-velocity core
   follows the bed surface, causing a velocity inversion (high velocities
   near the bed and low velocities at the surface). The plunging water then
   upwells along the canyon walls, resulting in counter-rotating,
   along-stream coherent flow structures that diverge near the bed. The
   resulting flow structure promotes deep scour in the bedrock channel
   floor and undercutting of the canyon walls. This provides a mechanism
   for channel widening and ensures that the base of the walls is swept
   clear of the debris that is often deposited there, keeping the walls
   nearly vertical. These observations reveal that the flow structure in
   bedrock canyons is more complex than assumed in the models presently
   used. Fluid flow models that capture the essence of the
   three-dimensional flow field, using simple phenomenological rules that
   are computationally tractable, are required to capture the dynamic
   coupling between flow, bedrock erosion and solid-Earth dynamics.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{181-196}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{A distortional theory is developed for the analysis of doubly symmetric
   and mono-symmetric wide flange beams under general loading. The
   governing differential equations of equilibrium and associated boundary
   conditions are derived based on the principle of potential energy. The
   theory captures shear deformation effects in the web and local and
   global warping effects. In contrast to classical beam theories, the
   present study captures web distortion by accounting for its flexibility
   within the plane of the cross-section while considering the flanges as
   Euler-Bernoulli beams. The formulation yields two systems of coupled
   differential equations of equilibrium in seven displacements fields. The
   first system governs the longitudinal transverse response and involves
   three displacement fields, and the second system governs the lateral
   torsional response and involves four displacement fields. Closed form
   solutions are then developed for both coupled systems under general
   loading. Numerical solutions for practical problems are then provided to
   illustrate the applicability of the formulation. Comparisons to results
   based on 3D shell finite element solutions show the validity of the
   results. The theory preserves the relative simplicity of one dimensional
   beam theories while effectively capturing the three-dimensional
   distortional phenomena normally captured within computationally
   expensive 3D FEA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{NiO nanoparticles of 70, 91 and 107 nm average diameter are synthesized
   by cathodic contact glow discharge electrolysis at 30, 36 and 42 VDC
   respectively, in 2 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M ethanol + 2.5 mg ml(-1) of PVP, and
   are investigated for electrochemical energy storage. From the cyclic
   voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements in 1 M KOH,
   it was found that a maximum specific capacitance of 218 F g(-1) is
   achieved with the 70 nm NiO nanoparticles at 2.7 A g(-1). Larger
   nanoparticles of 91 and 107 nm diameter exhibit specific capacitances of
   106 and 63 F g(-1), respectively, suggesting a size-dependent capacitive
   performance enhanced with decreasing particles size. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study membranes were fabricated from the blend of high (H) and
   low (L) molecular weights poly(vinylidene fluoride) by the phase
   inversion process. The membranes so fabricated were characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy, gas permeation tests, contact angle (CA)
   and liquid entry pressure of water (LEPw) measurement, and further
   subjected to vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) in a scenario that was
   applicable for cooling processes, where the feed water temperature was
   maintained at 27 degrees C. It was found that the H:L mixing ratio did
   not affect the membrane surface hydrophobicity (as reflected by the CA)
   significantly. The water vapor flux of VMD was found to be the highest
   at the intermediate range of H:L ratio, i.e., 4:6, at which the
   thickness of the sponge-like layer showed a minimum, the pore size
   showed a maximum, the finger-like macro-voids formed a more orderly
   single-layer structure, and the LEPw showed a minimum. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Coffee is a valuable beverage crop due to its characteristic flavor,
   aroma, and the stimulating effects of caffeine. We generated a
   high-quality draft genome of the species Coffea canephora, which
   displays a conserved chromosomal gene order among asterid angiosperms.
   Although it shows no sign of the whole-genome triplication identified in
   Solanaceae species such as tomato, the genome includes several
   species-specific gene family expansions, among them N-methyltransferases
   (NMTs) involved in caffeine production, defense-related genes, and
   alkaloid and flavonoid enzymes involved in secondary compound synthesis.
   Comparative analyses of caffeine NMTs demonstrate that these genes
   expanded through sequential tandem duplications independently of genes
   from cacao and tea, suggesting that caffeine in eudicots is of
   polyphyletic origin.}},

Abstract = {{QoS routing plays a critical role in providing QoS support in the
   Internet. Most existing QoS routing algorithms employ the strategy of
   unidirectional search in route selection. Bidirectional search has been
   recognized as an effective strategy for fast route acquisition in
   identifying the shortest path connecting a pair of nodes. However, its
   efficiency has not been well established in the context of route
   selection subject to multiple additive constraints, which is in general
   NP-Complete. In this paper, we study how to employ bidirectional search
   to support efficient QoS routing subject to multiple additive
   constraints. The major contributions in this paper are as follows.
   First, we propose a k shortest path algorithm using bidirectional
   search, whose complexity is deduced to be O(root k vertical bar V
   vertical bar lg(vertical bar V vertical bar) + k vertical bar E vertical
   bar), where vertical bar V vertical bar and vertical bar E vertical bar
   represent the number of nodes and links in the network, respectively.
   Second, we show that bidirectional search can significantly accelerate
   the convergence of several existing QoS routing algorithms. Third, we
   propose a novel cost-effective bidirectional multi-constrained routing
   algorithm, which can greatly alleviate the forwarding state scalability
   issue by supporting stateless QoS routing in IP networks via IP
   tunneling or constraints-based alternate routing in MPLS networks via
   label stacks. It has the fastest known on-line running time O(vertical
   bar V vertical bar). Theoretical and simulation results are given to
   demonstrate the high performance of our proposed algorithm in
   identifying QoS-satisfied paths and also in efficient resource
   utilization as compared with existing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of Cloisite 15A (R) Clay (CC) and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine
   (TAP) to enhance the transport properties of sulfonated poly ether ether
   ketone (SPEEK) nanocomposite membrane, which is a promising candidate
   for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) application, was investigated. The
   central composite design (CCD) of the response surface method (RSM) was
   utilized to optimize the content of incorporated additives in SPEEK
   nanocomposite membrane and predict its performance. Three models
   correlating the independent parameters (contents of added CC and TAP)
   and the responses (proton conductivity, methanol permeability and
   selectivity) were developed and verified with experimental data. The
   optimum parameters for achieving highest performance represented by
   methanol permeability of 2.56 x 10(-6) (cm/s), proton conductivity of
   17.12 (mS/cm(2)) and membrane selectivity of 55773.7 sS/cm(3) were
   obtained at contents of CC and TAP of 2.92 and 5.68 wt\%, respectively.
   The deviation of the corresponding experimental data was found to be in
   an acceptable range, confirming the suitability of RSM for predicting
   the membrane performance and optimizing the additives contents. The
   membrane with optimum additives content showed an improved structure as
   revealed by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to investigate extremum problems with pay-off
   being the total variation distance metric defined on the space of
   probability measures, subject to linear functional constraints on the
   space of probability measures, and vice-versa; that is, with the roles
   of total variation metric and linear functional interchanged. Utilizing
   concepts from signed measures, the extremum probability measures of such
   problems are obtained in closed form, by identifying the partition of
   the support set and the mass of these extremum measures on the
   partition. The results are derived for abstract spaces; specifically,
   complete separable metric spaces known as Polish spaces, while the high
   level ideas are also discussed for denumerable spaces endowed with the
   discrete topology. These extremum problems often arise in many areas,
   such as, approximating a family of probability distributions by a given
   probability distribution, maximizing or minimizing entropy subject to
   total variation distance metric constraints, quantifying uncertainty of
   probability distributions by total variation distance metric, stochastic
   minimax control, and in many problems of information, decision theory,
   and minimax theory.}},

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes is one of several Gram-positive bacteria known to
   contain an auxiliary ATPase (SecA2) involved in the Sec secretion of a
   subset of proteins important to bacterial pathogenesis, including
   autolysins. It is not known if IspC, a novel surface-associated
   autolysin essential for full virulence of L. monocytogenes serotype 4b,
   is SecA2-dependent for secretion. By creating a secA2 gene deletion
   (secA2) mutant from the wild type (WT) L. monocytogenes serotype 4b
   strain, in combination with the proteomic analysis of surface proteins
   and those secreted into the medium from both the mutant and the WT, we
   confirmed previous findings that two autolysins (p60 and NamA) are
   SecA2-dependent for secretion. However, this approach did not identify
   IspC as one of the surface proteins affected by the SecA2 deletion.
   Further experiments with immunofluorescence microscopy and Western
   blotting indicated that IspC was well displayed on the surface of both
   the secA2 mutant and WT cells, while p60 was not, clearly indicating
   that the secretion of IspC is not attributed to the SecA2 pathway. This
   finding sets IspC apart from other autolysins involved in virulence,
   such as p60 and NamA, in that SecA2 is not required for IspC secretion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents lossless prefix codes optimized with respect to a
   payoff criterion consisting of a convex combination of maximum codeword
   length and average codeword length. The optimal codeword lengths
   obtained are based on a new coding algorithm, which transforms the
   initial source probability vector into a new probability vector
   according to a merging rule. The coding algorithm is equivalent to a
   partition of the source alphabet into disjoint sets on which a new
   transformed probability vector is defined as a function of the initial
   source probability vector and scalar parameter. The payoff criterion
   considered encompasses a tradeoff between maximum and average codeword
   length; it is related to a payoff criterion consisting of a convex
   combination of average codeword length and average of an exponential
   function of the codeword length, and to an average codeword length
   payoff criterion subject to a limited length constraint. A special case
   of the first related payoff is connected to coding problems involving
   source probability uncertainty and codeword overflow probability,
   whereas the second related payoff compliments limited length Huffman
   coding algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A new technique for synthesizing reflectarray antennas is presented. It
   utilizes fragmented elements in a manner that allows the elements of the
   reflectarray to be shaped-optimized so that a high degree of geometrical
   similarity is maintained between adjacent elements. The implication is
   that in a reflectarray of such elements each element will see an
   electromagnetic environment that more closely emulates the infinite
   periodic one used to compute the element properties. We show
   experimentally that this indeed results in aperture efficiencies closely
   approaching the upper bounds achievable for some selected feed system,
   and offers a significant improvement over that obtained with
   conventional reflectarrays (that is, those not using
   similarity-synthesized fragmented elements). It is also shown that a
   reflectarray surface that uses fragmented elements can be simultaneously
   patterned with a visual image while still closely maintaining the
   desired reflection phase from its surface to yield a high-gain antenna.}},

Abstract = {{Securing networked control systems (NCSs) from cyber attacks has been a
   very important issue to keep NCSs reliable and stable. Most existing
   efforts tackling this issue treat cyber attacks as model-based
   disturbances to NCSs. But the reality is that intelligent attackers will
   not follow any prescribed models and in fact they are able to change
   their attack strategies dynamically and randomly. In this paper, we
   address this problem and present an optimal defense mechanism for the
   NCS under jamming attacks based on the stochastic game theory. A
   two-player zero-sum stochastic game is formulated to model the dynamic
   interactions between a jammer (attacker) and a sensor transmitter
   (defender) in the NCS. In this stochastic game, the cost function
   includes not only the resource costs used to conduct cyber-layer defense
   and attack actions, but also the possible degraded dynamic performance
   (indexed by a quadratic state error) of the NCS. With this cost
   function, the impacts of the interactions between the attacker and the
   defender on the dynamic performance of the NCS are taken into account
   when the two players design/change their cyber-layer strategies. The
   optimal defense mechanism is obtained by solving a stochastic dynamic
   programming (SDP) problem. Simulation and comparison studies show that
   the packet-loss rate of the communication channel of the NCS has been
   greatly reduced and the dynamic performance of the NCS being attacked by
   an intelligent jammer is much improved when the proposed defense
   mechanism is deployed. (C) 2014 The Franklin Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{Elasmobranchs (e.g. sharks and rays), like all fishes, grow continuously
   throughout life. Unlike other vertebrates, their skeletons are primarily
   cartilaginous, comprising a hyaline cartilage-like core, stiffened by a
   thin outer array of mineralized, abutting and interconnected tiles
   called tesserae. Tesserae bear active mineralization fronts at all
   margins and the tesseral layer is thin enough to section without
   decalcifying, making this a tractable but largely unexamined system for
   investigating controlled apatite mineralization, while also offering a
   potential analog for endochondral ossification. The chemical mechanism
   for tesserae mineralization has not been described, but has been
   previously attributed to spherical precursors, and alkaline phosphatase
   (ALP) activity. Here, we use a variety of techniques to elucidate the
   involvement of phosphorus-containing precursors in the formation of
   tesserae at their mineralization fronts. Using Raman spectroscopy,
   fluorescence microscopy and histological methods, we demonstrate that
   ALP activity is located with inorganic phosphate polymers (polyp) at the
   tessera-uncalcified cartilage interface, suggesting a potential
   mechanism for regulated mineralization: inorganic phosphate (Pi) can be
   cleaved from polyP by ALP, thus making Pi locally available for apatite
   biomineralization. The application of exogenous ALP to tissue
   cross-sections resulted in the disappearance of polyP and the appearance
   of Pi in uncalcified cartilage adjacent to mineralization fronts. We
   propose that elasmobranch skeletal cells control apatite
   biomineralization by biochemically controlling polyP and ALP production,
   placement and activity. Previous identification of polyp and ALP shown
   previously in mammalian calcifying cartilage supports the hypothesis
   that this mechanism may be a general regulating feature in the
   mineralization of vertebrate skeletons. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of surface area
   loading rates (SALRs) and hydraulic retention times (HRTs) in moving bed
   bioreactor (MBBR) systems on the morphology and thickness of the
   attached biofilm along with subsequent effects on particle size
   distribution and the settling characteristics of the biologically
   produced solids. The morphology of biofilm attached to the MBBR carriers
   changed from a porous biofilm to a biofilm with a more filamentous
   structure throughout the study at various operating conditions without
   observable correlation with SALR and HRT. Although, biofilm morphology
   did not demonstrate an effect on the biologically produced solids
   observed in this study, the thinnest biofilms resulted in the highest
   concentration of solids in the effluent. Furthermore, the particle size
   distribution analysis demonstrated that both higher SALRs and longer
   HRTs resulted in a shift towards larger-sized particles. Increases in
   SALR and HRT, independent of each other, also showed increases in
   effluent solid concentration and lower settleability of the solids.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion of a plume of dye in uniformly sheared turbulent flow in a
   water tunnel was investigated using simultaneous stereoscopic particle
   image velocimetry (SPIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF).
   Maps of the mean concentration and the turbulent concentration fluxes in
   planes normal to the plume axis were constructed, from which all
   components of the second-order turbulent diffusivity tensor were
   determined for the first time. Good agreement between the corresponding
   apparent and true diffusivities was observed. The turbulent diffusivity
   tensor was found to have strong off-diagonal components, whereas the
   streamwise component appeared to be counter-gradient. The different
   terms in the advection-diffusion equation were estimated from the
   measurements and their relative significance was discussed. All observed
   phenomena were explained by physical arguments and the results were
   compared to previous ones.}},

Abstract = {{A microwave photonic Hilbert transformer (MPHT) with a single passband
   and wide frequency tunable range based on a single passband microwave
   photonic filter (MPF) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The
   MPF is implemented using a broadband light source and a Mach-Zehnder
   interferometer (MZI) incorporating a phase modulator in one arm and a
   phase-shifted chirped fiber Bragg grating in the other arm. The optical
   signal at the output of the MZI is sent to a dispersion compensating
   fiber, and then, detected at a photodetector. The overall operation
   corresponds to a single passband MPF with a p phase-shift at the center
   of the passband, which has the frequency response corresponding to a
   microwave Hilbert transformer. The central frequency of the MPHT can be
   continuously tuned by tuning the length difference between the two arms
   of the MZI using a tunable delay line. A theoretical analysis is
   performed, which is verified by simulations and an experiment. In the
   experiment, an MPHT with a bandwidth of 1.70 GHz and a continuously
   tunable frequency from 5 to 15 GHz is demonstrated. The proposed MPHT
   can find applications in multi-channel microwave communications systems,
   where simultaneous channel selection and Hilbert transformation are
   needed.}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{A major limiting factor of forward osmosis (FO) membrane, particularly
   in pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) mode, is fouling by natural organic
   matters. In this work, we investigated the effect of the nanocomposite
   substrate on the fouling of a thin film nanocomposite (TEN) membrane due
   to organic foulants in PRO mode. The TFN membrane was synthesized by
   coating a polyamide film over the surface of substrate made of
   polysulfone-titanium dioxide. The TFN membrane always showed much higher
   FO water flux than the typical thin film composite TFC membrane prepared
   from the pristine polysulfone substrate. Reduced internal concentration
   polarization following a significant decrease of the structural
   parameter in the nanocomposite substrate causes the mass transfer
   coefficient of the substrate to increase. In the PRO mode, BSA removal
   in the presence of Ca2+ confirmed that the TEN FO membrane could
   significantly mitigate fouling tendency compared to a typical TFC
   membrane. Results also showed that fouling in TEN FO is highly
   reversible, recovering >92\% permeate flux after a simple water rinse
   process. A complete study of the membrane fouling was reported with
   detailed scientific discussion. To the best of our knowledge, this is
   the first report on the effect of the nanocomposite membrane on membrane
   fouling in PRO mode. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is on the behavior of inorganic fuel components
   since the end goal is to develop a CFD model which includes inorganic
   matter transformations. Using CanmetENERGY's 1 MWth gasifier, five
   gasification tests have been completed with three different coal fuels
   and a limestone as fluxant. The refractory liner from the upper section
   of the gasifier was removed for analysis after each test. The liners
   were made of sintered alumina or castable alumina-chromia refractory.
   Carbon conversions and cold gas efficiencies for the gasification tests
   ranged within 97.0-99.6\% and 33.7-61.9\%, respectively. Solid samples
   from the refractory liners, in-situ gas sampling probe sheaths and
   impingers, the slag tap, the slag pot, quench discharge water and
   scrubber water were collected and characterized. Char and fly ash
   samples indicate that most of the inorganic matter melted and formed
   spheres. Devolatilization and interaction with the gasifier refractory
   affected the composition of slag collected from the gasifier. Signs of
   refractory spalling/erosion were detected. The slag layers formed on the
   alumina liners are smooth with some rivulets and spotting. The slag
   layers formed on the alumina-chromia liners are rough and bubbly. Slag
   penetration fractions were determined for all liners. (C) 2014 Crown

Abstract = {{We study the Art Gallery Problem for face guards in polyhedral
   environments. The problem can be informally stated as: how many (not
   necessarily convex) windows should we place on the external walls of a
   dark building, in order to completely illuminate its interior?
   We consider both closed and open face guards (i.e., faces with or
   without their boundary), and we study several classes of polyhedra,
   including orthogonal polyhedra, 4-oriented polyhedra, and 2-reflex
   orthostacks.
   We give upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of faces required
   to guard the interior of a given polyhedron in each of these classes, in
   terms of the total number of its faces, f. In several cases our bounds
   are tight: {[}f/6] open face guards for orthogonal polyhedra and
   2-reflex orthostacks, and {[}f/4] open face guards for 4-oriented
   polyhedra. Additionally, for closed face guards in 2-reflex orthostacks,
   we give a lower bound of {[}(f + 3)/9] and an upper bound of {[}(f +
   1)/7].
   Then we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of
   (closed or open) face guards within a factor of Omega(log f), even for
   polyhedra that are orthogonal and simply connected. We also obtain the
   same hardness results for polyhedral terrains.
   Along the way we discuss some applications, arguing that face guards are
   not a reasonable model for guards patrolling on the surface of a
   polyhedron. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility of gold}},
Journal = {{OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{We critically analyze reported measured values of the third-order
   nonlinear optical susceptibility chi((3)) of bulk gold. Reported values
   of this quantity span a range of more than three orders of magnitude.
   Much of this variation results from the use of different measurement
   procedures which are sensitive to different contributions to the
   nonlinear optical response. For example, values measured through use of
   third-harmonic generation or non-degenerate four-wave mixing tend to be
   significantly lower than those obtained from measurements of the
   intensity-dependent refractive index. We ascribe this behavior to the
   fact that the first two processes respond only to ``instantaneous{''}
   nonlinearities, whereas the nonlinear refractive index has a
   contribution from the much stronger but much slower ``hot electron,{''}
   or ``Fermi-smearing{''} mechanism, which has a response time of the
   order of picoseconds. The data also reveal that the hot-electron
   contribution has a strong dependence on laser wavelength, because of the
   turn-on of the 5d to 6sp transition at about 550 nm It is hoped that the
   compilation presented here will prove useful in establishing what value
   of chi((3)) is most appropriate for adoption under various laboratory
   conditions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{226-239}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a musical-noise-free blind speech extraction
   method using a microphone array for application to nonstationary noise.
   In our previous study, it was found that optimized iterative spectral
   subtraction (SS) results in speech enhancement with almost no musical
   noise generation, but this method is valid only for stationary noise.
   The proposed method consists of iterative blind dynamic noise estimation
   by, e.g., independent component analysis (ICA) or multichannel Wiener
   filtering, and musical-noise-free speech extraction by modified
   iterative SS, where multiple iterative SS is applied to each channel
   while maintaining the multichannel property reused for the dynamic noise
   estimators. Also, in relation to the proposed method, we discuss the
   justification of applying ICA to signals nonlinearly distorted by SS.
   From objective and subjective evaluations simulating a real-world
   hands-free speech communication system, we reveal that the proposed
   method outperforms the conventional methods. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Conventional sampling techniques may not be able to meet the
   ever-increasing demand for increased bandwidth from modern
   communications and radar signals. Optical time-stretched sampling has
   been considered an effective solution for wideband microwave signal
   processing. Here, we demonstrate a significantly increased stretching
   factor in the photonic time-stretched sampling of a fast microwave
   waveform. The microwave waveform to be sampled is intensity modulated on
   a chirped optical pulse generated jointly by a mode-locked laser and a
   length of dispersion compensating fiber. The pulse is then injected into
   an optical dispersive loop that includes an erbium-doped fiber amplifier
   and is stretched by a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating multiple
   times in the loop. A record stretching factor of 36 is achieved based on
   an equivalent group delay dispersion coefficient of 12; 000 ps/nm. This
   result could help address the new challenges imposed on signal
   processors to operate at a very high sampling rate. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{The embodiment of polyaniline in situ modified halloysite nanotubes
   (PANi-HNTs) on the gas permeation properties of CO2, CH4, O-2, and N-2
   gases in polysulfone (PSf) membrane has been investigated. Halloysite
   nanotubes (HNTs) were modified by in situ polymerization of aniline.
   Asymmetric mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were synthesized by varying the
   PANi-HNTs concentrations of 0.5-2.5 wt.\% of polymer in the PSf
   solutions. The MMMs were characterized by SEM, ATR-IR, DSC and XRD.
   Membrane characterization reveals the structural change of the filler
   and interaction of PANi with PSf polymer matrix. The permeance of pure
   gases and the ideal selectivities were determined using an indigenously
   built high-pressure gas separation manifold. Increasing the PANi-HNTs
   incorporation in polymer enhanced the permeance of CO2 from 17.4 to 68.4

Abstract = {{Surface modified polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes
   (HFMs) were spun via dry-wet spinning technique at different air-gap
   lengths (0-20 cm). The morphology of prepared membranes was evaluated by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
   Membranes were also characterized in terms of gas permeation, overall
   porosity, collapsing pressure, critical water entry pressure (CEPw) and
   contact angle. To determine the CO2 absorption flux of HFMs, a
   gas-liquid membrane contactor system was used. Experimental results of
   this study revealed that by increasing the air-gap distance from 0 to 20
   cm, wetting resistance and contact angle of fabricated membranes
   increased due to enhancement of membrane surface hydrophobicity. The
   highest helium (He) permeation was achieved for the spun fiber at the
   air-gap of 10 cm. From CO2 absorption experiment it was found that the
   hollow fiber spun at the air-gap of 10 cm had the maximum CO2 absorption
   flux of 1.41 x 10(-3) mol/m(2) s at the absorbent flow rate of 300
   ml/min, which was significantly higher than CO2 absorption flux obtained
   by other researchers. It was also found that both highest He gas
   permeance and CO2 absorption flux were controlled by the surface
   porosity of the hollow fiber due to the maximum values obtained. Thus,
   the choice of an appropriate air-gap distance for fabrication of surface
   modified membranes was found to be a promising method to improve CO2
   removal in membrane contactor systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Hydraulic shock absorbers have been widely used to dissipate kinetic
   energy of the shocks into surrounding environment. By employing
   oscillatory motion to drive power generator, the shock energy can be
   converted into electricity for harvesting. However, the frequent
   bidirectional oscillation of the generator can cause a large impact
   force. This further leads to deteriorated energy harvesting performance,
   moving parts fatigue, and even system failure. As such, this study
   introduces four check values to form a hydraulic rectifier to integrate
   the shock absorption and energy harvesting functionalities. The
   bidirectional oscillation of the shock and the vibration is converted
   into unidirectional rotation to drive the generator. Following the
   proposed concept, a prototype energy-harvesting shock absorber has been
   designed and fabricated. An electromechanical model has also been
   developed to examine the response behavior of the prototype device. The
   prototype performance has been characterized based on the experimental
   results from three test setups. Both mechanical and electrical
   parameters of the electromechanical model have been identified based on
   our cyclic loading experiments. The results have shown that the
   developed energy-harvesting shock absorber is capable of harvesting the
   energy and absorbing the shock simultaneously. In our experiments, a
   maximum of 248.8 W instantaneous power (a maximum of 114.1 W on average)
   has been captured and a maximum of 38.81\% energy harvesting efficiency
   has been achieved via harmonic excitation with an amplitude of 8 mm and
   a frequency of 2 Hz, when the load resistance is tuned to 7.5 Omega. (C)

Abstract = {{Nonlinear diffusion equations are extensively applicable in diverse
   fields of science and engineering. Numerical stability is a common
   concern in this class of equations. In the present study, a three-stage
   third-order diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) scheme is introduced
   by optimizing the error and linear stability analysis for a commonly
   used nonlinear diffusive system in atmospheric boundary layer. The
   proposed scheme is stable for a wide range of time steps and able to
   resolve different diffusive systems with diagnostic turbulence closures,
   or prognostic ones with a diagnostic length scale, with enhanced
   accuracy and stability compared to current schemes. It maintains
   A-stability, which makes it appropriate for the solution of stiff
   problems. The procedure implemented in this study is quite general and
   can be used in other diffusive systems as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Anti-traffic analysis attack for location privacy in WSNs}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Traditional encryption and authentication methods are not effective in
   preserving a sink's location privacy from a global adversary that is
   monitoring the network traffic. In this paper, we first propose a novel
   anti-traffic analysis (ATA) method to preserve the sink's location
   privacy. In order to confuse a local or global adversary, each node
   generates dummy messages, the number of which is dependent on the number
   of the node's children. Hence, ATA is able to prevent the adversary from
   acquiring valuable information on the sink's location through the
   traffic analysis attack. However, a larger number of dummy messages lead
   to consumption of extra energy. Then, we design our improved ATA (IATA)
   in such a way that we select some sensors to act as fake sinks, to
   ensure that sensors around fake sinks generate dummy messages and
   discard received dummy messages. Since the problem of the optimal fake
   sinks' placement is nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard, we
   employ local search heuristics based on network traffic and security
   entropy. Performance analysis of the ATA scheme can protect the sink's
   location privacy, and IATA scheme can reduce energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Passive Optical Networks (PON) are recognized as a fundamental component
   of high-speed network access, and emerge as a solid networking solution
   for the smart grid. Smart grid aims to incorporate two-way
   communications between the customers and the utility, for the purposes
   of advanced monitoring and intelligent control of demand and supply of
   electricity. At the user-end, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are ideal
   tools for energy consumption monitoring at residential premises, as well
   as, event and ambient monitoring at substations, power lines and vaults.
   In this paper, we target a seamless integration of WSN technology with
   PONs to provide Quality of Service (QoS) to both the data collected by
   billions of sensors and to the Fiber-To-The-Home/Building/Curb (FTTX)
   users in the smart grid environment. We present the design of a
   Fiber-Wireless Sensor Network (Fi-WSN) gateway where data prioritization
   is fundamental since ambient data collected from a home will have lower
   priority than an alarm generated at a smart grid asset. We show that the
   proposed gateway design is able to offer low delay for high priority
   packets while maintaining the delay of FTTX traffic and the reliability
   of the WSN at desired levels under various loads, concentrations of
   service levels and aggressive/non-aggressive bursting mechanisms. (C)

Abstract = {{We examine the statistical distribution of the interference produced by
   a cluster of many co-channel interferers: e.g., a sensor network, or a
   city full of active wireless devices and access points. We consider a
   clustered interferer layout and analyze the interference as experienced
   at a given point outside (and not immediately near to) the interferer
   area. We model the propagation paths as experiencing power law
   attenuation and lognormal correlated shadowing, with pairwise
   correlations depending on the relative positions of the two interferers.
   It has already been shown in literature that adding correlation to the
   shadowing model can give significantly different, and more realistic,
   results. Our solution is mostly analytical, with only a small amount of
   numerical integration required. Whereas both simulation and other
   analytical methods become very computationally demanding as the number
   of interferers grows, our method's complexity is independent of the
   number of interferers, and its precision actually improves when their
   number increases.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this article was to assess the measurement uncertainty of
   the planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) method and, as much as
   possible, to devise corrections for predictable biases. More
   specifically, we considered the measurement of concentration maps in
   cross sections parallel to and normal to the axis of a slender plume
   containing Rhodamine 6G as a passive scalar tracer and transported by a
   turbulent shear flow. In addition to previously examined sources of
   error related to PLIF, we also investigated several unexplored ones.
   First, we demonstrated that errors would arise if the laser sheet
   thickness was comparable to or larger than the thickness of the
   instantaneous plume. We then investigated the effect of secondary
   fluorescence, which was attributed to absorption and re-emission of
   primary fluorescence by dye both within and outside the laser sheet. We
   found that, if uncorrected, this effect would contaminate the
   calibration as well as the instantaneous concentration measurements of
   the plume, and proposed methods for the correction of these errors and
   for identifying the instantaneous boundaries of the in-sheet dye
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Surface polaritons, which are electromagnetic waves coupled to material
   charge oscillations, have enabled applications in concentrating, guiding
   and harvesting optical energy below the diffraction limit. Surface
   plasmon polaritons involve oscillations of electrons and are accessible
   in noble metals at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, whereas
   surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) rely on phonon resonances in polar
   materials, and are active in the mid-infrared. Noble metal surface
   plasmon polaritons have limited applications in the mid-infrared. SPhPs
   at flat interfaces normally possess long polariton wavelengths and
   provide modest field confinement/enhancement. Here we demonstrate
   propagating SPhPs in a one-dimensional material consisting of a boron
   nitride nanotube at mid-infrared wavelengths. The observed SPhP exhibits
   high field confinement and enhancement, and a very high effective index
   (n(eff)similar to 70). We show that the modal and propagation length
   characteristics of the SPhPs may be controlled through the nanotube size
   and the supporting substrates, enabling mid-infrared applications.}},

Abstract = {{The resonance demodulation technique has been widely employed in
   vibration signal analysis. In order to construct a proper bandpass
   filter, the prior knowledge, i.e. the resonance frequency band of the
   mechanical system is required in the traditional demodulation method.
   However, as the collected vibration signal is often tainted by the
   background noise and interferences often with unknown frequency
   contents, it is difficult to identify the center frequency and the
   bandwidth of the filter. This paper introduces a clustering-based
   segmentation method to determine these parameters automatically.
   Envelope analysis is then applied to demodulating the vibration data.
   According to the simulated cases, the proposed approach is robust to
   Gaussian noise and interferences. Its effectiveness is further validated
   by applying it to detect rolling bearing faults based on experimental
   data.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Thin silver films (100-800 nm) were deposited by physical vapor
   deposition (PVD) on yttria-stabilized zirconia solid electrolyte. The
   electric percolation as a function of the film thickness was studied
   during deposition and annealing using a two-electrode in-situ resistance
   measurement technique. Electrical percolation was achieved in
   as-deposited films greater than 5.4 +/- 0.4 nm; however, thermal
   treatment (550 A degrees C in air) resulted in film dewetting for Ag
   films as thick as 500 nm and formation of electronically isolated Ag
   nanoparticles, as was confirmed by SEM and XPS. In thermally treated
   samples, stable electronic conductivity associated with a continuous
   percolated network was only observed in samples greater than 600 nm in
   thickness. The effect of polarization on the electrochemical reactions
   at the three-phase (electrode-gas-electrolyte) and two-phase
   (electrode-electrolyte) boundaries of the electrode was investigated by
   solid electrolyte cyclic voltammetry (SECV) at 350 A degrees C and P
   (O2) = 6 kPa. With the application of positive potential, silver oxide
   (Ag2O) was found to form along the three-phase boundary and then extends
   within the bulk of the electrode with increasing anodic potentials. By
   changing the hold time at positive potential, passivating oxide layers
   are formed which results in a shift in favor of the oxygen evolution
   reaction at the working electrode. This oxide forms according to a
   logarithmic rate expression with thick oxides being associated with
   decrease in current efficiency for subsequent oxide formation.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript, an optimal time-varying P-controller is presented
   for a class of continuous-time underactuated nonlinear systems in the
   presence of process noise associated with systems' inputs. This is a
   state feedback control strategy where the optimization is performed on a
   time-varying feedback operator (herein called the feedback control
   gain). The main goal of the current manuscript is to provide a framework
   for multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems which yields a
   satisfactory tracking performance based on the optimal time-varying
   feedback control gain. Unlike other feedback control techniques that
   perform dynamic linearization of system models, the proposed
   time-varying Pcontroller provides the full-state feedback control to the
   original nonlinear system model. Hence, this P-controller guarantees
   global asymptotic state-tracking. Furthermore, the bounded system's
   process noise is taken into consideration to measure the controller's
   robustness. The proposed P-controller is tested for its nonlinear
   trajectory tracking and fixed-point stabilization capabilities with two
   nonholonomic systems in the presence of input noise.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid polymerization technique was successfully employed to synthesize
   interconnected polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers using chemical oxidative
   polymerization inside a soft template. The thermoreversible hydrogels of
   Lutrol F 127 and gelatin were used as templates where the interstices
   present in the hydrogel were responsible for the formation of PANI
   nanofibers with a diameter in the range ca 70-75 nm and ca 50-55 nm
   respectively and several micrometers in length. The doped emeraldine
   salt of PANI was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The crystallinity of
   as-synthesized PANI nanofibers for both cases was verified by an X-ray
   diffraction study while thermogravimetric analysis was performed to
   compare the relative stability of the synthesized PANI nanofibers. The
   electrical conductivities of polymerized PANI are of the order of 10(-3)
   S cm(-1) and are compared with those of template fabricated PANI. The
   Lutrol F 127 gel guided PANI nanofibers showed a rectifying property
   while the gelatin gel guided PANI provided a simple ohmic nature. (C)

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm stands for virtually
   interconnected objects that are identifiable and equipped with sensing,
   computing, and communication capabilities. Implementation of services
   and applications over the IoT architecture can take benefit of the cloud
   computing concept. Sensing-as-a-Service (S(2)aaS) is a cloud-inspired
   service model which enables access to the IoT. In this paper, we present
   a framework where IoT can enhance public safety by crowd management via
   sensing services that are provided by smart phones equipped with various
   types of sensors. In order to ensure trustworthiness in the presented
   framework, we propose a reputation-based S(2)aaS scheme, namely,
   Trustworthy Sensing for Crowd Management (TSCM) for front-end access to
   the IoT. TSCM collects sensing data based on a cloud model and an
   auction procedure which selects mobile devices for particular sensing
   tasks and determines the payments to the users of the mobile devices
   that provide data. Performance evaluation of TSCM shows that the impact
   of malicious users in the crowdsourced data can be degraded by 75\%
   while trustworthiness of a malicious user converges to a value below
   40\% following few auctions. Moreover, we show that TSCM can enhance the
   utility of the public safety authority up to 85\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the kinematics of a planar multibody vehicle which
   is aimed at the exploration, data collection, non-destructive testing
   and general autonomous navigation and operations in confined
   environments such as pipelines. The robot is made of several identical
   modules hinged by passive revolute joints. Every module is actuated with
   four active revolute joints and can be regarded as a parallel mechanism
   on a mobile platform. The proposed kinematics allows to overcome the
   nonholonomic kinematic constraint, which characterizes typical wheeled
   robots, resulting into a higher number of degrees of freedom and
   therefore augmented actuation inputs. Singularities in the kinematics of
   the modules are analytically identified. We present the dimensional
   synthesis of the length of the arms obtained as the solution of an
   optimization problem with respect to a suitable dexterity index.
   Simulation results illustrate a kinematic control path following inside
   pipes. Critical scenarios such as 135 degrees elbows and concentric
   restriction are explored. Path following shows the kinematic capability
   of deployment of the robot for autonomous operations in pipelines, with
   feedback implemented by on-board sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Gold and silver-gold alloy nanoparticles with mean diameter of 10 nm and
   narrow size distribution were prepared by reduction of the correspondent
   metal precursors using aqueous dextran solution which acts as both a
   reducing and capping agent. The formation of nanoparticles was
   characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The
   silver and gold nanoparticles exhibited absorption maxima at 425 and 551
   nm respectively; while for the bimetallic Ag-Au alloy appeared 520 nm in
   between them. TEM images showed monodispersed particles in the range of
   8-10 nm. The crystallinity of the nanoparticles was assured by XRD
   analysis. DLS data gave particle size distribution. The dextran
   stabilized Au nanoparticles used as a colorimetric sensor for detection
   and estimation of pesticide present in water. The dextran stabilized
   Ag-Au alloy nanoparticles exhibited interesting antimicrobial activity
   against bacteria at micromolar concentrations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to develop novel surface-modified poly(ether
   sulfone) (PES) ultra-filtration (UF) membranes for removal of endocrine
   disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceutical and personal care
   products (PPCPs). Seven tailor-made charged surface modifying
   macromolecules (CSMMs) were developed for use as additives in the
   preparation of PES UF membranes with a greater surface charge and
   improved PPCP and EDC removal through charge repulsion. Twenty three
   types of PES membranes were prepared using two amounts of different
   CSMMs and two drying (or evaporation) times. The experiments were
   designed to obtain the membranes' performances in terms of normalized
   standard flux (NSF), molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), surface charge
   (SC), static contact angle and their removal efficiency towards one EDC
   (bisphenol A) and three PPCPs (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and
   sulfamethazine). The correlation between NSF versus SC, MWCO, pore
   density, and porosity was discussed. The filtration experiments showed
   an initial partial removal of the target compounds, but no removal in
   the later stages of operation, which indicated that charge repulsion was
   not the controlling removal mechanism. This is consistent with small
   changes in membrane surface charge achieved by addition of these
   additives. Given the decrease in the percent removal with time, removal
   by size exclusion was also not significant as expected because the
   membranes had a MWCO greater than 10 kilo-Dalton while the target
   compounds had molecular weights in the 200 to 300 Dalton range. Based on
   the decreasing level of removal with time, it appeared that adsorption
   was the main removal mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to investigate the potential use of moving
   bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) systems as ammonia removal post-treatment
   units for wastewater (WW) treatment lagoons that demonstrate large
   temperature changes throughout their operational year (1-20 degrees C).
   The study was carried out over a six-month period using laboratory-scale
   MBBR reactors fed with incoming effluent from a full-scale lagoon. The
   study shows that significant average ammonia removal rates of 0.26 and
   0.11kgN/m(3)center dot d were achieved at 20 degrees C and 1 degrees C.
   The increase in the ammonia removal rates with increasing temperature
   from 1 degrees C to 20 degrees C showed a strong correlation to an
   applied temperature correction coefficient model. No significant
   accumulation of effluent nitrite was observed at 1 degrees C or after
   being fed with synthetic wastewater (SWW); indicating that cold
   temperatures and transitions from real WW to SWW did not stress the
   nitrifiers. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that changes in
   temperature or changes from real WW to SWW do not affect the mass of
   biofilm attached per MBBR carrier. Hence, based on the results of this
   study, it is concluded that MBBR is a promising technology for
   post-treatment ammonia removal of WW lagoon effluent.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results to determine the moment-resisting capacity of wood
   portal frame corner joints are presented in this paper. Two types of
   corner joints (standard and MIDPLY) were tested with different
   configurations. An L-shaped corner joint including a narrow braced wall
   segment and header was used as a test specimen. A total of 37 corner
   joints were tested. Test results showed that the installation of metal
   strap or the adding of exterior oriented strand board (OSB) sheathing,
   while using high-density wood product (LVL, LSL) as header increased the
   moment-resisting capacity of corner joints. Furthermore, the MIDPLY
   corner joint had higher moment capacity than the standard corner joint.
   The moment-carrying capacity of corner joints could be further increased
   by applying fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) on top of exterior OSB
   sheathing. A detailed finite element (FE) model of a corner joint is
   presented. The FE model predictions correlated well with the

   Applications{''} (RIAs) have become more interactive, more responsive
   and generally more user friendly. Unfortunately, we have also lost our
   ability to crawl them.

   software engineering tools. We must regain our ability to efficiently
   construct models for these RIAs. In this paper, we present two methods,
   based on ``Model-Based Crawling{''} (MBC) first introduced in {[}1]: the
   ``menu{''} model and the ``probability{''} model. These two methods are
   shown to be more effective at extracting models than previously
   published methods, and are much simpler to implement than previous
   models for MBC. A distributed implementation of the probability model is
   also discussed. We compare these methods and others against a set of
   experimental and ``real{''} RIAs, showing that in our experiments, these
   methods find the set of client states faster than other approaches, and
   often finish the crawl faster as well..}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks, mWSNs, have attracted a lot
   of attention recently. This is because sink mobility can greatly
   alleviate the hotspot issue in WSNs and further prolong the network
   lifetime. However, sink mobility also causes unexpected changes in
   network topology and data routing paths, which can largely affect the
   routing performance in such networks. Design of efficient routing
   protocols for mWSNs has been a critical issue, and much work has been
   carried out in this aspect. In this article, we first classify existing
   protocols based on different design criteria and then present a survey
   of the state-of-the-art routing protocols in this area. We illustrate
   how each of the protocols works, and discuss their advantages and
   disadvantages. Finally, we point out some future directions for
   efficient routing in mWSNs.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the growing demand for efficient circuit simulation tools,
   Obreshkov formula (ObF)-based high-order integration methods were
   recently proposed. However, one of the challenges in this method is the
   growing computational cost of the solution at a particular time point
   with the increasing orders of the ObF. To address this issue and target
   high-speed circuits with large linear blocks and nonlinear loads, a new
   parallel framework is proposed in this paper to minimize the CPU time
   associated with the solution at any time point. For this purpose,
   recently identified special properties of the resulting circuit matrices
   and the node-tearing principles are exploited, while developing an
   efficient parallel simulation framework. Numerical examples are
   presented to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed

Abstract = {{The Bluetooth Scatternet Formation (BSF) problem consists of
   interconnecting piconets in order to form a multi-hop topology. While a
   large number of BSF algorithms have been proposed, only few address time
   as a key parameter, and when doing so, virtually none of the solutions
   were tested under realistic settings. In particular, the baseband and
   link layers of Bluetooth are highly specific and known to have crucial
   impacts on performance. In this paper, we revisit performance studies
   for a number of time-efficient BSF algorithms, focusing on BlueStars,
   BlueMesh, and BlueMIS. We also introduce a novel time-efficient BSF
   algorithm called BSF-UED (for BSF based on Unnecessary-Edges Deletion),
   which forms connected scatternets deterministically and limits the
   outdegree of nodes to 7 heuristically. The performance of the algorithm
   is evaluated through detailed simulation experiments that take into
   account the low-level specificities of Bluetooth. We show that BSF-UED
   compares favorably against BlueMesh while requiring only 1/3 of its
   execution time. Only BlueStars is faster than BSF-UED, but at the cost
   of a very large number of slaves per master (much more than 7), which
   makes it impractical in many scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, membrane contactors have attracted attentions as an efficient
   and flexible technology for CO2 capture. In the present work, blend
   hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes were
   prepared via a dry-wet phase-inversion process. Surface modifying
   macromolecule (SMM) was introduced to improve the membrane properties
   for CO2 absorption in gas-liquid membrane contactors. The effect of SMM
   concentration in the polymer dope, air gap distance and bore fluid
   composition on the structure and performance of the membranes were
   investigated. By increasing SMM in the polymer dope, the membranes
   presented smaller mean pore sizes, higher permeability and surface
   hydrophobicity. Using 2 wt.\% SMM, the membranes prepared at 24 cm air
   gap showed larger mean pore size, higher hydrophobicity and lower
   permeability compared to those prepared at 0 cm air gap. By using 60
   wt.\% DMAc aqueous solution as the bore fluid, the membrane permeability
   and CO2 flux significantly improved. Maximum CO2 absorption flux of 6.8
   x 10(-4) mol/m(2) s was achieved at absorbent velocity of 0.025 m/s. The
   surface modified membrane demonstrated about 10\% gradual CO2 flux
   reduction for over 140 h of the long-term operation. In conclusion, by
   improving surface hydrophobicity of the membrane, a long-term stable
   operation can be achieved for practical implication of gas-liquid
   membrane contactor technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Porous asymmetric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/montmorillonite (MMT)
   hollow fiber mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with different nano-clay
   loadings were prepared via wet phase inversion technique and was used
   for membrane contactor. The fabricated MMMs were characterized in terms
   of morphology, structure, gas permeability, wetting resistance and
   mechanical stability. From morphology point of view, the fabricated
   membranes had a finger-like/sponge-like structure in the middle layer
   with a very porous thin outer skin layer and an inner skinless
   sponge-like structure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed an
   increase in surface roughness with increasing MMT loading. From gas
   permeation test, the surface porosity of the MMMs was higher than the
   plain PVDF membrane and the mean pore size of the membranes was small
   (34-22 nm) and decreased slightly at 5 wt.\% MMT loading. A significant
   improvement in LEPw and hydrophobicity caused the prepared MMMs to show
   high wetting resistances. Mechanical stability test of membranes
   demonstrated an increase in stress at break and collapsing pressure with
   a slight loss in elongation with clay loading. CO2 absorption tests with
   water as absorbent showed that the absorption rate of the MMMs was
   higher than the plain membrane and increased with MMT loading. For
   example, at MMT loading of 5 wt.\% and absorbent flow rate of 0.5 m
   s(-1), the absorption flux was 1.89 x 10(-3) mol m(-2) s(-1) that was
   48.7\% higher than the plain PVDF membrane. Moreover, the absorption
   rate of the best fabricated MMM was higher than the commercial PVDF
   membrane. A long-term contactor test of this membrane over 350 h showed
   that wetting did not take place and the absorption flux remained almost
   constant. It was concluded that, due to the higher surface
   hydrophobicity, wetting resistance and performance, MMMs can be a
   promising candidate to be used in contactor applications. (C) 2014

   (HB) technique. The approach presented in this paper focuses on the
   direct factorization of the Jacobian matrix, of the HB nonlinear
   equations, using a graphical processing unit (GPU) platform. The
   computational core of the proposed approach is based on developing a
   block-wise version of the KLU factorization algorithm, where scalar
   arithmetic operations are replaced by block-aware matrix operations. For
   a large number of harmonics, or excitation tones, or both, the Block-KLU
   (BKLU) approach effectively raises the ratio of floating-point
   operations to other operations and, therefore, becomes an ideal vehicle
   for implementation on a GPU-based platform. Motivated by this fact, we
   develop a GPU-based framework to implement the BKLU. The proposed
   approach yields speedup by up to 89 times over conventional direct
   factorization on CPU.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal properties of the silica/poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)
   films prepared via emulsion polymerized mixed matrix (EPMM) method are
   investigated, and the impact of the synthesis protocol on the silica
   content, compatibility between the organic and inorganic phases, and the
   thermal stability of these nanocomposites is studied. Two series of
   films, namely EPMM-1S and EPMM-2S, synthesized in one- and two-step
   process, respectively, with different combinations of surfactant and
   compatibilizer were prepared. The polymerization of the silica precursor
   in the films was confirmed by Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance, and its
   content was investigated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
   analysis. Thermal properties of the EPMM films were investigated by
   differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The
   glass transition temperature (T (g)) of EPMM films was greater compared
   to the neat PPO film. However, an increase in T (g) was not related to
   the concentration of silica in the film, but rather to the quality of
   dispersion of synthesized nanoparticles. Despite a lower inorganic
   loading, EPMM-1S films had a greater T (g) than EPMM-2S films. On the
   other hand, both the decomposition temperature and the activation energy
   for the decomposition were directly related to the silica content in the
   EPMM films. In general, regardless of the synthesis protocol, the
   presence of compatibilizer (ethanol) leads to greater inorganic content
   and improved thermal properties of the EPMM films.}},

Abstract = {{The constrained battery power of mobile devices poses a serious impact
   on user experience. As an increasingly prevalent type of applications in
   mobile cloud environments, location-based applications (LBAs) present
   some inherent limitations concerning energy. For example, the Global
   Positioning System based positioning mechanism is well-known for its
   extremely power-hungry attribute. Due to the severity of the issue,
   considerable researches have focused on energy-efficient locating
   sensing mechanism in the last a few years. In this paper, we provide a
   comprehensive survey of recent work on low-power design of LBAs. An
   overview of LBAs and different locating sensing technologies used today
   are introduced. Methods for energy saving with existing locating
   technologies are investigated. Reductions of location updating queries
   and simplifications of trajectory data are also mentioned. Moreover, we
   discuss cloud-based schemes in detail which try to develop new
   energy-efficient locating technologies by leveraging the cloud
   capabilities of storage, computation and sharing. Finally, we conclude
   the survey and discuss the future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption of the optical backbone is expected to contribute to
   a significant portion of the energy consumed by the telecommunication
   networks. As an enhanced bandwidth utilization and management extent of
   the optical Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology,
   multi-granular switching concept has been shown to guarantee energy
   savings when compared to the traditional traffic grooming. However,
   Multi-Granular Optical Transport Network (MG-OTN) design and planning
   still calls for legitimate and self-contained design specifications. In
   this paper, we revisit the Routing and Multi-Granular Path Assignment
   (RMGPA) problem by having the objective of minimized power consumption
   and integrating the optical reach limitation of optical signals in the
   design and planning problem. The new problem is formulated as a Mixed
   Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. For large scale design
   scenarios, we propose an efficient heuristic approach that is capable of
   solving the power minimization problem in feasible runtime. The
   heuristics is verified within 2\% average approximation to the MILP
   solutions under small scale scenarios, and the numerical results of the
   design and planning problem heuristic show that significant power
   savings up to 55\% in MG-OTNs can be achieved with the proper selection
   of the wavelength capacity, waveband size, number of wavebands per
   fiber, and the value of the optical reach. Furthermore, the proposed
   heuristic has been shown to guarantee high fairness among the nodes with
   respect to the power fairness index, which is at the order of 92-99\%
   under various traffic scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a particle-based modeling method for predicting the
   constitutive behavior of textiles when subjected to various compressive
   loading conditions. The method, which is demonstrated for stacked layers
   of plain woven textiles, utilizes discrete mechanics as an alternative
   to traditional continuum mechanics. Fibers are modeled as a series of
   conjoined points, and their configurations are determined
   mechanistically using a modified Metropolis algorithm and inter-particle
   strain energy terms. The implementation presented in this paper enables
   intricate geometric modeling of textiles at microscopic, mesoscopic and
   macroscopic scales. It also enables extensive mechanical modeling of the
   textiles, from first principles, as they are loaded upon manufacturing
   of typical technical textile structures. While this paper focuses on the
   compaction behavior of weaves, the modeling method is readily adaptable
   to the analysis of shear, bending, buckling, punching, relaxation and
   other loading scenarios applied on a wide array of different textile
   types. These scenarios will be demonstrated in forthcoming publications.
   Comparative data from in silico and in situ testing shows excellent
   agreement. Results demonstrate an improvement in simulation accuracy
   over prior comparable modeling techniques. The method presented here
   successfully predicts the actual behavior of yarns, single-layer and
   double-layer textile stacks in compaction.}},

Abstract = {{This work contributes to a better understanding of the correlation
   between the substrate membrane and the formation of
   poly(piperazine-amide). Factors affecting the properties of the
   poly(piperazine-amide) layer of the thin film composite (TFC)
   nanofiltration membrane were analyzed by studying the variation in the
   physicochemical properties of the substrates made of three different
   polymer materials, i.e. polysulfone (PSf), polyethersulfone (PES) and
   polyetherimide (PEI). The resulting substrates and TFC membranes were
   characterized by FESEM, AFM, ATR-IR, XPS and contact angle goniometer.
   Results revealed that the physicochemical properties of the resulting
   TFC membranes as well as their separation performances were altered with
   the use of substrate of different properties. The flux of membrane
   decreased in the order of PEI-based TFC > PES-based TFC > PES-based TFC,
   which coincide with the characteristics of each polyamide layer formed
   over the three different substrates. Compared to PES-based TFC and
   PEI-based TFC membranes, it is found that the polyamide layer of
   PSf-based TFC was more compact and more likely cross-linked which as a
   result led to lower water flux and higher salt rejection as observed in

Abstract = {{For separation of oil and water mixture using ultrafiltration (UF),
   polysulfone (Psf) membranes were synthesized by phase inversion method
   using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). In order to achieve both higher
   permeation flux and fouling resistance, modification of Psf has been
   done by adding polymeric additives such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),
   polyetherimide (PEI), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyethersulfone
   (PES). Pure Psf membrane showed a lower flux of about 0.26 L m(-2) h(-1)
   which on PVP addition helped to enhance flux to the highest value of
   33.66 L m(-2) h(-1). The performance in oil and water separation in
   terms of rejection efficiency with respect to the concentration
   polarisation phenomenon was measured for each modified Psf membrane. The
   morphology and hydrophilicity of the modified membranes were
   investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle
   analysis respectively. The UF experimental results using synthetic
   vegetable oil-water mixture showed that retention of oil over the
   membrane was nearly 99.8\% for Psf/PVP membrane and also have excellent
   oil-fouling resistance ability even during dead-end batch UF under
   higher operation pressure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A coupled hydro-mechanical model for simulation of gas migration in host

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{In a deep geological repository (DGR) for nuclear wastes, several
   mechanisms such as waste form degradation and corrosion could lead to
   gas generation. The produced gas can potentially overpressurize the
   repository, alter the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the host
   rock and affect the long term containment function of the natural (host
   rock) and engineered barriers. Thus, the understanding of the gas
   migration within the host rock and engineered barriers and the
   associated potential impacts on their integrity is important for the
   safety assessment of a DGR. In this paper, a coupled hydro-mechanical
   model for predicting and simulating the gas migration in sedimentary
   host rock is presented. A detailed formulation coupling moisture (liquid
   water and water vapor) and gas transfer in a deformable porous medium is
   given. The model takes into account the damage-controlled fluid (gas,
   water) flow as well as the coupling of hydraulic and mechanical
   processes (e.g., stress, deformation). The model also considers the
   coupling of the diffusion coefficient with mechanical deformation as
   well as considers the modification of capillary pressure due to the
   variation of permeability and porosity. The prediction capability of the
   developed model is tested against laboratory scale and in situ
   experiments conducted on potential host sedimentary rocks for nuclear
   waste disposal. The model predictions are in good agreement with the
   experimental results. The numerical simulations of the laboratory and
   field gas injection tests provide a better understanding of the
   mechanisms of gas migration and the potential effects of excessive gas
   pressure on the host sedimentary rocks. This research work has allowed
   us to identify key features related to gas generation and migration that
   are considered important in the long term safety assessment of a DGR in
   sedimentary host formations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dry-wet phased inversion method was used to fabricate polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes. Different concentration of
   surface modifying macromolecules (SMM) i.e., 2, 4 and 6 wt.\% were used
   as additives in the spinning dope. In the phase inversion SMM migrates
   to the membrane surface and changes the surface morphology with chemical
   properties on the membrane surface. This modification results into
   larger pore size, higher gas permeance, effective surface porosity and
   water contact angle. The surface modified membrane was used in membrane
   contactor for CO2 stripping from water by using self-fabricated
   gas-liquid membrane contactor module. The result of CO2 stripping
   experiment shows that the performance of surface modified membrane is
   better than plain PVDF membrane. CO2 desorption flux increased with
   respect to SMM concentration, considerably. The membrane fabricated with
   6 wt.\% SMM as additive showed higher CO2 desorption flux and efficiency
   of 2.1 x 10(-3) (mol m(-2) s(-1)) and 80\%, respectively at 200 ml/min
   of liquid flow rate. For this membrane CO2 stripping flux was
   investigated for different liquid phase temperature. It was found that
   desorption flux increased by increasing liquid temperature and the
   highest stripping flux was obtained in the temperature of 90 degrees C.
   The enhancement of the gas flow rate increased the CO2 desorption flux
   but this change was negligible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Gas transport in a two-layer membrane system, subjected to a step
   increase in feed pressure, is modeled under highly transient state in
   which the Layer 2 behaves as a semi-infinite solid. The system of
   governing partial deferential equations is solved using Laplace
   transforms, and the solution is used to obtain the expression for the
   pressure decay in the upstream volume. Accordingly, the pressure decay
   at short and long times is directly proportional to the square root of
   time, where the early and late slopes are dependent on the properties
   (i.e., diffusivity and solubility) of the materials of Layer 1 and Layer
   2, respectively. Knowing the properties of the material of Layer 2, the
   material of Layer 1 can be fully characterized based on the early slope
   and the rate at which this early slope changes once the penetrant enters
   Layer 2. Since the thickness of Layer 1 in the two-layer system can be
   orders of magnitude smaller than that of a stand-alone membrane, the
   approach presented in this paper may allow characterizing barrier
   materials, which otherwise could not be characterized in a reasonable
   timeframe by traditional integral, permeation and sorption techniques.
   In addition, the new method may be used for characterization of the
   selective layer in thin film composite membranes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Quantitative assessment and statistical analysis of medical waste
   generation at provincial scale in Isfahan was conducted. Results
   indicated that 59\% of the total wastes produced were non-hazardous
   (general) wastes and the rest were hazardous medical wastes. More than
   98\% of centers implemented source separation of the wastes at source.
   Also, more than 91\% had a storage room, but only 48\% of storage rooms
   were operated under standard conditions, i.e. storage with appropriate
   ventilation and temperature control. Only about 21\% of medical centers
   had designated collection vehicles. For the remaining 79\% of
   facilities, the medical wastes were collected (comingled) and
   transported together with the general or non-medical wastes. As for the
   treatment of medical wastes, only 7\% of centers were equipped with
   autoclave. Although 22\% of centers had incinerators, the majority of
   them were not functional. Collected wastes from 29\% of facilities were
   disposed together and mixed with the municipal wastes at the same
   landfill trenches. Wastes from the remaining 71\% of centers were
   landfilled in separate trenches. The waste generation rates for total
   waste and general (non-hazardous) waste were 3.03 and 1.84 kg/active
   bed/day, and 1.03 and 0.65 kg/employee/day, respectively. Using
   multivariate regression analysis of data an empirical equation (Y = 0.55
   {*} NEM + 1.44 {*} NAB) was established to predict the total amount of
   waste generated at each facility (Y) as a function of number of active
   beds (NAB) and number of employees (NEM) of the facility. Strong
   correlation (R-2 = 0.97) between the observed and predicted values was

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The prediction of trust relationships in social networks plays an
   important role in the analytics of the networks. Although various link
   prediction algorithms for general networks may be adapted for this
   purpose, the recent notion of ``trust propagation{''} has been shown to
   effectively capture the trust-formation mechanisms and resulted in an
   effective prediction algorithm. This article builds on the concept of
   trust propagation and presents a probabilistic trust propagation model.
   Our model exploits the modern framework of probabilistic graphical
   models, more specifically, factor graphs. Under this model, the trust
   prediction problem can be formulated as a statistical inference problem
   and we derive the belief propagation algorithm as a solver for trust
   prediction. The model and algorithm are tested using datasets from
   Epinions and Ciao, by which performance advantages over the previous
   algorithms are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Developing and maintaining context-aware efficient systems in
   heterogeneous environments is a challenging task. In our research work,
   we enable context awareness in users, devices, and applications to
   enable context-based systems in Ambient Networks. We achieve this by
   proposing a context dissemination system which propagates the fast
   evolving context information from its sources (e. g., context sensors)
   to various interested information sinks (e. g., context sensitive
   clients). The proposed system implements a context aware overlay
   architecture composed of multi-level overlay networks. This overlay
   architecture acts as a base (middleware) for the development and
   maintenance of the application-layer context-specific dissemination
   protocol (the CSON-D protocol). The protocol's multi-level overlay
   structure and its intelligence, personalization, and fault tolerance
   features exhibit adaptive behavior with minimized casting functionality.
   Our conceptual model is reinforced by means of experimental evaluations.
   In general, the cost-based overhead for multi-level overlay formation
   and maintenance is minimal.}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{329-344}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The performance of landfill liners can be enhanced if they exhibit a
   semipermeable membrane behavior, which restricts the migration of
   contaminants. Consequently, enhancing the membrane property of clays
   used for liners is becoming increasingly important. As bentonite has
   already proven to be an excellent additive for improving the membrane
   behavior of clay, the hydraulic conductivities and membrane behaviors of
   a locally available clay, known as Fukakusa clay, amended with different
   amounts of dry bentonite (5\%, 10\%,, 15\%, and 20\%) were herein
   evaluated. The chemico-osmotic efficiency coefficient, to, was obtained
   under different concentration differences of KCl solution (0.5, 1, 5,
   10, and 50 Iraq) for specimens in rigid-wall cells. The test results
   show that theco of unamended clay is very low and can be ignored unless
   amended with bentonite, and that hydraulic conductivity k is suitably
   low (1.58 x 10(-9) m/s). Additionally, to decreased as the KCl
   concentration increased, which is consistent with the theory that
   increasing concentration causes progressively greater shrinkage of the
   diffuse-double layers of the clay particles. Furthermore, the mechanisms
   that influence the membrane behavior are discussed from the viewpoints
   of the diffuse-double layer and the interparticle pore size with the
   assistance of SEM. (C) 2014 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Abstract = {{Extracting moving and salient objects from videos is important for many
   applications like surveillance and video retargeting. In this paper we
   use spatial and temporal coherency information to segment salient
   objects in videos. While many methods use motion information from
   videos, they do not exploit coherency information which has the
   potential to give more accurate saliency maps. Spatial coherencymaps
   identify regions belonging to regular objects, while temporal coherency
   maps identify regions with high coherent motion. The two coherency maps
   are combined to obtain the final spatio-temporal map identifying salient
   regions. Experimental results on public datasets show that our method
   outperforms two competing methods in segmenting moving objects from
   videos.}},

Abstract = {{Pore networks can be simulated in silico by using the dual site-bond
   Model. In this approach, a set of cavities (sites) are interconnected to
   each other by means of a set of throats (bonds), while considering that
   each site should be always larger than any of its delimiting bonds. The
   NoMISS greedy algorithm has been implemented recently in order to
   address this task; nevertheless, even if this procedure is relatively
   fast, there arises problems related to large memory consumption and long
   computing time, as pore networks become somewhat large. Here, three
   parallel methods are proposed to allow a proficient construction of
   large pore networks. The first method is a parallel Monte Carlo
   procedure, which applies a number of exchanges among pore sizes in order
   to obtain a valid pore network. The other two methods are parallel
   versions of the pioneering NoMISS greedy algorithm. The first version
   uses a static data partitioning to speed up the running time, whilst the
   second applies a dynamic data distribution policy to improve the pore
   network quality. The obtained results show the behavior of each proposed
   version with respect to their performance and quality, by employing the
   resources of a 125-core Linux cluster.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring smart-grid assets in a timely manner is highly desired for
   emerging smart-grid applications such as transformer monitoring,
   capacitor bank control, plug-in hybrid-electric-vehicle load management,
   and power quality assessment. Wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs)
   are anticipated to be widely utilized in a wide range of smart-grid
   applications due to their numerous advantages along with their
   successful adoption in various critical areas including military and
   health. For resource-constrained WSANs, transmitting delay-critical data
   from smart-grid assets calls for data prioritization and delay
   responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce two medium-access
   approaches, namely, delay-responsive cross-layer (DRX) data transmission
   and fair and delay-aware cross-layer (FDRX) data transmission, which aim
   to address the delay and service requirements of smart grids. DRX is
   based on delay-estimation and data-prioritization steps that are
   performed by the application layer, in addition to the MAC layer
   parameters responding to the delay requirements of the smart-grid
   application and the network condition. On the other hand, FDRX
   incorporates fairness into DRX by preventing a few nodes from dominating
   the communication channel. We provide a comprehensive performance
   evaluation of those approaches. We show that DRX reduces the end-to-end
   delay while FDRX has lower collision rate compared with DRX. We outline
   the tradeoffs regarding these approaches and draw future research
   directions for robust communication protocols for smart-grid monitoring
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled thermo-hydro-chemical (THC) model has been developed to study
   the thermally and hydraulically coupled processes in hydrating cemented

   laboratory data (CPB made of Portland cement and CPB that contains
   mineral admixtures) and field CPB column studies (CPB cured in

   applied to simulate and predict the thermal (e.g. temperature
   development and thermal conductivity), hydraulic (e.g. water drainage,
   suction or negative pore-water pressure development and hydraulic
   conductivity) and physical (porosity) evolutions of the CPB columns
   under different conditions, such as various CPB temperatures and
   water-to-binder ratios. The presented outcomes can contribute to a

Abstract = {{Exertion games (exergames) pose interesting challenges in terms of user
   interaction techniques. Players are commonly unable to use traditional
   input devices such as mouse and keyboard, given the body movement
   requirements of this type of videogames. In this work we propose a hand
   gesture interface to direct actions in a target-shooting exertion game
   that is played while exercising on an ergo-bike. A vision-based hand
   gesture interface for interacting with objects in a 3D videogame is
   designed and implemented. The system is capable to issue game commands
   to any computer game that normally responds to mouse and keyboard
   without modifying the underlying source code of the game. The vision
   system combines Bag-of-features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
   achieve user-independent and real-time hand gesture recognition. In
   particular, a Finite State Machine (FSM) is used to build the grammar
   that generates gesture commands for the game. We carried out a user
   study to gather feedback from participants, and our preliminary results
   show the high level of interest from users use this multimedia system
   that implements a natural way of interaction. Albeit some concerns in
   terms of comfort, users had a positive experience using our exertion
   game and they expressed their positive intention to use a system like
   this in their daily lives.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of biological shapes has applications in many areas of
   biology, and tools exist to quantify organ shape and detect shape
   differences between species or among variants. However, such
   measurements do not provide any information about the mechanisms of
   shape generation. Quantitative data on growth patterns may provide
   insights into morphogenetic processes, but since growth is a complex
   process occurring in four dimensions, growth patterns alone cannot
   intuitively be linked to shape outcomes. Here, we present computational
   tools to quantify tissue deformation and surface shape changes over the
   course of leaf development, applied to the first leaf of Arabidopsis
   (Arabidopsis thaliana). The results show that the overall leaf shape
   does not change notably during the developmental stages analyzed, yet
   there is a clear upward radial deformation of the leaf tissue in early
   time points. This deformation pattern may provide an explanation for how
   the Arabidopsis leaf maintains a relatively constant shape despite
   spatial heterogeneities in growth. These findings highlight the
   importance of quantifying tissue deformation when investigating the
   control of leaf shape. More generally, experimental mapping of
   deformation patterns may help us to better understand the link between
   growth and shape in organ development.}},

Abstract = {{Novel insights in the synthesis-structure-catalytic activity
   relationships of nanostructured trimetallic Pt-Rh-Sn electrocatalysts
   for the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol are reported. In
   particular, we identify a novel single-phase Rh-doped Pt-Sn Niggliite
   mineral phase as the source of catalytically active sites for ethanol
   oxidation; we discuss its morphology, composition, chemical surface
   state, and the detailed 3D atomic arrangement using high-energy
   (HE-XRD), atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The intrinsic ethanol oxidation
   activity of the active Niggliite phase exceeded those of earlier
   reports, lending support to the notion that the atomic-scale
   neighborhood of Pt, Rh, and Sn is conducive to the emergence of active
   surface catalytic sites under reaction conditions. In situ mechanistic
   Fourier transform infrared (in situ FTIR) analysis confirms an active 12
   electron oxidation reaction channel to CO2 at electrode potentials as
   low as 450 mV/RHE, demonstrating the favorable efficiency of the PtRhSn
   Niggliite phase for C-C bond splitting.}},

Abstract = {{We have designed and investigated a new congestion control scheme,
   called optimal and fully explicit (OFEX) controller. Different from
   existing relatively explicit controllers, this new scheme can provide
   not only optimal bandwidth allocation but also a fully explicit
   congestion signal to sources. It uses the congestion signal from the
   most congested link instead of the cumulative signal from the flow path.
   In this way, it overcomes the drawback of relatively explicit
   controllers exhibiting bias toward multi-bottlenecked users and
   significantly improves their convergence speed and source throughput
   performance. Furthermore, our OFEX-controller design considers a dynamic
   model by proposing a remedial measure against the unpredictable
   bandwidth changes in contention-based multi-access. networks. Compared
   with former works/controllers, this remedy also effectively reduces the
   instantaneous queue size in a router and thus significantly improves
   queuing delay and packet loss performance. We have evaluated the
   effectiveness of the OFEX controller in OPNET. The experimental
   comparison with the existing relatively explicit controllers verifies
   the superiority of our new scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Physicians' understanding of biosignals as measured with medical
   instruments becomes the foundation of their decisions and diagnoses of
   patients, as they rely strongly on what the instruments show. Thus, it
   is critical and very important to ensure that the instruments'
   recordings exactly reflect what is happening in the patient's body so
   that the acquired signal is the real one or at least as close to the
   real in-body signal as possible. This is such an important issue that
   sometimes physicians use invasive measurements to obtain the real
   biosignal. Generating an in-body signal from what a measurement device
   shows is called ``signal purification{''} or ``reconstruction{''} and
   can be done only when we have adequate information about the interface
   between the body and the monitoring device. In this paper, first, we
   present a device that we developed for electrocardiogram (ECG)
   acquisition and transfer to PC. To evaluate the performance of the
   device, we use it to measure ECG and apply conductive textile as our ECG
   electrode. Then, we evaluate ECG signals captured by different
   electrodes, specifically traditional gel Ag/AgCl and dry golden plate
   electrodes, and compare the results, allowing us to investigate if ECG
   measured with the device is proper for applications where no skin
   preparation is allowed, such as ECG-assisted blood pressure monitoring
   devices. Next, we propose a method to reconstruct the ECG signal from
   the signal acquired by our device, with respect to the interface
   characteristics and their relation to the ECG. The interface in this
   paper is skin-electrode interface for conductive textiles. In the last
   stage of this paper, we explore the effects of pressure on
   skin-electrode interface impedance and its parametrical variation.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Following a review of two recent sets of fluid-to-fluid scaling laws for
   supercritical heat transfer and a discussion of their possible
   limitations, we have proposed two additional sets of scaling laws, which
   take into account empirically adjustable versions of the Dittus-Boelter
   correlation and which are applicable to both the supercritical and the
   high subcritical flow regions. We have compiled a database of heat
   transfer measurements in carbon dioxide flowing upwards in vertical
   heated tubes that are free of deterioration or enhancement. We then
   applied the four sets of scaling laws to these data to compute values of
   the water-equivalent heat transfer coefficient and compared these values
   to predictions of a transcritical look-up table, which was earlier shown
   to represent well a large compilation of measurements in water at
   supercritical and high subcritical pressures. It was shown that the two
   earlier methods systematically overestimated the heat transfer
   coefficient in water and also introduced significant imprecision. In
   contrast, the two proposed methods of scaling introduce no bias and have
   lower precision uncertainties than those of the previous scaling
   methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a project undertaken by an interdisciplinary team combining
   researchers in sleep psychology and in Natural Language
   Processing/Machine Learning. The goal is sentiment analysis on a corpus
   containing short textual descriptions of dreams. Dreams are categorized
   in a four-level scale of positive and negative sentiments. We chose a
   four scale annotation to reflect the sentiment strength and simplicity
   at the same time. The approach is based on a novel representation,
   taking into account the leading themes of the dream and the sequential
   unfolding of associated sentiments during the dream. The dream
   representation is based on three combined parts, two of which are
   automatically produced from the description of the dream. The first part
   consists of co-occurrence vector representation of dreams in order to
   detect sentiment levels in the dream texts. Those vectors unlike the
   standard Bag-of-words model capture non-local relationships between
   meanings of word in a corpus. The second part introduces the dynamic
   representation that captures the sentimental changes throughout the
   progress of the dream. The third part is the self-reported assessment of
   the dream by the dreamer according to eight given attributes
   (self-assessment is different in many respects from the dream's
   sentiment classification). The three representations are subject to
   aggressive feature selection. Using an ensemble of classifiers on the
   combined 3-partite representation, the agreement between machine rating
   and the human judge scores on the four scales was 64 \% which is in the
   range of human experts' consensus in that domain. The accuracy of the
   system was 14 \% more than previous results on the same task.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports the modification of polyethersulfone (PES) membrane
   using silver nanoparticles (n-Ag), their characterizations and protein
   separation performances. As a bio-mediated synthesis route,
   gram-positive Bacillus subtilis bacterial supernatants were employed for
   preparing n-Ag. The resulting n-Ag exhibited uniform and well defined
   spherical morphology with size less than 50 nm. The effect of the
   incorporation of n-Ag on PES membrane in terms of cross sectional
   morphology, surface roughness, crystallinity and hydrophilicity were
   investigated systematically. XPS analysis showed that a significant
   portion of silver was in silver oxide form. Depth profiling by argon
   plasma etching and XPS showed the partition of Ag2O and Ag between the
   membrane surface and the bulk. A minor oxidation on the surface of the
   silver was observed whereas the internal structure of the membrane
   retained Ag in its metallic state. The potential of the nano composite
   membrane for the separation of BSA with varying feed concentration and
   transmembrane pressure were performed. At 1.5 wt\% loading of n-Ag in
   neat PES, enhancement in bovine serum albumin (BSA) flux and decrease in
   the rejection were observed. The results and performance of the PES/n-Ag
   nanocomposite membranes indicate that it would be a deserving candidate
   for future industrial separations. The experimental results confirm that
   the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles in PES UF membrane can increase
   hydrophilicity and reduce the fouling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to design a microfluidic apparatus capable
   of providing controlled flow conditions suitable for red blood cell
   (RBC) aggregation analysis. The linear velocity engendered from the
   controlled flow provides constant shear rates used to qualitatively
   analyze RBC aggregates. The design of the apparatus is based on
   numerical and experimental work. The numerical work consists of 3D
   numerical simulations performed using a research computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) solver, Nek5000, while the experiments are conducted
   using a microparticle image velocimetry system. A Newtonian model is
   tested numerically and experimentally, then blood is tested
   experimentally under several conditions (hematocrit, shear rate, and
   fluid suspension) to be compared to the simulation results. We find that
   using a velocity ratio of 4 between the two Newtonian fluids, the layer
   corresponding to blood expands to fill 35\% of the channel thickness
   where the constant shear rate is achieved. For blood experiments, the
   velocity profile in the blood layer is approximately linear, resulting
   in the desired controlled conditions for the study of RBC aggregation
   under several flow scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 10 years there has been continuous innovation and
   evolution in the technology of web applications. While originally
   designed as a telecom testing platform, TTCN-3 has proven to be a
   flexible and powerful platform for web application testing throughout
   this period. Major challenges to testing have been integration with unit
   test frameworks, service-oriented architecture, rich client interfaces,
   and security vulnerabilities. Through careful analysis and practical
   experience in industrial projects we have developed mechanisms to
   address each of these aspects of web application testing in TCN-3. These
   mechanisms are summarized here with examples drawn from our industrial
   experience to show how TTCN-3 provides significant advantages for
   testing web applications in comparison to other tools typically used in
   industry. We also present a significant extension to the model
   architecture for TTCN-3 which greatly facilitates web application
   testing that has been implemented by a major vendor and is now under
   consideration by the ETSI standards committee.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the rheological properties of nylon-6,6
   solutions and the morphology of their electrospun nanofibers was
   established. The viscosity of nylon-6,6 in formic acid (90\%) was
   measured in the concentration range of 5 wt\%-25 wt\% using a
   programmable viscometer. Electrospinning of nylon-6,6 solutions was
   carried out under controlled parameters. The chemical structure,
   morphology and thermal properties of the obtained nanofibers were
   investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC), respectively. Entanglement concentration (c (e)) was found to be
   15 wt\% and a power law relationship between specific viscosity and
   solution concentration was observed with exponents of 2.0 and 3.3 for
   semi-dilute unentangled (c < c (e)) and semi-dilute entangled (c > c
   (e)) regimes, respectively. The diameter and uniformity of the
   nanofibers were found to be dependent on the viscosity. Moreover, the
   average diameter of electrospun nanofibers was found to be dependent on
   zero shear rate viscosity and normalized concentration (c/c (e)) in a
   power law relationship with exponents of 0.298 and 0.816, respectively.
   For nylon-6,6 solutions, the entanglement concentration (c (e) = 15
   wt\%) provides the threshold viscosity required for the formation of a
   stable polymeric jet during electrospinning and producing uniform
   beadless fibers. For concentrations less than c (e), beaded fibers with
   some irregularities are formed. DSC analysis showed an increase in
   crystallinity of all electrospun samples compared to original polymer.
   Furthermore, Based on FTIR spectroscopy, alpha phase is dominant in
   electrospun nanofibers and minor amount of beta and gamma phases is also
   available.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The modification of photocatalysts by silver addition or deposition can
   be used to increase photocatalytic efficiencies by preventing
   photogenerated electron-hole recombination through electron trapping
   mechanisms, and by increasing visible light absorption of the composite
   materials through the surface plasmon resonance enhancement of silver
   nanoparticles. Nanosilver also possesses excellent antimicrobial
   activity, and can be used as a biocidal agent when incorporated into
   TiO2 photocatalysts. Alternatively, the host photocatalyst may also
   contribute to antimicrobial activity observed in the absence of
   irradiation, such as for AgX (X = Cl, Br, I) and ZnO. These
   silver-modified composites present a novel class of hybrid
   photocatalysts, which possess antibacterial and/or antiviral action in
   both dark and light conditions, and are discussed in detail in this
   review. In addition, other antimicrobial photocatalysts such as those
   based on copper are examined. Further work should be performed on these

Abstract = {{Planetary gearboxes play an important role in wind turbine (WT)
   drivetrains. WTs usually work under time-varying running conditions due
   to the volatile wind conditions. The planetary gearbox vibration signals
   in such an environment are hence highly nonstationary. Conventional
   spectral analysis and demodulation analysis methods are unable to
   identify the characteristic frequency of gear fault from such
   nonstationary signals. As such, this paper presents a time frequency
   analysis methods to reveal the constituent frequency components of
   nonstationary signals and their time-varying features for WT planetary
   gearbox monitoring. More specifically, we exploit the adaptive optimal
   kernel (AOK) method for this challenging application because of its fine
   time frequency resolution and cross-term free nature, as demonstrated by
   our simulation analysis. In this study, the AOK method has been applied
   to identify the time-varying characteristic frequencies of gear fault or
   to extract different levels of impulses induced by gear faults from lab
   WT experimental signals and in-situ WT signals under time-varying
   running conditions. We have demonstrated that the AOK is effective
   diagnosis of: (a) both the local damage (a single chipped tooth) and
   distributed faults (wear of all teeth), (b) both sun gear and planet
   gear faults, and (c) faults with very weak signature (e.g., the sun gear
   fault at the low speed stage of a WT planetary gearbox). (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Local bubble characteristics, including gas holdups, bubble rise
   velocities, and chord lengths, were measured using a monolibre optical
   probe manufactured to withstand elevated pressures. Previous studies
   have validated the use of single tip probes for simultaneous measurement
   of local bubble properties at atmospheric conditions; however no study
   has been currently reported for these probes at elevated pressures.
   Experiments were conducted in a 101.6 mm diameter column operating at
   pressures up to 9.0 MPa. Surfactant addition and operating pressure were
   studied to simulate high gas holdups observed in many industrial
   reactors containing liquid mixtures with surface-active compounds.
   Experiments were hence completed using two liquid phases: tap water and
   a 0.5 wt\% aqueous ethanol solution. Liquid and gas superficial
   velocities were varied between 0-90 mm/s and 0-150 mm/s, respectively.
   Radial profiles at atmospheric conditions validated the probe
   measurements in water. Local holdups, rise velocities and chord lengths
   were adequately measured in water up to 9.0 MPa. The probe struggled in
   the aqueous ethanol solution due to its physical constraints (i.e., Lip
   diameter and sensing length) when compared to the significant bubble
   size reduction (chord lengths below 0.5 mm). Comparisons with fluidized
   bed freeboard measurements demonstrated that flow through the bed
   enhanced bubble breakup for a coalescing system, but had a negligible
   impact with the added surfactant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Near-infrared amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from an
   optically-pumped dye-doped polymeric slab waveguide, consisting of
   IR-140 in PMMA on a glass substrate, has been characterised. The ASE
   gain was measured using the variable stripe length method. Linewidth
   narrowing with increasing pump intensity was observed, indicating ASE
   gain in this material. The effects of the dye concentration and pump
   intensity on the gain were investigated under linear operation. The
   maximum achieved gain coefficient is gamma similar to 68 cm(-1) for a
   film with 0.8wt \% of IR-140 to PMMA for a pump intensity of 43.4
   mJ/cm(2). The polarisation dependence of the ASE gain was also
   investigated by measuring the gain coefficient of orthogonal TE and TM
   modes and varying the pump polarisation relative to the amplifier
   length. It was observed that there is some degree of gain anisotropy
   when the pump polarisation is aligned perpendicular to the length, but
   that the gain was isotropic when the pump polarisation is aligned
   parallel the length. The applicability of IR-140 doped PMMA for active
   plasmonic applications is discussed. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Single femtosecond laser-based coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering
   (CARS) microscopy, using a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) pumped in the
   near-IR to generate a supercontinuum for the Stokes source, is rapidly
   being adopted as a cost-effective approach. A PCF with two closely-lying
   zero dispersion wavelengths is a popular choice for the Stokes source,
   but it is often limited to imaging lipids. A polarization-maintaining
   PCF with two far-lying zero dispersion wavelengths offers important
   advantages for polarization CARS microscopy, and for CARS imaging in the
   fingerprint region. This PCF fiber, though commercially available, has
   limited use for CARS microscopy in the C-H bond region. The main problem
   is that the supercontinuum from this fiber is typically noisier than
   that from a standard PCF with two closely-lying zero dispersion
   wavelengths. To overcome this, we determined the optimum operating
   conditions for generating a low-noise supercontinuum out of a PCF with
   two far-lying zero dispersion wavelengths, in terms of the input
   parameters of the excitation pulse. We measured the relative intensity
   noise (RIN) of the Stokes and the corresponding CARS signal as a
   function of the input laser parameters in this fiber. We showed that the
   results of CARS imaging using this alternate fiber are comparable to
   those achieved using the standard fiber, for input laser pulse
   conditions of low average power, narrow pulse width with slightly
   positive chirp, and polarization direction parallel to the slow axis of
   the selected fiber. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{As digital components are increasingly present in the control of
   automotive engines, direction systems and other in-car devices,
   Human-Vehicle Interaction (HVI) becomes more and more complex, requiring
   new user interfaces. Gesture control is proposed in the literature as a
   techniques which deserves to be explored as it can tremendously simplify
   numerous interactions between the car and the driver and/or other
   passengers. Key characteristics of such HVI devices include reliability,
   robustness, and stability of the entire system, ranging from the
   acquisition of the gesture to its recognition and tracking in real-time.
   In this paper, a smart and real-time depth camera operating in the Near
   Infrared (NIR) Spectrum is introduced. The camera is based on a new
   depth generation principle of sampling the space of the Field-of-View
   (FOV) with IR pulses of variable frequency and duty cycle. The depth
   images are calculated using reconfigurable hardware architecture and a
   series of eight IR images obtained via a sensitive image sensor. The
   final depth map is then processed by the gesture detection, recognition
   and tracking algorithms. A series of gestures are explored to qualify
   them for the special case of car control.}},

Abstract = {{A new simulation tool is developed to model coupled
   thermo-hydro-mechanical-geochemical (THM-GeoC) processes that would
   occur in the near field of deep geological repositories (DGRs) for
   nuclear wastes, and their impacts on the evolution of the rock porosity
   and permeability. First, a coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical
   (THMC) model, in which, the chemical (C) process is limited to solute
   transport, is developed and then implemented into COMSOL Multiphysics
   finite element code. Then, two types of numerical software are coupled;
   the first is COMSOL Multiphysics code and the second is the PHREEQC
   geochemical code. The coupling of the two types of software is performed
   by developing a special code that has been written by using MATLAB.
   COMSOL Multiphysics is used to solve the coupled THMC processes (the C
   process is limited to solute transport) and PHREEQC is used to solve the
   geochemical reactions resultant of the transport of chemical species.
   Simulation results obtained by using the THM-GeoC simulator are compared
   with experimental data and data from modeling reactive transport, with
   good agreement in the results. The developed simulator is applied to
   investigate the coupled effect of climate changes and water enriched
   with carbon dioxide gas, which would be generated from low and
   intermediate nuclear wastes, on the dissolution of the limestone host
   rock in Ontario (Canada) for nuclear wastes, and porosity and
   permeability changes within the near field rock. The results show that
   the maximum change in porosity is approximately 3.5\%, with a gradual
   decrease to approximately zero. The zone affected by the dissolution
   process is mainly located on the first 10 m within the host rock and
   does not cause a significant increase in permeability. From safety and
   environmental assessment perspectives, the impact of dissolution is not
   significant. However, parametric studies and experimental investigations
   need to be implemented to support the predicted results. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The objective of this review is to assess and analyze the literature on

   dioxide, water, R-22, and R-12. The majority of experimental studies
   show that, for the same flow conditions, the heat transfer coefficient
   (HTC) in the `normal' heat transfer mode increases with a decrease in
   tube diameter. Furthermore, it was found that at SC pressures, heat
   transfer is more prone to deteriorate in large tube diameters. In the
   ``deteriorated{''} heat transfer mode, the HTC also appears to decrease

Abstract = {{The main purpose of research in membrane gas separation is to develop
   membranes with high permeability and selectivity. Historically, the gas
   separation performance of polymeric membranes has been constrained to an
   upper performance limit. Hence, different methods have been investigated
   to prepare membranes that can exceed this limitation including the
   incorporation of inorganic materials into polymer matrices. Membranes
   formed by this method are called mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). The
   major challenge is to prepare a defect-free polymer/inorganic
   nanoparticles interfaces with enhanced separation performance and
   mechanical and thermal stability. For this purpose, various types of
   nanoparticles have been proposed and examined experimentally. This
   review is especially devoted to summarize the fundamental concepts that
   have to be considered to prepare various types of MMMs, including
   considerations for the design novel MMMs that will eventually surpass
   the Robeson's trade-off upper bound. In addition, it provides the pros
   and cons of various factors that affect the MMM preparation especially

Abstract = {{A method for predicting the signal strength of a tsunami at coastal tide
   gauges once the event is underway is presented. It is based on the
   calculation of a transfer function for a linear system whose input is
   obtained from Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART)
   bottom pressure recorders (BPRs) and the output from coastal tide
   gauges. To perform the calculations, a data window for the input and
   output signals must initially be chosen that requires a compromise
   between signal purity and resolution. Limited experience suggests that
   windows in the range of 6-12 hours duration are a reasonable choice for
   1-minute data. The method is illustrated with three examples, the first
   two taken from the tsunami generated by the Great Tohoku Earthquake of
   2011 and the third from the tsunami generated by the Chilean earthquake
   of 2010. Magnitude spectra from the transfer functions in each case
   reflect the influence of oscillations present in the tide gauge data, a
   requirement that must be met if the transfer functions are to be of
   predictive value. The magnitude spectra for each of two pairs of DART
   BPRs employed in two cases were generally similar, suggesting that the
   results are robust in the sense that they are not strongly location
   dependent. This approach provides an alternate view of the forecasting
   process that should be useful in identifying spectral components in the
   coastal response that may be critical to the forecast. Once implemented,
   the method will be rapid, easily competing with other precomputed
   database methods. Finally, with further development the method could be
   used to augment other tsunami forecast methodologies that are presently
   in use.}},

Abstract = {{A major goal of cell therapy for vascular diseases is to promote
   revascularization through the injection of endothelial stem/progenitor
   cells. The gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie endothelial
   progenitor-mediated vascular repair, however, remain elusive. Here, we
   identify the transcription factor TAL1/SCL as a key mediator of the
   vascular repair function of primary human endothelial colony-forming
   cells (ECFCs). Genome-wide analyses in ECFCs demonstrate that TAL1
   activates a transcriptional program that promotes cell adhesion and
   migration. At the mechanistic level, we show that TAL1 upregulates the
   expression of migratory and adhesion genes through recruitment of the
   histone acetyltransferase p300. Based on these findings, we establish a
   strategy that enhances the revascularization efficiency of ECFCs after
   ischemia through ex vivo priming with the histone deacetylase inhibitor
   TSA. Thus, small molecule epigenetics drugs are effective tools for
   modifying the epigenome of stem/progenitor cells prior to
   transplantation as a means to enhance their therapeutic potential.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified hybrid linear/nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis
   (SHDFEA) based on visual inspection is introduced as part of a proposed
   semi-quantitative assessment approach of aged bridge columns. The focus
   is on the evaluation of the dynamic characteristics and behaviour of
   slab-on-girder bridges under moving trucks when their columns are
   subjected to severe corrosion damage. The proposed SHDFEA uses nonlinear
   finite element analysis to evaluate the damaged columns stiffness, mass
   and damping throughout the step-by-step time history analysis. The
   efficiency, accuracy and stability of the proposed SHDFEA are verified
   through different case studies, where very high numerical stability and
   fast convergence are achieved. The results show that the nonlinear
   dynamic analysis presents the most general approach to evaluate the
   effects of any level of corrosion damage in the column for any case of
   loading, boundary conditions and any progressive change in the column
   properties. However, linear dynamic analysis is found to be the most
   economical alternative when the columns are overdesigned. It is found
   that with severe local corrosion damage in traditionally designed
   slab-on-girder bridges columns, their static behaviour mostly remains in
   the elastic range, and the traffic load magnitude remains below their
   ultimate static capacity. It is also found that the changes in the
   bridge dynamic performance parameters are marginal when over-designed
   columns have severe corrosion damage and their safety and stability are
   critical. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Characterization of both mucilage and transdermal patches has been done
   by several techniques such as Molisch's test, organoleptic evaluation of
   mucilage, mechanical, morphological and thermal analysis of transdermal
   patches. Skin irritation test is studied on hairless Albino rat skin
   showing that transdermal patches are apparently free of potentially
   hazardous skin irritation. Fourier transform infrared analysis shows
   that there is no interaction between drug, mucilage and HPMC while
   scanning electron microscopy shows the surface morphology of transdermal
   patches. In vitro drug release time of mucilage-HPMC based transdermal
   patches is prolonged with increasing mucilage concentration in the

   absorption property and water vapor transmission rate were also
   measured. XRD analysis showed the formation of exfoliated HPMC/GO

   adhesion between the GO and HPMC matrix. The tensile strength and
   Young's modulus of the nanocomposite films containing the highest weight
   percentage of GO increased sharply. The thermal stability of HPMC/GO
   nanocomposites was slightly better than pure HPMC. The water absorption

Abstract = {{An ultrawideband RF photonic phase shifter implemented using two
   cascaded polarization modulators (PolMs) is proposed and experimentally
   demonstrated. The first PolM (PolM1) is employed to generate an optical
   carrier and two first-order sidebands that are orthogonally polarized.
   By aligning the polarization directions of the optical carrier and the
   two first-order sidebands from the first PolM with the two principal
   axes of the second PolM (PolM2), complementary phase modulation on the
   optical carrier and the first-order sidebands is produced if a DC
   voltage is applied to the second PolM. By selecting the optical carrier
   and one sideband using an optical filter and beating them at a
   photodetector, an RF signal with its phase that is tunable by tuning the
   applied DC voltage is generated. The proposed phase shifter has the
   advantages of fast tuning and an ultrawide frequency tunable range. An
   experiment is performed. A full 360 degrees phase shift over an
   ultrawide frequency range from 5 to 40 GHz is demonstrated. The spurious
   free dynamic range of the phase shifter is also studied.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to detect video tampering and distinguish
   it from common video processing operations, such as recompression,
   noise, and brightness increase, using a practical watermarking scheme
   for real-time authentication of digital video. In our method, the
   watermark signals represent the macroblock's and frame's indices, and
   are embedded into the nonzero quantized discrete cosine transform value
   of blocks, mostly the last nonzero values, enabling our method to detect
   spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal tampering. Our method can be
   easily configured to adjust transparency, robustness, and capacity of
   the system according to the specific application at hand. In addition,
   our method takes advantage of content-based cryptography and increases
   the security of the system. While our method can be applied to any
   modern video codec, including the recently released high-efficiency
   video coding standard, we have implemented and evaluated it using the H.
   264/AVC codec, and we have shown that compared with the existing similar
   methods, which also embed extra bits inside video frames, our method
   causes significantly smaller video distortion, leading to a PSNR
   degradation of about 0.88 dB and structural similarity index decrease of
   0.0090 with only 0.05\% increase in bitrate, and with the bit correct
   rate of 0.71 to 0.88 after H. 264/AVC recompression.}},

Abstract = {{A significant number of elderly patients with severe symptomatic aortic
   stenosis are denied surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) because of
   high operative risk. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has
   emerged as a valid alternative to SAVR in these patients. One of the
   main characteristics of TAVI, when compared to SAVR, is that the
   diseased native aortic valve remains in place. For hemodynamic testing
   of new percutaneous valves and clinical training, one should rely on
   animal models. However, the development of an appropriate animal model
   of severe aortic stenosis is not straightforward. This work aims at
   developing and testing an elastic model of the ascending aorta including
   a severe aortic stenosis. The physical model was built based on a
   previous silicone model and tested experimentally in this study.
   Experimental results showed that the error between the computer-aided
   design (CAD) file and the physical elastic model was < 5\%, the
   compliance of the ascending aorta was 1.15 ml/mm Hg, the effective
   orifice area (EOA) of the stenotic valve was 0.86 cm(2), the peak jet
   velocity was 4.9 m/s and mean transvalvular pressure gradient was 50 mm
   Hg, consistent with as severe. An EDWARDS-SAPIEN 26 mm valve was then
   implanted in the model leading to a significant increase in EOA (2.22
   cm(2)) and a significant decrease in both peak jet velocity (1.29 m/s)
   and mean transvalvular pressure gradient (3.1 mm Hg). This model can be
   useful for preliminary in vitro testing of percutaneous valves before
   more extensive animal and in vivo tests.}},

Abstract = {{A novel configuration for a dual-wavelength fiber ring laser with
   improved lasing stability realized through the use of an
   injection-coupled optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is proposed and
   demonstrated, and its application to transverse load sensing is studied.
   The OEO-coupled dual-wavelength laser has two mutually coupled loops:
   the fiber ring loop and the OEO loop. In the fiber ring loop, a
   polarization-maintaining phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating is
   incorporated to generate two optical wavelengths with the wavelength
   spacing determined by the birefringence of the polarization-maintaining
   (PM) fiber. In the OEO loop, a microwave signal with its frequency also
   determined by the birefringence of the PM fiber is generated, which is
   fed into the fiber ring loop to injection lock the dual wavelengths. Due
   to the injection locking, a very stable dual-wavelength operation is
   established. The use of the dual wavelengths for high-resolution and
   high-speed transverse load sensing is then implemented. The sensitivity
   of the transverse load sensor is measured as high as +9.7573 and -9.7350
   GHz/(N/mm), along the fast and slow axes, respectively. The high
   frequency purity and stability of the generated microwave signal permits
   very reliable and high accuracy measurement and the microwave frequency
   interrogation allows the system to operate at an ultra-high speed.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for the identification of flow regime in vertical upward
   gas-liquid flows has been proposed. It consists of an application of the
   elastic maps algorithm, which is a machine learning method, to the
   probability density function of differential pressure measurements in
   pipes. The proposed method was found to be insensitive to axial location
   of the measurements, pipe diameter within the range 13.9-49.2 mm and
   absolute pressure within the range 100-240 kPa; it is therefore amenable
   to relatively simple calibration in a calibration rig. Compared to three
   previously suggested machine learning algorithms, the present one had a
   superior performance in identifying the gas-liquid flow regime. (c) 2014

   Optimizing nodulation in legumes is a target for crop improvement, and
   the spatial control of nodulation is just beginning to be unravelled.
   However, there is currently no method for standard phenotyping of
   nodulation patterns. Here we present a method and software for the
   quantitative analysis of nodulation phenotypes. Roots of nodulated peas
   (Pisum sativum), wild-type and two mutants, were photographed. Data from
   the photographs were extracted using custom image and data analysis
   software. The software makes it possible to extract each nodule's
   position along primary and lateral roots, and to represent the nodulated
   root system in a standardized way independent of the way roots are
   arranged in the soil. A wide variety of nodulation and root variables
   are calculated, and average spatial nodulation patterns can be computed
   from multiple samples. Standardized spatial analysis of nodulation
   patterns opens the way for comparative analyses among genotypes of a
   single legume species, as here in pea. This approach could also be used
   to compare nodulation patterns among crops, among plants grown under
   different environmental conditions, or among plants exposed to different
   pharmacological treatments. The proposed method should therefore prove
   useful for studies on nodule organogenesis and nodule physiology and for
   optimizing nodulation in crops.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoantennas are key optical components for several applications

   a full study was carried out on the dimensions of the nanodipoles at
   three optical wavelengths of interest, 850, 1310, and 1550 nm, and some
   of the results were validated using full 3D FDTD modeling. We show that
   nanodipoles on a glass substrate produce a greater bulk sensitivity than
   on a silicon substrate. The largest bulk sensitivities are produced at
   the longest wavelength (1550 nm) as 1000 nm/RIU on glass and 500 nm/RIU
   on silicon. Good performance over a wide range of nanodipole dimensions
   was observed, making the arrays tolerant to imperfections.}},

   magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The membranes were characterized using
   the contact angle, liquid entry pressure of water, scanning electron
   microscopy, and porometry measurements. Both cast and nanofiber
   membranes were tested by direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD)
   with feed 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution. Finally, the membrane performance of
   cast and nanofiber membranes was compared. The prepared hydrophobic SMM
   modified PVDF electro-spun nano-fibers membranes when combined with the
   casted membranes are very promising in DCMD for sea water desalination
   after running for 48 h operational timeframe. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An intensity-modulation and coherent-detection (IM/CD) microwave
   photonic (MWP) link with digital signal processing (DSP)-based phase
   noise cancellation is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. At the
   transmitter, the optical carrier is intensity-modulated by a
   radio-frequency (RF) signal and sent to a coherent receiver over a
   single-mode fiber (SMF). At the receiver, the intensity-modulated
   optical signal is coherently detected using a local oscillator (LO)
   laser source. The phase noise introduced by both the transmitter laser
   source and the LO laser source is converted into an amplitude noise at
   the output of the coherent receiver, which would be added to the
   in-phase component and quadrature component from the coherent receiver.
   The noise can be completely cancelled by summing the squared magnitudes
   of the in-phase and quadrature components from the coherent receiver,
   which can be implemented using a DSP unit. Error-free transmission of a
   1.25-Gb/s quadrature phase shift keying modulated RF signal with a
   center frequency of 1.6 GHz over 25-km SMF is experimentally
   demonstrated. For a signal with a bit rate of 834 Mb/s, the receiver
   sensitivity can reach -24.5 dBm which is 20 dB better than that based on
   an intensity-modulation and direct-detection MWP link.}},

   responsivity in the presence of nanodipoles and predict a maximum
   responsivity of similar to 100 mA/W at wavelengths near 1550 nm. The 3
   dB electrical bandwidth of the device is estimated based on its RC rise
   time and the hole transit time through the detection volume for the
   cases of conventional and ballistic transport in InGaAs and is found to
   range from similar to 0.7 to 4 THz. Also, trends are observed relating
   the responsivity to the gap dimensions, revealing a trade-off between
   the field-enhancement in the gap and its volume, and leading to an
   optimum gap length producing the maximum responsivity. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) nanocomposites films are
   prepared by a solution intercalation process using natural
   montmorillonite (MMT) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-modified

   modification of MMT by CTAB and characterized by Fourier transform
   infrared analysis, thermo-gravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) studies. CMMT gives better dispersion in the PBAT matrix than MMT
   and is confirmed by XRD and transmission electron microscopy. Because of
   better compatibility of CMMT, water vapor transmission rate of PBAT
   decreases more in the presence of CMMT than MMT. The biodegradability of
   PBAT and its nanocomposite films are studied in compost and from the
   morphological analysis it is apparent that the PBAT/CMMT shows a lower
   biodegradation rate in comparison to the PBAT/MMT. The antimicrobial
   activity of PBAT and its nanocomposite films is tested by an inhibition
   zone method. Because of the presence of the quaternary ammonium group of
   CTAB-modified MMT, PBAT/CMMT nanocomposites show adequate antimicrobial
   activity. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2014,

Abstract = {{Oil debris sensors are effective tools to monitor wear particles in
   lubricants. For in situ applications, surrounding noise and vibration
   interferences often distort the oil debris signature of the sensor.
   Hence extracting oil debris signatures from sensor signals is a
   challenging task for wear particle monitoring. In this paper we employ
   the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) with optimal
   decomposition depth to enhance the wear particle monitoring capability.
   The sensor signal is decomposed by the MODWT into different depths for
   detecting the wear particle existence. To extract the authentic particle
   signature with minimal distortion, the root mean square deviation of
   kurtosis value of the segmented signal residue is adopted as a criterion
   to obtain the optimal decomposition depth for the MODWT. The proposed
   approach is evaluated using both simulated and experimental wear
   particles. The results show that the present method can improve the oil
   debris monitoring capability without structural upgrade requirements.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, experimental results for the concentration of dilute
   glycerol wastewater using membrane distillation (MD) with a microporous
   hydrophobic flat-sheet FTFE membrane are reported. Experiments were
   performed using the sweeping gas mode of the MD (SGMD) process. The
   effects of various operating variables, such as feed temperature,
   glycerol concentration in aqueous phase, feed flow rate and sweeping gas
   flow rate were studied. A Taguchi analysis has been performed on the
   experimental results which determined the effects and contribution of
   each of the factors on the distillate flux and the interactions between
   the operating variables. Results showed that the most influential factor
   was feed temperature. The second significant contribution was observed
   for the sweeping gas flow rate. Feed concentration had a negative effect
   on the distillate flux. At optimum conditions (i.e. 65 degrees C, 400
   mL/min, 1 mass\%, and 0.453 Nm(3)/h), the Taguchi model predicted the
   value of the response (the distillate flux) as 20.93 L/m(2) h, which had

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Haptic-based Virtual Reality (VR) applications have many merits. What is
   still obscure, from the designer's perspective of these applications, is
   the experience the users will undergo when they use the VR system.
   Quality of Experience (QoE) is an evaluation metric from the user's
   perspective that unfortunately has received limited attention from the
   research community. Assessing the QoE of VR applications reflects the
   amount of overall satisfaction and benefits gained from the application
   in addition to laying the foundation for ideal user-centric design in
   the future. In this article, we propose a taxonomy for the evaluation of
   QoE for multimedia applications and in particular VR applications. We
   model this taxonomy using a Fuzzy logic Inference System (FIS) to
   quantitatively measure the QoE of haptic virtual environments. We build
   and test our FIS by conducting a users' study analysis to evaluate the
   QoE of a haptic game application. Our results demonstrate that the
   proposed FIS model reflects the user's estimation of the application's
   quality significantly with low error and hence is suited for QoE
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Asymmetric MMMs were fabricated containing various amount of organically
   modified clay particle (Cloisite (R) 15A) with the main intention to
   investigate the gas permeation behavior of the resultant material
   combination. The fabricated MMMs were characterized by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
   and pure gas permeation testing. XRD analysis suggested that clay layers
   crystalline structure was slightly changed upon blending but only
   limited polymer chain intercalation occurred thus resulted in phase
   separated clay-polymer composite. The gas permeation properties were
   evaluated by pure gases: nitrogen, oxygen, methane, and carbon dioxide.
   The gas permeation rate was observed to be increasing with increasing
   clay content while the selectivity remained at par to that of unfilled
   PSF before it declined at 2 wt.\% C15A loading due to filler
   agglomeration as confirmed by FESEM. The best results were obtained at 1
   wt.\% C15A loading where more than 270\% enhancement in O-2 and CO2
   permeance were observed, with insignificant change in O-2/N-2 and
   CO2/CH4 selectivity compared to that of neat PSF. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A deformation mechanism map is constructed for the 1.23Cr-1.2Mo-0.26V
   rotor steel as a function of temperature, stress, and strain rate using
   published creep test results and the current understanding of time
   dependent deformation mechanisms operative in complex engineering
   alloys. Instead of diffusional creep, grain boundary sliding (GBS)
   accommodated by different deformation processes is considered dominant
   at lower strain rates. The GBS dominated region is further sub-divided
   into two parts, where GBS is accommodated by wedge type cracking at
   temperatures below 0.5T/T (m) and the accommodation process changes to
   creep cavitation at temperatures above 0.5T/T (m). The map is verified
   using experimental data and artificial neural network modeling. The
   proposed artificial neural network model is capable of predicting the
   dominance of different deformation mechanisms in 1.23Cr-1.2Mo-0.26V
   steel over a wide range of stress and temperature. This modeling
   procedure can potentially be used to construct or expand deformation

Abstract = {{Ex-Situ Bioremediation has been increasingly viewed as an appropriate
   remediation technology for hydrocarbon contaminated soils under cold
   climates conditions in countries like Canada. A response surface
   methodology (RSM) based on a factorial design was performed to
   investigate and optimize the effects of the microbial consortia
   application rate and amount of mature compost amendment on the TPH
   removal (964 mu g g(-1) initial concentration). 18 field-scale biopiles
   (16 m(3) each) were constructed, maintained and subjected to different
   microbial consortium and mature compost application rates under cold
   climate conditions over a period of 94 days. TPHs removal rates in the
   range of 74-82\% was observed in the treatments setups where mature
   compost and microbial consortia were used simultaneously, compared to an
   average 48\% of TPHs removal in control setup.
   The interaction between these two factors were studied and modelled
   using a statistical regression model, which showed that the microbial
   consortia application rate, the mature compost amendment and their
   interactions had a significant effect on TPHs degradation with a
   coefficient cif determination (R-2) of 0.88. Furthermore, using a
   numerical optimization approach, the optimum rates predicted via RSM
   were estimated at 4.1 ml m(-3) and 7\% for microbial consortia and
   compost application rates to obtain a maximum TPH removal of 90.7\%. (C)

Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{227-245}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We study the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on the metric completion
   of cubic and subcubic graphs, which is known to be NP-hard. The problem
   is of interest because of its relation to the famous 4/3-conjecture for
   metric TSP, which says that the integrality gap, i.e., the worst case
   ratio between the optimal value of a TSP instance and that of its linear
   programming relaxation (the subtour elimination relaxation), is 4/3. We
   present the first algorithm for cubic graphs with approximation ratio
   4/3. The proof uses polyhedral techniques in a surprising way, which is
   of independent interest. In fact we prove constructively that for any
   cubic graph on vertices a tour of length exists, which also implies the
   4/3-conjecture, as an upper bound, for this class of graph-TSP.
   Recently, Momke and Svensson presented an algorithm that gives a
   1.461-approximation for graph-TSP on general graphs and as a side result
   a 4/3-approximation algorithm for this problem on subcubic graphs, also
   settling the 4/3-conjecture for this class of graph-TSP. The algorithm
   by Momke and Svensson is initially randomized but the authors remark
   that derandomization is trivial. We will present a different way to
   derandomize their algorithm which leads to a faster running time. All of
   the latter also works for multigraphs.}},

Abstract = {{Adjoint-based iterative methods are employed to compute linear optimal
   disturbances in a spatially growing boundary layer around an elliptic
   leading edge. The Lagrangian approach is used where an objective
   function is chosen and constraints are assigned. The optimisation
   problem is solved using power iterations combined with a matrix-free
   formulation, where the state is marched forward in time with a standard
   direct numerical simulation solver and backward with the adjoint solver
   until a chosen convergence criterion is fulfilled. We consider the
   global and, more relevant to receptivity studies, the upstream localised
   optimal initial condition leading to the largest possible energy
   amplification at time T. We find that the two-dimensional initial
   condition with the largest potential for growth is a
   Tollmien-Schlichting-like wave packet that includes the Orr mechanism
   and is located inside the boundary layer downstream of the leading edge.
   Three-dimensional optimal disturbances induce streaks by the lift-up
   mechanism. Requiring the optimal initial condition to be localised
   upstream of the plate enables us to better study the effects of the
   leading edge on the boundary layer receptivity mechanisms.
   Two-dimensional upstream disturbances are inefficient at triggering
   unstable eigenmodes, whereas three-dimensional disturbances induce
   streamwise streaks with significant growth.}},

Title = {{Wear resistant carbon fiber reinforced Stellite alloy composites}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{487-494}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Stellite alloys are a family of cobalt-based superalloys that are the
   main engineering materials used for severe corrosion, wear and high
   temperature environments. These alloys are strengthened by various
   carbides. However, the presence of carbides can cause many problems
   although they are main agents for wear resistance. This research
   attempts to develop a class of novel composite materials which
   substitute carbon of Stellite alloys with carbon fiber, aiming to
   minimize the disadvantageous effects of carbides in the alloys. Two
   types of carbon fiber, plain carbon fiber and nickel-coated carbon
   fiber, are employed in the composites. The new materials are fabricated
   using hot isostatic pressing (HIP) technique. The microstructures of
   these composites are analyzed to investigate if any carbides are induced
   due to incorporating carbon fibers. The tribological properties of these
   new composites are characterized on a pin-on-disk tribometer. The
   experimental results show that the developed composites exhibit better
   wear resistance than that of medium-carbon Stellite alloys and
   comparable wear resistance to that of high-carbon Stellite alloys. (C)

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) dirigibles are well suited for
   surveillance and surveyance missions since they can hover and maintain
   lift without consuming energy and can be easily deflated for packaging
   and transportation. The challenge is developing a long endurance system
   while maintaining a low unit cost. This paper presents a novel hybrid
   power plant design that addresses both of these requirements. The
   lightweight design consists of a 4-stroke 14cc gasoline engine in-line
   with a brushless dc motor/generator and variable pitch propeller capable
   of producing a maximum power output of 250 W. A method was also
   developed to compare its performance and endurance to other power plant
   configurations that could be used in dirigible UAVs. Overall, the
   proposed hybrid power plant has 674\% increase in energy density over
   that of a purely electric system, thereby proportionally increasing UAV
   flight time for the same power and weight.}},

Abstract = {{In ``imaging the biomechanical properties of tissues,'' a number of
   approaches analyze shear wave propagation initiated by a short radiation
   force push. Unfortunately, it has been experimentally observed that the
   displacement-versus-time curves for lossy tissues are rapidly damped and
   distorted in ways that can confound simple tracking approaches. This
   article addresses the propagation, decay and distortion of pulses in
   lossy and dispersive media, to derive closed-form analytic expressions
   for the propagating pulses. The theory identifies key terms that drive
   the distortion and broadening of the pulse. Furthermore, the approach
   taken is not dependent on any particular viscoelastic model of tissue,
   but instead takes a general first-order approach to dispersion. Examples
   with a Gaussian beam pattern and realistic dispersion parameters are
   given along with general guidelines for identifying the features of the
   distorting wave that are the most compact. (E-mail:

Title = {{Effect of substrate and enzyme concentration on cyclodextrin production
   in a hollow fibre membrane reactor system}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{61-67}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{The batch and continuous production of cyclodextrins (CDs) was assessed
   by employing an enzymatic membrane reactor (EMR) system. The effects of
   tapioca starch substrate and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase)
   concentrations on the yield of CDs were studied. A similar effect on the
   behaviour of the ultrafiltration membrane in the EMR system (integration
   system) was also evaluated. The results for the batch process showed
   that incremental doses of CGTase caused gradual increments in CD yield;
   however, further addition of CGTase (above 1.0\%) showed a 16\%
   reduction in the total CD production. Further incremental in the tapioca
   starch concentration increased CD concentration (23 g/L). However,
   addition above 8\% w/v resulted in an insignificant yield of CDs. In the
   case of integration system, tapioca starch feeding rate that is higher
   than 4.41 g/h caused adverse effects (lower CD yield and membrane flux).
   In particular at higher tapioca starch feeding rate (5.0 g/h), the
   hydraulic resistance would reach as high as 1.31 x 10(13) m(-1).
   Presumably this phenomenon was due to the unreacted substrates that were
   adsorbing onto the membrane surface and pores that subsequently led to
   greater fouling conditions and a severe flux decline. In addition, the
   weak adsorption (r(a1)) has been found to be the major fouling mechanism
   attributed to starch and its by products. Therefore, hydraulic cleaning
   is highly suggested as the procedure to be used for this EMR system. (C)

   membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{454}},
Pages = {{451-462}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to propose a novel approach for
   predicting the structural parameters of integrally skinned porous
   membranes using gas permeation data. It is intended to overcome the
   limitation of the conventional gas permeation testing (GPT) method,
   since the latter method seems to suffer from several conceptual
   drawbacks. In particular, a comparison is made between the theoretical
   calculation and the experimental data to show the superiority of the
   newly proposed model. The new model is a modification of Wakao et al.'s
   model, in which, unlike the conventional GPT method, the contribution of
   the slip flow is considered. Although Wakao et al.'s model was found
   superior to the conventional GPT method, the model fitting to the
   experimental data was not completely satisfactory, It was likely that
   the slip flow, although its effect cannot be neglected, is not fully
   developed. Therefore, a factor tu is introduced to show the extent of
   the contribution of the slip flow mechanism to the total gas permeation
   rate. As a result, the new method can overcome the shortcomings of the
   conventional GPT method by manifesting the following advantages: (i) it
   can cover the entire range off versus P diagram, (ii) it can specify the
   contribution of the individual mechanisms involved in the total gas
   permeation and (iii) unlike the conventional GPT method, it is not
   limited by any constraints or conditions of data acquisition. In
   summary, the model can predict pore size and effective porosity, and
   also simulate the experimental] versus P trends with sufficient accuracy
   (within similar to 2\% over the pressure range studied) for all types of
   membranes, i.e. NF, UF, ME, MD and membrane contactors. In view of this
   fact, the proposed model is simpler to apply than Rangarajan et al.'s
   model and more accurate than the conventional GPT method. (c) 2013
