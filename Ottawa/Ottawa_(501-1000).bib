Abstract = {{Personal privacy protection increasingly becomes a story of privacy
   protection in electronic data format. Personal privacy protection also
   becomes a showcase of advantages and challenges of Big Data phenomenon.
   Accumulation of massive data volumes combined with development of
   intelligent Data Mining algorithms allows more data being analysed and
   linked. Unintended consequences of Big Data analytics include increasing
   risks of discovery new information about individuals. There are several
   approaches to protect privacy of individuals in the largeS. Matwin data
   sets, privacy-preserving Data Mining being an example. In this paper, we
   discuss content-aware prevention of data leaks. We concentrate on
   protection of personal health information (PHI), arguably the most
   vulnerable type of personal information. This paper discusses the
   applied methods and challenges which arise when we want to hold health
   information private. PHI leak prevention on the Web and on online social
   networks is our case study.}},

Abstract = {{Network measurement is an important tool for network managers and
   operators since it provides the information needed to carry out
   different management tasks. However, because of the rapid increase in
   data link speeds and the volume of traffic carried by modern networks,
   the availability of system resources dedicated to network measurement
   has always been the main limiting factor in developing modern
   measurement solutions. The emergence of Software Defined Networks in
   recent years has inspired the development of new measurement solutions
   that takes advantage of the capabilities offered by this new paradigm
   such as programmability and central management {[}9]. Current SDN
   enabled measurement solutions are able to orchestrate the execution and
   resources allocation of network-wide measurement tasks but still falls
   short in their ability to recognize efficient operating points (amount
   of allocated resources) for running tasks and often results in
   inefficient resources utilization. In this paper we provide a novel
   resource allocation method that continuously estimates the
   resources-accuracy relationships for running tasks, infers their
   individual points of diminishing-returns and uses the resulting value of
   each task as it's target point of operation in order to achieve a more
   efficient resource utilization. In contrast to existing work, our
   proposed method maximizes the return on used system resources and
   results in lower drop rates of running tasks as shown by our
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive online learning algorithms have been successfully applied to
   fast-evolving data streams. Such streams are susceptible to concept
   drift, which implies that the most suitable type of classifier often
   changes over time. In this setting, a system that is able to seamlessly
   select the type of learner that presents the current ``best{''} model
   holds much value. For example, in a scenario such as user profiling for
   security applications, model adaptation is of the utmost importance. We
   have implemented a multi-strategy framework, the so-called Tornado
   environment, which is able to run multiple and diverse classifiers
   simultaneously for decision making. In our framework, the current
   learner with the highest performance, at a specific point in time, is
   selected and the corresponding model is then provided to the user. In
   our implementation, we employ an Error-Memory-Runtime (EMR) measure
   which combines the error-rate, the memory usage and the runtime of
   classifiers as a performance indicator. We conducted experiments on
   synthetic and real-world datasets with the Hoeffding Tree, Naive Bayes,
   Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Stumps algorithms. Our
   results indicate that our environment is able to adapt to changes and to
   continuously select the best current type of classifier, as the data
   evolve.}},

   to the editor. The architecture makes use of Docker to allow for the
   development and testing of individual services as separate containers
   enabling seamless deployment across the available network of computers
   and other computing devices. The system will be demonstrated by showing
   how microservices make it possible for multiple users to co-edit a

Abstract = {{A wormhole attack is a specific mechanism where two or more Autonomous
   Systems (ASes) coordinate to perform a black hole attack by exchanging
   secure BGP updates over a tunnel, signing route attestations for each
   other. Routing protocols generally choose route through a wormhole
   because it is, in general, the shortest route. This attack can redirect
   traffic through a chosen path that is compromised by the attacker. It
   can also significantly degrade the performance of the network. In this
   paper we present an approach to detecting coordinated wormhole attack by
   the validation of the path to detect any tunnel that may exist between
   two consecutive nodes in the AS-PATH. Similarly to SoBGP, we require
   that each AS signs and publishes its local topology through the topology
   certificate. The BGP speaker can then verify that the AS path is
   wormhole free by assembling local topologies in a global inter-AS
   topology map. We develop a metric that calculates the likelihood that
   two consecutive ASes in the AS-PATH are real neighbors in the AS graph.
   We demonstrate this approach by developing a wormhole detector where
   randomly chosen ASes are colluding to perform attacks according to a
   stochastic distribution model. We present experimental results from
   testing this algorithm in a controlled environment, demonstrating that
   it has a high detection rate. Our analysis shows that the detection
   algorithm is optimized for detecting long tunnels, i.e. tunnels that
   span over multiple ASes.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in diverse
   types of applications motivated the development of strong security
   measures to protect these networks. The main challenge against deploying
   strong security algorithms is that WSNs suffer from major constraints in
   terms of power and computing resources. WSNs impose a primary condition
   on the design stage that requires any protocol or algorithm to be
   power-efficient. This means that strong cryptography techniques cannot
   be used and we need another layer of defence to protect the WSN. This
   makes intrusion detection systems (IDSs) an essential option in these
   networks. IDSs can capture malicious misbehaviour that manages to
   penetrate the first layer of defence (i.e., cryptography and
   authentication). In this paper we highlight the challenges encountered
   while designing an efficient intrusion detection framework in WSNs, and
   provide a review of important contributions in this area. Finally, we
   propose a new approach that aids in detecting and confining intrusive
   behaviour in the network.}},

Abstract = {{Computer displays emit electromagnetic waves, which compromise the
   information displayed by the computer. This can be a potential
   information security threat as the sensitive information can be stolen
   from a distance without leaving any trace. The video leakage signals
   contain the information of the image displayed in the computer, so the
   video leakage signals can be seen as special image signals. However,
   different from the normal image signal, the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
   of video leakage signal is low due to the environmental noise and many
   other man-made noises. In this paper, a novel wavelet based independent
   component analysis (ICA) method is proposed for improving SNR of
   computer video leakage signals. By using this method, we can improve the
   performance of pre-processing of computer video leaking signals. We
   solve the problem of using Fast ICA in processing video leakage signal
   by using a wavelet filter. The performance of Fast ICA is improved by
   working in wavelet domain because of advantages like ease of
   implementation and less computation time when compared to time domain.
   We preprocess one-dimensional received signal without reconstructing the
   image since it is inefficient to reconstruct signal before processing. A
   direct SNR can't be defined. Therefore, another metric called quasi
   signal to noise ratio (QSNR) is defined to estimate signal to noise
   ratio of video leakage signals. The processed results of the actual
   experimental data show that the proposed wavelet based ICA algorithm has
   a better performance than the Fast ICA algorithm and the Wavelet
   de-noising algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Delay-Tolerant Sensor Networks (DTSN) experience long, unpredictable
   latency under fluctuating wireless networks with intermittent
   connectivity. Energy consumption and throughput improvement are
   essential in the design of MAC for DTSNs. However, when latency is
   relaxed in DTSN environments, traditional metrics such as throughput and
   energy consumption cannot express the transmission efficiency and energy
   consumption. Therefore, transmission strategies in DTSNs can use data
   packets over energy as energy efficiency to demonstrate efficiency under
   the requirements of high data volumes and energy conservation. In this
   paper, we examine and analyze the MAC parameters that impact energy
   efficiency with reservation-based and contention-based MAC approaches
   under DTSN environments. Simulation results from two typical MAC
   protocols also match the results of our analysis regarding energy
   efficiency in DTSN.}},

Abstract = {{The volume of traffic carried on the Optical Transport Network (OTN) is
   continuously growing, not only due to the increase of new services, new
   applications, and the number of both connected users and smart devices,
   but also owing to the rapidly growing Data Center Interconnect (DCI)
   market. As a result, telecom operators need to upgrade their transport
   networks to cope with these new traffic requirements. This tremendous
   increase in bandwidth demand will also introduce energy bottlenecks in
   OTNs. The telecommunication networks' significant Greenhouse Gas
   Emissions (GGE) is another challenge that must be addressed in OTN
   design and planning policies. Thus, energy-efficient OTN architectures
   are currently attracting the attention of telecom operators. The
   candidate OTN architectures are: (1) the conventional Dense Wavelength
   Division Multiplexing (DWDM) fixed grid with high Single Line Rates
   (SLRs); (2) the conventional DWDM fixed grid adopting Mixed Line Rates
   (MLRs); and (3) the Elastic Optical Network (EON) or flexigrid-based
   architecture which is enabled by the Optical Orthogonal Frequency
   Division Multiplexing (O-OFDM) technique. This paper evaluates the power
   consumption of the abovementioned OTN architectures under different
   traffic loads and patterns, as well as different network physical
   topologies. In order to perform the evaluation, new heuristic algorithms
   are specifically developed for the green design and planning of data
   center optical interconnects.}},

   simultaneous network interfaces to maximize throughput and reducing

   management of the flow mobility based on some classes of application for

   the rings of flows in order to meet the minimum requirements of
   vehicular applications, as well as to maximize the throughput.
   Simulations have been conducted to analyze the performance of the
   proposed architecture by comparing it to other previously devised
   architectures. As a result, the proposed architecture presented a low

Abstract = {{The digitalization of our day-to-day activities has resulted in a huge
   volume of data. This data, called Big Data, is used by many
   organizations to extract valuable information either to take marketing
   decisions, track specific behaviors or detect threat attacks. The
   processing of such data is made possible by using multiple techniques,
   called Big Data Analytics, which allow getting enormous benefits by
   dealing with any massive volume of unstructured, structured and
   semi-structured content that is fast changing and impossible to process
   using conventional database techniques. However, while Big Data
   represents an immense opportunity for many industries and decisions
   makers, it also represents a big risk for many users. This risk arises
   from the fact that these analytics tools consist of storing, managing
   and efficiently analyzing varied data gathered from all possible and
   available sources. The consequence is that people become widely
   vulnerable to exposure because of combining and exploring specific
   behavioral data. That is, it is possible to collect more data than it
   should have which leads to many security and privacy violations.
   Therefore, research community has to consider these issues by proposing
   strong protection techniques that enable getting benefits from big data
   without risking privacy. In this paper, we highlight the benefits of Big
   Data Analytics and then we review challenges of security and privacy in
   big data environments. Furthermore, we present some available protection
   techniques and propose some possible tracks that enable security and
   privacy in a malicious big data context.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular-to-Vehicular (V2V) and Vehicular-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
   communications in Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) environment rely
   mainly on Medium Access Control (MAC) to minimize the delay and maintain
   reliable access to the communication medium. IEEE 802.11p standard is
   developed to achieve these goals. However its performance deteriorates
   drastically in large networks due to the high level of contention
   between the vehicles. In this paper, we propose a Quality of Service
   (QoS) based MAC scheme for high intensity vehicular networks to maintain
   low delays, high throughput and support QoS provisioning for critical
   traffic. We develop a model to partition the network into clusters
   managed by Cluster Heads (CHs), the CHs form a multi-layer architecture
   where the Road Side Unit (RSU) is located at the root of the tree. We
   propose a QoS Distributed Time Synchronization (QDTS) mechanism to
   manage the Time Slot (TS) allocations in a distributed manner. We
   develop three communication scenarios to evaluate our mechanism in terms
   of average end to end delay and average throughput. Our results show
   that our mechanism outperforms the IEEE 802.11p standard, the average
   end-to-end delay is reduced and the average network throughput is
   increased.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a tremendous opportunity for both enterprises and end
   users. Cloud users can benefit from the possibility of remote processing
   in order to outsource their data and infrastructure; that is why many
   companies have chosen to adopt cloud-deployed solutions such as remote
   databases, mail servers, and connected applications. However, the cloud
   fails to provide sufficient security measure to preserve the privacy of
   the data even from the service providers. Therefore, the research
   community has assigned to this topic the utmost attention by proposing
   several solutions like blind processing. This latter is based on
   homomorphic encryption schemes and allows performing operations on
   encrypted data without decryption. This way it is possible to protect
   users' privacy even from the cloud provider since we only publish an
   encrypted form of the sensitive data. But, most of the proposed
   solutions only deal with the case of a mono-setting environment where
   one user collaborates with one server, whereby the multi-user topology
   reveals another kind of issues such as key sharing and concurrent
   access. In this paper, we propose a blind decryption technique based on
   homomorphic encryption that allows not only a user but multiple users to
   manage the same encrypted data without sharing the secret key. The
   proposed protocol could be utilized to build various kinds of cloud
   applications which require the collaboration of several users like
   remote databases, files sharing, and video-on-demand services.}},

Abstract = {{Governments and healthcare providers are under increasing pressure to
   streamline their processes for efficiency, to reduce operational costs
   while improving service delivery and quality of care. Systematic
   performance management of healthcare processes is important in
   determining if quality of care goals are being met at all levels of the
   healthcare ecosystem. The challenge is that reaching these goals
   requires the aggregation and analysis of large amounts of data from
   various stakeholders in the healthcare industry. With the lack of
   interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and
   storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our
   ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is
   either limited or non-existent. Cloud computing is an emerging
   technology that can provide the needed interoperability and management
   of large volumes of data across the entire healthcare system. In this
   paper, we review various cloud computing applications for surveillance
   and performance management of quality of care in healthcare. We also
   introduce a framework for achieving systematic surveillance and

Abstract = {{Using the hexagonal grid based two-interferer model we derive a simple
   analytical expression for the max-SIR conditional outage probability in
   an interference-limited cellular network. The derived probability is
   compared to the one that is obtained by simulation from the 19 base
   stations two-ring hexagonal grid. The comparison reveals that the
   derived probability matches the actual one to within 0-2.5 dB for
   practical values of the path loss exponent and the shadowing standard
   deviation. While no closed form expression is derived for the cell's
   outage probability (as the integral has no closed-form solution) its
   value is obtained through numerical integration. The cell's outage
   probability is shown to match, to within a fraction of a dB, the one
   provided by the two-ring hexagonal model. The derived expression can be
   used to obtain the cell's outage probability (or its complement, i.e.
   the cell's coverage probability) for a shadowing standard deviation of
   between 6 to 12 dB and for a path loss exponent of between 2.5 to 4.5.}},

Abstract = {{In cellular networks, cells are divided into sectors, each containing
   its own directional antenna. Although localization systems is a major
   research topic, in all conducted studies, contrary to the existing

   this study, an extended received signal strength (RSS) model is proposed
   to be able to analyze the effects of directional antennas, deviations in
   angular gain patterns on localization performance. It is shown via
   various simulations that by using RSS-based fingerprinting technique,
   the maximum gain direction angle of antennas and angular gain pattern
   deviations considerably affect the localization accuracy. In addition,
   the validity of the suggested model is tested by conducting the field
   measurements in an urban microcellular environment.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to be deployed across
   North America in the coming few years. EVs can serve dual purpose if
   they are properly managed and controlled, they can serve as a clean
   transportation medium and they can also provide power storage and
   ancillary services to the smart grid when they are plugged-in. One of
   the main important ancillary services that EVs are capable of providing
   to smart grids is frequency regulation, which is the mean of controlling
   frequency oscillations. EVs can participate in this operation by
   charging their batteries from the grid during frequency regulation-down
   and by discharging their batteries from the grid during frequency
   regulation-up. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to maximize the
   number of EVs participating in the frequency regulation market.
   Maximizing the number of EVs participating in the regulation process
   depends very much on the number of EVs that can hear the call for
   frequency regulation at that moment of time. Our mechanism increases the
   throughput and decreases the delay of EVs that are acting as relay nodes
   to rebroadcast the frequency regulation signal in a smart grid
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Utilities rely on Demand response (DR) systems to balance the supply and
   demand in the power grid. Traditionally, DR systems are utilized by
   commercial customers since they consume a great deal of power during

   (OpenADR), DR systems are increasingly becoming available to households.
   However, there are many obstacles that hinder the wide adoption of
   automatic demand response systems in the residential sector. In this
   paper, we focus on OpenADR implementation challenges in households and
   discuss technical and non-technical issues related to effectiveness,
   security, privacy, and scalability properties that must be considered

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the outage performance of full-duplex
   fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems over Rayleigh
   fading channels. New exact outage probability expression of full-duplex
   fixed-gain AF relaying is derived analytically in single-integral form
   by using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) approach. The
   analytical results for outage performance are verified by Monte-Carlo
   type computer simulations. We observe that the error floor caused by
   loop-interference at the full-duplex fixed-gain relay occurs for larger
   values of the loop interference power. Furthermore, the results are
   compared with full-duplex variable-gain AF relaying results given in the
   literature. In addition to simpler structure advantage of fixed-gain
   relaying compared to variable-gain relaying, it is shown that
   full-duplex fixed-gain AF relaying provides better outage performance.
   Contrary to the full-duplex fixed-gain AF relaying, the error floor is
   observed for the full-duplex variable-gain AF relaying for even small
   values of the loop interference power.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, portable electronic packaging products such as smart
   phones, tablets, notebooks and other gadgets have been developed with
   reduced size of component packaging, light weight, high speed and with
   enhanced performance. Thus, flip chip technology with smaller solder
   sphere sizes that would produce fine solder joint interconnections have
   become essential in order to fulfill these miniaturization requirements.
   This study investigates the interfacial reactions and intermetallics
   formation during reflow soldering and isothermal aging between
   Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC405) and electroless nickel/immersion
   palladium/immersion gold (EN(P)EPIG). Solder diameters of 300 mu m and
   700 mu m were used to compare the effect of solder volume on the solder
   joint microstructure. The solid state isothermal aging was performed at
   125 degrees C starting from 250 hours until 2000 hours. The results
   revealed that only (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC was found at the interface during
   reflow soldering while both (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 IMC have been
   observed after aging process. Smaller solder sizes produced thinner IMC
   than larger solder joints investigated after reflow soldering, whereas
   the larger solders produced thinner IMC than the smaller solders after
   isothermal aging. Aging duration of solder joints has been found to be
   increase the IMC's thickness and changed the IMC morphologies to
   spherical-shaped, compacted and larger grain size.}},

Abstract = {{Online ensemble methods have been very successful to create accurate
   models against data streams that are susceptible to concept drift. The
   success of data stream mining has allowed diverse users to analyse their
   data in multiple domains, ranging from monitoring stock markets to
   analysing network traffic and exploring ATM transactions. Increasingly,
   data stream mining applications are running on mobile devices, utilizing
   the variety of data generated by sensors and network technologies.
   Subsequently, there has been a surge in interest in mobile (or so-called
   pocket) data stream mining, aiming to construct near real-time models.
   However, it follows that the computational resources are limited and
   that there is a need to adapt analytics to map the resource usage
   requirements. In this context, the resultant models produced by such
   algorithms should thus not only be highly accurate and be able to
   swiftly adapt to changes. Rather, the data mining techniques should also
   be fast, scalable, and efficient in terms of resource allocation. It
   then becomes important to consider Return on Investment (ROI) issues
   such as storage space needs and memory utilization. This paper
   introduces the Adaptive Ensemble Size (AES) algorithm, an extension of
   the Online Bagging method, to address this issue. Our AES method
   dynamically adapts the sizes of ensembles, based on the most recent
   memory usage requirements. Our results when comparing our AES algorithm
   with the state-of-the-art indicate that we are able to obtain a high
   Return on Investment (ROI) without compromising on the accuracy of the
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear optics deals with phenomena that occur when a very intense
   light interacts with a material medium, modifying its optical
   properties. Shortly after the demonstration of first working laser in
   1960 by Maiman (Nature, 187 (1960) 493), the field of nonlinear optics
   began with the observation of second harmonic by Franken et al. in 1961
   (Phys. Rev. Lett., 7 (1961) 118). Since then, the interest in this field
   has grown and various nonlinear optical effects are utilized for
   purposes such as nonlinear microscopy, switching, harmonic generation,
   parametric downconversion, filamentation, etc. We present here a brief
   overview of the various aspects on nonlinear optics and some of the
   recent advances in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Packaging film that possess antimicrobial activity is one of the
   ground-breaking concepts in food packaging. The main object of this work
   was to develop nontoxic nanocomposite films with good antimicrobial
   properties. Cellulose acetate (CA), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) modified montmorillonite (OMMT)
   were used to prepare the nanocomposite films. OMMT is characterized
   using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared analysis.
   The films composed of 20 wt\% PEG in a CA matrix (CP20) gave optimum
   results in terms of mechanical properties. OMMT (1, 3 and 5 wt\%) was
   incorporated into the CP20 matrix to prepare the nanocomposites. XRD and
   transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the nanocomposites
   are intercalated in nature. 3 wt\% OMMT loaded nanocomposite gave the
   best results in terms of mechanical and barrier properties. The storage
   modulus and thermal stability of the nanocomposites increase with the
   increasing concentration of OMMT from 1-5 wt\%. Optical clarity of the
   nanocomposites is not much affected in the visible region with different
   loadings of OMMT. These nanocomposites possess good antimicrobial
   activity as well as showing no toxicity towards human blood, so can be
   used as active packaging material.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a research program investigating the
   potential of using Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) and fibers to
   improve the blast performance of reinforced concrete structural
   components. As part of the research program a series of fiber reinforced
   concrete (FRC) beams and columns constructed with SCC and fibers are
   tested under simulated blast loading using a high-capacity shock-tube.
   Test parameters considered include transverse reinforcement detailing,
   fiber content and fiber type. Under dynamic loading, the combined use of
   SCC and fibers is found to improve the blast performance of the beams by
   increasing shear capacity, reducing midspan displacements, increasing
   damage tolerance. The provision of fibers is also found to improve the
   blast performance of columns by reducing displacements and eliminating
   secondary blast fragments.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in microstructure observation technologies have
   significantly contributed towards rational characterization of the
   collapse behaviour of loess soils. In this paper, microstructure
   characteristics of collapsible loess are summarized taking account of
   the following four factors; particle pattern, contact relation, pore
   form and bonding material. The summarized research suggests that all the
   four factors are dependent on each other. The two dominant factors that
   control the collapse behaviour of loess are pore form and bonding
   material. In other words, spaced pores and clay bonds that are
   respectively related to the pore form and bonding material of
   collapsible soils are two key parameters that significantly influence
   their collapsibility behaviour. All four factors should however be
   fundamentally understood for comprehensive estimation of the collapse
   behaviour of loess soils.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, determination and prediction of the resilient modulus

   reliable pavement designs extending mechanistic design methods taking

   constitutive model proposed by Han \& Vanapalli (2015a) is extended to
   predict the non-linear M-R - s correlations for two different subgrade
   soils from China. This constitutive model is formed with only one
   constant model parameter that does not need calibration. In addition,
   all information required for using this model can be determined using
   conventional laboratory testing equipment. There is good agreement
   between the measurements and the predictions of the M-R - s correlations
   for the two soils investigated. The model introduced in this paper is
   simple and can be used in the prediction of the M-R - s correlations for
   compacted cohesive subgrade soils for the rational design of pavements.}},

Abstract = {{In conventional engineering practice, suction reduction associated with
   rainfall is considered to be the main cause of shallow slip failures in
   expansive soils slopes. Hydraulic analysis is usually used to interpret
   the expansive soil slope instability without considering cracks and
   coupling effects. In this study, expansive soil slope stability is
   numerically investigated using a typical representative slope in China.
   The hydraulic response (seepage analysis without considering coupling
   effect) and hydro-mechanical response (coupled analysis) of the slope
   are simulated using commercial software SEEP/W and SIGMA/W,
   respectively. The bimodal soil water characteristic curve and
   permeability function of a typical expansive soil from Zaoyang, Hubei,
   China, are used for considering the effect of cracks within the shallow
   layer. The factors of safety (FS) for shallow layer of unsaturated soil
   expansive slope are calculated using the two-dimensional modified Limit
   Equilibrium Method to incorporate effect of suction. The results of
   study summarized in this paper show that: (i) cracks significantly
   influence the hydraulic response and lower the FS; (ii) coupled analysis
   also results in lower FS in comparison to uncoupled analysis. Both the
   coupling behavior and cracks have adverse effects on the slope stability
   of expansive soils and hence should be taken into account in
   conventional engineering practice.}},

Abstract = {{Red clays are widely distributed in mountainous regions of various
   provinces in China; namely, Yunan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Hunan, and
   Guangdong. These clays are used as subgrade material for pavements in
   spite of their unfavorable properties because of lack of other favorable
   soils in these regions. In recent years, the resilient modulus, M-R of
   subgrade soil, which is a mechanistic property, has been used as key
   parameter in the rational design of pavement structures. Several studies
   in the literature established that the matric suction, psi(m) of
   unsaturated subgrade soil has a significant influence on the M-R. A
   series of dynamic triaxial compression tests are conducted on the
   compacted Red clay specimens from Chenzhou, Hunan Province, China to
   determine the various factors that influence the M-R. Based on the
   regression analyses on the testing data, a model has been proposed in
   this paper for predicting the variation of the M-R of Red clay with
   respect to psi(m), using the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) as a
   tool taking account of the influence of stress state (i.e. confining
   stress sigma(3), and deviator stress, sigma(d)).}},

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{105-119}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effects of two auditory stressors, fast
   stimulus rate and/or addition of white noise, on auditory processing of
   speech in normal hearing subjects.
   Design: Speech-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were collected
   using a 300 ms formant-synthesized /a/ vowel presented in four
   conditions: slow stimulus rate of 1.6/s in quiet, fast stimulus rate of
   3.1/s in quiet, slow stimulus rate of 1.6/s with continuous white noise,
   fast stimulus rate of 3.1/s with continuous white noise.
   Study sample: Twelve subjects (25 to 35 years old) with normal hearing
   thresholds.
   Results: A fast stimulus rate in quiet reduced amplitude response
   corresponding to F1 but not to F0. The addition of white noise at the
   slow stimulus rate reduced amplitude of wave V and response amplitude at
   F1 but increased response amplitude at F0. Changing from quiet-slow to
   noise-fast increased response amplitude at F0 by 2.9 dB (p<0.05), and
   decreased response amplitude at F1 and amplitude of wave V by 5.1 dB
   (p<0.01) and 4.7 dB (p<0.05) respectively. The interaction of fast
   stimulus rate with the addition of white noise demonstrated facilitative
   effects for response amplitude at F0, but occlusive or reversal effects
   for response amplitude at F1 and wave V amplitude.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the interaction of
   fast stimulus rate and addition of white noise on speech-evoked ABR in
   human subjects. The results indicate a clear dissociation in the
   speech-evoked ABR between the steady-state response at F0, and that at
   F1 or the transient wave V. The findings advance our understanding of
   the complex interaction of perceptual stressors in young normal-hearing
   adults.}},

Abstract = {{Information Fusion (IF) systems have long exploited data provided by
   hard (physics-based) sensors with the aspiration of making sense of the
   environment they are monitoring. In recent times, the IF community has
   recognized the potential of utilizing data generated by people, also
   known as soft data. In this study, we demonstrate how course of action
   (CoA) generation, one of the key elements of Level 3 High Level
   Information Fusion and a vital component for security and defense
   decision support systems, can be augmented using soft (human-derived)
   data for improved mission effectiveness. This conceptualization is
   validated through an elaborate experiment situated in the maritime
   world. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to
   apply soft data to automatic CoA generation in the maritime domain.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of representing image pixels in a way that is consistent
   with human perception is one of the essential problems in computer
   vision. An appropriate representation of pixels in an image can be of
   great help for the subsequent image analysis. A major kind of solutions
   for pixel color representation is to design novel color spaces from
   conventional sRGB color space so that the distance in the new color
   space can isotropically represent the color difference in the sense of
   human vision. Most of the color spaces, however, often transform the
   colors in the image using the same metrics. On the contrary, the human
   vision system can always auto adjust the sense of colors with respect to
   the view condition. In order to simulate the way that human perceives
   colors, we propose a novel color representation which can parameterize
   the color of each pixel with respect to the global color distribution in
   the current image. The underlying assumption of our proposed
   representation is the fact that the chrominance in a nature image is
   limited in the sense of human perception, and we call those colors as
   dominant colors in the image. We further assume that all the colors in a
   nature image can be modeled based on those dominant colors.
   Specifically, we first approximate the global image color distribution
   by the sum of a series of mixture Gaussian functions. The centroids of
   these Gaussian functions are regarded as the dominant colors of the
   image. In order to further model the colors not belonging to any of the
   Gaussian centroids, a simple linear model is proposed. Our proposed
   color representation explains the image color in a semantic way, and it
   can be easy to use for image analysis, such as segmentation, color
   editing, and compression.}},

Abstract = {{Of late, an iterative procedure for the generation of the prime
   implicants of switching functions by utilizing a new tabular mode of
   functional representation called clause-column table was developed by
   Das and Khabra. This approach of Das and Khabra generates all the prime
   implicants of the functions given either in the sum-of-products or in
   the product-of-sums forms, both canonical and noncanonical, and is
   computationally very efficient. The method can be applied for finding
   the prime implicants of functions having a large number of unspecified
   or don't care terms as well. In a clause-column table representation of
   a function, the set of literals or clauses defining a product or sum
   term in the sum-of-products or product-of-sums form, respectively,
   appears in a column, the total number of columns in the table being
   equal to the number of such product or sum terms. Although the basic
   principle utilized in the procedure is that of successive expansion
   around the literals as employed in some of the other existing methods,
   the manner the expansion is carried through is entirely different and
   greatly reduces the generation of the redundant terms. For a switching
   function specified in the product-of-sums form, the method produces all
   the prime implicants, while for a switching function given in the
   sum-of-products form, the procedure yields all the prime implicates
   first and is next applied to this set of prime implicates to obtain the
   prime implicants of the function. In the paper, an assessment of the
   performance of this prime implicant generation algorithm has been made
   by simulating it on a computer under conditions of different numbers of
   variables and different numbers of terms in the product-of-sums
   (sum-of-products) representations of the functions. The experimental
   outcome indicates that the algorithm performs quite elegantly with
   respect to the CPU time and memory usage.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of any speaker recognition system depends on the
   duration of the speech samples. The higher the number of feature vectors
   is, the better is the efficiency. A major contribution of this paper is
   in enhancing the identification accuracy of the speaker recognition
   system through minimization of the objective function and associated
   distortions. With nonlinear mapping, the sectional set fuzzy vector
   quantization with novel norm is utilized here as usual to form speaker's
   model in the high-dimensional feature space. However, during feature
   extraction, the traditional triangular shaped bins have been replaced by
   Gaussian shaped filter (GF) and Tukey filter (TF) for calculating the
   mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The paper presents
   experimental evaluation of three modeling techniques, viz. fuzzy
   c-means, fuzzy vector quantization (FVQ)2 and novel fuzzy vector
   quantization (NFVQ). On simulation, the NFVQ shows significant
   improvement in performance over fuzzy c-means and FVQ2. The experimental
   evidence demonstrates that for two seconds of training and one second of
   testing data, the efficiency of the NFVQ, with a minimum objective
   function of J(m) = 0.073 and distortion D = 4.334, for a set of 100
   speakers chosen from the Texas Instruments and Massachusetts Institute
   of Technology (TIMIT) database and self-collected database is 98.8\% and

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks have found their way into a wide range of
   applications among which environmental monitoring systems have attracted
   increasing interests of researchers. The main challenges for the
   applications are scalability of the network size and energy efficiency
   of the spatially distributed motes. These devices are mostly
   battery-powered and spend most of their energy budget on the radio
   transceiver module. A so-called Wake-On-Radio (WOR) technology can be
   used to achieve a reasonable balance among power consumption, range,
   complexity and response time. In this paper, a novel design for
   integration of WOR into IEEE802.1.5.4 is presented, which flexibly
   allows trade-offs in energy consumption between sender and receiver
   station, between real-time capability and energy consumption. For
   identical behavior, the proposed scheme is significantly more efficient
   than other schemes, which were proposed in recent publications, while
   preserving backward compatibility with standard IEEE802.15.4
   transceivers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new image watermarking scheme robust to geometric
   transformations and image compression. The approach presented here is
   based on contourlet transform (CT) and principal component analysis

   location. The principal components of contourlet coefficients are used
   to embed the watermark. Meanwhile, with the noise visibility function
   (NVF), the watermark embedding strength is adjusted adaptively to
   preserve the perceptual quality of the image. The watermark can be
   detected with high accuracy after various possible distortions.
   Moreover, the scheme can be extended to be blind for different

   good performance in terms of both fidelity and robustness against a

Abstract = {{Accurate positioning of objects within an indoor environment is
   essential for applications such as virtual reality, robotics and
   multirotor drones. Previous methods of obtaining six-degrees-of-freedom
   for a tracked object have been susceptible to latency and accumulated
   error, computationally intensive, inaccurate, costly, or required exotic
   components, setups and calibration procedures. This paper presents a
   novel architecture and implementation of an indoor tracking system that
   consists of a rotary-laser base station and a tracked object equipped
   with photodiode sensors. The base station emits horizontal and vertical
   laser lines that sweep across the environment in sequence. The base
   station also emits an infrared synchronization beacon that floods the
   environment between each sweep. The tracked object consists of multiple
   photodiode sensors and a processing unit. Based on the timings between
   the synchronization beacons and the sweeps observed by each photodiode,
   along with the known configuration of the photodiode constellation, the
   position and orientation of the tracked object can be determined with
   high accuracy, low latency, and low computational overhead. In addition,
   the system allows a large number of such objects to be tracked within
   the same space, as each tracked object can be a separate embedded
   device. The Nikon iGPS tracking system, along with the more recently

Abstract = {{Image super-resolution technique mainly aims at restoring
   high-resolution image with satisfactory novel details. In recent years,
   sparsity-based super-resolution has attracted great interests for its
   impressive results. By using learning dictionaries, sparsity-based
   methods try to find some mapping relationships as prior knowledge
   between low-and high-resolution example images for better
   reconstruction. In this paper, based on two of the state-of-the-art
   sparsity-based super-resolution methods, we propose a joint
   dictionary-based framework to improve the quality of reconstructed
   high-resolution images. Experimental results illustrate that our method
   outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of sharper
   edges, clearer textures and better novel details.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new blind watermarking scheme for
   depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) 3D images. The center view and the
   depth map are available at the content provider side. After applying
   contourlet transform (CT) to the center view, we embed the watermark
   into the selected contourlet subbands of the center view by quantization
   on certain contourlet coefficients. The virtual left and right views are
   generated from the watermarked center view and the associated depth map
   using DIBR technique at the receiver side. The statistical differences
   between quantized and unquantized contourlet coefficients are used for
   watermark extraction. The watermark can be detected with a low bit error
   rate (BER) from the center view, the left and right views even when each
   view is distorted and distributed separately. The simulation results
   demonstrate that our scheme keeps good perceptual quality of the
   watermarked images under both objective and subjective image quality
   estimations. Moreover, compared with other related methods, the proposed
   scheme has better performance in terms of robustness against image
   compression, noise addition and geometric attacks such as rotation,
   scaling and cropping.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY}},

Abstract = {{A Bi2WO6 photocatalyst modified with graphene was synthesized in a
   two-step template-free hydrothermal process. The prepared samples were
   characterized to explore their properties. The photocatalytic activities
   of the prepared samples were investigated by degrading dye model,
   Rhodamine B (RhB), under visible light irradiation. This showed that the
   modified Bi2WO6 photocatalyst with 1.2wt\% of graphene greatly improved
   photocatalytic activity during the degradation of dye pollutants,
   compared to pure Bi2WO6. The enhancement can be interpreted as the
   integrated effects of ultrahigh charge carriers' mobility and high
   adsorption of RhB on graphene. Additionally, effects including catalysts
   dosage amount, pH of RhB solution, and temperature of reactor on the
   photocatalytically degrading RhB were also studied and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A monolithic compound semiconductor phototransducer optimized for

   efficiencies exceeding 50\%. The III-V heterostructure was grown by
   MOCVD, based on the vertical stacking of a number of partially absorbing
   GaAs n/p junctions connected in series with tunnel junctions. The
   thicknesses of the p-type base layers of the diodes were engineered for
   optimal absorption and current matching for an optical input with
   wavelengths centered in the 830 nm to 850 nm range. The device
   architecture allows for improved open-circuit voltage in the individual
   base segments due to efficient carrier extraction while simultaneously
   maintaining a complete absorption of the input photons with no need for
   complicated fabrication processes or reflecting layers. Progress for
   device outputs achieving in excess of 12 V is reviewed in this study.}},

   We find that luminescent coupling effectively redistributes any excess
   generated photocurrent between all junctions leading to reduced
   wavelength sensitivity. This broadened response is consistent with
   experimental measurements of devices with high-quality materials
   exhibiting long carrier lifetimes. Photon recycling is also found to
   significantly improve the voltage of all junctions, in contrast to
   multi-junction solar cells which utilize junctions of differing bandgaps
   and where high-bandgap junctions benefit less from photon recycling.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) is greatly
   affected by the design of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol adopted
   by these networks. In large-scale networks, the MAC protocol of the IEEE
   802.11p standard may fail to provide the required Quality of Service
   (QoS) provisioning, in terms of delay and reliability, for
   safety-related applications. Therefore, new MAC mechanisms should be
   implemented to overcome the scalability problems and deal with the
   communication issues. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Time
   Synchronization (DTS) mechanism for cluster-based multi-layer large
   vehicular networks. Our mechanism divides the communication area to
   intra-cluster communication domain and inter-cluster communication
   domain. In the DTS mechanism, the Road Side Unit (RSU) does not
   synchronize the communication of the entire network, it just manages the
   time synchronization of the Cluster Heads (CH) in its immediate
   vicinity. The remaining part of the network is synchronized in a
   distributed manner by the CHs themselves. To avoid data loss, each CH is
   equipped with a finite buffer that stocks the packets received from
   other CHs or from the vehicles in the clusters. We develop an analytical

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is typically assumed to be constant for both saturated
   and unsaturated soils. However, the back-calculated Poisson's ratio
   using the relationship between elastic and shear modulus (i.e. the
   equation for homogeneous, isotropic and linear elastic continuum)
   published in the literature showed that the Poisson's ratio is not
   constant but decreases with the degree of saturation (or increasing
   suction). In the present study, more focused investigations are
   undertaken to study the influence of Poisson's ratio on the stress vs.
   settlement (SVS) behaviour of shallow foundations in an unsaturated
   fine-grained (UFG) soil. The FEA are carried out using the software,
   SIGMA/W (GeoStudio 2007) to better understand the SVS behavior taking
   account of the influence of Poisson's ratio for different matric suction
   values and compared with the model footing tests conducted in an UFG
   soil. Several suggestions are made with respect to the influence of
   Poisson's ratio on the SVS behavior of shallow foundations in the UFG
   soils based on the results of this study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the performance of concrete shear walls reinforced
   with Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) using nonlinear numerical modelling. A
   hysteretic constitutive model for Superelastic (SE) SMA reinforcing bars
   that was recently implemented into a nonlinear finite element analysis
   package applicable to reinforced concrete membrane structures and
   compatible with a compression field approach is presented. The objective
   of the model is to provide simple formulations that satisfactorily
   capture the forward and reverse transformations phases that superelastic
   SMAs experience when subjected to mechanical loading. The finite element
   model was corroborated with experimental results of a slender SMA
   reinforced concrete shear wall subjected to reverse cyclic loading. The
   model captures salient features of behaviour, including strength,
   ductility, energy dissipation, load-displacement response, cracking
   patterns, and failure modes. Nonlinear static analyses are conducted on
   the SMA reinforced shear wall and assessed against a companion
   traditional reinforced concrete shear wall. The comparison includes
   strength, ductility, and displacement recovery capacities. In addition,
   the effect of increasing axial load on the performance of the SMA and
   traditional reinforced walls is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Computer and machine vision applications are used in numerous fields to
   analyze static and dynamic imagery in order to assist or automate
   decision-making processes. Advancements in sensor technologies now make
   it possible to capture and visualize imagery at various wavelengths (or
   bands) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Multispectral imaging has
   countless applications in various fields including (but not limited to)
   security, defense, space, medical, manufacturing and archeology. The
   development of advanced algorithms to process and extract salient
   information from the imagery is a critical component of the overall
   system performance.
   The fundamental objective of this research project was to investigate
   the benefits of combining imagery from the visual and thermal bands of
   the electromagnetic spectrum to improve the recognition rates and
   accuracy of commonly found objects in an office setting. A multispectral
   dataset (visual and thermal) was captured and features from the visual
   and thermal images were extracted and used to train support vector
   machine (SVM) classifiers. The SVM's class prediction ability was
   evaluated separately on the visual, thermal and multispectral testing
   datasets.}},

   algorithm can be enhanced with ``markers{''} identifying clusters of

Abstract = {{This paper suggests the use of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithms to
   tune the parameters of Takagi-Sugeno proportional-integral-fuzzy
   controllers (PI-FCs) for a class of nonlinear servo systems. The servo
   systems are modelled by second order dynamics plus a saturation and dead
   zone static nonlinearity. The GWO algorithms solve the optimization
   problems that minimize discrete-time objective functions expressed as
   the weighted sum of the squared control error and of the squared output
   sensitivity function in order to achieve the parametric sensitivity
   reduction. The output sensitivity function is derived from the
   sensitivity model with respect to the modification of the process gain,
   and fuzzy control systems with a reduced process gain sensitivity are
   offered. Three parameters of Takagi-Sugeno PI-FCs are obtained by a new
   cost-effective tuning approach. Experimental results related to the
   angular position control of a laboratory servo system validate the
   tuning approach. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

   context of software and requirements engineering empirical research.
   Toward this, we offer a review of key principles underlying the lean
   mindset and provide an overview of the typical processes followed in DSR
   research projects. Subsequently, we reflect the potential for lean
   development approaches to facilitate DSR projects. {[}Contribution:] We
   propose a conceptual framework that integrates lean principles with DSR

Abstract = {{Airships offer a low-cost alternative to heavier-than-air vehicles for

   manoeuvring an under-actuated vehicle in a real environment while taking

   This paper examines the use of optimal control for the trajectory
   planning of a small airship. The dynamic model of the vehicle and the
   experimental characterization of the drag coefficient are presented
   first, followed by the description of the trajectory planning problem
   formulated as an optimal control problem. Two trajectories are then
   solved using a pseudo-spectral solver to demonstrate that an optimal

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the role of coherent structures as mechanisms of
   scalar dispersion, we studied measurements of a passive scalar plume
   released in a uniformly sheared turbulent flow generated in a water
   tunnel. The flow had homogeneous turbulence properties in the
   measurement domain and contained hairpin vortices similar to those in
   boundary layers, and so was an ideal test bed to study the effects of
   coherent structures on turbulent dispersion, free from the effects of
   inhomogeneities or boundaries. Measurements of the velocity and
   concentration fields were acquired simultaneously using stereo particle
   image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluorescence. We found that
   dye was preferentially located far away from vortices and was less
   likely to appear in close proximity to vortices, which is attributed to
   the high dissipation at the periphery of the vortices. However, we also
   found that dye was not directly correlated with the uniform momentum
   zones in the flow, suggesting a more complex relationship exists between
   these zones, the locations of vortices, and dye transport. Considering
   scalar flux events rather than simply the presence of dye as our
   condition of interest, a conditional eddy analysis demonstrated that
   hairpin vortices are responsible for the large scalar flux events as
   well as the large Reynolds stress events in the flow. The fact that the
   Reynolds stress was correlated with the scalar flux further confirmed
   that coherent structures are dominant mechanisms for scalar transport.
   Furthermore, we found that the scalar flux vector was preferentially
   inclined by 155 degrees and -25 degrees with respect to the streamwise
   direction, and was thus approximately orthogonal to the planes of the
   legs of the most common upright and inverted hairpin structures in the
   flow. These findings demonstrate that coherent structures play an
   important and intricate role in turbulent diffusion.}},

   Provisioning in Vehicular Cloud}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Pages = {{3153-3168}},
Abstract = {{The increasing number of applications based on the Internet of Things,
   as well as advances in wireless communication, information and
   communication technology, and mobile cloud computing, has allowed mobile
   users to access a wider range of resources when mobile. As the use of
   vehicular cloud computing has become more popular due to its ability to
   improve driver and vehicle safety, researchers and industry have a
   growing interest in the design and development of vehicular networks for
   emerging applications. Vehicle drivers can now access a variety of on
   demand resources en route via vehicular network service providers. The
   adaptation of vehicular cloud services faces many challenges, including
   cost, privacy, and latency. The contributions of this paper are as
   follows. First, we propose a game theory-based framework to manage
   on-demand service provision in a vehicular cloud. We present three
   different game approaches, each of which helps drivers minimize their
   service costs and latency, and maximize their privacy. Second, we
   propose a quality-of-experience framework for service provision in a
   vehicular cloud for various types of users, a simple but effective model
   to determine driver preferences. Third, we propose using the trusted
   third party concept to represent drivers and service providers, and
   ensure fair game treatment. We develop and evaluate simulations of the
   proposed approaches under different network scenarios with respect to
   privacy, service cost, and latency, by varying the vehicle density and
   driver preferences. The results show that the proposed approach
   outperforms conventional models, since the game theory system introduces
   a bounded latency of <= 3\%, achieves service cost savings up to 65\%,
   and preserves driver privacy by reducing revealed information by up to
   47\%.}},

Title = {{Optimal Trust System Placement in Smart Grid SCADA Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{2907-2919}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to propose a trust system placement
   scheme for smart grid supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
   networks. The functionalities of a trust system include firewalling and
   network intrusion detection. It is capable of monitoring both ingress
   traffic and egress traffic. In order to minimize the capital expenditure
   (CAPEX) and the operational expenditure (OPEX), only a selected number
   of nodes are equipped with trust systems. Those nodes are known as the
   trust nodes. This paper studies the trust system placement problem from
   a network topological perspective. It develops a scheme that aims to
   defend SCADA networks, deploying minimal number of trust nodes. It uses
   a network segmentation approach to distribute the trust nodes. It
   considers the minimum spanning tree (MST) as a measure of geographic
   dispersion. In the segmentation approach, size balancing and geographic
   dispersion are two main concerns. The segment sizes affect the number of
   required trust nodes. On the other hand, geographic dispersion affects
   the response time. The proposed scheme computes trust nodes using linear
   programming problem (LPP) formulations and local search. Numerical
   analysis is conducted through case studies for the IEEE test system
   topologies. It reveals the consistency of performance, better quality of
   protection, and low computational time. The proposed scheme can be a
   useful cyber security planning tool for smart grid operators.}},

Abstract = {{Amine-functionalized graphene has been chemically tagged within
   long-chain polyurethane molecules, using graphene as a chain extender to
   prepare a nanohybrid, and its novelty has been explored by comparing its
   properties with those of physically dispersed functionalized graphene in
   polyurethane based on di-ol as a chain extender. Chemical tagging has
   been confirmed through NMR studies and the nature of the interaction
   between the polymer matrix and graphene (nanofiller) is stronger in the
   chemically tagged nanohybrid compared to a nanohybrid prepared through
   physical mixture, as revealed from FTIR, UV-visible and PL spectroscopic
   measurement. A homogeneous dispersion of graphene platelets is achieved
   through a chemically tagged nanohybrid as against the agglomerated
   nanostructure found in a physically mixed nanohybrid. Enhancement of
   thermal properties and toughening of the nanohybrids is observed, whose
   extent is significantly higher in the chemically tagged nanohybrid due
   to greater interactions between the components and the uniform
   dispersion of nanofiller. Graphene-induced self-assembly from the
   nanometer scale to the micron level (step by step) was investigated
   through X-ray diffraction, small angle neutron scattering, atomic force
   microscopy and optical images in the order of nanometer, tens of
   nanometer, hundreds of nanometer and micron size, respectively. The
   effects of self-assembly on drug release and the biocompatible nature of
   the nanohybrids were monitored using HeLa cells, looking at cell
   viability, cell adhesion and fluorescence imaging. Significant sustained
   release of an anti-cancer drug was obtained using the chemically tagged
   nanohybrid and understanding gained of its kinetic behavior and
   mechanism. The greater biocompatibility of the chemically tagged
   nanohybrid was revealed through cell adhesion and fluorescence imaging,
   demonstrating a superior biomaterial which delivers the anti-cancer drug
   in a sustained manner. Hence, the developed nanohybrid is a potential
   biomaterial for drug delivery and tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The need to develop innovative types of hemodialysis membranes stems
   from the increasing incidence of renal failure and the abysmally low
   availability of healthy kidneys for transplantation. We aim to improve
   the efficiency and biocompatibility of hemodialysis membranes by the
   incorporation of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes/polyvinyl
   pyrrolidone (f-MWCNTs/PVP) composites into the polyetherimide membrane
   matrix. The mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were characterized by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, porosity, thermo-gravimetric analysis,
   etc. The change in cross-sectional and top surface morphology of the
   flat sheet mixed matrix membranes could be observed using scanning
   electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The improvement in the
   hydrophilicity was confirmed by the smaller water contact angle values
   observed. Membranes with higher concentration of the f-MWCNTs exhibited
   significant creatinine adsorption from model solutions in static
   conditions. These membranes when challenged with model protein solutions
   (albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen), displayed a significant depression
   in the quantity of proteins adsorbed, which is an indication of enhanced
   biocompatibility. Moreover, the membranes also prolonged blood
   coagulation time, suppressed attachment/activation of platelets and
   prevented hemolysis of the contacted red blood cells. The improvement of
   Chang Liver cell viability evidenced by formazan adsorption and the
   double cell staining technique is an indication of the cytocompatibility
   of these MMMs. Hollow fiber membranes of the same composition were
   prepared and potted into a module so as to create an effective surface
   area of 0.7 m(2). The ultrafiltration coefficient, human serum albumin
   retention, was evaluated and found to be superior for these prepared
   membrane modules. These mixed matrix hollow fiber membranes demonstrated
   a greater removal of uremic toxins due to adsorption as well as
   diffusion. These membranes should be further investigated as potential
   blood purification systems.}},

Abstract = {{Consolidation of servers through virtualization, facilitated by the use
   of hypervisors, allows multiple servers to share a single hardware
   platform. Xen is a widely preferred hypervisor, mainly, due to its dual
   virtualization modes, virtual machine migration support and scalability.
   This paper involves an analysis of the virtual CPU (vCPU) scheduling
   algorithms in Xen, on the basis of their performance while handling
   compute intensive or I/O intensive domains in virtualized server
   environments. Based on this knowledge, the selection of CPU scheduler in
   a hypervisor can be aligned with the requirements of the hosted
   applications. We introduce a new credit-based vCPU scheduling strategy,
   which allows the vCPUs of I/O intensive domains to supersede other
   vCPUs, in order to favor the reduction of I/O bound domain response
   times and the subsequent bottleneck in the CPU run queue. The results
   indicate substantial improvement of I/O handling and fair resource
   allocation between the host and guest domains.}},

Abstract = {{Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection in streaming
   data are based on decision trees due to their fast construction speed

   online learning algorithm involving an ensemble of threaded multilayer
   perceptrons (MLP). The other model is a one-class learning algorithm
   with an ensemble of threaded autoencoders. The latter model only
   requires data from the positive class for training and is accurate even
   when anomalous training data are rare. The models feature an ensemble of
   multilayer perceptrons or autoencoders from multi-threads which evolve
   with data streams. Using multi-threads makes the methods highly
   efficient because both methods process data streams in parallel. Our
   analysis shows that both methods in streaming data have constant small
   time complexity and constant memory requirement. When compared with Very
   Fast Decision Trees (VFDT), a state-of-the-art algorithm, our methods
   performed favorably in terms of detection accuracy and training time for
   the datasets under consideration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new system-level fault diagnosis approach using
   support vector machines (SVMs). The objective of the fault diagnosis
   problem is to identify the set of permanent faulty nodes when at most t
   nodes can fail simultaneously. We consider both the asymmetric and
   symmetric comparison models which assume that nodes are assigned a set
   of tasks and their outcomes are compared. Based on the comparison
   outcomes, the diagnosis algorithm must identify all faulty nodes. In
   both models, it is assumed that two fault-free nodes give matching
   results, while a faulty and a fault-free node give mismatching outcomes.
   The two models differ in the assumption on comparisons involving pairs
   of faulty nodes. In the asymmetric model, two faulty nodes always give
   mismatching outputs, while in the symmetric model, both comparison
   outcomes are possible in this case. For the asymmetric comparison model,
   we show that a linear SVM is sufficient to solve the diagnosis problem,
   while for the symmetric model a nonlinear SVM is developed. The new
   SVM-based diagnosis is first trained using various input syndromes with
   known fault sets. Then, it is extensively tested using randomly
   generated diagnosable systems of different sizes and under various fault
   scenarios. Results from the thorough simulation study demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the SVM-based fault diagnosis approach, in terms of
   diagnosis correctness, latency and scalability. We also conducted
   extensive simulations using partial syndromes, i.e. when not all the
   comparison outcomes were available before initiating the diagnosis
   phase. Simulations showed that the SVM-based diagnosis performed
   efficiently, i.e. diagnosis correctness was around 99\% even when at
   most half of the comparison outcomes were missing, making it a viable
   addition or alternative to existing diagnosis algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A significant body of literature has reported strategies and techniques
   to assess the mechanical properties of biological samples such as
   proteins, cellular and tissue systems. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has
   been used to detect elasticity changes of cancer cells. However, only a
   few studies have provided a detailed and complete protocol of the
   experimental procedures and data analysis methods for non-adherent blood
   cancer cells. In this work, the elasticity of NB4 cells derived from
   acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was probed by AFM indentation
   measurements to investigate the effects of the disease on cellular
   biomechanics. Understanding how leukemia influences the nanomechanical
   properties of cells is expected to provide a better understanding of the
   cellular mechanisms associated with cancer, and promises to become a
   valuable new tool for cancer detection and staging. In this context, the
   quantification of the mechanical properties of APL cells requires a
   systematic and optimized approach for data collection and analysis in
   order to generate reproducible and comparative data. This report
   elucidates the automated data analysis process that integrates
   programming, force curve collection and analysis optimization to assess
   variations of cell elasticity in response to processing criteria. A
   processing algorithm was developed to automatically analyze large
   numbers of AFM datasets in an efficient and accurate manner. In fact,
   since the analysis involves multiple steps that must be repeated for
   many individual cells, an automated and unbiased processing approach is
   essential to precisely determine cell elasticity. Different fitting
   models for extracting the Young's modulus have been systematically
   applied to validate the process, and the best fitting criteria, such as
   the contact point location and indentation length, have been determined
   in order to obtain consistent results. The designed automated processing
   code described in this report not only permits us to correlate
   alterations in cellular biomechanics to cancer cell maturity, but also
   to assess drug-induced changes in cell elasticity for drug screening
   purposes.}},

Title = {{A Vehicular Cloud-Based Framework for the Intelligent Transport
   Management of Big Cities}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{An intelligent transport system (ITS) is intended to streamline the
   operations of vehicles, manage vehicle traffic, and help drivers with
   safety and other information, as well as supply convenient applications
   for passengers. This system is essential for tackling the problems of a
   big city, like traffic congestion and a lack of a communication
   infrastructure or traffic engineering, among other factors. With these
   challenges in mind, we propose a vehicular cloud architecture to assist
   in the management of large cities. This will create a framework to
   support different types of services as well as provide storage
   mechanisms, access, and information management which includes tools for
   different modes of transport not only for citizens but also for
   commercial vehicles and emergency services like ambulances. In addition,
   it will be possible to increase the capacity for abstraction to meet
   information needs through the use of vehicular networks and the
   integration of VANETs with other networks, so as to provide relevant
   information for the monitoring and management of an intelligent
   transport system.}},

Abstract = {{In Canada, poisoning deaths are classified as unintentional, suicide,
   homicide or undetermined. However, there is a significant proportion of
   deaths which are classified as undetermined. This work describes a
   methodology to classify cases of poisoning-related deaths that were
   misclassified as undetermined, using data from the Canadian Coroner and
   Medical Examiner Database (CCMED). The research work used Decision Trees
   (DTs), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), and Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANNs), using a number of known cases of suicides and of unintentional
   deaths, to classify undetermined cases as a suicide or an unintentional
   poisoning. The performance achieved a sensitivity of 96\% (true
   positives or suicides), a specificity of 84\% (true negatives or
   unintentional), and an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
   Curve (ROC) of 0.96. The results will help to calculate better estimates
   of the rates of suicides and of unintentional deaths by poison.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of water vapour on gas permeation and
   separation properties of zeolite membranes especially at lower
   temperatures is important for the applications of these zeolite
   membranes for gas separations involving water vapour. Zeolite membranes
   have high potential for the purification of natural gas, biogas and
   syn-gas to produce the pipe-line gas and often those gases contain
   moisture. The separation of gases via zeolite is quite complex,
   particularly in the presence of water vapour in the feed stream. The
   increase of the fluxes of other gaseous components has been reported in
   some articles while the decrease is reported in the others. As well,
   both increase and decrease of selectivity are reported. Despite many
   works conducted during the past 15 years the details on the effect of
   the water vapour remain unknown. In this paper attempts are made to
   summarize the results of the experimental investigations with an
   emphasis on five types of zeolites, e.g. ZSM (MFI), DDR (deca-dodecasil
   3R), SAPO-34 (silicoaluminophosphate), FAU (fauzasite) and 4A zeolite.
   As well, interpretation of the experimental observations is attempted

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Functional polymeric coatings have rapidly become one of the most
   efficient strategies to endow biomaterials with enhanced bioactive
   properties. Among the bio-inspired polymers used for biomedical
   applications, mussel-derived poly(dopamine) (PDA) has increasingly
   attracted considerable interest because of its unique characteristics.
   In this work, we carried out detailed physicochemical characterization
   of a PDA film deposited on nanoporous titanium. In particular, we
   employed spectroscopic techniques (Raman and ATR-FTIR) and Digital
   Pulsed Force Mode Atomic Force microscopy (DPFM-AFM) to probe the
   chemical makeup and the nanomechanical properties of PDA-coated
   surfaces. In addition, we investigated protein adsorption by ATR-FTIR
   and quantified it with ten different serum proteins by Liquid
   Chromatography Mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), aiming at elucidating their
   potential contribution to the subsequent cell colonization.
   Successively, we assessed the response of MG-63 human osteoblastic cells
   to PDA-coated titanium both the multiple-and single-cell levels. Results
   for this study demonstrate that, compared to bare and nanoporous
   titanium, the PDA coating positively influences the adhesion and
   proliferation of MG-63 cells. In addition, we focus on how the three
   different substrates influence cell morphology (i.e. aspect ratio and
   form factor), the establishment of focal adhesions and the expression of
   RhoA, a protein involved in cell contractility. In conclusion, our work
   provides a deeper insight on the in vitro response of human osteoblastic
   cells to poly(dopamine) by closing in on specific aspects of cell-PDA
   interactions, ultimately reaffirming the potential of this bio-inspired
   polymer as a functional coating for bone tissue engineering
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium implants have been extensively used in orthopedic and dental
   applications. It is well known that micro-and nanoscale surface features
   of biomaterials affect cellular events that control implant-host tissue
   interactions. To improve our understanding of how multiscale surface
   features affect cell behavior, we used microarrays to evaluate the
   transcriptional profile of osteoblastic cells from human alveolar bone
   cultured on engineered titanium surfaces, exhibiting the following
   topographies: nanotexture (N), nano+submicrotexture (NS), and rough
   microtexture (MR), obtained by modulating experimental parameters
   (temperature and solution composition) of a simple yet efficient
   chemical treatment with a H2SO4/H2O2 solution. Biochemical assays showed
   that cell culture proliferation augmented after 10 days, and cell
   viability increased gradually over 14 days. Among the treated surfaces,
   we observed an increase of alkaline phosphatase activity as a function
   of the surface texture, with higher activity shown by cells adhering
   onto nanotextured surfaces. Nevertheless, the rough microtexture group
   showed higher amounts of calcium than nanotextured group. Microarray
   data showed differential expression of 716 mRNAs and 32 microRNAs with
   functions associated with osteogenesis. Results suggest that oxidative
   nanopatterning of titanium surfaces induces changes in the metabolism of
   osteoblastic cells and contribute to the explanation of the mechanisms
   that control cell responses to micro- and nanoengineered surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Permeability characteristics of the anti-hypertensive drug, diltiazem
   hydrochloride, from uncross-linked and cross-linked methylcellulose
   (MC)/graphene oxide (GO) rate controlling membranes (RCMs) were
   investigated. The MC/GO membranes were cross-linked with different
   concentrations of glutaraldehyde (GLA) to examine the effect of
   cross-linking on the permeability characteristics. The ATR-FTIR spectra,
   along with solubility resistance, swelling studies, the molar mass
   between cross-links, and moisture absorption of cross-linked RCMs over
   the uncross-linked RCM confirmed the cross-linking between MC and GO.
   The cross sectional view of cross-linked and uncross-linked RCMs, as
   observed by SEM, showed that the porous and fibrillose structure of the
   uncross-linked RCM was disrupted after cross-linking. The cross-linked
   RCMs showed improved mechanical and thermal properties compared to the
   uncross-linked RCMs. In vitro and ex vivo drug release was found to
   depend on the concentration of the cross-linker, which suggests that
   drug delivery is controlled by the cross-link density of RCM.}},

Abstract = {{This work evaluates the thermal and hydrodynamic performance of
   pyramidal fin arrays produced using cold spray as an additive
   manufacturing process. Near-net-shaped pyramidal fin arrays of pure
   aluminum, pure nickel, and stainless steel 304 were manufactured. Fin
   array characterization such as fin porosity level and surface roughness
   evaluation was performed. The thermal conductivities of the three
   different coating materials were measured by laser flash analysis. The
   results obtained show a lower thermal efficiency for stainless steel
   304, whereas the performances of the aluminum and nickel fin arrays are
   similar. This result is explained by looking closely at the fin and
   substrate roughness induced by the cold gas dynamic additive
   manufacturing process. The multi-material fin array sample has a better
   thermal efficiency than stainless steel 304. The work demonstrates the
   potential of the process to produce streamwise anisotropic fin arrays as
   well as the benefits of such arrays.}},

   spread are statistically modeled for possible use-cases corresponding to

   Compared to common indoor environments, delay spread and path loss
   values suggest a better link budget at higher distances and possibly
   higher interference in dense deployment scenarios. The reported models

Abstract = {{At critical infrastructure sites, either large number of onsite
   personnel, or many cameras are needed to keep all key access points
   under continuous observation. With the proliferation of inexpensive high
   quality video imaging devices, and improving internet bandwidth, the
   deployment of large numbers of cameras monitored from a central location
   have become a practical solution. Monitoring a high number of critical
   infrastructure sites may cause the operator of the surveillance system
   to become distracted from the many video feeds, possibly missing key
   events, such as suspicious individuals approaching a door or leaving an
   object behind. An automated monitoring system for these types of events
   within a video feed alleviates some of the burden placed on the
   operator, thereby increasing the overall reliability and performance of
   the system, as well as providing archival capability for future
   investigations. In this work, a solution that uses a background
   subtraction-based segmentation method to determine objects within the
   scene is proposed. An artificial neural network classifier is then
   employed to determine the class of each object detected in every frame.
   This classification is then temporally filtered using Bayesian inference
   in order to minimize the effect of occasional misclassifications. Based
   on the object's classification and spatio-temporal properties, the
   behavior is then determined. If the object is considered of interest,
   feedback is provided to the background subtraction segmentation
   technique for background fading prevention reasons. Furthermore any
   undesirable behavior will generate an alert, to spur operator action.}},

Abstract = {{Security in computer networks is an active research field since
   traditional approaches (e.g., access control, encryption, firewalls,
   etc.) are unable to completely protect networks from attacks and
   malwares. That is why Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have become an
   essential component of security infrastructure to detect these threats
   before they inflict widespread damage. Concisely, network intrusion
   detection is essentially a pattern recognition problem in which network
   traffic patterns are classified as either normal or abnormal. Several
   Computational Intelligence (CI) methods have been proposed to solve this
   challenging problem, including fuzzy sets, swarm intelligence,
   artificial neural networks and evolutionary computation. Despite the
   relative success of such methods, the complexity of the classification
   task associated with intrusion detection demands more effective models.
   On the other hand, there are scenarios where identifying abnormal
   patterns could be a challenge as the collected data is still permeated
   with uncertainty. In this chapter, we tackle the network intrusion
   detection problem from a classification angle by using a recently
   proposed granular model named Rough Cognitive Networks (RCN). An RCN is
   a fuzzy cognitive map that leans upon rough set theory to define its
   topological constructs. An optimization-based learning mechanism for
   RCNs is also introduced. The empirical evidence indicates that the RCN
   is a suitable approach for detecting abnormal traffic patterns in
   computer networks.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of user authentication is a crucial component of many
   solutions related to defense and security. The identification and
   verification of users allows the implementation of technologies and
   services oriented to the intended user and to prevent misuse by
   illegitimate users. It has become an essential part of many systems and
   it is used in several applications, particularly in the military. The
   handwritten signature is an element intrinsically endowed with
   specificity related to an individual and it has been used extensively as
   a key element in identification/authentication. Haptic technologies
   allow the use of additional information like kinesthetic and tactile
   feedback from the user, thus providing new sources of biometric
   information that can be incorporated within the process in addition to
   the traditional image-based sources. While work had been done on using
   haptic information for the analysis of handwritten signatures, most
   efforts have been oriented to the direct use of machine learning
   techniques for identification/verification. Comparatively fewer targeted
   information visualization and understanding the internal structure of
   the data. Here a variety of techniques are used for obtaining
   representations of the data in low dimensional spaces amenable to visual
   inspection (two and three dimensions). The approach is unsupervised,
   although for illustration and comparison purposes, class information is
   used as qualitative reference. Estimations of the intrinsic dimension
   for the haptic data are obtained which shows that low dimensional
   subspaces contains most of the data structure. Implicit and explicit
   mappings techniques transforming the original high dimensional data to
   low dimensional spaces are considered. They include linear and
   nonlinear, classical and computational intelligence based methods:
   Principal Components, Sammon mapping, Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding,
   Spectral Embedding, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding,
   Generative Topographic Mapping, Neuroscale and Genetic Programming They
   provided insight about common and specific characteristics found in
   haptic signatures, their within/among subjects variability and the
   important role of certain types of haptic variables. The results
   obtained suggest ways how to design new representations for
   identification and verification procedures using tactile devices.}},

Title = {{Affective Haptics: Current Research and Future Directions}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{26-40}},
Abstract = {{Touch plays a prominent role in communicating emotions and intensifying
   interpersonal communication. Affective haptics is an emerging field,
   which focuses on the analysis, design, and evaluation of systems that
   can capture, process, or display emotions through the sense of touch.
   The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the recent
   achievements in affective haptics and to discuss how the sense of touch
   can elicit or influence human emotions. We first introduce a definition
   to the term affective haptics and describe its multidisciplinary nature
   as a field that integrates ideas from affective computing, haptic
   technology, and user experience. Second, we provide a thorough
   discussion about the effectiveness of using the haptic channel to
   communicate affective information through direct and mediated means.
   Third, we present a variety of applications in the area ranging from
   interhuman social interaction systems to human robot interaction
   applications. Finally, we discuss some of the key findings discerned
   from the various surveyed papers, and present some of the challenges and
   trends in this field. We extract the following conclusions pertaining to
   affective haptics: 1) haptic stimulation can be successfully used to
   achieve a higher level of emotional immersion during media consumption
   or emotional telepresence; 2) existing research has demonstrated that
   haptics is effective in communicating valence and arousal, and the
   emotions of happiness, sadness, anger and fear, and less focus have been
   given to the communication of disgust and surprise; 3) the haptic-based
   affect detection remains an understudied topic, whereas the haptic-based
   affect display is a well-established subject; and 4) the interpretation
   of the haptic stimulation by human beings is highly contextual.}},

Title = {{Magnetic Field Control for Haptic Display: System Design and Simulation}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{299-311}},
Abstract = {{We present magnetic rendering, a new haptic display method applying an
   electromagnet array to produce magnetic field in mid-air where the force
   field can be felt as magnetic repulsive force exerted on the hand
   through the attached magnet disks. The magnetic field is generated by a
   specifically designed electromagnet array driven by direct current. By
   attaching small magnet disks on the hand, the tactile sensation can be
   perceived by the user. This method can provide a strong tactile force
   and avoid cumbersome attachments with wires, and thus, it is suitable
   for a colocated visual and haptic display. In this paper, we introduce
   the detailed design of the electromagnet array for haptic rendering
   purposes, which is modeled and tested using finite-element method
   simulations. We characterize the model mathematically, and apply
   recursive least squares adaptive control algorithm for controlling the
   magnetic field. We evaluate the performance of our simulated model in
   terms of force strength, operation distance, and force stiffness. We
   then implement and test the control algorithm, which results in fast and
   accurate convergence. We conclude with simulations on a 15-by-15 model
   to generate a haptic human face, which results in a smooth force field
   and accurate force exertion on the control points.}},

Title = {{Ag/AgCl Loaded Bi2WO6 Composite: A Plasmonic Z-Scheme Visible
   Light-Responsive Photocatalyst}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchical flower-like Bi2WO6 was successfully synthesized by facile
   hydrothermal method at low pH. And Ag/AgCl was loaded by photoreduction
   on its surface. As-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by various
   techniques. Bi2WO6 was successfully synthesized at a size of 2-3 mu m.
   Depositing Ag/AgCl did not destroy the crystal structure, and both Ag+
   and metallic Ag-0 were found. The band gap of the composite was 2.57 eV,
   which indicates that visible light could be the activating irradiation.
   In the photocatalytic activity test, the composite with 10 wt\% Ag/AgCl
   boasted the highest removal efficiency (almost 100\%) in 45 min. The
   significant enhancement can be attributed to the surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) effect and the establishment of heterostructures between
   Ag/AgCl and Bi2WO6. A possible mechanism of photocatalytic oxidation in
   the presence of Ag/AgCl-Bi2WO6 was proposed. This work sheds light on
   the potential applications of plasmonic metals in photocatalysis to
   enhance their activities.}},

Title = {{Human Breathing Rate Estimation from Radar Returns Using Harmonically
   Related Filters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Radar-based noncontact sensing of life sign signals is often used in
   safety and rescue missions during disasters such as earthquakes and
   avalanches and for home care applications. The radar returns obtained
   from a human target contain the breathing frequency along with its
   strong higher harmonics depending on the target's posture. As a
   consequence, well understood, computationally efficient, and the most
   popular traditional FFT-based estimators that rely only on the strongest
   peak for estimates of breathing rates may be inaccurate. The paper
   proposes a solution for correcting the estimation errors of such single
   peak-based algorithms. The proposed method is based on using
   harmonically related comb filters over a set of all possible breathing
   frequencies. The method is tested on three subjects for different
   postures, for different distances between the radar and the subject, and
   for two different radar platforms: PN-UWB and phase modulated-CW (PM-CW)
   radars. Simplified algorithms more suitable for real-time implementation
   have also been proposed and compared using accuracy and computational
   complexity. The proposed breathing rate estimation algorithms provide a
   reduction of about 81\% and 80\% in the mean absolute error of breathing
   rates in comparison to the traditional FFT-based methods using strongest
   peak detection, for PN-UWB and PM-CW radars, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Bile salts carry out a vital bioactive responsibility among the various
   physiologically important molecules. The use of bile acids and their
   conjugates in nanoscience is a novel idea, which opens up fascinating
   prospects and gives rise to various versatile properties. Sodium
   cholate, a biosurfactant which is environmentally safe, has been used to
   reduce and stabilize silver nitrate solution. The silver nanostructures
   thus produced are crystalline and anisotropic in nature and show
   different types of particle shapes and sizes depending on the reaction
   conditions including star and wire shapes which have not been reported
   earlier, by simply varying the reaction conditions. The silver precursor
   concentration and the ratio of sodium cholate to silver precursor were
   the key factors which controlled the morphosynthesis. The formation of
   the silver NPs was monitored using UV-vis spectrophotometry. The
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique was used to study the
   morphology of the synthesized NPs. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
   spectroscopy was used to identify the interaction of sodium cholate with
   the synthesized NP. The possible mechanistic role of sodium cholate in
   the reduction and stabilization of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) has
   also been discussed. The obtained Ag NPs exhibit antibacterial and
   anticancerous activities. The present study also explores the cytotoxic
   role of Ag NPs in KG-1A (human acute myeloid leukemia) and K562 (human

   piperazine (PIP) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) monomers. Nanomaterials
   were dispersed into the monomer solution using two different approaches.
   In the first one, the functionalized TNTs were dispersed into the amine
   aqueous solution, while in the second approach the same nanomaterials
   were dispersed in TMC organic solution. The TFN membranes were
   characterized and compared with a control thin film composite (TFC)
   membrane to investigate the effect of nanofiller loadings and the
   fabrication approach on membrane properties. Results showed that
   introducing nanofillers into the organic phase was more effective to
   synthesize a TFN membrane of greater separation performance as the use
   of a rubber roller to remove aqueous solution from the substrate surface
   could cause the loss of a significant amount of nanofillers, which
   further affected the polyamide layer integrity. It was also found that
   the incorporation of a high nanofiller loading tended to interfere with
   interfacial polymerization and weaken the bonds between monomer blocks,
   resulting in poor polyamide-nanotube integrity. Compared to the TFC
   membrane, the TFN membrane made of 2\% PIP and 0.15\% TMC with 0.5\%
   nanofiller incorporation could achieve greater water flux (7.5 vs. 5.4 L
   m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)) and Na2SO4 rejection (96.4\% vs. 86\%) while
   exhibiting higher resistance against fouling by protein and dye.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in Electric Vehicles (EVs) are expected to greatly reduce the
   carbon emissions from surface transport if they are widely used and
   efficiently charged. One of the main limitations of EVs is their limited
   range and relatively long recharging times. This limitation is closely
   associated with the current battery technologies used in the EVs. In
   order to efficiently utilize the EVs, their charging schedules and
   locations must be effectively integrated within the smart grid.
   Real-time and reliable integration of EVs with the smart grid could
   solve problems related to demand response, cost and time of charging. In
   this paper, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art in Wireless
   Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)
   applications and highlight the main challenges associated with
   implementing WAVE in V2G applications. We present two IEEE 802.11p-based
   Quality of Service (QoS) schemes to facilitate the interaction between
   the smart grid and EVs, namely, QoS scheme for Charging EVs (QCEV) in a
   smart grid environment and a Channel Access Control (CAC) scheme. Unlike
   conventional contention based distributed QoS approaches used by the
   IEEE 802.11p MAC protocol, both of the QCEV and the CAC schemes provide
   centralized QoS differentiation in situations where urgent EV battery
   charging is required. The centralization is done at the Access Point
   (AP) which takes an informed decision on which EV should receive highest
   priority to access the channel based on the individual EV battery
   levels, and also based on the availability and cost of the electricity
   at different locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Data mining has been successfully applied in many businesses, thus
   aiding managers to make informed decisions that are based on facts,
   rather than having to rely on guesswork and incorrect extrapolations.
   Data mining algorithms equip institutions to predict the movements of
   financial indicators, enable companies to move towards more
   energy-efficient buildings, as well as allow businesses to conduct
   targeted marketing campaigns and forecast sales. Specific data mining
   success stories include customer loyalty prediction, economic
   forecasting, and fraud detection. The strength of data mining lies in
   the fact that it allows for not only predicting trends and behaviors,
   but also for the discovery of previously unknown patterns. However, a
   number of challenges remain, especially in this era of big data. These
   challenges are brought forward due to the sheer Volume of today's
   databases, as well as the Velocity (in terms of speed of arrival) and
   the Variety, in terms of the various types of data collected. This
   chapter focuses on techniques that address these issues. Specifically,
   we turn our attention to the financial sector, which has become
   paramount to business. Our discussion centers on issues such as
   considering data distributions with high fluctuations, incorporating
   late arriving data, and handling the unknown. We review the current
   state-of-the-art, mainly focusing on model-based approaches. We conclude
   the chapter by providing our perspective as to what the future holds, in
   terms of building accurate models against today's business, and
   specifically financial, data.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in delay and reliability critical
   environments is highly desired due to their unique advantages such as
   low cost, ease of deployment, and redundancy. However, successful
   deployment of resource-limited WSNs in such applications requires strict
   quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning techniques to meet the desired
   latency and reliability targets of those applications. Implementation of
   QoS techniques in WSNs is significantly challenging since WSNs have been
   initially devised for low-data-rate non-real-time applications.
   Therefore, WSN designers and developers resort to different cross-layer
   interaction and optimization techniques to provision QoS in WSNs. In
   this paper, we present a survey on the state of the art of cross-layer
   QoS approaches in wireless terrestrial sensor networks to achieve delay
   and reliability bounds in critical applications. Our paper provides a
   unique classification of cross-layer QoS approaches in WSNs that allows
   surveying a large amount of studies with utmost clarity. Furthermore, we
   highlight the main challenges of implementing QoS protocols in WSNs and
   present an overview of QoS-aware WSN applications.}},

Abstract = {{A low power, reusable optical hydrogen sensor using long-range surface
   plasmon polariton (LRSPP) cladded membrane waveguides is demonstrated.
   The sensor incorporates a 5 mu m wide, 20 nm thick gold stripe embedded
   in a 160 nm thick free-standing Cytop membrane with a 5 nm thick Pd
   over-layer. Input and output coupling is achieved with directly
   integrated broadside grating couplers. The sensor is tested with
   hydrogen concentrations up to 3\% and demonstrates a strong response
   with an estimated detection limit of 290 ppm, and a response time of 7 s
   to a 0.6\% H-2 step-this level of performance is among the best reported
   for optical H-2 sensors. Cycling of the hydrogen exposure shows a
   significant hysteresis response, however no film deformation or
   delamination was observed over many cycles. The high stress that is
   induced in clamped films during hydrogenation is relaxed in due to the
   film being deposited on the flexible and elastic Cytop membrane. This
   could result in improved lifetimes for this sensor and increased uptake
   ability.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the electronic applications of graphene
   synthesized from the graphite electrode of waste dry cell zinc-carbon
   batteries. Graphite powder {[}G (R)] is successfully recovered from the
   graphite electrode of waste batteries by acid treatment and used as
   starting material for synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) following Hummers
   method. Finally, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was obtained from the
   chemical reduction of GO by hydrazine hydrate. RGO thus obtained was
   characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy,
   dynamic light scattering, energy dispersive X-ray spectra and
   transmission electron microscopy to get detailed information about the
   structure and morphology of the RGO. All the above characterization
   results confirmed the restoration of sp(2) conjugation and removal of
   functional groups after the reduction of GO and also the sheet like
   morphology of RGO. The surface charge and stability of RGO in an aqueous
   medium are examined by measuring zeta potential. An electrochemical
   study demonstrated that, at different sweep rates, the current is the
   highest for RGO and lowest for GO and the current increases with an
   increasing sweep rate for all materials. The loop area of all the
   samples at the 100 mV s(-1) sweep rate is the highest. The galvanostatic
   charging/ discharging measurements have also been performed for both the
   GO and RGO samples at a current density of 1 mA g(-1).
   Electro-conductivity measurement shows that RGO has higher conductivity
   than GO due to the restoration of the sp(2) structure. The current
   voltage (I-V) characteristics show a non-linear behavior of GO and the
   ohmic nature of RGO.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new tuning approach, by which, all parameters of a
   data driven Model-Free Adaptive Control (MFAC) algorithm are
   automatically determined using a nonlinear Virtual Reference Feedback
   Tuning (VRFT) algorithm. The approach is referred to as mixed MFAC-VFRT
   control and it leads to mixed MFAC-VFRT algorithms. An advantage of
   mixed MFAC-VFRT control, is that it combines systematically, the
   features of VRFT (it computes the controller parameters using only the
   input/output data) with those of MFAC. This is especially illustrated by
   comparison with the classical MFAC algorithms, the initial values of the
   parameters, which are obtained through a process that involves solving
   an optimization problem. The application that validates the mixed
   MFAC-VFRT algorithms, by experiment, is a nonlinear twin rotor
   aerodynamic system laboratory equipment position control system, that
   represents a tribute, to Prof. Antal (Tony) K. Bejczy for his excellent
   results in space robotics, robot dynamics and control, haptics and force
   perception/control.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical promotion and metal-support interaction (MSI) have long
   been viewed as two separate phenomena; however, more recently it has
   been shown that, functionally, for ionic and mixed ionic-electronic
   conducting materials, both are linked by the transfer of ionic species
   at the interfaces. The purpose of this study was to exhibit a
   relationship between these two concepts through the use of an
   electro-chemical technique to evaluate CeO2-supported Pt- and Ru-based
   nanoparticles. The presence of ceria was found to increase the reaction
   rate when compared to free-standing Pt and Ru nanoparticles with the
   metal-support interaction rate enhancement ratios, rho(MSI), up to 14.
   Polarization measurements established that higher exchange current
   density, i(0), values correspond to lower open circuit catalytic rates.
   An apparent self-induced Faradaic efficiency was proposed and determined
   for each catalyst; lowest value (vertical bar Lambda(MSI)vertical bar
   approximate to 20) was found for free-standing nanoparticles, while
   highest value (vertical bar Lambda(MSI)vertical bar = 1053) corresponded
   to 1 wt\% Pt-1/CeO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure evolution, mechanical and corrosion properties of
   Al-11Si-2Cu-0.8Zn die cast alloy treated with Bi, Sb and Sr additions
   were investigated. The results of mechanical testing showed that all
   additions increased impact toughness, ultimate tensile strength, and
   elongation of the alloy as a result of change in eutectic Si morphology.
   The analysis of fracture surfaces revealed that with addition of Sr and
   to lesser extent Bi and Sb, the alloy exhibited a predominantly ductile
   fracture rather than quasi-cleavage brittle fracture. Moreover, with the
   additions of Sr, Bi and Sb, the quality index increased to 164.7 MPa,
   156.3 MPa and 152.6 MPa respectively from 102 MPa for the base alloy.
   Polarization corrosion tests conducted in sodium chloride solution
   showed that the corrosion potential shifted to more negative values with
   additions of Sb, Bi and Sr, respectively. Corrosion immersion tests also
   revealed that the element additions have a detrimental effect on the
   corrosion rate of alloys, due to the increase of boundaries between the
   Al and eutectic Si phases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) model was developed to
   predict nitrate concentration in groundwater of Arak plain, Iran. The
   model provided a tool for prediction of nitrate concentration using a
   set of easily measurable groundwater quality variables including water
   temperature, electrical conductivity, groundwater depth, total dissolved
   solids, dissolved oxygen, pH, land use, and season of the year as input
   variables. The data set comprised of 160 water samples representing 40
   different wells monitored for 1 year. The associated parameters for the
   optimum SVM model were obtained using a combination of 4-fold
   cross-validation and grid search technique. The optimum model was used
   to predict nitrate concentration in Arak plain aquifer. The SVM model
   predicted nitrate concentration in training and test stage data sets
   with reasonably high correlation (0.92 and 0.87, respectively) with the
   measured values and low root mean squared errors of 0.086 and 0.111,
   respectively. Finally, the map of nitrate concentration in groundwater
   was prepared for all four seasons using the trained SVM model and a
   geographic information system (GIS) interpolation scheme and compared
   with the results with a physics-based (flow and contaminant) model.
   Overall, the results showed that SVM model could be used as a fast,
   reliable, and cost-effective method for assessment and predicting
   groundwater quality.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an in-vehicle computing system capable of
   localizing lane markings and communicating them to drivers. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first system that combines the Maximally
   Stable Extremal Region (MSER) technique with the Hough transform to
   detect and recognize lane markings (i.e., lines and pictograms). Our
   system begins by localizing the region of interest using the MSER
   technique. A three-stage refinement computing algorithm is then
   introduced to enhance the results of MSER and to filter out undesirable
   information such as trees and vehicles. To achieve the requirements of
   real-time systems, the Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform (PPHT)
   is used in the detection stage to detect line markings. Next, the
   recognition of the color and the form of line markings is performed;
   this it is based on the results of the application of the MSER to left
   and right line markings. The recognition of High-Occupancy Vehicle
   pictograms is performed using a new algorithm, based on the results of
   MSER regions. In the tracking stage, Kalman filter is used to track both
   ends of each detected line marking. Several experiments are conducted to
   show the efficiency of our system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An experimental study of the effect of eccentricity on forced convective
   heat transfer was conducted for upward flows in vertical, open-ended
   annular channels with a diameter ratio of 0.61, a length to outer
   diameter ratio of 18: 1, and both internal surfaces heated uniformly.
   Flows with Reynolds numbers Re = 5450, 10,000, and 27,500 and
   eccentricities varying from 0 to 0.9 were examined. These results are
   deemed to be mostly in the forced convection regime with some possible
   overlap with the mixed convection regime at the lowest Reynolds number
   considered. This work complements our previous work on natural and mixed
   convection using the same facility. The effect of eccentricity was not
   significant at lower eccentricities, but, in highly eccentric cases, the
   wall temperature in the narrow gap was much higher than in the wide gap
   and the average heat transfer coefficient was as low as one-fifth of the
   concentric value. For Re > 10,000, the average Nusselt number for the
   concentric case was nearly four times higher than the value predicted by
   the Dittus-Boelter correlation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents experiments on the auto ignition of single droplets
   of liquid mixtures which have a composition such that their distillation
   behaviour approximates a ``continuous{''} mixture, i.e. one which can be
   described by a continuous distribution function. A number of such
   mixtures of both n-paraffins and n-alkyl aromatics were designed by
   matching their distillation curves to those of equivalent continuous
   distributions, and single droplet ignition experiments were then
   performed on them. To correlate the results and gain insight into the
   mixture ignition process, a continuous mixture droplet ignition model
   was devised by adding a continuous formulation for a global reaction
   rate expression to an existing droplet evaporation model. Expressions
   for rate parameters as functions of the distribution variable (molecular
   mass) were developed from experiments on pure hydrocarbons. The
   resulting ignition model was found to reproduce experimental mixture
   ignition delay times well. The mixtures tested here behave similarly to
   pure compounds of the same average molecular mass. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Data traffic in cellular networks has dramatically increased in recent
   years as the emergence of various new wireless applications, which
   imposes an immediate requirement for large network capacity. Although
   many efforts have been made to enhance wireless channel capacity, they
   are far from solving the network capacity enhancement problem.
   Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is recently proposed as a promising
   technique to increase network capacity. However, most existing work on
   D2D communications focuses on optimizing throughput or energy
   efficiency, without considering economic issues. In this paper, we
   propose a truthful double auction for D2D communications (TAD) in
   multi-cell cellular networks for trading resources in frequency-time
   domain, where cellular users with D2D communication capability act as
   sellers, and other users waiting to access the network act as buyers.
   Both intra-cell and inter-cell D2D sellers are accommodated in TAD while
   the competitive space in each cell is extensively exploited to achieve a
   high auction efficiency. With a sophisticated seller-buyer matching,
   winner determination and pricing, TAD guarantees individual rationality,
   budget balance, and truthfulness. Furthermore, we extend our TAD design
   to handle a more general case that each seller and buyer ask/bid
   multiple resource units. Extensive simulation results show that TAD can
   achieve truthfulness as well as high performance in terms of
   seller/buyer sanctification ratio, auctioneer profit and network
   throughput.}},

Abstract = {{CanRisk is a tool to assess the seismic vulnerability of buildings in

   the building scale. The model uses an evidence-based and
   multi-disciplinary approach to identifying risk factors that affect an
   individual's likelihood of being injured in an earthquake. The model
   implements fuzzy synthetic evaluation to quantify seismic risk, combines
   Hazus methodology with methodology presented herein to estimate number

Abstract = {{An evolutive elasto-plastic model is developed in this research work to
   address the vital role of binder hydration in the evolution of the

   Double hardening/softening parameters, which include effective

   A non-associated plastic potential function based on the dilation angle
   is employed to formulate the plastic deformation and dilation of CPB.
   Mechanical parameters, such as cohesion, internal friction and dilation
   angles, stiffness, and Poisson's ratio are expressed as functions of the
   degree of binder hydration. The developed model is implemented in a
   finite element code, COMSOL Multiphysics, and then validated against
   experimental data obtained from laboratory tests performed in this study
   and by other researchers. The validation results show good agreement

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Multi-view/3D video is currently available in games, entertainment,
   education, security, and surveillance applications. Since the amount of
   data in multi-view/3D increases proportionally with the number of
   cameras, and due to different bandwidth and playback capabilities of
   receivers, appropriate compression of multi-view/3D video to produce the
   correct bitrate while maintaining smooth video quality is crucial, a
   task that is mostly performed by the rate control module of the encoder.
   There are many existing rate control algorithms for single-view and
   multi-view video coding considering the specific features or aspects of
   these videos. In this paper, we introduce a novel view-level rate
   distortion (RD) model. We use a systematic methodology to derive this RD
   model by investigating the impact of multi-view/3D video characteristics
   on the bitrate of a compressed video. Our proposed RD model considers
   the concepts of intra-view and inter-view disparity as an effective
   feature of multi-view/3D video to estimate the overall bitrate of each
   view more accurately. Evaluation results indicate that our proposed
   view-level RD model outperforms existing linear models by a factor of 3
   and can predict the rate of each view with relatively high precision and
   a low estimation error of 12\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel MIMO-OFDM transmission scheme is developed to
   effectively enable multi-access by joint code design across multiple
   antennas, subcarriers, OFDM frames, and users. It achieves better
   spectrum efficiency while improving bit error rate performance. The
   proposed scheme uses either parity bit selected or permutation
   techniques to assign spreading codes at the transmitter side. As a
   result, the detection at the receiver is greatly improved because of the
   fact that identifying the spreading code(s) directly yields the
   transmitted data symbols. The paper also investigates the
   field-programmable gate array implementation of the proposed algorithms;
   optimization techniques are proposed to reduce area, power, and time.
   These techniques include a pipelined architecture for inverse FFT/FFT
   blocks, an efficient low complexity algorithm for despreading based on
   counters and comparators and an optimized architecture for complex
   matrix inversion using Gauss-Jordan elimination (GJ-elimination).
   Finally, the fixed-point optimized field-programmable gate array
   architecture for MIMO-OFDM transceiver is developed, where the maximum
   allowed performance loss because of quantization is defined, the
   tradeoffs between BER performance and area reduction are investigated.

Abstract = {{Separation using selective polymeric membranes has been well-established
   as an energy-efficient and cost-effective technology in water treatment
   and many other applications involving aqueous solutions. However,
   limited chemical, thermal, and mechanical resistances besides their
   tendency to fouling and inadequate pure water flux may often restrict
   their applications. To this end, inorganic materials as additives have
   been demonstrated to be able to enhance chemical, thermal, and fouling
   membrane resistances, which demonstrate their great potential for
   developing novel membranes by using them as additives in polymer
   matrices. Considering the excellent characteristics of the nanosized
   particles, this study reviews the effects of inorganic nano-additives on
   properties and performance of polymer/nanoparticle composite membranes.
   It has been demonstrated that using nanomaterials in a polymer matrix

   achieved by tuning the wavelength the optical carrier. The SFDR of the
   MPF is improved due to the gain enhancement by a partial suppression of
   the optical carrier. An experiment is performed. A single bandpass MPF

Abstract = {{A pneumatic conveying system has been designed for the continuous
   conveying of pulverized fuels, namely biomass (in the form of Canadian
   forestry waste), lignite, and petroleum coke, to an entrained flow
   gasification unit. All three fuels studied exhibit properties that are
   challenging for fluidization or conveying. The lignite and petroleum
   coke are Geldart class C particles and are expected to exhibit
   difficulties in conveying, while the biomass is a Geldart class A
   particle but the non-uniform particle shape and large size distribution
   result in pneumatic conveying challenges similar to class C particles.
   The conveying system consists of a blow vessel with three points of gas
   injection to aerate the bed of material and facilitate hopper discharge.
   The mass flux of each material was studied as the system parameters were
   varied, which included: fluidizing and sparge gas (two of the three
   gases aerating the hopper bed), transfer gas (gas injected directly into
   the solid transfer line), pressure drop, conveying gas type and transfer
   line diameter. Fuel fluxes were varied in a range of 450 kg/m(2)s to
   1700 kg/m(2)s for all three fuels. Compared to lignite and petroleum
   coke conveying, biomass conveying was found to have a smaller gain in
   mass flux to many conveying parameters investigated. Additionally,
   several models for pneumatic conveying of powders were compared against
   the data obtained. The models were found to have various degrees of
   relative error, with the best fitting model having a relative error of
   less than 10\% for all three fuels with a marginal bias towards
   underestimation.}},

Abstract = {{Through nanochannels are fabricated in poly(vinylidene
   fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene) films by bombarding swift heavy ions
   (SHI) of energy 80 MeV and thereby creating latent tracks in the ion
   passage followed by chemical etching of the amorphous track. The
   dimension of the nanochannel is varied from 34 to 65 nm using different
   fluences and by dispersing organically modified nanoclay in polymer
   matrix. The nanochannels are grafted with polystyrene using the free
   radicals caused by SHI irradiation followed by their sulfonation.
   Nanoclay nucleates piezoelectric beta-phase in copolymer whose extent
   gets enhanced after irradiation, grafting and sulfonation leading to a
   better material. The efficiency of functionalized nanochannel conduction
   is studied through dc conductivity of the bulk film in the
   semiconducting range against the insulating nature of the pristine
   copolymer. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of the membrane exhibits
   strong fluence dependency and shows superior conduction in
   functionalized nanohybrid. Proton conductivity of the functionalized
   nanohybrid is 6.2 x 10(-2) S cm(-1), while methanol permeability
   drastically reduces indicating higher values of the selective parameter
   of the developed membrane as compared to Nafion. Membrane electrode
   assembly studies of functionalized nanohybrid show 0.63 V as open
   circuit voltage leading to power density of 30.8 mW/cm(2), considerably
   higher than the functionalized copolymer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The robustness and efficiency of the numerical methods for obtaining
   solutions to MD membranes and module problems (e.g. temperature and
   concentration polarizations and, distillate flux enhancement) have given
   rise to the adoption of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) as a widely

   paper reviews recent researches utilizing CFD simulations to study the
   momentum, heat and mass transfer in conventional and newly designed MD
   modules, such as those including spacer-filled feed channels. Many of
   these works have focused on optimizing hydrodynamics and investigating
   the effect of various spacers' geometry, while fewer of them have
   attempted to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms giving rise
   to mass transfer enhancement inside the membrane pores. CFD and its
   couple with other modeling/simulation softwares could provide a lot of
   interesting information for the development of new MD membranes and

Abstract = {{Novel forward osmosis (FO) is a membrane-based separation process with
   significant potentials for low energy desalination. While this
   technology offers various benefits, overcoming its low water flux
   performance caused by internal concentration polarization (ICP) of
   solutes in porous substrates remains a challenge. This study aims at
   addressing this issue by introducing hydrophilic halloysite nanotubes
   (HNTs) into substrate made of polysulfone (PSF). The thin film
   nanocomposite (TFN) membranes suitable for FO applications were prepared
   via interfacial polymerization on the top surface of PSF-HNT
   nanocomposite substrates. The results obtained from filtration
   experiments showed that the TFN membrane prepared with 0.5 wff. HNTs
   (TFN0.5 membrane) demonstrated the most satisfactory results by
   exhibiting high water permeability and low reverse solute flux.
   Furthermore, TFN0.5 membrane exhibited remarkably higher water flux than
   that of control TFC membrane in both FO (27.7 vs 13.3 L/m(2) h) and PRO
   (423 vs 26.0 L/m(2) h) configurations when they were tested with 10 mM
   NaCl as feed solution and 2 M NaCl as draw solution. This improvement
   can be ascribed to the fact that the structural parameter of TFN0.5 is
   much lower compared to control TFC membrane (0.37 vs 0.95 mm), leading
   to reduced ICP effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Planetary gearbox fault diagnosis under nonstationary conditions is
   important for many engineering applications in general and for wind
   turbines in particular because of their time-varying operating
   conditions. This paper focuses on the identification of time-varying
   characteristic frequencies from complex nonstationary vibration signals
   for fault diagnosis of wind turbines under nonstationary conditions. We
   propose a time frequency analysis method based on the Vold-Kalman filter
   and higher order energy separation (HOES) to extract fault symptoms. The
   Vold-Kalman filter is improved such that it is
   encoders/tachometers-free. It can decompose an arbitrarily complex
   signal into mono-components without resorting to speed inputs, thus
   satisfying the mono-component requirement by the HOES algorithm. The
   HOES is then used to accurately estimate the instantaneous frequency
   because of its high adaptability to local signal changes. The derived
   time frequency distribution features fine resolution without cross-term
   interferences and thus facilitates extracting time-varying frequency
   components from highly complex and nonstationary signals. The method is
   illustrated and validated by analyzing simulated and experimental
   signals of a planetary gearbox in a wind turbine test rig under
   nonstationary running conditions. The results have shown that the method
   is effective in detecting both distributed (wear on every tooth) and
   localized (chipping on one tooth) gear faults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Condition-based maintenance via vibration signal processing plays an
   important role to reduce unscheduled machine downtime and avoid
   catastrophic accidents in industrial enterprises. Many machine faults,
   such as local defects in rotating machines, manifest themselves in the
   acquired vibration signals as a series of impulsive events. The spectral
   kurtosis (SK) technique extends the concept of kurtosis to that of a
   function of frequency that indicates how the impulsiveness of a signal.
   This work intends to review and summarize the recent research
   developments on the SK theories, for instance, short-time Fourier
   transform-based SK, kurtogram, adaptive SK and protrugram, as well as
   the corresponding applications in fault detection and diagnosis of the
   rotating machines. The potential prospects of prognostics using SK
   technique are also designated. Some examples have been presented to
   illustrate their performances. The expectation is that further research
   and applications of the SK technique will flourish in the future,
   especially in the fields of the prognostics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   by tuning the wavelength of the optical carrier. The proposed MPF is

Abstract = {{Photonic generation of linearly chirped microwave waveforms using a
   silicon-based on-chip spectral shaper is proposed and demonstrated. The
   on-chip optical spectral shaper has a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)
   structure, in which two identical linearly chirped waveguide gratings
   (LC-WBGs) with opposite chirp rates are incorporated into the two arms.
   The LC-WBGs are fabricated on two rib waveguides by linearly varying the
   rib widths along the gratings to produce linear chirps. By adding an
   offset waveguide to one arm of the MZI and controlling the length of the
   offset waveguide, the spectral response of the shaper can be controlled
   to have a symmetrical, linearly increasing, or linearly decreasing free
   spectral range, which is needed for the generation of a linearly chirped
   microwave waveform based on spectralshaping and wavelength-to-time
   mapping. The proposed device is fabricated using a CMOS-compatible
   process with 193-nm deep ultraviolet lithography. A theoretical analysis
   on the chirped microwave waveform generation is performed, which is
   verified by an experiment. Two linearly chirped microwave waveforms with
   symmetrical and uniform chirp profiles are experimentally generated
   using two fabricated spectral shapers with different lengths of the

Abstract = {{A novel technique to transport a microwave signal over an optical fiber
   based on phase-modulation and coherent in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase
   (Q) demodulation with an extended transmission distance is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. In the transmitter, a Sagnac loop
   incorporating a phase modulator (PM) is used to generate two
   orthogonally polarized optical signals with one being phase modulated
   and the other with no modulation that acts as a remote optical reference
   signal. The orthogonally polarized optical signals are transmitted over
   a single-mode fiber (SMF) to a polarization and phase diversity coherent
   receiver, and are coherently detected with a free-running optical local
   oscillator at the receiver. Since the phase-modulated and the reference
   signals are transmitted over the same SMF, the optical phases are
   correlated, and the original signal can be recovered based on a digital
   signal processing algorithm. The proposed technique is experimentally
   evaluated. Compared with a phase-modulated coherent I/Q demodulated link
   without using an optical phase correlated reference signal, the
   transmission distance is extended from 50 m to 10 km, while providing a
   link gain and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of -9.5 dB and 115.8

Abstract = {{D-Limonene (Lim) is a renewable monoterpene derived from citrus fruit

   formulation. The bulk free-radical terpolymerization of n-butyl acrylate

   benzoyl peroxide as the initiator. The terpolymerization was studied at
   various initial BA/BMA/Lim molar ratios, and the products were
   characterized for conversion, terpolymer composition, molecular weight,
   and glass-transition temperature. Lim was observed to undergo a
   significant degradative chain-transfer reaction, which greatly
   influenced the polymerization kinetics. The rate of polymerization,
   final conversion, and polymer molecular weight were all significantly
   reduced because of the presence of Lim. Nonetheless, polymers with
   relatively high weight-average molecular weights (20,000-120,000 Da)
   were produced. The terpolymer composition was well predicted with the
   reactivity ratios estimated for each of the three copolymer subsystems.

   remote sites by delaying position signals of the master and slave
   manipulator. The design also comprises local proportional and derivative
   signals with nonlinear adaptive terms to cope with parametric
   uncertainty associated with the master and slave dynamics. The
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is employed to establish stability
   conditions for the closed-loop teleoperators under both symmetrical and
   unsymmetrical time-varying communication delay. These delay-dependent
   conditions allow the designer to estimate the control gains a priori in
   order to achieve asymptotic property of the position, velocity and
   synchronisation errors of the master and slave systems. Finally,
   simulation results along with comparative studies are presented to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces two distributed Bluetooth scatternet formation
   (BSF) algorithms, called BSFWAVVY(MSF) and BSFWAVVY(ODL). The first
   algorithm forms scatternets that does not contain master-slave (MS)
   bridges (MS-free scatternets), whereas the second algorithm forms
   scatternets in which each piconet has at most k slaves
   (outdegree-limited scatternets). The motivation is that MS-freeness and
   outdegree limitation are the two properties that significantly improve
   the quality of the scatternets. However, and contrary to the existing
   BSF algorithms, our algorithms consider these properties under
   pessimistic environments modeled as arbitrary networks (i.e., no
   assumptions are made on the underlying network topology). We give two
   lower bounds that prove the asymptotic optimality of our algorithms with
   respect to time complexity and message complexity. We also show that the
   problem of forming MS-free and outdegree-limited scatternets at the same
   time is NP-COMPLETE. We introduce a time-efficient implementation of
   BSFWAVVY(MSF) and BSFWAVVY(ODL) that exploits unique characteristics of
   Bluetooth networks. Simulation experiments show that our algorithms have
   short execution time relative to major BSF algorithms and it outperforms
   other major algorithms with respect to various performance metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Novel matrix singular value inequalities are established for a
   sum/product of three matrices. Their application to the uncertain
   (compound) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel subject to
   normed additive uncertainty establishes the saddle-point property for a
   wide range of performance metrics monotonic in the channel singular
   values, including, among others, the mutual information, MMSE, error
   exponent, and pairwise error probability. This, in turn, implies that
   the transmission on the eigenmodes of the nominal (or worst case)
   channel is also optimal for the whole set of channels under a general
   power constraint and hence achieves the compound channel capacity. The
   worst case channel turns out to be antiparallel of the nominal one for
   all these performance metrics. An application of these results to
   beamforming over compound MIMO channels is discussed. An optimal robust
   precoder for the uncertain MIMO channel is obtained in a closed-form
   under the sum-MSE criterion and the total power constraint. The
   saddle-point property is shown to hold and the optimal strategy is to
   diagonalize the nominal (or worst case) channel.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a Smartphone-based Human Activity Recognition System in a
   Daily Living Environment}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{106}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An evaluation method that includes continuous activities in a
   daily-living environment was developed for Wearable Mobility Monitoring
   Systems (WMMS) that attempt to recognize user activities. Participants
   performed a pre-determined set of daily living actions within a
   continuous test circuit that included mobility activities (walking,
   standing, sitting, lying, ascending/descending stairs), daily living
   tasks (combing hair, brushing teeth, preparing food, eating, washing
   dishes), and subtle environment changes (opening doors, using an
   elevator, walking on inclines, traversing staircase landings, walking
   outdoors).
   To evaluate WMMS performance on this circuit, fifteen able-bodied
   participants completed the tasks while wearing a smartphone at their
   right front pelvis. The WMMS application used smartphone accelerometer
   and gyroscope signals to classify activity states. A gold standard
   comparison data set was created by video-recording each trial and
   manually logging activity onset times. Gold standard and WMMS data were
   analyzed offline. Three classification sets were calculated for each
   circuit: (i) mobility or immobility, ii) sit, stand, lie, or walking,
   and (iii) sit, stand, lie, walking, climbing stairs, or small standing
   movement. Sensitivities, specificities, and F-Scores for activity
   categorization and changes-of-state were calculated.
   The mobile versus immobile classification set had a sensitivity of
   86.30\% +/- 7.2\% and specificity of 98.96\% +/- 0.6\%, while the second
   prediction set had a sensitivity of 88.35\% +/- 7.80\% and specificity
   of 98.51\% +/- 0.62\%. For the third classification set, sensitivity was
   84.92\% +/- 6.38\% and specificity was 98.17 +/- 0.62. F1 scores for the
   first, second and third classification sets were 86.17 +/- 6.3, 80.19
   +/- 6.36, and 78.42 +/- 5.96, respectively. This demonstrates that WMMS
   performance depends on the evaluation protocol in addition to the
   algorithms. The demonstrated protocol can be used and tailored for
   evaluating human activity recognition systems in rehabilitation medicine
   where mobility monitoring may be beneficial in clinical decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{A novel acoustic tomographic measurement system capable of resolving
   sound travel time in extremely shallow rivers is introduced and the
   results of an extensive field measurements campaign are presented and
   further discussed. Acoustic pulses were transmitted over a wide
   frequency band of 20-35 kHz between eight transducers for about a week
   in a meandering reach of theBasen River, Hiroshima, Japan. The purpose
   of the field experiment was validating the concept of acoustic
   tomography in rivers for visualizing current fields. The particular
   novelty of the experiment resides in its unusual tomographic features:
   subbasin scale (100 m x 270 m) and shallowness (0.5-3.0 m) of the
   physical domain, frequency of the transmitted acoustic signals (central
   frequency of 30 kHz), and the use of small sampling intervals (105 s).
   Inverse techniques with no a priori statistical information were used to
   estimate the depth-average current velocity components from differential
   travel times. Zeroth-order Tikhonov regularization, in conjunction with
   L-curve method deployed to stabilize the solution and to determine the
   weighting factor appearing in the inverse analysis. Concurrent direct
   environmental measurements were provided in the form of ADCP readings
   close to the right and left bank. Very good agreement found between
   along-channel velocities larger than 0.2 m/s obtained from the two
   techniques. Inverted quantities were, however, underestimated, perhaps
   due to vicinity of the ADCPs to the banks and strong effect of river
   geometry on the readings. In general, comparing the visualized currents
   with direct nodal measurements illustrate the plausibility of the
   tomographically reconstructed flow structures.}},

Abstract = {{The surface hydrophobicity of membrane is a key factor in contactor
   applications where the penetration of liquid into membrane pores has
   negative effect on the contactor performance. Therefore, different
   methods have been proposed for surface modification. Blending
   hydrophobic polymers such as surface modifying macromolecules (SMM) has
   been investigated in our earlier researches. In this study, the effect
   of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) blending on the surface and bulk
   morphology of polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber membrane and its
   performance in membrane gas absorption process was studied. It was found
   that the pore size increased from 112 nm to 210 nm from the neat PEI
   membrane to the PEI membrane spun from the solution blended with 0.25
   wt\% PVDF. At the same time, the contact angle increased from 78.3 and
   84.3. Furthermore, the absorption flux of PVDF blended membrane enhanced
   by 13\% compared to the neat PEI membrane. (C) 2015 The Institution of

Title = {{Reducing Periconceptional Methylmercury Exposure: Cost-Utility Analysis
   for a Proposed Screening Program for Women Planning a Pregnancy in
   Ontario, Canada}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The assessment of neurodevelopmental effects in children
   associated with prenatal methylmercury exposure, from contaminated fish
   and seafood in the maternal diet, has recently been strengthened by
   adjustment for the negative confounding resulting from co-exposure to
   beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of a
   periconceptional screening program of blood mercury concentration for
   women planning to become pregnant in Ontario, Canada. Fish intake
   recommendations would be provided for those found to have blood mercury
   levels above the intervention threshold.
   METHODS: Analysis was conducted using a combined decision tree/Markov
   model to compare the proposed screening intervention with standard care
   from a societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. We used the
   national blood mercury distributions of women 20-49 years of age
   reported in the Canadian Health Measures Survey from 2009 through 2011
   to determine the cognitive deficits associated with prenatal
   methylmercury exposure for successful planned pregnancies. Outcomes
   modeled included the loss in quality of life and the remedial education
   costs. Value of information analysis was conducted to assess the
   underlying uncertainty around the model results and to identify which
   parameters contribute most to this uncertainty.
   RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)
   gained for the proposed screening intervention was estimated to be
   Can\$18,051, and the expected value for a willingness to pay of
   Can\$50,000/QALY to be Can\$0.61.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the proposed periconceptional
   blood mercury screening program for women planning a pregnancy would be
   highly cost-effective from a societal perspective. The results of a
   value of information analysis confirm the robustness of the study's
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Location privacy is an important issue in vehicular networks since
   knowledge of a vehicle's location can result in leakage of sensitive
   information. A way to protect vehicles' location privacy is to have them
   change their pseudonyms in predetermined regions known as mix zones.
   However, selfish vehicles may not change their pseudonyms because of
   limited resources ( such as pseudonyms and bandwidth). This could
   jeopardize the location privacy of those vehicles that are in need of
   changing their pseudonyms. To encourage vehicles to cooperate in
   changing their pseudonyms, we propose a method called Motivation for
   Protecting Selfish Vehicles' Location Privacy (MPSVLP). In MPSVLP,
   vehicles can form a mix zone dynamically when their pseudonyms are close
   to expiration and can also earn reputation ``credit{''} by implementing
   a pseudonym change. The simulations show that MPSVLP motivates more
   selfish vehicles to cooperate with each other while maintaining a high
   level of location privacy. In addition, MPSVLP can reduce communication
   overhead in comparison with the existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale hydraulic model tests were carried out by the Leibniz
   University of Hannover, Germany to investigate the performance of
   wide-graded grain materials (0.1-200 mm) as scour protection system
   tested under spectral wave loads. The model tests were conducted in the
   Large Wave Flume (GWK) of the Forschungszentrum Kuste (FZK) assuming a
   length scale of 1:4. The experimental setup consisted of a single layer
   material bed protecting a monopile (D = 1 m) as often used as offshore
   supporting structure. In order to measure the structure-induced scour
   development around the monopile acoustic backscatter systems (ABS),
   single-beam echosounder, and a 3D laser scanner were used. Matching
   environmental conditions of the North Sea, the model tests were carried
   out with spectral wave load (JONSWAP-spectra) and successively
   increasing significant wave heights up to H-s = 1.3 m. As result, a
   maximum scour depth of S/D = 0.161 was found after 9000 waves which
   resembled a synthetic storm duration of 20 h. The results indicate high
   stability against spectral wave load and demonstrate the capability of
   wide-graded material to perform reasonably well under wave loads,
   particularly applied in a dynamic design of scour protection.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the technical performance of an advanced
   configuration of the calcium looping (Ca-looping) process, called Ca-Cu
   looping, for the reduction of CO2 emissions from a subcritical CFB power
   plant with a net output of 250 MWe. In this new process concept, the
   thermal power requirement in the calciner is satisfied using a chemical
   looping combustion cycle. Thus, the power consumption associated with
   the air separation unit that is required in the conventional Ca-looping
   process scheme can be eliminated. The reference power plant has also
   been modified to integrate oxy-combustion, Ca-looping and amine
   scrubbing technologies for comparison. The fully integrated process
   flowsheets have been simulated using Honeywell's UniSim Design Suit
   R400. For a more accurate prediction of the CO2 capture efficiency in
   the carbonator of the Ca-Cu looping process, the experimentally obtained
   cyclic activity of a novel copper-functionalised, calcium-based
   composite sorbent has been implemented yielding a rigorous carbonator
   model. The process simulations also include a comprehensive analysis of
   the CO2 compression and purification unit as well as a heat exchanger
   network optimized using pinch analysis for the recovery of excess heat
   from the high temperature gas and solid streams available in the
   Ca-looping and Ca-Cu looping processes. Compared to the energy penalty
   of 10.5 percentage points for a conventional amine scrubbing
   configuration, the Ca-Cu looping process evaluated in this study
   achieves the same overall CO2 capture efficiency with a significantly
   reduced energy penalty of 3.5 percentage points; the lowest value for
   all CO2 capture architectures assessed here. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Reconstruction using 1D Frequency-Domain Photoacoustics}},
Journal = {{PHOTOACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{132-142}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the effect of an impedance mismatch between the
   absorber and its surroundings on the aborber reconstructions from the
   photoacoustic signal profile, in particular when a non-delta input pulse
   is used. A transfer function approach is taken, demonstrating in the
   case of impedance mismatch how the total response can be modeled using
   the sum of the mismatch-free response and its time-delayed,
   time-reversed replicas, which may or may not overlap. It is shown how
   this approach can be exploited to accommodate the effects of non-delta
   pulses and/or pulse-equivalent waveforms such as
   linear-frequency-modulated (LFM) chirps, and impedance mismatches in any
   inversion algorithms, even in the presence of large reflection
   coefficients. As a consequence, for simple-absorber reconstruction
   algorithms that assume impulses or `short enough' pulses, the
   compressive portion of the measured response may be used in
   reconstruction formulas that do not model the impedance mismatch,
   regardless of the size of the mismatch. For longer-duration input
   waveforms, it is demonstrated how existing reconstruction methods can be
   successfully adapted to include the effect of the impedance mismatch.
   Simulations are used to illustrate these ideas. The gained physical
   insight into how components of the generated pressure wave carry
   absorber information is then exploited for signal inversion and absorber
   reconstruction in the frequency domain when multi-frequency modulation
   chirps are used for photoacoustic radar pressure measurements. The
   foundational theoretical developments ultimately address impendance
   mismatch issues germane to the major photoacoustic frequency-domain
   imaging modality to-date, which is the photoacoustic radar. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is coupled with the Soil and Water
   Assessment Tools (SWAT) model in the streamflow assimilation of the
   upstream Senegal River in West Africa. Given the large number of
   distributed variables in SWAT, only the average watershed scale
   variables are included in the state vector and the Hydrological Response
   Unit (HRU) scale variables are updated with the a posteriori/a priori
   ratio of their watershed scale counterparts. The Jacobian matrix is
   calculated numerically by perturbing the state variables. Both the soil
   moisture and CN2 are significantly updated in the wet season, yet they
   have opposite update patterns. A case study for a large flood forecast
   shows that for up to seven days, the streamflow forecast is moderately
   improved using the EKF-subsequent open loop scheme but significantly
   improved with a newly designed quasi-error update scheme. The former has
   better performances in the flood rising period while the latter has
   better performances in the recession period. For both schemes, the
   streamflow forecast is improved more significantly when the lead time is
   shorter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work evaluates the shear strength of pyramidal fin arrays made from
   various feedstock materials (cylindrical aluminum, spherical nickel, and
   cylindrical stainless steel 304 powders) deposited on an Al6061-T6
   substrate. Higher shear strength was measured for the nickel fin array
   followed by the stainless steel 304 and the aluminum arrays. Different
   failure modes were observed by inspecting the fracture surfaces under
   Scanning Electron Microscope. Deposition between the cold sprayed nickel
   and stainless fins was detected whereas dimples were noticed on the
   substrate between the fins when aluminum is used as the feedstock
   material. A numerical simulation of normal and angled impacts using the
   high strain rate Preston-Tonks-Wallace model was carried out in order to
   have a better understanding of the experimental results. The equivalent
   plastic strain (PEEQ) obtained from the finite element analysis at
   normal impact correlates with the different shear strengths measured
   experimentally. Furthermore, even if a higher PEEQ was observed for
   angled impacts compared to its normal collision counterpart, it is
   suggested that the particles may not bond because of the rotational
   restitution momentum caused by the tangential friction generated during
   angled impacts. This rotational restitution momentum was not detected
   for particle impacts normal to the substrate surface.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid increase of social media resources and services, Internet
   users are overwhelmed by the vast quantity of social media available.
   Most recommender systems personalize multimedia content to the users by
   analyzing two main dimensions of input: content (item), and user
   (consumer). In this study, we address the issue of how to improve the
   recommendation and the quality of the user experience by analyzing the
   contextual aspect of the users, at the time when they wish to consume
   multimedia content. Mainly, we highlight the potential of including a
   user's biological signal and leveraging it within an adapted
   collaborative filtering algorithm. First, the proposed model utilizes
   existing online social networks by incorporating social tags and rating
   information in ways that personalize the search for content in a
   particular detected context. Second, we propose a recommendation
   algorithm to improve the user experience and satisfaction with the use
   of a biosignal in the recommendation process. Our experimental results
   show the feasibility of personalizing the recommendation according to
   the user's context, and demonstrate some improvement on cold start
   situations where relatively little information is known about a user or
   an item.}},

Abstract = {{Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a promising network paradigm that
   separates the control plane and data plane in the network. It has shown
   great advantages in simplifying network management such that new
   functions can be easily supported without physical access to the network
   switches. However, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM), as a
   critical hardware storing rules for high-speed packet processing in
   SDN-enabled devices, can be supplied to each device with very limited
   quantity because it is expensive and energy-consuming. To efficiently
   use TCAM resources, we propose a rule multiplexing scheme, in which the
   same set of rules deployed on each node apply to the whole flow of a
   session going through but towards different paths. Based on this scheme,
   we study the rule placement problem with the objective of minimizing
   rule space occupation for multiple unicast sessions under QoS
   constraints. We formulate the optimization problem jointly considering
   routing engineering and rule placement under both existing and our rule
   multiplexing schemes. Via an extensive review of the state-of-the-art
   work, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the
   non-routing-rule placement problem. Finally, extensive simulations are
   conducted to show that our proposals significantly outperform existing
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-growing cellular traffic demand has laid a heavy burden on
   cellular networks. The recent rapid development in vehicle-to-vehicle
   communication techniques makes vehicular delay-tolerant network (VDTN)
   an attractive candidate for traffic offloading from cellular networks.
   In this paper, we study a bulk traffic offloading problem with the goal
   of minimizing the cellular communication cost under the constraint that
   all the subscribers receive their desired whole content before it
   expires. It needs to determine the initial offloading points and the
   dissemination scheme for offloaded traffic in a VDTN. By novelly
   describing the content delivery process via a contact-based flow model,
   we formulate the problem in a linear programming (LP) form, based on
   which an online offloading scheme is proposed to deal with the network
   dynamics (e. g., vehicle arrival/departure). Furthermore, an offline
   LP-based analysis is derived to obtain the optimal solution. The high
   efficiency of our online algorithm is extensively validated by
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The present study complements recent published work by developing a
   general closed-form solution for the analysis of steel beams reinforced
   with glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) plates under general loading
   and boundary conditions. Comparisons against three-dimensional (3D)
   finite-element (FE) solutions indicate that the solution accurately
   captures the transverse-longitudinal and predominantly lateral
   responses. For predominantly torsional responses, the solution is shown
   to provide good predictions when the shear modulus of the adhesive layer
   is weak. For cases where the shear modulus is stiff, the present theory
   is found to lead to an overly stiff response. Careful examination of
   strain profiles as predicted by the 3D FE analyses provides valuable
   insight on the reason for the overly stiff behavior in such cases and
   shows the necessity of incorporating transverse shear deformation
   effects into the formulation. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Plasmonics applied to solar cells is a widely investigated research
   field. Its main purpose is to include plasmonic structures in the cell
   design, in order to increase light trapping in the cell and,
   consequently, its energy conversion efficiency. Light scattering by
   plasmonic structures has been extensively studied by depositing metal
   nanoparticles on both sides of the cell, in order to enhance the
   transmission into the cell and/or the path length of the transmitted
   radiation. The effects due to the nanoparticles were studied also in the
   presence of dielectric layers covering the cell and working as
   anti-reflective coatings (ARC), although a complete discussion on the
   possible optimization of this setup is lacking. In this work, we provide
   a joint computational and experimental investigation of the optical
   properties of silver nanoparticles embedded in a SiO (2) ARC located on
   top of a crystalline silicon wafer. The effect of the particle size,
   particle position within the ARC layer, and surface coverage on the
   light transmitted to the silicon crystal are simulated by a
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) in-house software. On the
   experimental side, a composite anti-reflective structure, made of a
   silica layer with embedded silver nanoparticles, is deposited on top of
   silicon wafers. Samples differing in the size and position of the
   embedded metal particles are produced. For each configuration, the total
   reflectance is optically measured by means of a photo spectrometer
   coupled to an integrating sphere. We provide direct comparison of
   experimental and simulation results, along with an exhaustive discussion
   about the transmission efficiency of the investigated systems. We also
   discuss how our analysis might be extended to different configurations
   and cell design.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{329-345}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study introduces a slack free connection (SFC) by which pinching
   would be removed from hysteretic behavior of tension-only braces (TOBs).
   SFC through its mono-directional behavior, eliminates undesirable
   pinching of the tension-only bracing and changes it to a reliable
   lateral load resisting system with high energy dissipation capability. A
   Matlab/Simulink-based model, called Macro-Simulink model, is developed
   to simulate hysteretic behavior of TOBs with or without SFC. Derived
   Macro-Simulink model is also able to account for hysteretic behavior of
   the frame. The frame itself can have either deteriorated or
   non-deteriorated hysteretic behaviors. The Macro-Simulink model is
   verified through different techniques including earlier experimental
   results, explicit finite element modeling, and other pre-verified
   analytical/numerical tools. It is observed that initial pre-tension load
   only affects initial stiffness of the TOB and has no contribution on its
   nonlinear hysteretic behavior. Obtained results of this study indicate
   that energy dissipation capacity of TOBs with SFC would be improved up
   to 6 times compared with that of conventional TOBs. Moreover
   contribution of SFC is more pronounced in the case of frames with highly
   deteriorated behaviors. As a result TOB with SFC can be considered for
   retrofit purposes as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Do Patients With a Failed Metal-on-metal Hip Implant With a Pseudotumor
   Present Differences in Their Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Subpopulations?}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{473}},

Pages = {{3903-3914}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Early adverse tissue reactions around metal-on-metal (MoM)
   hip replacements, especially pseudotumors, are a major concern. Because
   the causes and pathomechanisms of these pseudotumors remain largely
   unknown, clinical monitoring of patients with MoM bearings is
   challenging.
   Questions/purposes The purpose of this study was to compare the
   lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood from patients with a
   failed MoM hip implant with and without a pseudotumor and patients with
   a well-functioning MoM hip implant without a pseudotumor. Potential
   differences in the systemic immune response are expected to reflect
   local differences in the periprosthetic tissues.
   Methods Consenting patients who underwent a revision of a failed MoM hip
   implant at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) from 2011 to 2014, or presented
   with a well-functioning MoM hip implant for a postoperative clinical
   followup at TOH from 2012 to 2013, were recruited for this study, unless
   they met any of the exclusion criteria (including diagnosed conditions
   that can affect peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations). Patients
   with a failed implant were divided into two groups: those with a
   pseudotumor (two hip resurfacings and five total hip arthroplasties
   {[}THAs]) and those without a pseudotumor (10 hip resurfacings and two
   THAs). Patients with a well-functioning MoM hip implant (nine
   resurfacings and three THAs) at 5 or more years postimplantation and who
   did not have a pseudotumor as demonstrated sonographically served as the
   control group. Peripheral blood subpopulations of T cells (specifically
   T helper {[}Th] and cytotoxic T {[}Tc]), B cells, natural killer (NK)
   cells, memory T and B cells as well as type 1 (expressing
   interferon-gamma) and type 2 (expressing interleukin-4) Th and Tc cells
   were analyzed by flow cytometry after immunostaining. Serum
   concentrations of cobalt and chromium were measured by inductively
   coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.
   Results The mean percentages of total memory T cells and, specifically,
   memory Th and memory Tc cells were lower in patients with a failed MoM
   hip implant with a pseudotumor than in both patients with a failed
   implant without a pseudotumor and patients with a well-functioning
   implant without a pseudotumor (memory Th cells: 29\% +/- 5\% {[}means
   +/- SD] versus 55\% +/- 17\%, d = 1.8, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   {[}1.2, 2.5] and versus 48\% +/- 14\%, d = 1.6, 95\% CI {[}1.0, 2.2],
   respectively; memory Tc cells: 18\% +/- 5\% versus 45\% +/- 14\%, d =
   2.3, 95\% CI {[}1.5, 3.1] and versus 41\% +/- A 12\%, d = 2.3, 95\% CI
   {[}1.5, 3.1], respectively; p < 0.001 in all cases). The mean percentage
   of memory B cells was also lower in patients with a failed MoM hip
   implant with a pseudotumor than in patients with a well-functioning
   implant without a pseudotumor (12\% +/- 8\% versus 29\% +/- 16\%, d =
   1.3, 95\% CI {[}0.7, 1.8], p = 0.025). In addition, patients with a
   failed MoM hip implant with a pseudotumor had overall lower percentages
   of type 1 Th cells than both patients with a failed implant without a
   pseudotumor and patients with a well-functioning implant without a
   pseudotumor (5.5\% {[}4.9\%-5.8\%] {[}median with interquartile range]
   versus 8.7\% {[}6.5\%-10.2\%], d = 1.4, 95\% CI {[}0.8, 2.0] and versus
   9.6\% {[}6.4\%-11.1\%], d = 1.6, 95\% CI {[}1.0, 2.2], respectively; p a
   parts per thousand currency sign 0.010 in both cases). Finally, serum
   cobalt concentrations in patients with a failed MoM hip implant with a
   pseudotumor were overall higher than those in patients with a
   well-functioning implant without a pseudotumor (5.8 mu g/L {[}2.9-17.0
   mu g/L] versus 0.9 mu g/L {[}0.6-1.3 mu g/L], d = 2.2, 95\% CI {[}1.4,
   2.9], p < 0.001).
   Conclusions Overall, results suggest the presence of a type IV
   hypersensitivity reaction, with a predominance of type 1 Th cells, in
   patients with a failed MoM hip implant with a pseudotumor.}},

Journal = {{OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm (FP-NSGA-II) is proposed by
   combining the fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic
   algorithm-II (NSGA-II) with a simple front prediction algorithm. Due to
   the significant computational time of evaluating objective functions in
   real life engineering problems, the aim of this hybrid approach is to
   better approximate the Pareto front of difficult constrained and
   unconstrained problems while keeping the computational cost similar to
   NSGA-II. FP-NSGA-II is similar to the original NSGA-II but generates
   better offsprings. This is achieved by using a prediction operator which
   utilizes the direction in the decision variable space between each
   solution in the first front and the nearest neighbour solution in the
   second front, in order to extrapolate future chromosomes. This enables
   the addition of solutions that are closer to the true Pareto front into
   the new generation. To assess the performance of the proposed approach,
   eight benchmark two-objective test problems and four three-objective
   test problems are used to compare FP-NSGA-II with NSGA-II. In addition,
   a three-objective heat exchanger network problem is examined to show the
   potential application of FP-NSGA-II in real-life problems. Results
   indicate that the FP-NSGA-II improves upon the performance of NSGA-II
   for a variety of benchmark test problems exhibiting different
   characteristics. In addition, a similar front prediction algorithm could
   also be easily integrated with other evolutionary algorithms to enhance
   its performance.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of oil particle sensor capability via resonance-based signal
   decomposition and fractional calculus}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{240-254}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Oil particle sensors can provide valuable information about the
   conditions of mechanical devices by detecting the metallic particles
   falling from machine components into lubricating oil due to fatigue,
   corrosion and pitting. However, the vibration interferences and
   background noise in the signals from a particle sensor make it difficult
   to precisely detect the particle quantity and size, and thus lead to
   misleading detection results. To enhance the capabilities of oil
   particle sensors, resonance-based signal decomposition is employed in
   this study to separate the output signal of the oil particle sensor into
   two components, i.e., the high-resonance and the low-resonance
   components. Since the high-and the low-resonance components reflect the
   harmonic signal components and the impulse signal components contained
   in the original signal respectively, only the low-resonance component
   contains the particle signal contents. Then the fractional calculus
   technique is applied to extract the oil particle signature from the
   low-resonance component. In this way, the interferences can be
   eliminated and the particle signature can be reliably extracted. The
   performance of the proposed approach has been validated by both
   simulated and experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present study, the self-synthesized thin film nanocomposite (TFN)
   membrane incorporated with hydrophilic functionalized titanate nanotubes
   (TNTs) has been fabricated and tested for forward osmosis (FO)
   desalination. The ATR-FTIR results showed that NH2-TNT5 were
   successfully modified by AATPS and while TEM and XRD revealed the
   tubular morphology and crystal structure of NH2-TNTs nanotubes,
   respectively. The presence of the chemical bondings between NH2-TNT5 and
   polyamide (PA) selective top layer of TFN is corroborated with the FTIR
   results. The existence of NH2-TNTs in PA top layer was further confirmed
   by XPS analysis on the control and TFN membranes. The effect of NH2-TNT5
   on the PA layer was investigated and discussed in terms of surface
   morphology and separation performance. The morphology of the PA layer
   was investigated through FESEM and AFM micrographs and the outgrowth of
   the ``leaf-like{''} structure was observed following the increase in
   NH2-TNT5 content. Compared to the thin film composite (TFC) control
   membrane, the TFN membrane embedded with 0.05 wt\% NH2-TNTs (designated
   as TFN0.05) exhibited two times improvement in water flux without
   sacrificing salt rejection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Characterization of partial pore wetting in hollow fiber gas absorption
   membrane contactors: An EDX analysis approach}},

Abstract = {{In this work a novel method to evaluate the partial pore wetting of gas
   absorption membranes is proposed. The method consists of two approaches,
   one by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), and the other by
   calculating the mass transfer resistances from the gas and liquid phase
   in the pore, using the parameter obtained by He gas permeation
   experiments. For this purpose, hollow fibers were spun from
   polyetherimide (PEI) and polyethersulfone (PES). As well, the lumen of a
   PEI hollow fiber was coated with silicone rubber. The hollow fibers were
   then characterized by He gas permeation experiments, critical entry
   pressure of water (CEPw), contact angle, scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and EDX. The hollow fibers were then subjected to CO2 gas
   absorption using aqueous NaCl solution as absorbent. After drying the
   hollow fiber was subjected to the EDX analysis. The cross-sectional
   profile of Na and Cl content in the hollow fiber revealed that the pores
   of the PES hollow fibers were partially wetted, particularly at the pore
   inlet. Calculation of mass transfer resistances, on the other hand,
   revealed that the resistance came from gas phase in most hollow fibers,
   except for the PES hollow fiber where the liquid phase contribution was
   significant. Silicone rubber coating of the PEI hollow fiber increased
   the surface hydrophobicity and reduced the pore wetting considerably.
   Thus, it was concluded that the proposed method can be used as a
   powerful tool to investigate the pore wetting for many membrane
   contactor applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Combined effects of pH (i.e., 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5) and bicarbonate (i.e.,
   0, 80 and 160 mM NaHCO3) on lipid accumulation and on biological
   contaminant viability in a protozoa-contaminated culture of the
   freshwater microalga Neochloris oleoabundans were studied. Cultures
   grown in the media containing 160 mM NaHCO3 at pH 9.5 obtained the
   highest biomass concentration (DCWmax = 1.32 g/L), lipid content (LC =
   327 mg/g), which corresponded to a lipid productivity of 56 mg/(L.d),
   and the culture was protozoa free one day after inoculation. Other
   cultures, 160 mM NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 (DCWmax = 1.32 g/L, LC = 223 mg/g),
   and 80 mM NaHCO3 at pH 9.5 (DCWmax = 1.25 g/L, LC = 264 mg/g) could
   delay protozoan growth, but not inhibit it completely. These results
   suggest 160 mM NaHCO3 or slightly above at pH levels of 8.5-9.5 may be
   used in outdoor cultivation processes of freshwater N. oleoabundans to
   control protozoa contamination while maintain a high lipid content. (C)

Abstract = {{Dual-layer composite membrane is a new design for direct contact
   membrane distillation, (DCMD) with membrane performance potentially
   superior to that of single layer porous membranes. Using dry-wet phase

   polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP) or

   and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blend. The effect of the nonsolvent additive
   type in the outer layer and that of PVA/PVDF blending ratio in the inner
   layer on the morphological, mechanical and separation characteristics of
   the composite membranes was investigated. Membrane performance was
   further correlated to the physicochemical and morphological
   characteristics of the membranes. In particular, a thorough
   investigation of pore wetting in DCMD was attempted for the first time
   in this work, observing the cross-sectional distribution of EDX chlorine
   signals as an indication of the penetration of sodium chloride solution
   into the pore from the feed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the feasibility of high purity H-2 production by
   means of the electrochemical reforming of biomass derived organic
   alcohols (methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol)-water solutions in a
   proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis cell. For that purpose, a
   nanostructured bimetallic carbon-supported Pt-Sn catalyst, with nominal
   Pt/Sn atomic ratios of 70/30, was synthesized by a modified polyol
   reduction method and characterized by means of TEM, XRD and XPS
   analysis. The resulting Pt-7-Sn-3/C catalyst consists of a bi-phase
   Pt/SnOx structure and presents a narrow particle size distribution with
   size predominantly in the order of 4.5 nm, showing high dispersion on
   carbon support (20 wt.\% metal loading). During electrochemical
   reforming tests, the influence of reaction temperature and the
   electrocatalytic stability of the system were verified for mild working
   operation times. Synthesized 20 wt.\% Po-Sn-3/C anodic catalyst provided
   a promising electro-catalytic activity, comparable to that of commercial
   60 wt.\% Pt-Ru/C and required lower amounts of Pt in order to produce
   the same amount of hydrogen. Proposed system allowed to produce H-2 with
   a lower electrical energy requirement (26 kWh kg(H2)(-1) even after
   deactivation), in comparison with commercial PEM water electrolyser
   stacks (50 kWh kg(H2)(-1)). In addition, obtained H-2 purity was very
   high (99.938\%) and only few ppm of CO and CO2 were detected at the
   cathode chamber. These results demonstrated the potential interest of
   Pt-7-Sn-3/C anodic catalyst, synthesized via the polyol method, for
   production of pure hydrogen from biomass-derived compounds via
   electrochemical reforming at low temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Criterion fusion for spectral segmentation and its application to
   optimal demodulation of bearing vibration signals}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64-65}},
Pages = {{132-148}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The defective bearing signatures can be detected by resonance
   demodulation of the vibration signals. The decision of the bearing fault
   detection largely depends on the quality of the identified resonant
   frequency band. Two key issues in locating the resonance frequency band
   are the proper segmentation of the frequency spectrum of interest and
   the criterion used to guide the search for the resonance band. To deal
   with the two issues, this paper proposes a criterion fusion approach to
   guide the spectral segmentation process. With the proposed approach, the
   frequency spectrum of the bearing signal is first divided into initial
   fine segments which are then adaptively merged into different subsets
   using an enhanced bottom-up segmentation technique. To guide the
   spectral segmentation and merging process, three commonly used criteria,
   i.e., kurtosis, smoothness index and crest factor are fused into a
   synthesized cost function using an entropy-based method. The final
   frequency band delivered by this approach has a good coverage of the
   resonant band and is then used to demodulate bearing signals. Both
   simulated and experimental signals have been employed to evaluate the
   proposed approach, which has also been compared to single-criterion
   methods. The comparison indicates that the fused criterion yields better
   results than those from the single-criterion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Motivation: The macromolecular surfaces associated with proteins and
   macromolecules play a key role in determining their functionality and
   interactions, and are also of importance in structural analysis and
   classification. As a result of their interaction with their environment,
   the macromolecular surfaces experience random conformational
   deformations. Consequently, a realistic description of the molecular
   surface must be invariant under these deformations. Further, the motion
   associated with disconnected regions on the molecular surface may be
   correlated. This property is known as the allosteric effect. In this
   paper, we address these two requirements. To this end, we propose an
   approach based on discrete differential geometry and the fractional
   Fokker-Planck equation which provides an isometrically invariant and
   allosteric aware description of macromolecular surfaces. Our method is
   applied to the influenza neuraminidase. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic triblock copolymer (Pluronic F127) was used as a
   macromolecular additive to modify the surface of poly(ether imide) (PEI)
   ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with additive contents from 0 to 3 wt \%
   in the casting solution. The surface modification of the membranes was
   confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and contact angle
   measurements. The membranes were also characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy, UF of proteins, and flux recovery. A membrane with the
   highest Pluronic (3 wt \%) in PEI exhibited the highest pure water flux,
   highest water content, and lowest membrane hydraulic resistance. It
   exhibited high UF fluxes of 170 and 180 L m(2) h(1) at 345 kPa, for 1.0
   g/L bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffer solution and 1.0 g/L
   humic acid (HA) in deionized water feed solutions, with solute
   rejections of 84 and 82\%, respectively. It also showed that the blended
   membranes with 3 wt \% Pluronic content had a higher flux recovery ratio
   (92.4 and 89.4\%), slightly higher reversible fouling (25.8 and 18.8\%),
   and lower irreversible fouling (7.6 and 10.6\%) after the UF of BSA and
   HA solute separation. This explained their low fouling behaviors
   compared to the neat PEI membranes.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure, phase reaction characteristics and mechanical
   properties of fabricated Al-20\%Mg2Si in situ composite with different
   contents of cerium have been investigated using optical microscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis and
   hardness tests. The results show that addition of Ce not only refined
   Mg2Si reinforcement particles but also changed the morphology of
   eutectic Al-Mg2Si, Al5FeSi (beta) intermetallic and Al5Cu2Mg8Si6 (Q) +
   Al2Cu (circle minus) phases. It was found that 0.8 wt\% Ce is the
   optimum concentration to transform the phases into refined structures.
   The structure of the skeleton of Mg2SiP changed to a polygonal shape
   with uniform distribution and decrease in size from 124 mm to 60 mm and
   increased in density from 12 to 45 particles/mm(2). Flake-like Mg2SiE
   transformed into a rod-like morphology. In addition, the aspect ratio of
   needle-like b structures reduced from 40.5 to 22.9, accompanied with an
   increase of solid fraction for Q + circle minus phase. Ce addition
   increased the nucleation temperature of Mg2SiP and b phases; however, it
   had an opposite effect for the Mg2SiE and Q + circle minus phases. The
   composite hardness increased from 61.32 to 74.15 HV because of
   refinement of the microstructure. The refining mechanism of Mg2SiP and
   Mg2SiE phases is discussed in the current study, and formation of new Ce
   compounds is believed to be responsible for the refinement effect. (C)

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3-D) serial time-encoded imaging system with a high

   proposed and experimentally demonstrated. A regular serial time-encoded
   imaging system can perform ultrafast two-dimensional imaging in which
   the reflectivity of a sample surface is represented by the intensity
   change of a microwave waveform. By adding one reference channel to form
   a Mach-Zehnder interferometer structure, the depth information of the
   sample surface is encoded as the microwave phase or frequency change,
   thus, 3-D imaging is implementable by extracting the phase or frequency
   information. In the proposed approach, the intensity and phase or
   frequency information are extracted based on Hilbert transform from the
   microwave waveform. The approach is experimentally evaluated. The
   imaging of a silicon chip as a sample is performed. A vertical
   resolution better than 130 nm and a depth measurement range greater than
   2 mm are demonstrated.}},

   onto the entire surface of the TiO2 nanotubes leading to the formation

   electrooxidation of ethanol on Pd clusters deposited on TiO2 nanotubes
   shows not only a direct correlation between the catalytic activity and

Abstract = {{This article presents an information hiding algorithm for H.264/AVC
   video stream. It utilizes position of the last nonzero level of
   quantized discrete cosine transform block to embed information bits.
   Because only the high-frequency levels are changed, it can guarantee a
   high peak signal-to-noise ratio and slight increase in bit rate after
   the watermark embedding. The extraction process is not complex; thus,
   the proposed technique is an excellent solution for real-time
   applications such as broadcasting. Experimental results on several test
   sequences demonstrate that the proposed approach can realize blind
   extraction with real-time performance; it also provides very high
   capacity, low distortion and increase in bit rate by about 0.5\%.

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are seen as the key enabling
   technology of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In addition to
   safety, VANETs also provide a cost-effective platform for numerous
   comfort and entertainment applications. A pragmatic solution of VANETs
   requires synergistic efforts in multidisciplinary areas of communication
   standards, routings, security and trust. Furthermore, a realistic VANET
   simulator is required for performance evaluation. There have been many
   research efforts in these areas, and consequently, a number of surveys
   have been published on various aspects. In this article, we first
   explain the key characteristics of VANETs, then provide a meta-survey of
   research works. We take a tutorial approach to introducing VANETs and
   gradually discuss intricate details. Extensive listings of existing
   surveys and research projects have been provided to assess development
   efforts. The article is useful for researchers to look at the big
   picture and channel their efforts in an effective way.}},

Title = {{Integrating building information modeling (BIM) and LEED system at the

Abstract = {{Designing environmentally friendly buildings that provide both high
   performance and cost savings is of increasing interest in the
   development of sustainable cities. Today, we are looking at not just
   buildings' certification but sustainable practices that go beyond
   ratings to satisfy our social responsibilities. The construction
   industry in general will benefit from an integrated tool that will help
   optimize the selection process of materials, equipments, and systems at
   every stage of a proposed building's life. Building information modeling
   (BIM) has the potential to aid designers to select the right type of
   materials during the early design stage and to make vital decisions that
   have great impacts on the life cycle of sustainable buildings.
   This paper describes a methodology that integrates BIM with the Canadian
   green building certification system (LEED(C)). Also, it explains how
   this integration would assist project teams in making sustainability
   related decisions while accumulating the required number of points based
   on the applied green building rating system. The methodology depicts the
   implementation of a model that automatically calculates the compiled
   number of LEED certification points and related registration costs for
   green and certified materials used in designing sustainable buildings
   all within the concepts of BIM. Using BIM in this methodology will help
   designers to invent and animate sustainable buildings in 3D mode easily
   and efficiently at the conceptual stage. The design information of the
   proposed sustainable building will be produced in a timely manner by
   using new plug-ins, which are developed for that reason, and which will
   link the BIM model with an external database that stores sustainable
   materials and assembly groups. A real case project is presented to
   illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the proposed model. (C)

Title = {{A study of the effect of impurities on CO2 storage capacity in
   geological formations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{132-137}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technology for reducing
   atmospheric CO2 emissions from industrial CO2 emitters. The high cost of
   carbon capture is one of the major barriers to the implementation of
   CCS. CO2 captured from industrial emitters contains various impurities
   such as N-2, O-2, Ar and SOx, and storing the impure CO2 underground
   would eliminate the need for purification and substantially reduce the
   cost. However, the impurities may negatively impact CO2 storage. In this
   work, we studied the impact of impurities on the storage capacity of CO2
   in geological formations through density changes. Density measurements
   for CO2 mixtures with N-2, O-2, Ar and SO2 were carried out in CO2
   storage pressure and temperature ranges. The observed density behaviors
   and the impact on the storage capacity of CO2 are analyzed. The
   experimental and analytic results suggest that N-2, O-2 and Ar would
   bring about a minimum of the storage capacity at a certain pressure,
   where about 15 mol\% N-2, O-2 and Ar could reduce the storage capacity
   for CO2 by over 65\%. The reduction of the storage capacity decreases
   with increasing temperature. The results also suggest that Ar could
   represent the three air-derived impurities combined in density and
   storage capacity evaluations for CO2 mixtures. Moreover, the results
   suggest that SO2 could bring about a maximum of the storage capacity,
   where more CO2 could be stored in given space compared to pure CO2 case.
   Based on the analysis, a generalization is proposed to predict whether a
   minimum or a maximum for the CO2 storage capacity would occur with
   different impurities. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Metal strip waveguides and devices suitable for high-speed digital
   signal transmission at both microwave and optical frequencies are
   fabricated and demonstrated in this work. The waveguide structure
   consists of three metal strips forming a coplanar waveguide (CPW) to
   support a microwave mode. In the proposed structure, the signal line
   consists of a copper strip sandwiched between two thin gold layers. The
   CPW ground planes are thin gold strips supporting long-range surface
   plasmon polaritons (LRSPPs) at optical frequencies. Thus, the proposed
   structure can simultaneously support LRSPPs at optical frequencies and
   microwave signals up to at least 40 GHz. The metalizations are patterned
   using bilayer photolithography followed by thermal evaporation. Then, to
   create the signal waveguide, an O-2 plasma etch of the cladding and
   copper E-beam evaporation are used. The fabrication process steps are
   verified through experimental characterization. Microwave and optical
   transmission through the fabricated devices is demonstrated using radio
   frequency probes applied to the top of the device and optical fibers in
   an end-fire coupling configuration, respectively. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Opportunistic routing (OR) is a promising paradigm that selects the
   next-hop forwarder on the fly. OR has gained a lot of attention from the
   research community for its ability to increase the performance of
   wireless networks. In OR a potential group of nodes (candidates) is
   selected to help as the next-hop forwarder. Each candidate that receives
   the packet can continue forwarding the packet. In OR, by using a dynamic
   relay node to forward the packet, the transmission reliability and
   network throughput are increased. Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs)
   collect data from the environment and transfer them to the sonobuoys on
   the surface to send them to a center for further processing. Because of
   the acoustic channels common to UWSNs, they have low bandwidth, high
   error probability, and longer propagation delay compared to radio
   channels. These properties of UWSNs make them good potential candidates
   for using OR concepts to deliver packets to the destination. This
   article reviews and compares different OR protocols proposed for UWSNs.
   We classify the existing approaches in different categories, discuss
   representative examples for each class of protocols, and uncover the
   requirements considered by the different protocols, as well as the
   design requirements and limitations under which they operate. Finally,
   we discuss potential future research directions for UWSNs using the OR

Abstract = {{An approach to the interrogation of a linearly chirped fiber Bragg
   grating (LCFBG) sensor using a linearly frequency-modulated (or chirped)
   optical waveform (LFMOW) with a high resolution is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. An LFMOW is generated at a laser diode
   through linear frequency modulation. The generated LFMOW is then
   launched into an LCFBG pair consisting of two identical LCFBGs, with one
   serving as a sensing LCFBG and the other as a reference LCFBG. The
   reflection of the LFMOW from the two LCFBGs would lead to two time
   delayed LFMOWs. By beating the LFMOWs at a photodetector, a microwave
   signal with a beat frequency that is proportional to the time delay
   difference between the two reflected LFMOWs is generated. By measuring
   the frequency change of the beat signal, the strain applied to the
   sensing LCFBG is estimated. The proposed approach is experimentally
   evaluated. An LCFBG sensor with a resolution of 0.25 mu epsilon is

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was conducted into the nature of the
   vortex shedding generated by truncated and nonflat serrated trailing
   edges of a NACA 0012 wing section as well as the aerodynamic performance
   of such trailing edges. In line with previous findings, the truncated
   trailing edge generates a significant amount of vortex shedding, while
   increasing both the maximum lift and drag coefficients, resulting in an
   overall reduction in the maximum lift-to-drag ratio compared to a plain
   NACA 0012 wing section. By decreasing the chevron angle phi of the
   nonflat trailing-edge serrations (i.e., by making them sharper), the
   energy of the vortex shedding significantly decreases, and the
   lift-to-drag ratios increase compared to a plain NACA 0012 wing section.
   Fractal/multiscale patterns made of scaled-down repetitions of these
   serrations were also investigated with a view to further improve
   performance. It was found that the energy of the vortex shedding
   increases with an increasing fractal iteration if the chevron is broad
   (phi=65deg) but decreases for sharper chevrons (phi=45deg). It is
   believed that if phi is too big, the multiscale trailing edges are too
   far away from each other to interact and break down the vortex shedding
   mechanism. Fractal/multiscale trailing edges are also able to improve
   aerodynamic performance compared to the NACA 0012 wing section.}},

Abstract = {{Social media has been a convenient platform for voicing opinions through
   posting messages, ranging from tweeting a short text to uploading a
   media file, or any combination of messages. Understanding the perceived
   emotions inherently underlying these user-generated contents (UGC) could
   bring light to emerging applications such as advertising and media
   analytics. Existing research efforts on affective computation are mostly
   dedicated to single media, either text captions or visual content. Few
   attempts for combined analysis of multiple media are made, despite that
   emotion can be viewed as an expression of multimodal experience. In this
   paper, we explore the learning of highly non-linear relationships that
   exist among low-level features across different modalities for emotion
   prediction. Using the deep Bolzmann machine (DBM), a joint density model
   over the space of multimodal inputs, including visual, auditory, and
   textual modalities, is developed. The model is trained directly using
   UGC data without any labeling efforts. While the model learns a joint
   representation over multimodal inputs, training samples in absence of
   certain modalities can also be leveraged. More importantly, the joint
   representation enables emotion-oriented cross-modal retrieval, for
   example, retrieval of videos using the text query ``crazy cat{''}. The
   model does not restrict the types of input and output, and hence, in
   principle, emotion prediction and retrieval on any combinations of media
   are feasible. Extensive experiments on web videos and images show that
   the learnt joint representation could be very compact and be
   complementary to hand-crafted features, leading to performance
   improvement in both emotion classification and cross-modal retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{The novel Sm1-xCexFeO3-delta (x = 0, 0.01, 0.05) (SCF) perovskites with
   and without 1 wt\% of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) were investigated for
   carbon monoxide and ethylene oxidation in the temperature range of
   25-350 degrees C. All perovskites were predominantly ionic conductors,
   with ionic conductivities two orders of magnitude higher than the
   electronic contribution. Furthermore, the cerium doping increases the
   ionic conductivity of these materials at high temperatures. The bare SCF
   perovskites possessed catalytic activity for both reactions; however the
   Pt-supported catalysts had 50-100 degrees C lower light-off temperatures
   than the corresponding perovskites. More significantly, the enhancement
   in the catalytic activity of the Pt/SCF family with respect to other
   Pt-supported catalysts was shown by the lower activation energies, which
   were 25.7 kJ/mol over Pt/Sm0.95Ce0.05FeO3-delta and 18.3 kJ/mol over
   Pt/Sm0.99Ce0.01FeO3-delta for CO and ethylene oxidation, respectively.
   The corresponding activation energies for Pt NPs supported on
   conventional gamma-Al2O3 were 57.1 and 32 kJ/mol, and on ionically
   conductive yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were 35.8 and 22 kJ/mol for
   CO and C2H4 oxidation, respectively. The increased activity was
   attributed to the high ionic conductivity (O2-) of the perovskite
   supports at 100-400 degrees C that facilitates the spontaneous
   backspillover of O2- promoters from the lattice to the gas-exposed Pt
   nanoparticle surface. The promoters alter the adsorption strength of
   reactants similar to the electrochemical promotion mechanism observed
   under polarization.}},

   data are then classified by means of a thresholding procedure based on
   the Neyman-Pearson criterion. The effectiveness of the algorithm is
   demonstrated by applying it to different data sets obtained from field

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel model-free trajectory tracking of
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by the combination of
   iterative learning control (ILC) and primitives. The optimal trajectory
   tracking solution is obtained in terms of previously learned solutions
   to simple tasks called primitives. The library of primitives that are
   stored in memory consists of pairs of reference input/controlled output
   signals. The reference input primitives are optimized in a model-free
   ILC framework without using knowledge of the controlled process. The
   guaranteed convergence of the learning scheme is built upon a model-free
   virtual reference feedback tuning design of the feedback decoupling
   controller. Each new complex trajectory to be tracked is decomposed into
   the output primitives regarded as basis functions. The optimal reference
   input for the control system to track the desired trajectory is next
   recomposed from the reference input primitives. This is advantageous
   because the optimal reference input is computed straightforward without
   the need to learn from repeated executions of the tracking task. In
   addition, the optimization problem specific to trajectory tracking of
   square MIMO systems is decomposed in a set of optimization problems
   assigned to each separate singleinput single-output control channel that
   ensures a convenient model-free decoupling. The new model-free
   primitive-based ILC approach is capable of planning, reasoning, and
   learning. A case study dealing with the model-free control tuning for a
   nonlinear aerodynamic system is included to validate the new approach.
   The experimental results are given.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff changes are tightly connected to precipitation in West African
   Sahel in such a way that any impact on precipitation would result in
   potential changes in runoff. Unfortunately, climate change and
   variability impacts induced changes in streamflow which directly disturb
   water availability for socioeconomic activities particularly
   agricultural sector which constitutes the main survival issue of West
   African population. Thus, available streamflow information a few months
   in advance prior to a rainy season with an acceptable forecasting skill
   will immensely benefit for water users to make an operational planning
   for water management decision. Streamflow is usually either forecasted
   directly by linking streamflow to predictors through a multiple linear
   regression or indirectly using a rainfall-runoff model to transform
   predicted rainfall into streamflow. Seasonal annual mean streamflow and
   maximum monthly streamflow were forecasted in this study by using two
   statistical methods based on change point detection using Normalized
   Bayes Factors. Each method uses one of the following predictors: Sea
   level pressure, air temperature and relative humidity (RHUM). Models M1
   and M2 respectively allow for change in model parameters according to
   rainfall amplitude (M1), or along time (M2). They were compared to
   forecasting models where precipitation is obtained using the classical
   linear model with constant parameters (M3) and the climatology (M4). The
   obtained results revealed that model M3 using RHUM as predictor at a lag
   time of 8 months was the best method for seasonal annual streamflow
   forecast. Whereas, model M1 using air temperature as predictor at a lag
   time of 4 months is the best model to predict maximum monthly streamflow
   in the Sirba watershed.}},

   fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-co-HFP) ultra-filtration
   membranes prepared from casting solutions with different concentrations

   Membrane properties were studied in terms of membrane compaction, pure
   water flux (PWF), water content (WC), membrane hydraulic resistance
   (R-m), protein rejection, molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), average pore
   size, and porosity. PWF, WC, and thermal stability of the blend
   membranes increased whereas the crystalline nature and mechanical
   strength of the blend membranes decreased when PVP additive
   concentration was increased. The contact angle (CA) decreased as the PVP
   concentration increased in the casting solution, which indicates that
   the hydro-philicity of the surface increased upon addition of PVP. The
   average pore size and porosity of the PVdF-co-HFP membrane increased to
   42.82 angstrom and 25.12\%, respectively, when 7.5 wt\% PVP was blended
   in the casting solution. The MWCO increased from 20 to 45 kDa with an
   increase in PVP concentration from 0 to 7.5 wt\%. The protein separation
   study revealed that the rejection increased as the protein molecular
   weight increased. The PVdF-co-HFP/PVP blended membrane prepared from a
   7.5 wt\% PVP solution had a maximum flux recovery ratio of 74.3\%, which

Abstract = {{Wood remains the material of choice for stringed musical instruments.
   However, as supplies of suitable wood decrease, a need to maximize the
   use of available timber arises. Since large variations exist within a
   species, manufacturing processes require direct measurements of the
   mechanical properties of a given specimen in order to construct
   acoustically consistent instruments. This paper reports on the
   application of non-destructive mechanical property tests developed to be
   used on a single wooden specimen. In this way, relationships between
   mechanical properties of clear, straight-grained, quartersawn timber can
   be investigated and the number of measurements during manufacturing can
   be reduced. Measured properties include density, moisture content,
   radial and longitudinal Young's moduli, shear modulus and Poisson's
   ratios in the longitudinal-radial plane. Furthermore, natural
   frequencies of theses specimens have been measured for the rectangular
   plates having simply supported boundary conditions. Sitka spruce (Picea
   sitchensis) has been studied. Relationships between various mechanical
   properties are found, and suggestions for using Poisson's ratios are
   proposed. These relationships are shown to reduce the number of
   measurements required to construct acoustically consistent instruments
   in musical instrument manufacturing. In particular, it is shown that
   measurements of the Young's moduli in both the radial and longitudinal
   directions would be suitable for describing the important mechanical
   properties of such soundboard wood. The natural frequencies of the
   tested plates were also calculated from the measured properties and
   compared to values obtained experimentally. Great correlation is found
   between the theoretical model and experimental results for the simply
   supported rectangular plates.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach to achieving ultrafast three-dimensional (3-D) imaging
   based on space-to-wavelength-to-time mapping and short-time Fourier
   transform (STFT) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The
   fundamental concept to achieve 3-D imaging is to encode the depth
   information of a sample by interfering two delayed pulses that are
   reflected from the surface of the sample and an additional reference
   plane on the top of the sample. The interference pattern that contains
   the depth information in the frequency domain is converted into the time
   domain based on dispersive Fourier transform and then analyzed based on
   STFT. Thus, ultrafast 3-D imaging is achieved. The proposed approach is
   experimentally evaluated. The imaging of a sample with a depth of 1.5 mm
   using an ultrafast pulse laser source with a beam width of similar to 2
   mm at a repetition rate of 48.8 MHz is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Intense sediment transport and rapid bed evolution are frequently
   observed under highly-energetic flows, and bed erosion sometimes is of
   the same magnitude as the flow itself. Simultaneous simulation of
   multiple physical processes requires a fully coupled system to achieve
   an accurate hydraulic and morphodynamical prediction. In this paper, we
   develop a high-order well-balanced finite-volume method for a new fully
   coupled two-dimensional hyperbolic system consisting of the shallow
   water equations with friction terms coupled with the equations modeling
   the sediment transport and bed evolution.
   The nonequilibrium sediment transport equation is used to predict the
   sediment concentration variation. Since bed-load, sediment entrainment
   and deposition have significant effects on the bed evolution, an
   Exner-based equation is adopted together with the Grass bed-load formula
   and sediment entrainment and deposition models to calculate the
   morphological process. The resulting 5 x 5 hyperbolic system of balance
   laws is numerically solved using a Godunov-type central-upwind scheme on
   a triangular grid. A computationally expensive process of finding all of
   the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices is avoided: The upper/lower
   bounds on the largest/smallest local speeds of propagation are estimated
   using the Lagrange theorem. A special discretization of the bed-slope
   term is proposed to guarantee the well-balanced property of the designed
   scheme. The proposed fully coupled model is verified on a number of
   numerical experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A two-terminal mass (TTM) based vibration absorber with variable moment
   of inertia (VMI) for passive vehicle suspension is proposed. The VMl of
   the system is achieved by the motion of sliders embedded in a hydraulic
   driven flywheel. The moment of inertia increases in reaction to strong
   vertical vehicle oscillations and decreases for weak vertical
   oscillations. The hydraulic mechanism of the system converts the
   relative linear motion between the two terminals of the suspension into
   rotating motion of the flywheel. In the case of stronger vehicle
   vertical oscillation, the sliders inside the flywheel move away from the
   center of the flywheel because of the centrifugal force, hence yielding
   higher moment of inertia. The opposite is true in the case of weaker
   vehicle oscillation. As such, the moment of inertia adjusts itself
   adaptively in response to the road conditions. The performance of the
   proposed TTM-VMI absorber has been analyzed via dynamics modeling and
   simulation and further examined by experiments. In comparison to its
   counterpart with constant moment of inertia, the proposed VMI system
   offers faster response, better road handling and safety, improved ride
   comfort, and reduced suspension deflection except in the case of
   sinusoidal excitations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A microwave photonic filter (MPF) with two independently tunable
   passbands using a polarization modulator (PolM) and a phase-shifted
   fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG) is proposed and experimentally
   demonstrated. By applying two orthogonally polarized optical waves from
   two tunable laser sources (TLSs) to the PolM, two phase-modulated
   optical signals that are orthogonally polarized are generated, which are
   sent to the PS-FBG that acts as an optical notch filter to suppress one
   sideband of the orthogonally polarized phase-modulated signals. Thus,
   the two phase-modulated signals are converted to two intensity-modulated
   single-sideband signals. The overall operation corresponds to a
   dual-passband MPF with the central frequencies of the two passbands
   independently tunable by changing the wavelengths of the optical
   carriers from the two TLSs. The proposed MPF is experimentally
   evaluated. A dual-passband MPF with a bandwidth for each passband of 140
   MHz and a frequency tunable range of similar to 6 GHz is demonstrated.
   The insertion loss and the dynamic range of the filter are also studied
   and measured experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of luminescent coupling are observed in monolithic 5V,
   five-junction GaAs phototransducers. Power conversion efficiency was
   measured at 61.6\% 6 +/- 3\% under the continuous, monochromatic
   illumination for which they were designed. Modeling shows that photon
   recycling can account for up to 350mV of photovoltage in these devices.
   Drift-diffusion based simulations including a luminescent coupling term
   in the continuity equation show a broadening of the internal quantum
   efficiency curve which agrees well with experimental measurements.
   Luminescent coupling is shown to expand the spectral bandwidth of the
   phototransducer by a factor of at least 3.5 for devices with three or
   more junctions, even in cases where multiple absorption/emission events
   are required to transfer excess carriers into the limiting junction. We
   present a detailed description of the novel luminescent coupling
   modeling technique used to predict these performance enhancements. (C)

Abstract = {{A significant decrease in mean river flow as well as shifts in flood
   regimes have been reported at several locations along the River Niger.
   These changes are the combined effect of persistent droughts, damming
   and increased consumption of water. Moreover, it is believed that
   climate change will impact on the hydrological regime of the river in
   the next decades and exacerbate existing problems. While decision makers
   and stakeholders are aware of these issues, it is hard for them to
   figure out what actions should be taken without a quantitative estimate
   of future changes. In this paper, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool
   (SWAT) model of the Niger River watershed at Koulikoro was successfully
   calibrated, then forced with the climate time series of variable length
   generated by nine regional climate models (RCMs) from the AMMA-ENSEMBLES
   experiment. The RCMs were run under the SRES A1B emissions scenario. A
   combination of quantile-quantile transformation and nearest-neighbour
   search was used to correct biases in the distributions of RCM outputs.
   Streamflow time series were generated for the 2026-2050 period (all nine
   RCMs), and for the 2051-2075 and 2076-2100 periods (three out of nine
   RCMs) based on the availability of RCM simulations. It was found that
   the quantile-quantile transformation improved the simulation of both
   precipitation extremes and ratio of monthly dry days/wet days. All RCMs
   predicted an increase in temperature and solar radiation, and a decrease
   in average annual relative humidity in all three future periods relative
   to the 1981-1989 period, but there was no consensus among them about the
   direction of change of annual average wind speed, precipitation and
   streamflow. When all model projections were averaged, mean annual
   precipitation was projected to decrease, while the total precipitation
   in the flood season (August, September, October) increased, driving the
   mean annual flow up by 6.9\% (2026-2050), 0.9\% (2051-2075) and 5.6\%
   (2076-2100). A t-test showed that changes in multi-model annual mean
   flow and annual maximum monthly flow between all four periods were not
   statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-radio multi-channel wireless networks (M(2)WNs) have been studied
   intensively over the past decade with focusing on traffic management
   functionalities such as channel-to-interface assignment, traffic routing
   and scheduling. These developed solutions always assumed continuous
   normal operation of all network components while failing to take into
   considering the failure-prone nature of wireless networks. This article
   analyzes the effects of node failure on the ability of network nodes to
   maintain their connectivity. More precisely, we present a tight upper
   bound on the node failure probabilities needed to maintain full network
   connectivity on the one hand. On the other hand, a lower bound, at which
   the system loses connectivity, is also derived. We show that these
   bounds are dependent only on the nodes' geometric distribution and
   density. We then verify these theoretical results against those obtained
   via experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{We present the continuous model of a mobile slender mechanism that is
   intended to be the structure of an autonomous hyper-redundant slender
   robotic system. Rigid body degrees-of-freedom (DOF) and deformability
   are coupled through a Lagrangian weak formulation that includes control
   inputs to achieve forward locomotion and shape tracking. The forward
   locomotion and the shape tracking are associated to the coupling with a
   substrate that models a generic environment with which the mechanism
   could interact. The assumption of small deformations around rigid body
   placements allows to adopt the floating reference kinematic description.
   By posing the distributed parameter control problem in weak form, we
   naturally introduce an approximate solution technique based on Galerkin
   projection on the linear mode shapes of the Timoshenko beam model that
   is adopted to describe the body of the system. Simulation results
   illustrate coupling among forward motion and shape tracking as described
   by the equations governing the system.}},

Abstract = {{Sharks, rays and other elasmobranch fishes are characterized by a
   skeletal type that is unique among living vertebrates, comprised
   predominantly of an unmineralized cartilage, covered by a thin outer
   layer of sub-millimeter, mineralized tiles called tesserae. The
   mineralized portion of the skeleton appears to grow only by apposition,
   adding material at the edges of each tessera; maintenance of
   non-mineralized joints between tesserae is therefore vital, with precise
   control of mineral deposition and inhibition at the many thousands of
   growth fronts in the skeleton. Yet, we have only scattered evidence as
   to how the elasmobranchs mineralize and grow their skeletons. In this
   review, we take an ``environment to skeleton{''} approach, drawing
   together research from a vast range of perspectives to track calcium and
   phosphate from the typical elasmobranch habitats into and through the
   body, to their deposition at tesseral growth fronts. In the process, we
   discuss the available evidence for skeletal resorption capability,
   mineral homeostasis hormones, and nucleation inhibition mechanisms. We
   also outline relevant theories in crystal nucleation and typical errors
   in measurements of serum calcium and phosphate in the study of
   vertebrate biology. We assemble research that suggests consensus in some
   concepts in elasmobranch skeletal development, but also highlight the
   very large gaps in our knowledge, particularly in regards to endocrine
   functional networks and biomineralization mechanisms. In this way, we
   lay out frameworks for future directions in the study of elasmobranch
   skeletal biology with stronger and more comparative links to research in
   other disciplines and into other taxa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Renewable monomers containing allylic C-H bonds in their structure are
   prone to degradative chain transfer in free-radical polymerization,

   understand this mechanism, a kinetic model incorporating a degradative

   d-limonene (LIM) and n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) was developed using
   PREDICI. Model predictions offered insight on how degradative chain
   transfer reactions affect conversion, copolymer composition and
   molecular weight in the polymerization. Experimental data from
   copolymerizations at monomer feed compositions (LIM/BMA, mol/mol) of
   10/90, 20/80 and 30/70 were compared to the model's predictions.
   Moreover, it was discovered that degradative chain transfer results in
   elevated concentrations of growing polymer chains ending in allylic
   limonene radicals, which inevitably influences termination reactions and
   molecular weight development.}},

Abstract = {{Stitching is used to reduce dry-core (incomplete infusion of T-joint
   core) and reinforce T-joint structure. However, it may cause new types
   of flaws, especially submillimeter flaws. Microscopic inspection,
   ultrasonic c-scan, pulsed thermography, vibrothermography, and laser
   spot thermography are used to investigate the internal flaws in a
   stitched T-joint carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) matrix
   composites. Then, a new microlaser line thermography is proposed.
   Microcomputed tomography (microCT) is used to validate the infrared
   results. A comparison between microlaser line thermography and microCT
   is performed. It was concluded that microlaser line thermography can
   detect the internal submillimeter defects. However, the depth and size
   of the defects can affect the detection results. The microporosities
   with a diameter of less than 54 mu m are not detected in the microlaser
   line thermography results. Microlaser line thermography can detect the
   microporosity (a diameter of 0.162 mm) from a depth of 90 mu m. However,
   it cannot detect the internal microporosity (a diameter of 0.216 mm)
   from a depth of 0.18 mm. The potential causes are given. Finally, a
   comparative study is conducted. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Soil suction (psi) is one of the key factors that influence the
   resilient modulus (M-R) of pavement subgrade soils. There are several
   models available in the literature for predicting the M-R-psi
   correlations. However, the various model parameters required in the
   existing models are generally determined by performing regression
   analysis on extensive experimental data of the M-R-psi relationships,
   which are cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming to obtain. In this
   paper, a model is proposed to predict the variation of the M-R with
   respect to the psi for compacted fine-grained subgrade soils. The
   information of (i) the M-R values at optimum moisture content condition
   (M-ROPT) and saturation condition (M-RSAT), which are typically
   determined for use in pavement design practice; (ii) the psi values at
   optimum moisture content condition (psi(OPT)); and (iii) the soil-water
   characteristic curve (SWCC) is required for using this model. The
   proposed model is validated by providing comparisons between the
   measured and predicted M-R-psi relationships for 11 different compacted
   fine-grained subgrade soils that were tested following various protocols
   (a total of 16 sets of data, including 210 testing results). The
   proposed model was found to be suitable for predicting the variation of
   the MR with respect to the psi for all the subgrade soils using a
   single-valued model parameter zeta, which was found to be equal to 2.0.
   The proposed model is promising for use in practice, as it only requires
   conventional soil properties and alleviates the need for experimental
   determination of the M-R-psi relationships.}},

Title = {{A privacy preserving protocol for tracking participants in phase I
   clinical trials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Some phase 1 clinical trials offer strong financial
   incentives for healthy individuals to participate in their studies.
   There is evidence that some individuals enroll in multiple trials
   concurrently. This creates safety risks and introduces data quality
   problems into the trials. Our objective was to construct a privacy
   preserving protocol to track phase 1 participants to detect concurrent
   enrollment.
   Design: A protocol using secure probabilistic querying against a
   database of trial participants that allows for screening during
   telephone interviews and on-site enrollment was developed. The match
   variables consisted of demographic information.
   Measurement: The accuracy (sensitivity, precision, and negative
   predictive value) of the matching and its computational performance in
   seconds were measured under simulated environments. Accuracy was also
   compared to non-secure matching methods.
   Results: The protocol performance scales linearly with the database
   size. At the largest database size of 20,000 participants, a query takes
   under 20 s on a 64 cores machine. Sensitivity, precision, and negative
   predictive value of the queries were consistently at or above 0.9, and
   were very similar to non-secure versions of the protocol.
   Conclusion: The protocol provides a reasonable solution to the
   concurrent enrollment problems in phase 1 clinical trials, and is able
   to ensure that personal information about participants is kept secure.

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{In this work, aluminum and aluminum-alumina powder mixtures were used to
   produce pyramidal fin arrays on aluminum substrates using cold spray as
   an additive manufacturing process. Using aluminum-alumina mixtures
   instead of pure aluminum powder could be seen as a cost-effective
   measure, preventing nozzle clogging or the need to use expensive polymer
   nozzles that wear out rapidly during cold spray. The fin geometries that
   were produced were observed using a 3D digital microscope to determine
   the flow passages width and fins' geometric details. Heat transfer and
   pressure drop tests were carried out using different ranges of
   appropriate Reynolds numbers for the sought commercial application to
   compare each fin array and determine the effect of alumina content. It
   was found that the presence of alumina reduces the fins' performance
   when compared to pure aluminum fins but that they were still
   outperforming traditional fins. Numerical simulations were performed to
   model the fin arrays and were used to predict the pressure loss in the
   fin array and compare these results with experimental values. The
   numerical model opens up new avenues in predicting different applicable
   operating conditions and other possible fin shapes using the same fin
   composition, instead of performing costly and time-consuming

Title = {{Hydro-mechanical coupling effect on surficial layer stability of
   unsaturated expansive soil slopes}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{68-82}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Rain-induced surficial slope failures in expansive soils are frequently
   reported in the literature. These failures are primarily attributed to
   the shear strength reduction due to the loss of suction associated with
   the water infiltration. For this reason, slope stability is
   conventionally evaluated taking account of the hydraulic response of the
   soil to infiltration of water. The unsaturated expansive soil swells
   significantly upon wetting; the associated hydro-mechanical coupling
   effect on the slope stability of expansive soils is not considered in
   conventional geotechnical engineering practice. This paper aims to
   numerically evaluate the coupling effect or swelling on the hydraulic
   response as well as the stability of surficial layer of a typical
   expansive soil slope. Both hydro-mechanical (coupled) and hydraulic
   (uncoupled) responses of the slope to a low intensity prolonged rainfall
   are modeled using the commercial software SIGMA/W and SEEP/W,
   respectively. Subsequently, the infinite slope formulation is used to
   compute the factors of safety (FS) profiles extending both coupled
   (SIGMA/W) and uncoupled (SEEP/W) analysis. The results of the study
   presented in this paper show that coupled analysis (considering
   swelling) leads to different suction (negative pore water pressure
   (PWP)) and FS profiles within the surficial layer from those resulting
   from uncoupled analysis at the same elapsed time. The wetting fronts in
   the PWP profile from coupled analysis advance at a relatively faster
   rate in comparison to uncoupled analysis contributing to more critical
   FS values or failure conditions. The study highlights the coupled
   hydro-mechanical behavior of expansive soil has an adverse effect on the
   slope stability and hence should be taken into account in practice for
   estimating reliable values of FS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{REACTIVE \& FUNCTIONAL POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{80-87}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the potential of silver lactate (SL)-holloysite
   nanotube clay (HNTs) nano-filler embedded into the polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) polymer matrix as an antibacterial separator. Three
   different nanocomposite membranes were fabricated via phase inversion
   technique aimed to enhance the permeation flux and fouling resistance
   with complete bacterial rejection. HNT has been modified by
   N-beta-(aminoethyl)-gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxy silane (AEAPTMS) aiming
   for immobilization of SL on the surface HNT during dope preparation.
   Salmonella and Enterobacter aerogenes (E. aerogenes) were considered as
   two types of bacteria to be removed from contaminated water in this
   experimental work. Nanocomposite membranes were characterized and
   analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
   combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscope (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle,
   molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) and tensile strength. Potential silver
   ion loss was assessed by measuring the silver content in the coagulation
   bath and in the UF permeate using inductive-coupled plasma mass
   spectrometer (ICP-MS). Moreover, antibacterial effect of the membrane
   was examined in terms of removal of microorganisms by filtration, Log
   Reduction Value (LRV) and thickness of inhibition zone. From the
   experimental results, the prepared nanocomposite membranes have shown
   more than 99\% bacterial rejection, LRV of more than 3 and broad
   inhibition zones in the agar plate. In particular, the nanocomposite
   membrane consisting M-HNTs/SL/PVDF showed significant improvement in
   permeation flux and flux declination among all the tested membranes. It
   was also found that modification of HNTs resulted in reduction of silver
   leaching by uniform distributing of SL, which contributed to significant
   inhibition for both types of growth bacteria within 24 h of incubation.

Title = {{Getting close without touching: near-gathering for autonomous mobile
   robots}},
Journal = {{DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the Near-Gathering problem for a finite set of
   dimensionless, deterministic, asynchronous, anonymous, oblivious and
   autonomous mobile robots with limited visibility moving in the Euclidean
   plane in Look-Compute-Move cycles. In this problem, the robots have to
   get close enough to each other, so that every robot can see all the
   others, without touching (i.e., colliding with) any other robot. The
   importance of solving the Near-Gathering problem is that it makes it
   possible to overcome the restriction of having robots with limited
   visibility. Hence it allows to exploit all the studies (the majority,
   actually) done on this topic in the unlimited visibility setting.
   Indeed, after the robots get close enough to each other, they are able
   to see all the robots in the system, a scenario that is similar to the
   one where the robots have unlimited visibility. We present the first
   (deterministic) algorithm for the Near-Gathering problem, to the best of
   our knowledge, which allows a set of autonomous mobile robots to nearly
   gather within finite time without ever colliding. Our algorithm assumes
   some reasonable conditions on the input configuration (the
   Near-Gathering problem is easily seen to be unsolvable in general).
   Further, all the robots are assumed to have a compass (hence they agree
   on the ``North{''} direction), but they do not necessarily have the same
   handedness (hence they may disagree on the clockwise direction). We also
   show how the robots can detect termination, i.e., detect when the
   Near-Gathering problem has been solved. This is crucial when the robots
   have to perform a generic task after having nearly gathered. We show
   that termination detection can be obtained even if the total number of
   robots is unknown to the robots themselves (i.e., it is not a parameter
   of the algorithm), and robots have no way to explicitly communicate.}},

Abstract = {{Once cemented paste backfill (CPB) is poured into a mine stope, it is
   subjected to strong coupled thermal (T), hydraulic (H), mechanical (M)
   and chemical (C) processes. A laboratory investigation is performed to
   understand the THMC behavior of CPB at early ages. An experimental setup
   is developed to study the THMC behavior of CPB. The testing and
   monitoring are conducted in undrained conditions, with and without
   pressure application, and take into consideration two types of tailings
   (artificial and natural). The evolutions of the total pressure, pore
   pressure, suction, temperature and electrical conductivity are monitored
   for a period of 7 days. Also, the CPB samples are tested or analyzed
   with regards to their shear strength properties, hydraulic conductivity,
   thermal conductivity, and physical and microstructural characteristics
   at 1, 3 and 7 days. The obtained results show that the THMC properties
   of CPB are strongly coupled due to several mechanisms, such as curing
   stress, heat of hydration, self-desiccation and pore fluid chemistry.
   The results presented in this paper will provide a better understanding
   of the THMC behavior of CPB at early ages and thus contribute to the
   better designing of CPB structures.}},

Title = {{The Secrecy Capacity of Compound Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Strong secrecy capacity of compound wiretap channels is studied. The
   known lower bounds for the secrecy capacity of compound finite-state
   memoryless channels under discrete alphabets are extended to arbitrary
   uncertainty sets and continuous alphabets under the strong secrecy
   criterion. The conditions under which these bounds are tight are given.
   Under the saddle-point condition, the compound secrecy capacity is shown
   to be equal to that of the worst-case channel. Based on this, the
   compound Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output wiretap channel is
   studied under the spectral norm constraint and without the degradedness
   assumption. First, it is assumed that only the eavesdropper channel is
   unknown, but is known to have a bounded spectral norm (maximum channel
   gain). The compound secrecy capacity is established in a closed form and
   the optimal signaling is identified. The compound capacity equals the
   worst-case channel capacity and thus establishing the saddle-point
   property; the optimal signaling is Gaussian and on the eigenvectors of
   the legitimate channel and the worst-case eavesdropper is isotropic. The
   eigenmode power allocation somewhat resembles the standard water-filling
   but is not identical to it. More general uncertainty sets are considered
   and the existence of a maximum element is shown to be sufficient for a
   saddle-point to exist, so that signaling on the worst-case channel
   achieves the compound capacity of the whole class of channels. The case
   of rank-constrained eavesdropper is considered and the respective
   compound secrecy capacity is established. Subsequently, the case of
   additive uncertainty in the legitimate channel, in addition to the
   unknown eavesdropper channel, is studied. Its compound secrecy capacity
   and the optimal signaling are established in a closed form as well,
   revealing the same saddle-point property. When a saddle-point exists
   under strong secrecy, strong and weak secrecy compound capacities are
   equal.}},

Abstract = {{A single-notch microwave photonic filter with tunable frequency and
   tunable notch depth is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In the
   proposed filter, two phase-modulated optical signals at two different
   wavelengths are generated at a phase modulator. One phase-modulated
   signal is filtered by a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating with an
   ultra-narrow notch to remove the upper sideband. The other
   phase-modulated signal is filtered by a wideband optical bandpass filter
   to remove the lower sideband. Since the remaining lower and upper
   sidebands in the two optical signals are out of phase, the combination
   of the beat signals at a photodetector will lead to the cancelation of
   the detected microwave signals, to generate an ultranarrow notch. An
   experiment is performed. A single-notch microwave photonic filter with a
   3-dB bandwidth of similar to 180 MHz, a tunable frequency from 1.5 to

Abstract = {{Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/SiO2 flat sheet composite membranes were
   prepared for vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) by the phase inversion
   immersion precipitation process. The effect of blending superhydrophobic
   SiO2 nanoparticles into the PVDF dope solution was studied. The
   concentration of the nanoparticles in the dope solution was varied at
   different wt.\% (1, 2,4,6, 7, 8 and 10 wt.\%). The prepared membranes
   were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, water contact angle,
   porosity, liquid entry pressure of water, Fourier transformed infrared
   spectroscopy, and VMD at feed temperature of 27 degrees C. The
   nanoparticles enhanced the membrane performance through a reduction in
   the sponge-like layer thickness and an increase in surface pore size,
   leading to increased vapour flux with a maximum at 7 wt.\%. The salt
   rejection was greater than 99.98\% when a 35 g/L NaCl solution was used
   as feed. At this concentration, the smallest thickness of the
   sponge-like layer and largest macro-voids were also achieved. Beyond 7
   wt.\%, the sponge-like layer became predominant and the flux was
   reduced. With a vapour flux increase of up to 4 times (from 0.7 to 2.9
   kg/m(2) h) when compared to the neat membrane, this nanocomposite
   membrane could be of great potential in the desalination process through

   Implications for drinking water production}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of biofiltration
   to reduce the formation potential of disinfection byproducts (DBPs).
   Particularly, the work investigates the effect of the duration of the
   filter cycle on the formation potential of total trihalomethanes (TTHM)
   and five species of haloacetic acids (HAA5), dissolved oxygen (DO),
   organic carbon, nitrogen and total phosphorous concentrations along with
   biofilm coverage of the filter media and biomass viability of the
   attached cells. The study was conducted on a full-scale biologically
   active filter, with anthracite and sand media, at the Britannia water
   treatment plant (WTP), located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The formation
   potential of both TTHMs and HAA5s decreased due to biofiltration.
   However the lowest formation potentials for both groups of DBPs and or
   their precursors were observed immediately following a backwash event.
   Hence, the highest percent removal of DBPs was observed during the early
   stages of the biofiltration cycle, which suggests that a higher
   frequency of backwashing will reduce the formation of DBPs. Variable
   pressure scanning electron microscopy (VPSEM) analysis shows that
   biofilm coverage of anthracite and sand media increases as the
   filtration cycle progressed, while biomass viability analysis
   demonstrates that the percentage of cells attached to the anthracite and
   sand media also increases as the filtration cycle progresses. These
   results suggest that the development and growth of biofilm on the
   filters increases the DPB formation potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Bearing fault diagnosis under unknown variable speed via gear noise
   cancellation and rotational order sideband identification}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{62-63}},
Pages = {{30-53}},

Abstract = {{The interfering vibration signals of a gearbox often represent a
   challenging issue in rolling bearing fault detection and diagnosis,
   particularly under unknown variable rotational speed conditions. Though
   some methods have been proposed to remove the gearbox interfering
   signals based on their discrete frequency nature, such methods may not
   work well under unknown variable speed conditions. As such, we propose a
   new approach to address this issue. The new approach consists of three
   main steps: (a) adaptive gear interference removal, (b) fault
   characteristic order (FCO) based fault detection, and (c)
   rotational-order-sideband (ROS) based fault type identification. For
   gear interference removal, an enhanced adaptive noise cancellation (ANC)
   algorithm has been developed in this study. The new ANC algorithm does
   not require an additional accelerometer to provide reference input.
   Instead, the reference signal is adaptively constructed from signal
   maxima and instantaneous dominant meshing multiple (IDMM) trend. Key ANC
   parameters such as filter length and step size have also been tailored
   to suit the variable speed conditions, The main advantage of using ROS
   for fault type diagnosis is that it is insusceptible to confusion caused
   by the co-existence of bearing and gear rotational frequency peaks in
   the identification of the bearing fault characteristic frequency in the
   FCO sub-order region. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been
   demonstrated using both simulation and experimental data. Our
   experimental study also indicates that the proposed method is applicable
   regardless whether the bearing and gear rotational speeds are
   proportional to each other or not. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The vibration signal of planetary gearboxes exhibits the characteristics
   of both amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM), and
   thus has a complex sideband structure. Time-varying speed and/or load
   will result in time variant characteristic frequency components. Since
   the modulating frequency is related to the gear fault characteristic
   frequency, the AM and FM parts each alone contains the information of
   the gear fault. We propose a time-frequency amplitude and frequency
   demodulation analysis metbhod to avoid the complex time-variant sideband
   analysis, and thereby identify the time-variant gear fault
   characteristic frequency. We enhance the time-frequency analysis via
   iterative generalized demodulation (IGD). The time-varying amplitude and
   frequency demodulated spectra have fine time-frequency resolution and
   are free of cross term interferences. They do not involve complex
   time-variant sidebands, thus considerably facilitating fault diagnosis
   of planetary gearboxes under nonstationary conditions. The method is
   validated using both numerically simulated data and experimental
   signals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The plasmonic gain of a top-pumped active symmetric metal slab waveguide
   is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The structure consists
   of a thin Ag film cladded above and below by gain media (IR140-doped
   poly (methyl methacrylate)), and operating with long-range surface
   plasmon polaritons (LRSPPs) at near-infrared wavelengths. We consider
   the spatial distribution of the pump intensity and the position
   dependence of the dipole lifetime within the claddings when computing
   the LRSPP gain. We find that the bottom cladding provides significant
   gain to the LRSPP, despite the low pump transmittance through the Ag
   film, as long as the pump intensity is strong enough to saturate the
   gain material (similar to 4MW/cm(2)). In this situation, the LRSPP gain
   is doubled compared to the case where the top cladding only is active.
   The LRSPP gain was measured in a fabricated structure using the variable
   stripe length method, yielding g(mod) = 16.7 cm(-1) at a pump intensity
   of similar to 4MW/cm(2). The measured LRSPP gain agrees very well with
   the computed value, implying that the bottom cladding provides
   significant gain to the mode. Active plasmonic devices based on the
   symmetric dielectric-metal-dielectric structure can be significantly
   more efficient by using gain layers as both the top and bottom
   claddings. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique to generate a microwave vector signal based on a
   bidirectional use of a polarization modulator (PolM) and a phase
   modulator (PM) in a Sagnac loop is proposed and experimentally
   demonstrated. The I/Q data streams of a vector signal are mixed with a
   microwave carrier and then applied to the PolM and the PM, respectively.
   A microwave vector signal is generated by combining two microwave
   signals with one obtained by beating the optical carrier and the +1st
   order sideband of a phase-modulated signal and the other obtained by
   beating the optical carrier and the +1st order sideband of an
   intensity-modulated signal. A quadrature phase is introduced due to the
   inherent pi/2 phase shift between the optical carrier and the + 1st
   order sideband of the phase-modulated signal. The generation of a 4.5
   GHz microwave signal at 625 Msym/s with quadrature phase-shift-keying
   (QPSK) modulation and the transmission of the signal over a 25-km
   single-mode fiber are evaluated. An error-free transmission is achieved
   at a received optical power of 6 dBm. By incorporating I/Q imbalance
   compensation, an error-free transmission is achieved at a lower received

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study examining the axial load
   performance of ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHPFRC)
   columns. As part of the experimental program six large-scale columns

   transverse reinforcement detailing on column performance. The results
   demonstrate that the provision of closely-spaced and well-detailed
   transverse reinforcement allows for the development of excellent

   configuration of transverse reinforcement are important factors
   affecting the axial strength and toughness of UHPFRC columns. The
   analytical investigation examines the suitability of using existing
   high-strength concrete and fiber reinforced concrete confinement models
   to predict the axial response of the columns tested in this research

Abstract = {{Membranes were prepared from three poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) of

   performance testing, the membrane prepared from the intermediate
   molecular weight of Kynar (R) MG 15 polymer showed the highest VMD flux
   (325 g/m(2) h) at the feed temperature of 27 degrees C and the lowest
   LEPw (622 kPa) due to the largest pore size (49.8 nm) observed among all

   Bragg stack}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Fano interference is predicted in a structure consisting of a periodic
   array of uncoupled gold nano-disks (AuNDs) supported by a Bragg stack.
   The phenomenon occurs due to resonant interference between the
   reflection spectrum of the Bragg stack and localized surface plasmon
   resonances (LSPRs) on the AuNDs. Fitting the computational results to
   the Fano lineshape formula yields the Fano parameters of the resonances
   including their linewidth. One of the most important advantages of the
   structure is that the linewidth of the Fano resonances (similar to 9 nm)
   is much narrower than the bandwidth of the LSPR nano-disks (similar to
   80 nm) and the reflection bandwidth of the Bragg stack on which the
   disks are supported (similar to 100 nm). The narrow Fano linewidth and
   the ease with which they can be interrogated using perpendicularly
   incident light makes the structure attractive for biosensing
   applications. The bulk sensitivities and figure of merit of Fano
   resonances in a proposed design are 44 nm/RIU (redshift) and -52 nm/RIU
   (blueshift), and similar to 4 RIU-1, respectively. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{This paper presents a coupled two-dimensional model that can produce a
   more stable numerical simulation of rapid bed evolution than the
   conventional decoupled model. To solve the coupled bed-load sediment
   transport terms using a Godunov-type central-upwind method, a novel
   scheme to estimate the bed-load fluxes which can produce more accurate
   results than the previously reported coupled model is proposed using a
   pair of local wave speeds different from those used for the flow. The
   two-dimensional shallow water equations are used to solve the flow
   velocities and water depth. The bed level is solved by an Exner-based
   equation containing bed-load sediment transport as numerical flux terms
   and sediment entrainment and deposition as source terms. Analytical
   formulas to compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are
   developed. The linear reconstruction of variables with a
   multi-dimensional slope limiter, and the second-order Runge-Kutta scheme
   are employed to achieve higher accuracy in space and time. For the case
   of rapid bed-erosion, the accuracy and stability of the proposed coupled
   model are verified by several numerical tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores use of acoustic Doppler current profiler backscatter
   amplitude as a surrogate for total suspended solids concentration. Total
   suspended solids concentration and acoustic Doppler current profiler
   data were collected at the Lower Nelson River and Red River in Manitoba,
   Canada, during both ice-covered and open water periods such that
   acoustic Doppler current profiler backscatter data could be calibrated
   to predict TSS concentrations. Several novel calibration schemes were
   evaluated, including multiple linear regression models that involved
   flow parameters determined from acoustic Doppler current profiler data
   in addition to acoustic backscatter intensity. The inclusion of the
   average of the friction velocities of the channel bed and ice cover,
   calculated from time-averaged velocity data, in a multiple linear
   regression was found to improve model performance in both studied rivers
   and during both ice-covered and open water periods.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc and lead pollution are public environmental issues that have
   attracted lots of attention for a long time. Landfill leachate contains
   heavy metals, such as Zn(II) and Pb(II), which are usually related to
   the pollution of groundwater, especially in developing countries.
   Bentonite has been proven to be effective in enhancing the membrane
   property of clay, by which landfill liners can have better barrier
   performance towards the migration of contaminants. In this study, 5\%
   sodium bentonite amended with locally available Fukakusa clay was
   utilized to evaluate the membrane behavior towards the heavy metals zinc
   and lead. The chemico-osmotic efficiency coefficient,., was obtained
   through Zn(II) and Pb(II) solutions with different concentrations of
   0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 50 mM. According to the results, omega continually
   decreased as the Zn(II) and Pb(II) concentrations increased, which is
   consistent with the Gouy-Chapman theory. Compared to normal inorganic
   ions, the membrane behavior towards heavy metal ions was lower. The
   migration of heavy metal ions was not observed based on experimental
   results, which can be attributed to the adsorption or ion exchange
   reaction. The mechanisms of the membrane performance change were
   discussed with the assistance of XRD patterns, free swelling results,
   XRF results, and SEM images.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled tile drainage (CTD) regulates water and nutrient export from
   tile drainage systems. Observations of the effects of CTD imposed en
   masse at watershed scales are needed to determine the effect on
   downstream receptors. A paired-watershed approach was used to evaluate
   the effect of field-to-field CTD at the watershed scale on fluxes and
   flow-weighted mean concentrations (FWMCs) of N and P during multiple
   growing seasons. One watershed (467-ha catchment area) was under CTD
   management (treatment {[}CTD] watershed); the other (250-ha catchment
   area) had freely draining or uncontrolled tile drainage (UCTD)
   (reference {[}UCTD] watershed). The paired agricultural watersheds are
   located in eastern Ontario, Canada. Analysis of covariance and paired t
   tests were used to assess daily fluxes and FWMCs during a calibration
   period when CTD intervention on the treatment watershed was minimal
   (2005-2006, when only 4-10\% of the tile-drained area was under CTD) and
   a treatment period when the treatment (CTD) watershed had prolific CTD
   intervention (2007-2011 when 82\% of tile drained fields were
   controlled, occupying >70\% of catchment area). Significant linear
   regression slope changes assessed using ANCOVA (p <= 0.1) for daily
   fluxes from upstream and downstream monitoring sites pooled by
   calibration and treatment period were -0.06 and -0.20 (stream water)
   (negative values represent flux declines in CTD watershed), -0.59 and
   -0.77 (NH4+-N), -0.14 and -0.15 (NO3--N), -1.77 and -2.10 (dissolved
   reactive P), and -0.28 and 0.45 (total P). Total P results for one site
   comparison contrasted with other findings likely due to unknown
   in-stream processes affecting total P loading, not efficacy of CTD. The
   FWMC results were mixed and inconclusive but suggest physical abatement
   by CTD is the means by which nutrient fluxes are predominantly reduced
   at these scales. Overall, our study results indicate that CTD is an
   effective practice for reducing watershed scale fluxes of stream water,
   N, and P during the growing season.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 90s, several studies were conducted to evaluate the
   predictability of the Sahelian rainy season and propose seasonal
   rainfall forecasts to help stakeholders to take the adequate decisions
   to adapt with the predicted situation. Unfortunately, two decades later,
   the forecasting skills remains low and forecasts have a limited value
   for decision making while the population is still suffering from
   rainfall interannual variability: this shows the limit of commonly used
   predictors and forecast approaches for this region. Thus, this paper
   developed and tested new predictors and new approaches to predict the
   upcoming seasonal rainfall amount over the Sirba watershed. Predictors
   selected through a linear correlation analysis were further processed
   using combined linear methods to identify those having high predictive
   power. Seasonal rainfall was forecasted using a set of linear and
   non-linear models. An average lag time up to eight months was obtained
   for all models. It is found that the combined linear methods performed
   better than non-linear, possibly because non-linear models require
   larger and better datasets for calibration. The R-2, Nash and Hit rate
   score are respectively 0.53, 0.52, and 68\% for the combined linear
   approach; and 0.46, 0.45, 61\% for non-linear principal component

Abstract = {{As a leading framework for processing and analyzing big data, MapReduce
   is leveraged by many enterprises to parallelize their data processing on
   distributed computing systems. Unfortunately, the all-to-all data
   forwarding from map tasks to reduce tasks in the traditional MapReduce
   framework would generate a large amount of network traffic. The fact
   that the intermediate data generated by map tasks can be combined with
   significant traffic reduction in many applications motivates us to
   propose a data aggregation scheme for MapReduce jobs in cloud.
   Specifically, we design an aggregation architecture under the existing
   MapReduce framework with the objective of minimizing the data traffic
   during the shuffle phase, in which aggregators can reside anywhere in
   the cloud. Some experimental results also show that our proposal
   outperforms existing work by reducing the network traffic significantly.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study two tightly coupled issues, space-crossing
   community detection and its influence on data forwarding in mobile
   social networks (MSNs). We propose a communication framework containing
   the hybrid underlying network with access point (AP) support for data
   forwarding and the base stations for managing most of control traffic.
   The concept of physical proximity community can be extended to be one
   across the geographical space, because APs can facilitate the
   communication among long-distance nodes. Space-crossing communities are
   obtained by merging some pairs of physical proximity communities. Based
   on the space-crossing community, we define two cases of node local
   activity and use them as the input of inner product similarity
   measurement. We design a novel data forwarding algorithm Social
   Attraction and Infrastructure Support (SAIS), which applies similarity
   attraction to route to neighbor more similar to destination, and
   infrastructure support phase to route the message to other APs within
   common connected components. We evaluate our SAIS algorithm on real-life
   datasets from MIT Reality Mining and University of Illinois Movement
   (UIM). Results show that space-crossing community plays a positive role
   in data forwarding in MSNs. Based on this new type of community, SAIS
   achieves a better performance than existing popular social
   community-based data forwarding algorithms in practice, including
   Simbet, Bubble Rap and Nguyen's Routing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the near-bed maximal floc size and of the response of a
   population of flocs to the fluctuations of the turbulence field, the
   suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and salinity was observed in mid
   reaches of a shallow tidal channel through a four-day campaign during
   the flow reversal period. Flocculation process was found to be
   controlled predominantly by the turbulent motion and the SSC. Maximum
   floc size was observed through the first half of flooding tide which is
   normally associated with the resupension of the loosely settled
   sediments (SSC > 4 FTU) and the presence of relatively intense shear
   stresses (<10 cm(2)/s(2)). Turbulent shear over lengths governed by
   Kolmogorov length scale lambda(k) escalated the maximum floc size when
   lambda(k) < 500 mu m. Salinity did not appear to necessarily enhance
   flocculation. Using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) to
   simultaneously measure the turbulent diffusivities and SSC at 12 points
   along the estuary provided non-intrusive approach to measure the
   settling velocity of cohesive sediments in the field. Two distinct
   settling behaviors were distinguished and were mainly attributed to the
   channel morphology and its influence on inducing upward velocity
   fluctuations. (C) 2014 International Association for Hydro-environment

Abstract = {{A facile one-pot approach for rapid synthesis of silver and gold
   nanoparticles (Ag NPs and Au NPs) with narrow size distribution and good
   stability was described by reducing silver nitrate and chloroauric acid

   and stabilizing agent for synthesis of NPs. The as-synthesized Ag NPs
   and Au NPs were characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The
   Ag NPs and Au NPs exhibited an absorption maxima at 404 and 547 nm
   respectively. TEM images showed NPs in the range of 8-28 nm. The
   crystallinity of the NPs was measured by XRD analysis. Furthermore, the
   as-prepared Ag NPs revealed colorimetric sensor property for detection
   of Cu2+ ions based on changes in absorbance resulting from metal
   ion-induced aggregation of NPs or direct deposition of metal ions onto
   NPs. The as-prepared Au NPs exhibited a notable catalytic activity
   toward the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence
   of NaBH4. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of downward air-water flow in vertical 32.5 mm feeder
   tubes connected to a horizontal 203 mm cylindrical header was studied
   experimentally in a modular header facility operating at
   near-atmospheric pressure. Several experimental configurations with
   different combinations of two or four feeders were used. A large
   database of mass flow rate measurements was compiled using a flow rate
   measurement method based on machine learning. The collected data allowed
   the effects of inlet flow rates and feeder location on the gas and
   liquid flow distribution to be studied. The feeder mass flow rates were
   also qualitatively correlated to the observed flow patterns in the
   header, including the inlet gas-liquid jet, the free surface level and
   the cross-flow velocity over the feeders. Three potential approaches for
   correlating the wall pressures measured at different locations to the
   flow rate distribution were tested. Although under certain conditions a
   measurable pressure was found to be correlated with the flow
   distribution, it was concluded that none of these methods was capable of
   estimating consistently and accurately the flow distribution in a
   header-feeder system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Robust Image Chroma-Keying: A Quadmap Approach Based on Global Sampling

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BROADCASTING}},

Abstract = {{Chroma-keying is a technique used to replace solid-colored background of
   images or video frames. This technique is widely used in TV
   broadcasting, film production, augmented reality, and virtual
   environment. This paper proposes a new chroma-keying method, which can
   automatically remove the background color in an image and accurately
   segment the foreground objects along with their transparency property.
   Compared to conventional chroma-keying methods based on color
   clustering, color difference, or thresholding, the proposed method
   analyzes the color statistics and color confidence of the image in
   global range. By analyzing image color statistics, local lightness
   variation, and experience from human visual perception in HSV color
   space, a segmentation map called quadmap is automatically generated to
   segment the image into four types of regions: 1) foreground; 2)
   background; 3) transparent; and 4) reflective regions. By using quadmap,
   the proposed chroma-keying system can differentiate between transparent
   and reflective regions. This has always been a challenging problem in
   conventional chroma-keying or a matting systems. This improvement
   generates more reliable foreground colors in reflective regions. As a
   result, there can be less constrains for foreground scene used in
   TV-broadcasting or film making. The procedures of the proposed method
   consist of the following five steps: 1) background region detection
   based on color statistics and local lightness variation; 2) absolute
   foreground region detection based on the knowledge of background color
   and predefined thresholds in Hue channel of HSV color space; 3)
   reflective region detection based on experience from human visual
   system; 4) background color propagation based on Laplacian equation; and
   5) transparency value and foreground color estimation based on global
   sampling and color confidence.}},

Abstract = {{Using a 20-run central composite design, standard Basal Salt Media (BSM)

   pastoris in bioreactor-based fed-batch cultivations using glucose as the

   at the end of 48-hour runs was modeled as a function of the medium
   composition, and this model was successfully validated. Using
   Inductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy (ICP), residual elements were
   quantified in the cultivation broth at the end of each run to confirm
   that differences in final cell density and enzyme activity were not due
   to nutrient depletion, but indeed associated with the variations in
   medium composition. The optimized media contains significantly lower
   concentration of the potassium and magnesium sources (28.7 g/l KH2PO4
   and 4.8 g/l MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O respectively), as well as a reduced
   concentration of trace salts, and based on experimental results,

Abstract = {{Objectives: We sought to create a model of aortic insufficiency in a
   left heart simulator combined with 3-dimensional echocardiography and
   finite element modeling of the aortic valve. We examined the effects of
   aortic root geometry alteration on aortic insufficiency.
   Methods: Porcine aortic roots were analyzed on a left heart simulator
   before (control, n = 8) and after intervention (n = 8). Intervention
   entailed 3 vertical incisions at the sinotubular junction with
   diamond-shaped patches incorporated into the defects to increase the
   sinotubular junction diameter. Hemodynamic parameters were assessed,
   including regurgitant volume and fraction. Video and echocardiography
   images evaluated aortic valve function, coaptation surface area, aortic
   insufficiency, and effective regurgitant orifice area. Finite element
   modeling corroborated relationships between root geometry and aortic
   insufficiency, and examined cusp stress.
   Results: The intervention resulted in a sinotubular junction diameter
   increase of 55\% +/- 4\%. The sinotubular junction to ventriculo-aortic
   junction diameter ratio was significantly higher in the intervention
   group (1.89 +/- 0.16 vs 1.47 +/- 0.04, P = .02). Increased sinotubular
   junction diameter resulted in aortic insufficiency assessed by
   regurgitant volume (28 +/- 7 mL vs 5 +/- 2 mL, P = 3.004), regurgitant
   fraction (36\% +/- 5\% vs 7\% +/- 1\%, P < . 001), and effective
   regurgitant orifice (15 +/- 5 mm 2 vs 0 mm(2), P = .016). Intervention
   coaptation surface area was smaller (1.03 +/- 0.11 cm(2) vs 1.80 +/-
   0.08 cm(2), P < .001). There was a linear correlation between increased
   sinotubular junction/ventriculo-aortic junction ratio and regurgitant
   fraction (R-2 = 0.65, P = .003). The finite element modeling
   demonstrated a similar relationship between increasing sinotubular
   junction diameter and aortic insufficiency severity, and between
   end-diastolic cusp stresses and sinotubular junction diameters (R-2 =
   0.98, P < .001).
   Conclusions: In this model, increasing sinotubular junction diameter is
   linearly related to reduced coaptation surface area and increasing
   aortic insufficiency severity. This model provides new insights into
   aortic insufficiency mechanisms and may be used to evaluate novel
   interventions for aortic valve repair.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating electrochemistry with photocatalytic technology,
   photoelectrocatalysis has been identified as a superior candidate to
   debottleneck photocatalytic processes. Photoelectrocatalysis involves a
   photocatalytic system to which an external positive bias is applied,
   which can significantly increase the rates of photocatalytic reactions
   by driving the photo-generated electron-hole pairs in opposite
   directions, reducing their recombination rates. The design of a
   cost-efficient photoelectrocatalytic reactor plays a critical role in
   the ultimate acceptance of this promising technology in industry for
   environmental remediation as well as other applications. In this study,
   photoelectrocatalysis and associated novel reactor designs reported in
   recent years are reviewed and discussed. Some of the topics which are
   discussed in this study include various reactor configurations with
   different illumination sources, photocatalyst utilization modes, and
   electrodes as well as composite systems incorporating solar cells in
   addition to microbial and photocatalytic fuel cells. Future efforts are
   suggested to push the industrial application of photoelectrocatalysis

Title = {{Response of SFRC Columns under Blast Loads}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Research has shown that the addition of steel fibers to concrete results
   in improved postcracking tensile capacity leading to enhanced toughness,
   ductility, and damage tolerance. These performance enhancements make
   steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) an ideal material for use in the
   blast-resistant design of structures. Research in the literature is
   conflicting on the performance of SFRC at high strain rates. There is
   also very limited research on the performance of SFRC structural
   components under blast loads. This paper presents the results of a
   research program investigating the blast performance of reinforced
   concrete and steel fiber-reinforced concrete columns. In the
   experimental program half-scale columns were constructed and exposed to
   different simulated blast pressure-impulse combinations using the
   state-of-the art shock-tube testing facility at the University of
   Ottawa. The test parameters included transverse reinforcement spacing
   (nonseismic and seismic detailing) as well as steel fiber content (0 to
   1.5\% by volume of concrete). The results show that SFRC improves the
   blast performance of columns in terms of maximum and residual
   displacements as well as damage tolerance and elimination of secondary
   blast fragments. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the use of
   seismic detailing improves blast performance. Finally, the paper
   examines the suitability of using single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF)
   analysis to predict the blast response of the SFRC columns tested in the
   research program. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{The influence of grain size on the velocity and sediment concentration
   profiles and depositional record of turbidity currents}},
Journal = {{GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Cross-stratification formed by migrating dunes is ubiquitous in fluvial
   channel deposits, yet cross-stratification, specifically formed by
   dunes, is comparatively uncommon in deep-marine channel deposits
   subjected to similarly unidirectional flows, the reasons for which is
   the subject of much debate. In part, this is related to the difficulty
   associated with acquiring high-resolution data sets; natural turbidity
   currents are highly destructive, whereas physical models are hampered by
   the shortcomings of conventional laboratory instrumentation.
   Consequently the internal structure of turbidity currents is poorly
   understood, thus hindering the ability to identify the linkages between
   flow properties and depositional characteristics. In this study we use a
   medical-grade computed tomography scanner coupled with a
   three-dimensional ultrasonic Doppler velocity profiler to characterize
   the flow field and depositional morphology across a range of grain sizes
   (d(50): 70-330 mu m) and sediment concentrations (5\%-17.5\% by mass).
   Results show that the development of angular bedforms is suppressed in
   all flows with particle concentrations greater than 9.5\% by mass, but
   notably also in all flows with particles <230 mu m and sediment
   concentrations down to 5\%, the lowest slurry densities used in these
   experiments, by mass. This suggests a first-order control on the
   response of the bed by the makeup of the overriding current. More
   fundamentally, we propose that grain size controls the character of
   near-bed density stratification, which is a requisite condition to
   generate the hydrodynamic instabilities that create the initial bed
   defects, which then lead to the development of angular bedforms like
   ripples and dunes.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate noninvasive estimation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) is of
   great importance in the evaluation of circulatory function and prognosis
   of some cardiovascular diseases. This paper proposes a novel
   oscillometric MAP estimation method based on the dependence of pulse
   transit time (PTT) on cuff pressure (CP). The PTT computed as the time
   interval between the electrocardiogram (ECG) R-peaks and the maximum
   slope points on the oscillometric pulses is mathematically modeled by
   considering the cuff-arm-artery system and the blood flow dynamics. It
   is then analytically shown that MAP can be approximated as the CP at
   which the PTT is maximum. Based on our theoretical findings, a new
   method of MAP estimation from simultaneous ECG and oscillometric blood
   pressure measurements is proposed. Our proposed method is validated with
   a pilot study in which 150 recordings from 10 subjects are analyzed. The
   reference MAP is computed from the systolic and diastolic pressures
   measured by the Food and Drug Administrationapproved Omron HEM-7901T
   monitor using three different formulas given in the literature. The
   performance of our proposed method is compared with the maximum
   amplitude and zero-crossing methods in terms of mean error (ME), mean
   absolute error, and standard deviation of error (SDE). It is found that
   our proposed method achieves improvements of more than 20\% in SDE
   compared with the maximum amplitude method and more than 50\% in ME
   compared with the zero-crossing method.}},

   applied to enable the clustering of any number of transducers.
   Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed to dynamically detect added and
   removed transducers from a node. Lastly, an XML based protocol is
   devised to allow nodes to communicate a description of their layout,
   measured data and control information. To verify the proposed framework,
   multiple reconfigurable wireless nodes are used to monitor the dynamic
   condition of a multiple rooms during a period of 24 hours in order to
   emulate a smart home scenario.}},

Abstract = {{In order to adapt to a continuously changing environment, organizations
   are evolving their business objectives, processes, and operations
   through various strategic initiatives. In this context, it is imperative
   for organizations to continuously monitor their performance and adjust
   when there is a need or an opportunity to do so. The cluster of
   technologies that delivers this monitoring capability is called business
   intelligence (BI), and over the years it has come to play a central role
   in business operations and governance. Unfortunately, there is a huge
   cognitive gap between a requirements view of a strategic initiative
   articulated in terms of business goals, processes, and performance on
   one hand, and an implementation view of BI monitoring articulated in
   terms of databases, networks, and computational processing. In this
   paper, we present a model-based performance management framework for
   managing strategic initiatives across their complete lifecycle of
   analysis, modeling, implementation, and evaluation to bridge this
   cognitive gap. We demonstrate its usefulness through a case study at a
   major teaching hospital, which is implementing a strategic initiative to
   reduce antibiotic-resistant infections.}},

Abstract = {{Photocatalysis is a growing area of study for a clean and renewable
   energy source, particularly the degradation of organics in wastewater
   and polluted air. Researchers have studied the combination of various
   semiconductors to create photocatalysts with improved activities, but
   little has been reported in selecting semiconductors based on their
   extrinsic type-namely n-type or p-type. In this study, a BiOBr
   (P-type)-(BiWO6)-W-2 (n-type) heterojunction semiconductor was
   synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The new materials were
   characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and diffuse-reflection spectroscopy
   (DRS). Their photocatalytic activities were examined by measuring the
   degradation rate of Rhodamine B with photocatalysts synthesized using
   various atomic ratios of BiOBr and Bi2WO6 (1:4,1:1, and 4:1). These new
   composites' ability to effectively degrade dye pollutants shed light on
   the benefits of using heterojunction photocatalysts, and also on the
   importance of considering the semiconductor type when forming composite

Abstract = {{In this work, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanopartides/halloysite nanotube
   (HNT) nanocomposites synthesized via one-step solvothermal method were
   used as nanofillers in the preparation of thin film nanocomposite (TFN)
   membranes for forward osmosis (FO) application. With respect to
   separation performance, it was reported that the TFN membrane
   incorporated with 0.05\%(w/v) TiO2/HNTs (denoted as TEN0.05) exhibited
   the best performance due to its high water permeability and low reverse
   solute flux when tested using 10 mM NaCl feed solution and 2.0 M NaCl
   draw solution under two different membrane configurations. Moreover,
   compared to control membrane, the fabricated TEN0.05 membrane showed
   significantly better antifouling affinity against bovine serum albumin
   (BSA) as well as complete recovery of water flux after a simple water
   cleaning process. The results revealed that fouling in the TEN0.05
   membrane is fully reversible. Overall, it can be concluded that the
   unique tubular structure of HNTs coupled with the excellent anti-fouling
   features of TiO2 have madeTiO(2)/HNTs a reliable material with a bright
   perspective in improving the antifouling affinity of conventional thin
   film composite membranes for FO applications. To the best of the

   that these vertices and edges can be added to as points and straight
   line segments, respectively,to obtain k plane straight-line drawings
   isomorphic to the augmentation of G. We show that adding
   Theta(nr(1-1/k)) edges and vertices to G is always sufficient and
   sometimes necessary to achieve this goal. The upper bound holds for all

   algorithm whose running time is O(nr(1-1/k)) for k = O(1) and whose
   running time is O(kn(2)) for general values of k. The lower bound holds
   for all r is an element of \{2,..., n/4\} and k >= 2.}},

Abstract = {{This review focuses on the development of polyamide (PA) thin film
   nanocomposite (TPN) membranes for various aqueous media-based separation
   processes such as nanofiltration, reverse osmosis and forward osmosis
   since the concept of TFN was introduced in year 2007. Although the total
   number of published TFN articles falls far short of the articles of the
   well-known thin film composite (TFC) membranes, its growth rate is
   significant, particularly since 2012. Generally, by incorporating an
   appropriate amount of nanofiller into a thin selective PA layer of a
   composite membrane, one could produce TFN membranes with enhanced
   separation characteristics as compared to the conventional TFC membrane.
   For certain cases, the resulting TFN membranes demonstrate not only
   excellent antifouling resistance and/or greater antibacterial effect,
   but also possibly overcome the trade-off effect between water
   permeability and solute selectivity. Furthermore, this review attempts
   to give the readers insights into the difficulties of incorporating
   inorganic nanornaterials into the organic PA layer whose thickness
   usually falls in a range of several-hundred nanometers. It is also
   intended to show new possible approaches to overcome these challenges in
   TFN membrane fabrication. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have experimentally demonstrated broadband tuneable four-wave mixing
   in AlGaAs nanowires with the widths ranging between 400 and 650 nm and
   lengths from 0 to 2 mm. We performed a detailed experimental study of
   the parameters influencing the FWM performance in these devices
   (experimental conditions and nanowire dimensions). The maximum
   signal-to-idler conversion range was 100 nm, limited by the tuning range
   of the pump source. The maximum conversion efficiency, defined as the
   ratio of the output idler power to the output signal power, was -38 dB.
   In support of our explanation of the experimentally observed trends, we
   present modal analysis and group velocity dispersion numerical analysis.

Abstract = {{Hemodialysis is one of the most commonly used treatments for patients
   suffering from irrecoverable kidney damage. In our present work, we
   investigate poly(ether imide) (PEI) mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) as a
   potential candidate for hemodialysis applications due to their efficient
   clearance and high biocompatibility. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized
   by the modified Hummers' method and was then confirmed by X-ray
   diffraction spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman
   spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The
   GO-polyvinylpyrrolidone nanocomposite incorporated PEI MMMs were
   fabricated by a semiautomatic casting unit using the nonsolvent induced
   phase separation technique. The effect of the nanocomposite loading
   ratio was evaluated by water content, ultrafiltration rate, and
   porosity, which were all found to increase as the nanocomposite content
   increased. Cross-sectional and top surface morphology was visualized
   using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The
   hydrophilicity of these membranes was in consonance with contact angle
   values. These MMMs demonstrated an increase in biocompatibility: reduced
   protein adsorption, suppressed platelet adhesion, and lower complement
   activation. Furthermore, the prolonged blood clotting time is an
   indication of the heparin mimic anticoagulant properties of these
   membranes. The cytocompatibility results by 3-(4,
   5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay and live
   cell/dead cell staining indicated that there was an increase in cell
   viability. The membranes with 0.1 wt \% GO showed an excellent clearance
   of the model uremic toxins, namely urea, vitamin B-12, and cytochrome-c
   in vitro. The diffusive permeability of these membranes could be
   comparable to the existing commercial hemodialysis membranes. Thus, it
   can be concluded that these membranes containing a composite of both
   functional nanosheets and bioactive polymers have a tremendous potential
   to be utilized commercially in hemodialysis modules if shown successful
   in further in vivo studies with an animal model.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, flat sheet polysulfone (PSf)-based membranes modified with
   inorganic hydrous aluminum oxide (HAO) nanoparticles were used as
   antifouling ultrafiltration membranes for removing oil molecules from
   oily solution. SEM, AFM and FTIR analyses were performed on the
   fabricated membranes to study the effect of HAO nanoparticles loading on
   the membrane properties. The membrane hydrophilicity and separation
   performance were determined through contact angle measurement and
   cross-flow ultrafiltration of oily solution, respectively. Results
   showed that the hydrophilicity of HAO-modified membrane was increased
   remarkably upon addition of the highest weight ratio of HAO
   nanoparticles to PSf (i.e. 2:1), which led to a significant rise in
   permeate flux, achieving 1194 L/m(2) h bar in comparison to 151 L/m(2) h
   bar shown by the plain PSf membrane. With respect to oil removal
   efficiency, the modified membrane was found to exhibit almost complete
   elimination of oil molecules with flux recovery ratio of around 67\%
   after a simple water washing process. The promising results achieved by
   the modified PSf membrane could be mainly due to the presence of
   hydroxyl functional groups on the membrane surface upon addition of
   highly hydrophilic HAO nanoparticles, which improved not only membrane
   water permeability but also its antifouling ability. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Pages = {{2676-2682}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Stem cell differentiation is largely guided by master
   transcriptional regulators, but it also depends on the expression of
   other types of genes, such as cell cycle genes, signaling genes,
   metabolic genes, trafficking genes, etc. Traditional approaches to
   understanding gene expression patterns across multiple conditions, such
   as principal components analysis or K-means clustering, can group cell
   types based on gene expression, but they do so without knowledge of the
   differentiation hierarchy. Hierarchical clustering can organize cell
   types into a tree, but in general this tree is different from the
   differentiation hierarchy itself.
   Methods: Given the differentiation hierarchy and gene expression data at
   each node, we construct a weighted Euclidean distance metric such that
   the minimum spanning tree with respect to that metric is precisely the
   given differentiation hierarchy. We provide a set of linear constraints
   that are provably sufficient for the desired construction and a linear
   programming approach to identify sparse sets of weights, effectively
   identifying genes that are most relevant for discriminating different
   parts of the tree.
   Results: We apply our method to microarray gene expression data
   describing 38 cell types in the hematopoiesis hierarchy, constructing a
   weighted Euclidean metric that uses just 175 genes. However, we find
   that there are many alternative sets of weights that satisfy the linear
   constraints. Thus, in the style of random-forest training, we also
   construct metrics based on random subsets of the genes and compare them
   to the metric of 175 genes. We then report on the selected genes and
   their biological functions. Our approach offers a new way to identify
   genes that may have important roles in stem cell differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive experimental program of heat transfer measurements has been
   completed recently at the University of Ottawa's supercritical pressure
   test facility (SCUOL). Thermal hydraulics tests were performed for
   vertical upflow of carbon dioxide in directly heated tubes with inner
   diameters of 8 and 22 mm, at high subcritical, near-critical and
   supercritical pressures. The test conditions, when converted to
   water-equivalent values, correspond to conditions of interest to current
   Super-Critical Water-Cooled Reactor designs, and include many
   measurements under conditions for which few data are available in the
   literature. These data significantly complement the existing
   experimental database and are being used for the derivation and
   validation of a new heat transfer prediction method in progress at the
   University of Ottawa. The same data are also suitable for the assessment
   of the accuracy of other heat transfer prediction methods and
   fluid-to-fluid scaling laws for near-critical and supercritical
   pressures. In addition, they permit further examination of previously
   suggested relationships describing the critical heat flux and
   post-dryout heat transfer coefficient at high subcritical pressures and
   the boundaries of the deteriorated/enhanced heat transfer regions for
   near-critical and supercritical pressures. The measurements reported in
   this paper cover several subcritical heat transfer modes, including
   single phase liquid heat transfer, nucleate boiling, critical heat flux,
   post-dryout heat transfer and superheated vapor heat transfer; they also
   cover several supercritical heat transfer modes, including heat transfer
   to liquid-like supercritical fluid and heat transfer to vapor-like
   supercritical fluid, which occurred in the downstream sections of the
   tubes. The collected data were reduced and compiled. The reported heat
   transfer database consists of more than 17,000 data points in the 8 and
   22 mm tubes, along with pressure drop data for the 8 mm tube. The tables
   of heat transfer and pressure drop data are provided as separate files
   in electronic format. The results are presented in plots of wall
   temperature and heat transfer coefficient vs. bulk fluid enthalpy. The
   parametric trends of diameter, mass flux, pressure and heat flux on
   these wall temperature and heat transfer coefficient profiles have been
   plotted and discussed. The present supercritical heat transfer
   measurements are in good agreement with corresponding results reported
   by other investigators. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Enhanced CO2 capture by biomass-templated Ca(OH)(2)-based pellets}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{274}},
Pages = {{69-75}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Biomass-templated Ca(OH)(2)-based pellets were synthesized for
   high-temperature post-combustion CO2 capture. Four types of
   biomass-derived materials were used for sorbent templating: cardboard,
   maple leaves, date seeds, and white soft wood. After calcination at 850
   degrees C in air, composite pellets with leaves exhibited a high pore
   volume of 0.11 cm(3)/g, compared to that of 0.07 cm(3)/g for pellets
   without biomass addition. The alteration in porosity was attributed to
   the release of combustion gases during the combustion of biomass. After
   20 capture cycles with no steam, these pellets captured 0.24 g CO2/g
   calcined pellets, compared to 0.18 g/g for biomass-free pellets. The
   highest CO2 uptake was achieved with pellets containing 10\% leaves.
   This enhancement in CO2 uptake allowed the possibility of doubling the
   binder content, thus improving the mechanical strength of the pellets.
   The introduction of steam to the carbonation environment resulted in
   relatively high uptakes of 0.53 and 0.41 g/g for the first and 20th
   cycles, respectively. In general, all composite pellets modified with
   biomass displayed better performance than their counterpart pellets,
   indicating the benefits of biomass addition. The dispersed biomass ash
   also appears to have helped stabilize the morphology of these pellets as
   well as acting as a doping agent assisting CO2 capture via enhanced
   diffusion. Considering the fact that such biomass materials are readily
   available and cheaper than synthetic organic materials by at least an
   order of magnitude, their utilization should not significantly increase
   the cost of the templated sorbent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{An adaptive algorithm for group testing for complexes}},
Journal = {{THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{592}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{In group testing for complexes, the property of being positive is not
   defined on single items but on subsets of items. Given a set N of n
   items with at most d positive subsets of N, each positive subset having
   cardinality at most r, we need to determine the set P subset of P(N) of
   positive subsets via group tests. In this paper, we give an adaptive
   algorithm for group testing for the complex model, for all r <= 2, which
   can be seen as a generalization of the binary splitting method for
   classical group testing (r = 1). For fixed r, our algorithm solves the
   problem with O (d(r) logn) tests while the best known non-adaptive
   algorithm requires O (d(r+1)(1+3/d)(d) log n/d)tests. While non-adaptive
   solutions are preferable for some applications that require
   parallelization of tests, our adaptive algorithm is superior when d
   grows with n, yielding a polynomial number of tests on d and logk. (C)

   at terahertz frequencies}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{We develop a simple analytical model for calculating the vibrational
   contribution to the nonlinear refractive index n(2) (Kerr coefficient)
   of a crystal in terms of known crystalline parameters such as the linear
   refractive index, the coefficient of thermal expansion, the atomic
   density, and the reduced mass and the natural oscillation frequency of
   the vibrational modes of the crystal lattice. We show that the value of
   this contribution in the terahertz spectral region can exceed the value
   of the nonlinear refractive index n(2) in the visible and near-IR
   spectral ranges (which is largely electronic in origin) by several
   orders of magnitude. For example, for crystal quartz the value of the
   Kerr coefficient in the low-frequency limit is n(2) = 2.2 x 10(-9) esu
   or, equivalently, 4.4 x 10(-16) m(2)/W, which is very much larger than
   its value of 3 x 10(-20) m(2)/W in the visible range. Furthermore, we
   present an analysis of the dispersion of n(2) in the terahertz spectral
   range and show that even larger values of n(2) occur at frequencies
   close to the vibrational resonances.}},

Journal = {{DESALINATION}},

Volume = {{369}},
Pages = {{75-84}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{In this study, composite membranes of hydrophilic CuO and CaCO3
   nanopartides and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were developed by phase
   inversion method. The fabricated membranes were subjected to different
   characterizations including morphology study, pore size, porosity, and
   thickness measurement, wettability and surface roughness analysis. The
   membrane performance was examined in terms of pure water flux in vacuum
   membrane distillation (VMD), salt rejection, and liquid entry pressure
   of water (LEPw). It was found that the membrane performance was
   optimized when 1.0 to 2.0 wt.\% of CuO nanoparticles were embedded into
   the PVDF matrix via enhancing the membrane structure through enlarging
   surface pores and thickening the finger-like layer (in other words,
   thinning of the sponge-like layer). As a result, flux increased by
   153.4\% at the feed temperature of 27.5 degrees C and vacuum pressure of
   12 kPa, when 2.0 wt.\% of the CuO nanoparticles were embedded in PVDF.
   Membrane selectivity did not drop as a result of the CuO nanopartides
   incorporation and was more than 99.99\%. All the nanocomposite membranes
   showed reasonable contact angle and LEPw, which proved appropriateness
   of the fabricated membranes for VMD application. Regarding the type of
   hydrophilic nanomaterials, CuO demonstrated better performance than
   CaCO3 in terms of membrane permeability improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Cemented paste backfill (CPB), a mixture of tailings, water and binder,
   is extensively used in underground mines worldwide for ground support
   and tailings disposal. The prediction of the behavior of CPB structures
   from early to advanced ages is of great practical importance. Once
   placed underground, the behavior of CPB is controlled by complex
   multiphysics (thermal, hydraulic, chemical and mechanical) processes.
   Modeling of the coupled THMC processes that occur in CPB are crucial for
   reliably assessing and predicting the performance of CPB structures. Yet
   there is currently no tool to predict the
   thermohydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) behavior of CPB, or the
   performance of CPB under coupled THMC loadings. Therefore, a new
   multiphysics model is presented in this paper to describe and predict
   the coupled THMC behavior of CPB and its evolution with time. The
   governing equations of the model result from a combination of a set of
   conservation and constitutive equations. Four balance equations (water
   and air mass, momentum (mechanical equilibrium) and energy conservation
   equations) are taken into consideration. The model considers full
   coupling between the thermal, hydraulic, chemical (binder hydration)
   processes and CPB deformation as well as changes in CPB properties
   resultant of these phenomena, such as stress-strain relationship,
   thermal conductivity, permeability, porosity, and strength. The model
   coefficients are identified in terms of measurable parameters. The
   prediction capability of the developed model is then tested against
   laboratory and field tests conducted on CPB. Good agreement between the
   modeling results and experimental data confirms the capability of the
   developed model to well capture the THMC behavior of CPB and its
   evolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work the effects of polyethylene fluidizing particle size
   (smaller than 400 mu m) on the degree of fluidized bed electrification
   and wall coating formation was studied. Experiments were conducted in a
   stainless steel, 0.15 m diameter column, under ambient conditions.
   Polyethylene resin as received (20-1500 mu m) as well as mono-sized and
   binary mixture of large (600-710 mu m) and small (212-300 \& 300-425 mu
   m) polyethylene particles were fluidized while their mass, net specific
   charge and size distribution in the bulk of the bed and the wall coating
   were measured. For the binary mixture the fraction of the small
   particles examined were 5\%-10\% and 20\%. The extent of wall coating
   varied between different cases tested with the mono-sized large
   particles resulting in the most amount coating. It was found that as the
   fraction of the small particles in the binary mixture was increased,
   these particles formed majority of the wall coating. At the mass
   fraction of 20\%, the extent of wall coating and its net specific charge
   were similar to that of resin as received. Overall results implied that
   the magnitude of the smaller sized particles within the resin played an
   important role in the degree of particles electrostatic charging and the
   extent of the particles adhesion to the column wall. Small particles
   were found to generate a much larger net specific charge which although
   resulted in them coating the column wall but prevented the coating layer
   growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Instrumented and Vickers indentation testing and microstructure analysis
   were used to investigate zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) and silicon
   carbide (SiC). Several equations were studied to relate the Vickers
   indentation hardness, Young's modulus and crack behavior to the fracture
   toughness. The fracture in SiC is unstable and occurs primarily by
   cleavage leading to a relatively low toughness of 3 MPa m(1/2), which
   may be inappropriate for multi-hit capability. ZTA absorbs energy by
   plastic deformation, pore collapse, crack deviation and crack bridging
   and exhibits time dependent creep. With a relatively high toughness
   around 6.6 MPa m(1/2), ZTA is promising for multi-hit capability. The
   higher accuracy of median equations in calculating the indentation
   fracture toughness and the relatively high c/a ratios above 2.5 suggest
   median type cracking for both SiC and ZTA. The Young's modulus of both
   ceramics was most accurately measured at lower indentation loads of
   about 0.5 kgf, while more accurate hardness and fracture toughness
   values were obtained at intermediate and at higher indentation loads
   beyond 5 kgf, respectively. A strong indentation size effect (ISE) was
   observed in both materials. The load independent hardness of SiC is 2563
   HV, putting it far above the standard armor hardness requirement of 1500
   HV that is barely met by ZTA. Copyright (C) 2015, The editorial office

Abstract = {{Overload has been suggested as a contributing factor for bone loss, for
   instance at the bone implant interface. The objective of this study is
   to investigate spongy bone resorption under overload using a
   semi-mechanistic bone remodeling theory. Since overload can cause the
   accumulation of microdamage in bone, in this study, it is assumed that
   overload will increase the osteoclastic activity, and also will reduce
   the osteocyte influence distance. First, a previously proposed
   semi-mechanistic bone remodeling theory was extended by defining a new
   form for the resorption probability function, which is based on
   experimental evidence. Then, in order to investigate the validity of our
   hypothesis, a three-dimensional finite element model of spongy bone was
   developed. The simulation results show that, first, trabeculae adapt
   with the mechanical stimuli placed on them. Secondly, a sharp reduction
   in spongy bone density will be resulted, in agreement with experimental
   evidence, when bone is under overload.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to propose a muscle control method for a
   humanoid musculoskeletal arm that mimics human muscle coordination from
   an engineering viewpoint. As muscle control is posed as a redundancy
   problem, the resulting muscle force corresponds to different desired
   control criteria (e.g., minimizing the total metabolic energy,
   minimizing muscle activity). In this research, the criterion we choose
   is ``load balance{''}, which is essential for reducing actuator demands
   on systems subject to repetitive and demanding tasks. In order to
   achieve a balanced force distribution throughout the muscles, we obtain
   a minimum-load muscle force by considering the acceleration contribution
   in both muscle and joint space. The orthogonal space of the minimum-load
   muscle force solution is designed to place the muscle force close to the
   midpoint of the muscle force limits. The proposed method is tested by
   tracking a table tennis movement of a real human subject. The results
   not only provide an explanation on the concepts of ``minimum-load{''}
   and ``balance-load{''}, but also show that the proposed method has
   advantageous properties such as computational efficiency and stability.}},

Abstract = {{A simple technique which approximates the continuously disturbed line

   soils water content and suction reached by a soil specimen sheared under
   constant water content conditions (Croney and Coleman, in J Soil Sci
   5(1):75-84, 1954). The critical state line (CSL), generated from
   specimens sheared under constant net normal stress, and the approximate
   continuously disturbed line (CDLa) appear to overlap at higher suction
   values. From plots of water content against matric suction, the CSL
   appears as a bi-linear relationship which lies below the CDLa with a
   shallower slope at lower matric suctions. The intersection point of the
   CSL and CDLa corresponds to the point where a unique value of the
   microstructural water content, e (wm) , can be back-calculated from the

Abstract = {{Soundings made by using the standard penetration test in sensitive
   marine clay in Ottawa (Canada) have been problematic. Negative readings
   have been recorded. The incorrect estimation of the engineering
   characteristics of Ottawa clays has been noted. The effect of
   temperature on the penetrometer load cell output is suspected as the
   reason for the negative drift in soundings and erroneous estimations of
   engineering characteristics. Also, focused research is needed to verify
   existing correlations and empirical factors between the cone penetration
   test and engineering characteristics of Ottawa clays. These are the
   reasons for carrying out this research work. Temperature effects have
   become a significant factor in countries with radical temperature
   changes, such as Canada. Three types of penetrometer tips have been used
   at the Canadian Geotechnical Research Site No. 1. The tips used are a 36
   mm cone, 40 mm ball, and 113 mm ball. Nilcon field vane testing has also
   been carried out in the site to determine the undrained shear strength
   and sensitivity (the ratio of the initial undrained shear strength to
   the remolded undrained shear strength) from the penetrometer soundings.
   Undisturbed samples are collected to obtain the engineering
   characteristics by laboratory testing. Laboratory testing on
   penetrometer equipment is performed to verify the effects of temperature
   on the soundings. It is found that temperature changes affect the
   penetrometer soundings. Temperature effects can cause drifting as
   indicated by negative tip stress or sleeve friction in soft or low
   resistance clays. Therefore, temperature effects may increase the errors
   in the estimation of the engineering characteristics of Ottawa clays. It
   has also been found that correlations may or may not apply well to
   Ottawa sensitive marine clay. Temperature corrections could be applied
   to the penetrometer soundings. From this research, correlations and
   empirical factors between penetrometers and engineering characteristics
   are verified for Ottawa sensitive marine clays.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There are few data about the patient-and prosthesis-related
   factors influencing the hemodynamics of transcatheter heart valves
   (THVs). The objective of this in vitro study was to assess the effect of
   aortic annulus size and prosthesis oversizing on the valve hemodynamics
   and estimated leaflet bending stress of the Edwards SAPIEN
   balloon-expandable THV (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA).
   Methods: The effective orifice area (EOA) of the 23-mm and 26-mm SAPIEN
   THVs were measured by Doppler echocardiography in a pulse duplicator
   under the following experimental conditions: (1) stroke volume of 20,
   30, 50, 70, and 80 mL and (2) aortic annulus size of 19, 20, 21, and 22
   mm for the 23-mm SAPIEN and 22, 23, and 24, and 25 mm for the 26-mm
   SAPIEN. The percentage of valve oversizing was calculated as follows: \%
   OS = 100 x {[}(prosthesis nominal area - aortic annulus area)/aortic
   annulus area], where \% OS is the percentage of oversizing. The leaflet
   bending stress was measured by high-speed camera imaging of the THV
   leaflet opening.
   Results: The 2 independent determinants of valve EOA were the aortic
   annulus diameter (R-2 = 0.33; P < 0.001) and the stroke volume (R-2 =
   0.63; P < 0.001). The prosthesis size and \% OS were not independently
   related to EOA. However, a larger \% OS was independently associated
   with higher peak systolic leaflet bending stress (Delta R-2 = 0.11; P <
   0.0001).
   Conclusions: The hemodynamic performance of THV is in large part
   determined by the aortic annulus diameter in which the valve is
   deployed. Oversizing (up to 20\% in area) has no significant effect on
   valve EOA but is associated with higher leaflet bending stress, which
   might promote faster structural valve degeneration in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to develop a robust two-dimensional coupled numerical
   model based on an unstructured mesh, which can simulate rapidly varying
   flows over an erodible bed involving wet-dry fronts that is a complex
   yet practically important problem. Using a modified spatial
   reconstruction based on the finite volume method, the well-balanced
   property is preserved, which is important for accurate and efficient
   simulation of morphological problems. In the present study, the
   central-upwind scheme is extended to simulation of bed erosion and
   sediment transport for the first time. It is demonstrated that the
   proposed scheme shows good accuracy and high efficiency. A modified
   shallow water system is adopted to improve the model. The shallow water
   equations, sediment transport equation and bed evolution equation are
   coupled in the governing system. Multiple test cases are employed to
   demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the current
   model. Furthermore, with a field scale dam-break test case, the
   efficiency and accuracy of the central-upwind method is verified in
   comparison with other popular Riemann solvers. The effects of the
   additional source terms in the adopted modified shallow water equations
   are also investigated by comparing the numerical results with a
   laboratory study available in the literature. The proposed scheme can
   efficiently track wetting and drying interfaces while preserving
   stability in simulating the bed erosion near the wet-dry fronts. The
   added terms in shallow water equations can improve the accuracy of the
   simulation when intense sediment-exchange exists; the central-upwind
   method adopted in the current study shows great accuracy and efficiency
   compared with other popular solvers; the developed model is robust,
   efficient and accurate to deal with various challenging cases.}},

Abstract = {{The design and optimization of straight long-range surface plasmon
   waveguides to maximize attenuation surface sensitivity in biochemical
   sensing applications are discussed. The sensor consists of a Au stripe
   embedded in CYTOP, with a microfluidic channel etched into the top
   cladding to expose the surface of the Au stripe and define the sensing
   channel. The attenuation alpha(s) of the structure changes as a
   biological adlayer grows on the Au surface. The dimensions of the stripe
   (thickness, width), the sensing length and the refractive index of the
   sensing buffer were varied in order to understand their impact on sensor
   performance. The attenuation sensitivity partial derivative
   alpha(s)/partial derivative a dominates over a wide range of waveguide
   designs, so we define a parameter K = (partial derivative
   alpha(s)/partial derivative a)/alpha(s) where maximizing vertical bar K
   vertical bar and selecting the optimal sensing length as L-opt = 1/(2
   alpha(s)) maximizes the overall sensitivity of the structure.
   Experimental results based on observing the physisorption of bovine
   serum albumin (BSA) on bare Au waveguides agree qualitatively and
   quantitatively with theory. Detection limits of Delta Gamma(min) < 0.1
   pg.mm(-2) are predicted for optimal designs, and a detection limit of
   Delta Gamma(min) = 4.1 pg/mm(2) (SNR = 1) is demonstrated experimentally
   for a sub-optimal structure.}},

Title = {{A comparative study of PCA, SIMCA and Cole model for classification of
   bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{42-51}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Due to safety and low cost of bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS),
   classification of BIS can be potentially A. preferred way of detecting
   changes in living tissues. However, for longitudinal datasets linear
   classifiers fail to classify conventional Cole parameters extracted from
   BIS measurements because of their high variability. In some
   applications, linear classification based on Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) has shown more accurate results. Yet, these methods have
   not been established for BIS classification, since PCA features have
   neither been investigated in combination with other classifiers nor have
   been compared to conventional Cole features in benchmark classification
   tasks.
   In this work, PCA and Cole features are compared in three synthesized
   benchmark classification tasks which are expected to be detected by BIS.
   These three tasks are classification of before and after geometry
   change, relative composition change and blood perfusion in a cylindrical
   organ. Our results show that in all tasks the features extracted by PCA
   are more discriminant than Cole parameters. Moreover, a pilot study was
   done on a longitudinal arm BIS dataset including eight subjects and
   three arm positions. The goal of the study was to compare different
   methods in arm position classification which includes all three
   synthesized changes mentioned above. Our comparative study on various
   classification methods shows that the best classification accuracy is
   obtained when PCA features are classified by a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   classifier. The results of this work suggest that PCA+KNN is a promising
   method to be considered for classification of BIS datasets that deal
   with subject and time variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Tongue-and-groove plank wood decking is a product that is commonly used
   in post and beam timber construction to transfer gravity loads on roofs
   and floors. In 2010, the National Building Code of Canada changed the
   application area of the specified concentrated roof live loads from 750
   x 750 mm to 200 x 200 mm. Preliminary analysis showed that the change in
   the application area of concentrated loads would have a significant
   impact on the design of decking systems. An experimental program was
   undertaken at the University of Ottawa's structural laboratory to better
   understand the stiffness characteristics of plank decking under
   concentrated loads. The experimental test program was complimented with
   a detailed finite-element model in order to predict the behavior of a
   plank decking system, especially the force transfer between decks
   through the tongue and groove joint. The study found that under
   concentrated loads, the stiffness of the decking system increased
   significantly as more boards were added. The number of boards found to
   be representative of a system was eight boards. A deflection coefficient
   of gamma = 0.4 was found to be appropriate to calculate the deflection
   for the simple span, two-span continuous, and controlled random layup,
   under concentrated load on an area of 200 by 200 mm. A finite-element
   model was created and compared with the experimental results, and it was
   found to predict the behavior with reasonable accuracy. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An experimental program was undertaken at the University of Ottawa's
   structural laboratory to investigate the behavior of plank decking under
   uniformly distributed loads. Nondestructive and destructive tests were
   conducted on plank decking systems to investigate their stiffness and
   failure mode characteristics. The study showed that the established
   deflection coefficients used to check the deflection of plank decking
   under balanced uniformly distributed loads can be conservatively used to
   estimate the stiffness of the simple span, two-span continuous, and
   controlled random layup patterns. It was also found that a deflection
   coefficient of 0.60 would be suitable for the combination simple and
   two-span continuous layup. Under unbalanced loading on two-span
   continuous layups, it was found that the deflection coefficient of 0.42
   was nonconservative and that a more appropriate value to use in this
   case would be 0.60. The failure mode of a controlled random layup
   decking system under a uniformly distributed load was found to be
   consistent with the failure observed for simple span. The assumption of
   basing the capacity of the controlled random layup on the capacity of
   simple span layup seems appropriate. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Extensive research has shown that properly detailed and closely spaced
   transverse reinforcement in reinforced concrete columns can ensure
   ductile behavior during earthquakes. However, in regions of high
   seismicity, detailing requirements can result in heavily congested
   sections; the use of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) can facilitate
   construction in these situations. Although extensive research exists on
   the axial load behavior of traditional concrete columns, only limited
   research exists on the behavior of columns constructed with SCC.
   Research over the past two decades has also shown that use of steel
   fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) can improve the strength and ductility
   of columns by delaying cover spalling and improving core confinement.
   Recent research has also shown that the combined use of SCC and steel
   fibers can ease problems associated with the workability of traditional
   fiber-reinforced concrete. This paper presents the results from an
   experimental program that was conducted to study the axial behavior of
   reinforced concrete columns constructed with SCC and SFRC. Full-scale
   columns having rectangular cross sections were tested under pure axial
   compressive loading. The columns were detailed with varying amounts of
   transverse reinforcement in accordance with the requirements of the
   Canadian Standards Association. The results confirm that increasing
   confinement with closely spaced transverse reinforcement in rectangular
   SCC columns results in improvements in behavior and ductility. In
   addition, the results demonstrate that the use of SFRC in rectangular
   columns results in improvements in performance and ductility. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Microsoft Kinect sensor has been widely used in many applications since
   the launch of its first version. Recently, Microsoft released a new
   version of Kinect sensor with improved hardware. However, the accuracy
   assessment of the sensor remains to be answered. In this paper, we
   measure the depth accuracy of the newly released Kinect v2 depth sensor,
   and obtain a cone model to illustrate its accuracy distribution. We then
   evaluate the variance of the captured depth values by depth entropy. In
   addition, we propose a trilateration method to improve the depth
   accuracy with multiple Kinects simultaneously. The experimental results
   are provided to ascertain the proposed model and method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a dispersion relation analysis is employed to investigate
   the finite volume triangular C-grid formulation for two-dimensional
   shallow-water equations. In addition, two proposed combinations of
   time-stepping methods with the C-grid spatial discretization are
   investigated. In the first part of this study, the C-grid spatial
   discretization scheme is assessed, and in the second part, fully
   discrete schemes are analyzed. Analysis of the semi-discretized scheme
   (i.e. only spatial discretization) shows that there is no damping
   associated with the spatial C-grid scheme, and its phase speed behavior
   is also acceptable for long and intermediate waves. The analytical
   dispersion analysis after considering the effect of time discretization
   shows that the Leap-Frog time stepping technique can improve the phase
   speed behavior of the numerical method; however it could not damp the
   shorter decelerated waves. The Adams-Bashforth technique leads to slower
   propagation of short and intermediate waves and it damps those waves
   with a slower propagating speed. The numerical solutions of various test
   problems also conform and are in good agreement with the analytical
   dispersion analysis. They also indicate that the Adams-Bashforth scheme
   exhibits faster convergence and more accurate results, respectively,
   when the spatial and temporal step size decreases. However, the
   Leap-Frog scheme is more stable with higher CFL numbers. (C) 2015

Title = {{Detection of Bearing Fault Detection From Heavily Contaminated Signals:
   A Higher-Order Analytic Energy Operator Method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a higher-order analytic energy operator (HO-AEO)
   approach to monitoring bearing health conditions from vibrations signals
   that are polluted by strong noise and multiple interferences. The
   proposed analytic energy operator (AEO) is formed using the raw signal,
   its Hilbert transform, and their derivatives. In analogy to the
   conventional energy operator (EO), it represents an alternative energy
   transformation. However, unlike the conventional EO, it exploits the
   information from both the real and imaginary parts of the analytic
   signal. It can also extract both the amplitude and frequency modulations
   and is thus well suited for detecting impulsive fault signature. The
   joint use of multiple higher-order AEOs can further offset noise effect.
   The built-in amplitude demodulation (AD) capability of the proposed
   HO-AEO eliminates the enveloping step required by most high-frequency
   resonance (HFR) methods. The method is simple and easy to implement. Our
   simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed
   method can effectively extract bearing fault signature in the presence
   of heavy noise and multiple vibration interferences. It has also been
   shown mathematically that the HO-AEO processed signal yields higher
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) than the conventional EO does. The
   simulation and experimental comparisons also indicate that the proposed
   method has much better noise and interference handling capabilities than
   the conventional EO.}},

Abstract = {{Service Overlay Networks (SONs) allow new, complex services to be

   overlays in terms of freedom of nodes to join and leave the network, and
   frequent changes in network conditions make their management a tedious,

   selection scheme to elect nodes that will monitor and analyze IPTV
   Quality of Experience (QoE) delivered over overlay networks. Then, a
   simple, yet effective, utility function is proposed to analyze the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel high-capacity audio watermarking system to
   embed data and extract them in a bit-exact manner by changing some of
   the magnitudes of the FFT spectrum. The key idea is to divide the FFT
   spectrum into short frames and change the magnitude of the selected FFT
   samples using Fibonacci numbers. Taking advantage of Fibonacci numbers,
   it is possible to change the frequency samples adaptively. In fact, the
   suggested technique guarantees and proves, mathematically, that the
   maximum change is less than 61\% of the related FFT sample and the
   average error for each sample is 25\%. Using the closest Fibonacci
   number to FFT magnitudes results in a robust and transparent technique.
   On top of very remarkable capacity, transparency and robustness, this
   scheme provides two parameters which facilitate the regulation of these
   properties. The experimental results show that the method has a high
   capacity (700 bps to 3 kbps), without significant perceptual distortion
   (ODG is about -1) and provides robustness against common audio signal
   processing such as echo, added noise, filtering, and MPEG compression
   (MP3). In addition to the experimental results, the fidelity of
   suggested system is proved mathematically.}},

Abstract = {{Palladium-ruthenium nanoparticles supported on carbon PdxRu1-x/C (x = 1,
   0.99, 0.95, 0.90, 0.80, 0.50) were prepared using a polyol method for
   ethanol electrooxidation in alkaline media. The resulting bimetallic
   catalysts were found to be primarily a mix of Pd metal, Ru oxides and Pd
   oxides. Their electrocatalytic activity towards ethanol oxidation
   reaction (EOR) in 1M KOH was studied using cyclic voltammetry and
   chronoamperometry techniques. Addition of 1-10 at.\% Ru to Pd not only
   lowers the onset oxidation potential for EOR but also produces higher
   current densities at lower potentials compared to Pd by itself. Thus,
   Pd90Ru10/C and Pd99Ru1/C provide the current densities of up to six
   times those of Pd/C at -0.96 V and -0.67 V vs MSE, respectively. The
   current density at different potentials was found to be dependent on the
   surface composition of PdxRu1-x/C nanostructures. Pd90Ru10/C catalyst
   with more surface oxides was found to be active at lower potential
   compared to Pd99Ru1/C with less surface oxides, which is active at
   higher potentials. The steady-state current densities of the two best
   catalysts, Pd90Ru10/C and Pd99Ru1/C, showed minimal surface deactivation
   from EOR intermediates/products during chronoamperometry. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Gradient features play important roles for the problem of pedestrian
   detection, especially the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature.
   To improve detection accuracy in terms of feature extraction, HOG has
   been combined with multiple kinds of low-level features. However, it is
   still possible to exploit further discriminative information from the
   classical HOG feature. Inspired by the symmetrical characteristic of
   pedestrian appearance, we present a novel feature of gradient
   self-similarity (GSS) in this work. GSS is computed from HOG, and is
   applied to capturing the patterns of pairwise similarities of local
   gradient patches. Furthermore, a supervised feature selection approach
   is employed to remove the non-informative pairs. As a result, the
   selective GSS (SGSS) feature is built on a concise subset of pair
   comparisons. The experimental results demonstrate that improvement is
   achieved by incorporating HOG with GSS/SGSS. In addition, considering
   that HOG is a prerequisite for GSS/SGSS, it is intuitional to develop a
   two-level cascade of classifiers for obtaining improved detection
   performance. Specifically, the first level is a linear SVM with the
   multiscale HOG features to efficiently remove easy negatives. At the
   second stage, the already computed HOG features are reused to produce
   the corresponding GSS/SGSS features, and then the combined features are
   used to discriminate true positives from candidate image regions.
   Although simple, this model is competitive with the state-of-the-art
   methods on the well-known datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   at a inflow rate of 300 mu l/h. Similarly, when the concentrator was
   used to concentrate E. coli DH5 alpha and NIH/3T3 cells, overall
   concentration factors of similar to 59 and 75-fold with particle
   recovery efficiencies of 81.0 +/- 17.2\% and 90.8 +/- 5.0\% were
   obtained, respectively. These results show significant improvements upon
   those previously reported for either bacterial or mammalian cell
   concentration applications. In addition, the device fabrication process
   developed in this work is fully compatible with regular microfabrication
   processes, making this microfluidic concentrator readily integrable with
   other on-chip functionalities for cell manipulation and detection
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using integrated CaO/CuO-based pellets in combined
   calcium and chemical looping cycles in a fixed bed was investigated with
   emphasis on CO2 capture performance. Three types of pellets were tested,
   namely; integrated core-in-shell CaO/CuO-based pellets; integrated
   homogeneous CaO/CuO-based pellets; and mixed CaO-based pellets and
   CuO-based pellets. Redox cycles consisted of oxidation/carbonation at
   650 degrees C in 15\% CO2; 4\% O-2, and N-2 balance, and
   reduction/calcination at 850 degrees C in a CO/H-2 mixture. The results
   showed that mixed pellets exhibited the highest CO2 uptakes of 0.11 g
   CO2/g bed in the first cycle and 0.07 g/g after 11 cycles (corresponding
   to CaO conversions of 32.1\% and 19\%, respectively). This enhanced
   performance was attributed to the significantly higher pore volume and
   surface area in the calcined CaO-based pellets, which were superior to
   those of integrated CaO/CuO-based pellets. The reduction of CuO to Cu2O
   was found to be partially irreversible, with similar to 45\% of copper
   oxide in the pellets in the form of Cu2O despite the excess O-2 in the
   oxidizing environment. It was also noted that cycled core-in-shell
   pellets were the most susceptible to fragmentation, indicating the low
   mechanical strength of these pellets. It was concluded that combined
   calcium and chemical looping cycles in a fixed bed system is a feasible
   process providing suitable pellets are used. Incorporating CuO in
   CaO-based pellets reduces the porosity of the pellets, thus compromises
   CO2 uptake. Among the three groups of pellets, mixed pellets are the
   most promising for CaL-CLC processes due to their better performance,
   easier manufacturing, and better quality control than integrated
   pellets. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Single-mode distributed feedback laser structures and parity-time
   symmetry broken grating structures based on dielectric-loaded long-range
   surface plasmon polariton waveguides are proposed. The structures
   comprise a thin Ag stripe on an active polymer bottom cladding with an

   IR140 dye providing optical gain at near infrared wavelengths. Cutoff
   top ridge dimensions (thickness and width) are calculated using a finite
   element method and selected to guarantee single-mode operation of the
   laser. Several parameters such as the threshold number of periods and
   the lasing wavelength are determined using the transfer matrix method. A
   related structure based on two pairs of waveguides of two widths, which
   have the same imaginary part but different real part of effective index,
   arranged within one grating period, is proposed as an active grating
   operating at the threshold for parity-time symmetry breaking (i.e.,
   operating at an exceptional point). Such ``exceptional point{''}
   gratings produce ideal reflectance asymmetry as demonstrated via

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the effect of local scalp cooling on
   corticomotor excitability with transcranial magnetic simulation (TMS).
   Participants (healthy male adults, n = 12) were first assessed with TMS
   to derive baseline measure of excitability from motor evoked potentials
   (MEPs) using the right first dorsal interosseous as the target muscle.
   Then, local cooling was induced on the right hemi-scalp (upper frontal
   region similar to 15 cm(2)) by means of a cold wrap. The cooling was
   maintained for 10-15 min to get a decrease of at least 10 degrees C from
   baseline temperature. In the post-cooling period, both scalp temperature
   and MEPs were reassessed at specific time intervals (i.e., TO, T10, T20
   and T30 min). Scalp surface temperatures dropped on average by 12.5
   degrees C from baseline at TO (p < 0.001) with partial recovery at T10
   (p < 0.05) and full recovery at T20. Parallel analysis of post-cooling
   variations in MEP amplitude revealed significant reductions relative to
   baseline at TO, T10 and T20. No concurrent change in MEP latency was
   observed. A secondary control experiment was performed in a subset of
   participants (n = 5) to account for the mild discomfort associated with
   the wrapping procedure without the cooling agent. Results showed no
   effect on any of the dependent variables (temperature, MEP amplitude and
   latency). To our knowledge, this report provides the first
   neurophysiological evidence linking changes in scalp temperature with
   lasting changes in corticomotor excitability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{When recording human movement with stereophotogrammetry, skin
   deformation and displacement (soft tissue artefact; STA) inhibits
   surface markers' ability to validly represent the movement of the
   underlying bone. To resolve this issue, the components of marker motions
   which contribute to STA must be understood. The purpose of this study is
   to describe and quantify which components of this marker motion (cluster
   translation, rotation, scaling and deformation) contribute to STA during
   the stance phase of walking, a cutting manoeuvre, and one-legged hops.
   In vivo bone pin-based tibio-femoral kinematics of six healthy subjects
   were used to study skin marker-based STA. To quantify how total cluster
   translation, rotation, scaling and deformation contribute to STA, a
   resizable and deformable cluster model was constructed. STA was found to
   be greater in the thigh than the shank during all three movements. We
   found that the non-rigid (i.e. scaling and deformation) movements
   contribute very little to the overall amount of error, rendering surface
   marker optimisation methods aimed at minimising this component
   superfluous. The results of the current study indicate that procedures
   designed to account for cluster translation and rotation during human
   movement are required to correctly represent the motion of body
   segments, however reducing marker cluster scaling and deformation will
   have little effect on STA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, titanate nanotubes (TNTs) were self-synthesized and amino
   functionalized to produce titanate nanotubes (NH2-TNTs) for thin film
   nanocomposite (TFN) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane fabrication. The novel
   RO membranes were fabricated by embedding NH2-TNTs of different
   quantities into polyamide (PA) layer. The nanotubular morphology of
   NH2-TNTs was studied using TEM while FTIR was employed to confirm the
   reaction of TNTs with {[}1-(2-amino-ethyl)-3-aminopropyl]
   trimethoxysilane. The effect of NH2-TNTs on the PA layer of TFN with
   respect to surface morphology, separation performance and antifouling
   properties was thoroughly investigated and discussed. The presence of
   NH2-TNTs in PA layer was verified using XPS while the ``leaf-like{''}
   outgrowth morphology of PA layer was observed using FESEM. Results
   showed that the TFN membrane with 0.05\% NH2-TNTs embedded was the most
   promising membrane as it exhibited 93\% higher water flux than the
   control thin film composite (TFC) membrane, without compensating NaCl
   rejection. In terms of organic fouling tendency, the TFN0.05 membrane
   also showed higher tolerance compared to the control membrane during RO
   process. Furthermore, as high as 94\% of the water flux of TFN0.05 was
   able to retrieve by a simple water rinse process, which suggests that
   organic fouling in TFN0.05 is highly reversible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Commercially available thin film composite (TFC) polyamide membrane (GE
   AG) and asymmetric cellulose acetate membrane (GE CE) have been
   characterized using different concentrations of ammonium sulfate, up to
   40 g.l(-1), in order to determine their suitability for the
   concentration of ammonium as ammonium sulfate from anaerobic digester
   digestate. At the manufacturer specified pressures of 1550 kPa and 2900
   kPa, the solvent permeances for the GE AG and the GE CE membranes were
   found to be 2.1 x 10(-5) and 7.4 x 10(-6) l.m(-2).h(-1).Pa-1,
   respectively. These permeances were practically independent of feed
   concentration. At the same time, both membranes showed excellent solute
   rejections, which decreased slightly with feed concentration, but were
   generally greater than 0.99. Consequently, the lower pressure GE AG
   membranes were considered to be more suitable for the separation of
   ammonium sulfate, and they were further tested at pressures exceeding
   the manufacturer specified value. These experiments revealed a slight
   decrease in solvent permeance for up to 17\%, as well as a slight
   decrease in solute rejection, which was 0.97 or greater. Given these
   results, both membranes studied in this research are suitable for future
   investigations; first using multi-ion aqueous solutions and then
   pre-treated anaerobic digester digestate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A new approach is proposed to act as an efficient design technique for
   the implementation of ultra-wideband (UWB) bandpass filters in
   integrated passive device technology. The proposed design is based on
   two major original contributions. First, the use of hourglass filter
   theory which, to the best of authors knowledge, has not been applied yet
   to such technology. Then, the minimisation of the number of inductors
   involved in the filter circuit through the zigzag technique. Implemented
   in 0.18 mu m CMOS technology, the designed filter exhibits excellent
   performances such as two finite tunable transmission zeros, enhanced
   selectivity, a bandwidth covering the entire UWB spectrum of 3.1-10.6
   GHz, a stopband rejection better than 15 dB throughout frequencies below
   2.7 GHz and above 11 GHz, a good matching better than 11 dB, a minimum
   mid-band insertion loss of 1.8 dB and, finally, a sufficiently constant
   group delay. With these features and only 10 lumped elements, the
   proposed filter is one of the most promising compact filters for UWB
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{High-pressure oxy-fired direct contact steam generation (HiPrOx/DCSG)
   can be achieved by the oxy-combustion of fuels in the presence of water.
   This process is capable of producing flue gas streams containing
   approximately 90\% steam with a balance of primarily CO2. The product
   flue gas is suitable for processes where the purity of the steam is less
   important, such as the steam-assisted gravity drainage process used for
   in situ production of bitumen within the Canadian oil sands. This study
   had three primary objectives: (1) To show that high-moisture HiPrOx/DCSG
   can be achieved with hydrocarbon fuels. For this purpose, n-butanol was
   used because of its high volatility and ease of handling. (2) To see if
   this technology could be applied to fuels with lower volatilities. This
   was studied by attempting to combust a graphite-water slurry as well as
   mixtures of graphite-water slurry and butanol. (3) To determine the
   effects of different fuel mixtures, oxygen-to-fuel ratios, and water
   inputs on process stability and H2O partial pressure in the product gas.
   This paper describes pilot-scale combustion testing and process modeling
   of n-butanol, graphite-water slurry, and their mixtures in an atmosphere
   consisting of oxygen and water at a pressure of 1.5 MPa(g).
   Graphite/butanol mixtures were selected because certain combinations
   could represent the range of fixed carbon/volatiles ratios of waste
   fuels and indicate whether low-volatile fuels will ignite in the
   high-water moderator environment. Over the butanol test periods, a steam
   content of around 90 mol \% at saturation was achievable; the O-2 in the
   combustion products was between 0.08 and 3.57 mol \% (wet) with an
   average of 1.13 mol \% (wet). The CO emissions were low (<25 ppmv wet,
   3\% O-2) in the combustor. The CO levels indicated that high fuel
   conversion was achieved with low excess O-2 content in the combustion
   products. The testing also indicated that operation with extremely low
   O-2 is possible for specific fuels, which will minimize downstream
   corrosion issues and reduce the energy consumption and costs associated
   with oxygen production requirements. Low CO emissions (<25 ppmv wet, 3\%
   O-2) and relatively good process stability were experienced for the
   butanol/graphite-water slurry mixtures containing similar to 40\%
   butanol. CO emissions increased and process stability decreased as the
   graphite content in the fuel mixture was increased. Unassisted
   combustion of the graphite-water slurry was achieved for a period of 20
   minutes until operational problems were encountered, due to burner
   plugging by the slurry, requiring that the burner be shut off. It was
   found that the maximum attainable H2O content in the product gas
   increased with increasing hydrogen-to-carbon ratio in the fuel. H2O
   content was around 80 mol \% with 100\% graphite-water slurry, 81 mol \%
   with a 25\% butanol in graphite-water slurry mixture, and around 86.5\%
   in a 40\% butanol in graphite-water slurry mixture. It was also found
   that the fuel H/C ratio, excess O-2, heat loss, O-2 purity, and fuel
   volatility are important parameters when considering a DCSG system
   because they directly affect the process performance and quality of the
   desired product.}},

Abstract = {{Gold mining along 525 km of the Fraser River between 1858 and 1909 added
   an estimated 1.1 x 10(8)t of tailings, half gravel and the rest finer,
   to the river's natural sediment load. We simulate the response using a
   1-D multigrain size morphodynamic model. Since premining conditions are
   unknown and modern data are insufficient for tuning the process
   representation, we devised a novel modeling strategy which may be useful
   in other data-poor applications. We start the model from a smoothed
   version of the modern longitudinal profile with bed grain size
   distributions optimized to match alternative assumptions about natural
   sediment supply and compare runs that include mining with control runs
   that can be used to quantify the effects of deficiencies in process
   representation and initialization. Simulations with an appropriate
   choice of natural supply rate closely match the best available test
   data, which consist of a detailed 1952-1999 gravel budget for the distal
   part of the model domain. The simulations suggest that the main response
   to mining was rapid bed fining, which allowed a major increase in bed
   load transport rate with only slight (similar to 0.1m) mean aggradation
   within the mining region and most of the excess sediment exported well
   beyond the mountain front within the mining period or soon afterward. We
   compare this pattern of response by a large, powerful river with
   previous case studies of river adjustment to sediment supply change.}},

Abstract = {{A turbulent combustion subgrid model, inspired by the Linear Eddy Model
   for Large Eddy Simulation (LEM-LES), is developed to study highly
   compressible and reactive flows involving very rapid transients in
   pressure and energy. The model is intended to be a one-dimensional
   treatment of a diffusion-reaction system within a multi-dimensional LES
   cell. The goal is to reduce the expense of solving a complete
   multi-dimensional problem through Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)
   while preserving micro-scale hotspots and their physical effects on
   ignition. The current approach features a Lagrangian description of
   fluid particles on the subgrid for increased accuracy. Recently, the
   model approach has been verified for various fundamental 1-D test cases,
   including inert mixing, constant volume ignition, shock tube problems
   and laminar flame propagation. In the current study, the model is
   extended to treat turbulent methane-air flames in one-dimension. Also, a
   1-D piston-driven laminar shock flame interaction and its subsequent
   transition to detonation is modelled. Results confirm that both laminar
   and turbulent flame speeds are reproduced when compared against 1D
   computations of the Navier Stokes equations (1D-NS) and experiments,
   respectively. Furthermore, the model offers a good prediction for
   detonation initiation in the presence of shock waves when compared to
   high and low-resolution 1D-NS simulations. Finally, the model is
   demonstrated to reproduce the correct detonation structures, velocities,
   and instability behaviour when compared to theory and the 1D-NS
   computations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing enables users to receive
   infrastructure/platform/software as a Service (XaaS) via a shared pool
   of resources in a pay-as-you-go fashion. Data centers, as the hosts of
   physical servers, play a key role in the delivery of cloud services.
   Therefore, interconnection of data centers over a backbone network is
   one of the major challenges affecting the performance of the cloud
   system, as well as the operational expenditures of service providers.
   This article proposes resilient design of a cloud backbone through
   demand profile-based network virtualization where the data centers are
   located at the core nodes of an IP over elastic optical network. Three
   approaches, MOPIC, MRPIC, and RS-MOPIC, are proposed. MOPIC aims to
   design the cloud backbone with minimum outage probability per demand.
   MRPIC aims to minimize the usage of network resources while routing the
   cloud demands toward data centers. RS-MOPIC is a hybrid of both
   approaches aiming to reduce network resource usage while minimizing
   outage probability. Through simulations of a small-scale cloud scenario,
   we show that incorporation of manycast provisioning ensures
   significantly low outage probability on the order of 10-7. Furthermore,
   integration of a resource saving objective into MOPIC can make a
   compromise between network resource consumption and outage probability
   of the workloads submitted to the cloud.}},

Abstract = {{Since conventional audio-video teleconferencing systems have reached
   their limits, the needs of integrating new sensations to improve users'
   telecommunication experience are growing. Haptics, the sense of touch,
   which includes handshake, comforting hug, encouraging pat, and other
   physical contacts, is important to interpersonal communication, as it
   allows people to express and receive intimate affection, intention or
   emotion efficiently. Motivated by some haptic telecommunication
   softwares, this paper presents an innovative webcam-based touchscreen to
   further increase people's degree of immersion with the haptic video chat
   system at a more reasonable price. With our webcam-based touchscreen,
   the user could directly use his/her bare hand to touch the image of the
   person who he/she is chatting with, instead of controlling a haptic
   device as the medium to realize indirect touch. This paper also gives
   details of the touchscreen method and our proposed mathematical models
   for touch position calculation. Experimental results show that our
   system is accurate and robust, while maintaining high compatibility with
   conventional audio-video teleconferencing systems for combination. With
   our haptic jacket, the passive user can feel the touch of the active
   user at the right position. Finally, we draw the conclusions and talk
   about future work.}},

Title = {{Estimated confidence interval from single blood pressure measurement
   based on algorithmic fusion}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{154-163}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Current oscillometric blood pressure measurement devices
   generally provide only single-point estimates for systolic and diastolic
   blood pressures and rarely provide confidence ranges for these
   estimates. A novel methodology to obtain confidence intervals (CIs) for
   systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
   estimates from a single oscillometric blood pressure measurement is
   presented.
   Methods: The proposed methodology utilizes the multiple regression
   technique to fuse optimally a set of SBP and DBP estimates obtained
   through different algorithms. However, the set of SBP and DBP estimates
   is a small number to determine the Cl of each individual subject. To
   address this issue, the weighted bootstrap approach based on the
   multiple regression technique was used to generate a pseudo sample set
   for the SBP and the DBP. In this paper, the multiple regression
   technique can estimate the best-fitting surface of an efficient function
   that relates the input sample set as an independent vector to the
   auscultatory nurse measurement as a dependent vector to estimate
   regression coefficients. Consequently, the coefficients are assigned to
   an eight-sample set obtained from the fusion of different algorithms as
   optimally weighted parameters. CIs are also estimated using the
   conventional methods on the set of fused SBP and DBP estimates for
   comparison purposes.
   Results: The proposed method was applied to an experimental dataset of
   85 patients. The results indicated that the proposed approach provides
   better blood pressure estimates than the existing algorithms and, in
   addition, is able to provide CIs for a single measurement.
   Conclusions: The CIs derived from the proposed scheme are much smaller
   than those calculated by conventional methods except for the pseudo
   maximum amplitude-envelope algorithm for both the SBP and the DBP,
   probably because of the decrease in the standard deviation through the
   increase in the pseudo measurements using the weighted bootstrap method
   for each subject. The proposed methodology is likely the only one
   currently available that can provide as for single-sample blood pressure
   measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A microwave photonic link (MPL) with an increased spurious-free dynamic
   range (SFDR) using a polarization modulator is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. The fundamental concept of the proposed
   approach to increase the SFDR is to reduce the third-order
   intermodulation distortion (IMD3) and to improve the modulation
   efficiency by partial carrier suppression, which is realized here by
   producing two channels of intensity-modulated signals with one having
   only the upper sidebands and the other having the optical carrier that
   is partially suppressed and the upper sidebands using two optical
   filters. If the optical powers into the two channels are kept identical,
   the combination of the two signals at a photodetector will fully cancel
   the IMD3 terms. In addition, the modulation efficiency is optimized due
   to the partial carrier suppression, which also leads to an increased
   SFDR. The proposed MPL is theoretically studied and experimentally
   demonstrated. An SFDR of 123.48 dB.Hz(2/3) at a noise floor of -166
   dBm/Hz is achieved, which is 15 dB higher than that of a regular

Abstract = {{Rising infection rates in health care cause complications for the
   patient, extended hospital stay, financial difficulties and even death.
   One of the crucial factors that reduce those infections is better hand
   hygiene. Due to the lack of automated systems that can help monitoring
   hand hygiene compliance, some hospitals use direct observations,
   surveys, dispensers usage measurements and other such methods to monitor
   the compliance of care providers. This paper presents an alternative
   system that takes advantage of emerging off-the-shelf infrastructures in
   hospitals and in particular of real-time location systems (RTLS) and
   automated hand sanitizer dispensers. Our RTLS-based hand hygiene
   monitoring and notification system (RHMNS) improves upon current methods
   by enabling interactions with care providers through notifications when
   they do not execute expected hand hygiene actions, even for fine-grained
   location situations such as moving between patients a multi-bed room.
   RHMNS supports two approaches that share the same infrastructure while
   differing in their way of deciding on missed hand hygiene opportunities.
   The activation-based approach, which offers better results than the

Abstract = {{In this work, the response of a proposed deep geological repository
   (DGR), located in sedimentary rock formations of southern Ontario, to
   potential future glaciation cycles is investigated numerically. A
   coupled thermohydromechanical-chemical model is developed and solved
   numerically by using the finite element method. The general circulation
   model (GCM) from the University of Toronto is used to generate future
   glacial cycles and related surface boundary conditions based on the past
   120 000 years of glacial history. The geometry of the hypothetical DGR
   is adopted from the proposed design. Two types of vertical shaft
   conditions, effective and failed, are included and investigated in this
   study. For the case with effective vertical shafts, the results show
   that the potential radioactive solute transport is diffusion-dominated
   and the transport distance is contained within natural barriers.
   However, the results for the case of a shaft seal failure show that
   future glaciations could potentially lead to significant advection
   transport of radionuclides from the level of the DGR to the shallow
   ground water horizons. From a safety perspective, the shaft structure is
   concluded to be a critical part of the DGR system and needs to be
   considered as an important factor in safety assessments and future
   research.}},

   nodes to efficiently select their managers. The proposed algorithm copes

Abstract = {{A pioneering body of work in the area of mobile opportunistic networks
   has shown that characterizing aggregated inter-contact time between
   mobile nodes is crucial. The most common approaches to study aggregated
   inter-contact time (ICT) in literatures are focused on a certain type of
   mobile wireless networks. Up to now, it still lacks a general approach
   to model the aggregated ICT effectively in different type of networks.
   This paper proposes a new approach to model aggregated ICT based on
   extreme value theory (EVT), which uses the generalized Pareto
   distribution as the unique asymptotic model of the tail distribution.
   Mean excess function is proposed to choose the threshold value and also
   other parameter estimation methods to the statistical model are
   discussed and applied to real mobility traces collected from different
   opportunistic networks, such as social pocket switched networks and
   vehicular ad hoc network. A decision rule based on confidence level of
   parameter is proposed to determine the statistical characteristics of
   aggregated ICT. By performing extensive experiments using EVT-based
   model, the aggregated ICT distributions for different type of networks
   are obtained. To show how well the EVT-based model actually fits the
   data in the tails, the complementary cumulative distribution function in
   a logarithmic scale is used to validate the model. Also according to the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, it illustrates that EVT-based distributions
   with different parameter values fit the tails well at the desired
   significance level 0.05 for the taxi mobility in VANET and the human
   node in the other type of opportunistic networks. Finally, some
   prospective applications based on the statistical model are discussed in
   designing new network protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Task offloading from smartphones to the cloud is a promising strategy to
   enhance the computing capability of smartphones and prolong their
   battery life. However, task offloading introduces a communication cost
   for those devices. Therefore, the consideration of the communication
   cost is crucial for the effectiveness of task offloading. To make task
   offloading beneficial, one of the challenges is to estimate the energy
   consumed in communication activities of task offloading. Accurate energy
   estimation models will enable these devices to make the right decisions
   as to whether or not to perform task offloading, based on the energy
   cost of the communication activities. Simply put, if the offloading
   process consumes less energy than processing the task on the device
   itself, then the task is offloaded to the cloud. To design an
   energy-aware offloading strategy, we develop energy models of the WLAN,
   third-generation, and fourth-generation interfaces of smartphones. These
   models make smartphones capable of accurately estimating the energy cost
   of task offloading. We validate the models by conducting an extensive
   set of experiments on five smartphones from different vendors. The
   experimental results show that our estimation models accurately estimate
   the energy required to offload tasks.}},

Abstract = {{We study the Art Gallery Problem for face guards in polyhedral
   environments. The problem can be informally stated as: how many (not
   necessarily convex) windows should we place on the external walls of a
   dark building, in order to completely illuminate its interior? We
   consider both closed and open face guards (i.e., faces with or without
   their boundary), and we study several classes of polyhedra, including
   orthogonal polyhedra, 4-oriented polyhedra, and 2-reflex orthostacks.
   We give upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of faces required
   to guard the interior of a given polyhedron in each of these classes, in
   terms of the total number of its faces, f. In several cases our bounds
   are tight: left perpendicular f/6 right perpendicular open face guards
   for orthogonal polyhedra and 2-reflex orthostacks, and left
   perpendicular f /4 right perpendicular open face guards for 4-oriented
   polyhedra. Additionally, for closed face guards in 2-reflex orthostacks,
   we give a lower bound of left perpendicular (f + 3)/9 right
   perpendicular and an upper bound of left perpendicular (f + 1)/7 right
   perpendicular.
   Then we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of
   (closed or open) face guards within a factor of 52(log f), even for
   polyhedra that are orthogonal and simply connected. We also obtain the
   same hardness results for polyhedral terrains. Along the way we discuss
   some applications, arguing that face guards are not a reasonable model
   for guards patrolling on the surface of a polyhedron. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{Metal phthalocyanities (MPcs) are versatile conjugated macrocycles that
   have attracted a great deal of interest as active components in modem
   organic electronic devices. In particular, the charge transport
   properties of MPcs, their chemical stability, and their synthetic
   versatility make them ideal candidate materials for use in organic
   thin-film transistors (OTFTs). This article reviews recent progress in
   both the material design and device engineering of MPc-based OTFTs,
   including the introduction of solubilizing groups on the MPcs and the
   surface modification of substrates to induce favorable MPc
   self-assembly. Finally, a discussion on emerging niche applications
   based on MPc OTFTs will be explored, in addition to a perspective and
   outlook on these promising materials in OTFTs. The scope of this review
   is focused primarily on the advances made in the field of MPc-based

Abstract = {{Blood, as a non-Newtonian biofluid, represents the focus of numerous
   studies in the hemorheology field. Blood constituents include red blood
   cells, white blood cells and platelets that are suspended in blood
   plasma. Due to the abundance of the RBCs (40\% to 45\% of the blood
   volume), their behavior dictates the rheological behavior of blood
   especially in the microcirculation. At very low shear rates, RBCs are
   seen to assemble and form entities called aggregates, which causes the
   non-Newtonian behavior of blood. It is important to understand the
   conditions of the aggregates formation to comprehend the blood rheology
   in microcirculation. The protocol described here details the
   experimental procedure to determine quantitatively the RBC aggregates in
   microcirculation under constant shear rate, based on image processing.
   For this purpose, RBCsuspensions are tested and analyzed in 120 x 60 mu
   m poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) microchannels. The RBC-suspensions are
   entrained using a second fluid in order to obtain a linear velocity
   profile within the blood layer and thus achieve a wide range of constant
   shear rates. The shear rate is determined using a micro Particle Image
   Velocimetry (mu PIV) system, while RBC aggregates are visualized using a
   high speed camera. The videos captured of the RBC aggregates are
   analyzed using image processing techniques in order to determine the
   aggregate sizes based on the images intensities.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work the propagation of gaseous detonations in a channel
   with porous walls is investigated experimentally and numerically. The
   main goal of the study is to determine the role of diffusive turbulent
   mixing and transverse waves in controlling the detonation limits in
   channels with porous walls. Detonations in propane-oxygen and
   hydrogen-oxygen-argon mixtures, which are characterized by their
   irregular and regular cellular structures, are considered in the
   experimental and numerical investigations. Euler simulations are
   performed for parameters corresponding to both regular and irregular
   detonations. In the smooth wall region Schlieren photographs of
   hydrogen-oxygen-argon detonation show laminar reaction zones behind the
   main front. In addition, as the detonation propagates over the porous
   wall, due to the mass divergence into the damping section, the frontal
   wave curvature increases. The number of transverse waves decreases in
   the porous section which is caused by the attenuation of the detonation
   wave. In comparison to the stable argon diluted detonations, experiments
   for unstable propane-oxygen detonations illustrate lower wave curvature
   and high turbulence in the reaction zone in the porous section. The
   numerically obtained results for both regular and irregular detonations
   show that close to the porous wall the front curvature increases, a
   finding that is also observed in experiments. If the curvature extends
   to the whole channel width the detonation wave fails to propagate.
   Nevertheless, the numerical critical limit of WP for unstable
   detonations is found to be higher than that of stable detonations, which
   is in contradiction with the experimental results. This discrepancy can
   be explained by the effect of turbulent diffusive mixing in controlling
   the reaction rate in highly unstable detonations, which is not taken
   into account in the current numerical simulations. (C) 2015 The

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Glutamate (GLU) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are important amino
   acid neurotransmitters that, respectively, mediate rapid excitatory and
   inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Serum GLU and GABA levels
   could play a significant role in pathogenesis of the encephalopathic
   state, early detection of autism, and the neurobiology of depression.
   The optimal concentration ratio of GLU and GABA is vital for
   neuroendocrine control, and deviations in their synthesis are linked to
   epilepsy. Additionally, circulating GLU affects GABA levels in striatal
   extracellular fluid. The present work explores the feasibility of
   employing surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy, in conjunction
   with partial least squares (PLS), for simultaneous measurement of
   physiological concentrations of GLU and GABA in their aqueous solution
   and blood serum. A PLS calibration model showed a high coefficient of
   determination (R-2 > 0.98) between the spectral data of GLU and GABA and
   their respective concentrations. The low root mean square error of
   prediction (RMSEP) value was similar to 2.7 mu M, and it established the
   accuracy of the calibration model. The present methodology enabled the
   detection of GLU and GABA as low as 8 mu M. This provides a
   cost-effective alternative to existing techniques for quantification of
   neurotransmitters.}},

Abstract = {{As gravel-bedded rivers fine in the downstream direction, they
   characteristically exhibit an abrupt transition from gravel- to
   sand-bedded conditions. The prevailing theory for why abrupt gravel-sand
   transitions emerge is based on bed load sorting of a bimodal sediment.
   The abruptness is thought to be a consequence of sand overwhelming the
   gravel-sand mixture once it reaches a critical coverage on the bed. The
   role suspension plays in the development of gravel-sand transitions has
   not been fully appreciated. The Fraser River, British Columbia, is an
   archetypical abrupt gravel-sand transition with a diffuse extension
   composed of a sand bed with some patches of gravel. We examine flow,
   shear stress, and suspended sediment flux in the diffuse extension to
   better understand sediment dynamics where the sand bed emerges. Sand is
   carried in suspension upstream of the primary abrupt gravel-sand
   transition, but in the diffuse extension, sand is moved as both bed load
   and suspended load. We do not observe downstream gradients in shear
   stress or suspended sand flux through the diffuse extension that would
   suggest a gradual rain out of sand moving downstream, which raises the
   question, how is the sand bed formed? Sediment advection length scales
   indicate that with the exception of very fine sand that moves as wash
   load in the diffuse extension, fractions coarser than the median sand
   size cannot be carried in suspension for more than one channel width.
   This suggests that sand is deposited en masse at the beginning of the
   diffuse extension, forming a sediment slug at low flood flows that is
   smeared downstream at high flood flows to form the sand reach.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion of turbulent jets in shallow coastal waters has numerous
   engineering applications. The accurate forecasting of the complex
   interaction of these jets with the ambient fluid presents significant
   challenge and has yet to be fully elucidated. In this paper, numerical
   simulation of 30 degrees and 45 degrees inclined dense turbulent jets in
   stationary water have been conducted. These two angles are examined in
   this study due to lower terminal rise heights for 30 degrees and 45
   degrees, this is critically important for discharges of effluent in
   shallow waters compared to higher angles. Mixing behavior of dense jets
   is studied using a finite volume model (OpenFOAM). Five
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models are applied to
   evaluate the accuracy of CFD predictions. These models include two
   Linear Eddy Viscosity Models: RNG k - epsilon, and realizable k -
   epsilon; one Nonlinear Eddy Viscosity Model: nonlinear k - epsilon; and
   two Reynolds Stress Models: LRR and Launder-Gibson. Based on the
   numerical results, the geometrical characteristics of the dense jets,
   such as the terminal rise height, the location of centerline peak, and
   the return point are investigated. The mixing and dilution
   characteristics have also been studied through the analysis of
   cross-sectional concentration and velocity profiles. The results of this
   study are compared to various advanced experimental and analytical
   investigations, and comparative figures and tables are discussed. It has
   been observed that the LRR turbulence model as well as the realizable k
   - epsilon model predicts the flow more accurately among the various
   turbulence models studied herein.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this study was to investigate the integration
   of combined calcium looping (CaL) and chemical looping combustion (CLC)
   with steam gasification of biomass through the utilization of composite
   pellets consisting of limestone, CuO, and a calcium aluminate cement
   binder. In this process, the heat released from the exothermic reduction
   of CuO is used to calcine CaCO3. The technologies can be integrated by
   combining an oxygen carrier such as CuO with limestone within a
   composite pellet, or by cycling CuO and limestone within distinct
   particles. Using a thermogravimetric analyzer, it was demonstrated that
   the use of composite CaO/CuO/calcium-aluminate-cement pellets for
   gasification purposes required oxidation of Cu to be preceded by
   carbonation as opposed to the postcombustion case in which the pellets
   are oxidized prior to carbonation. Composite pellets were thus tested
   under this CO2 capture sequence using varying carbonation conditions
   over multiple cycles. While the pellets exhibited relatively high
   carbonation conversion, the oxidation conversion declined for all tested
   conditions likely because of the CaCO3 product impeding passage of O-2
   molecules to the more remote Cu sites. The reduction in oxygen uptake
   was particularly important when the pellets were precarbonated in the
   presence of steam. Limestone-based pellets and Cu-based pellets were
   subsequently tested in separate CaL and CLC loops, respectively, to
   assess their performance in a dual-loop process. A maximum Cu content of
   50\% could be accommodated in a pellet with calcium aluminate cement as
   support with no loss in oxidation conversion and no observable
   agglomeration.}},

Abstract = {{Network virtualization is a promising new resource management approach
   that allows customized virtual networks (VNs) to be multiplexed on a
   shared physical infrastructure. In this paper, our focus is on the
   embedding of VN resources onto this infrastructure. Since this problem
   is known to be NP-hard, embedding proposals in literature are
   heuristic-based approaches that restrict the problem space in different
   dimensions. Limitations of these proposals are: 1) as embedding of VN
   links and nodes is performed in two separate stages, it may ensue in a
   high blocking of VN requests and a less efficient usage of substrate
   resources; and 2) as pricing of embedding resources is based on linear
   functions, it triggers no competition among VN users in order to
   maximize infrastructure provider profits. These drawbacks motivate us to
   propose a mathematical model that makes use of large-scale optimization
   tools and proposes a Column Generation (CG) formulation of the problem,
   coupled with branch-and-bound technique or rounding-off heuristic. We
   also propose a periodical planning of embedding process where profitable
   VN requests are selected through an auction mechanism. In our
   experiments with different substrate network topologies and many
   different VN request patterns, we show a clear advantage of
   auction-based CG models over present benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal signaling for secrecy rate maximization in Gaussian MIMO wiretap
   channels is considered. While this channel has attracted a significant
   attention recently and a number of results have been obtained, including
   the proof of the optimality of Gaussian signalling, an optimal transmit
   covariance matrix is known for some special cases only and the general
   case remains an open problem. An iterative custom-made algorithm to find
   a globally-optimal transmit covariance matrix in the general case is
   developed in this paper, with guaranteed convergence to a global
   optimum. While the original optimization problem is not convex and hence
   difficult to solve, its minimax reformulation can be solved via the
   convex optimization tools, which is exploited here. The proposed
   algorithm is based on the barrier method extended to deal with a minimax
   problem at hand. Its convergence to a global optimum is proved for the
   general case (degraded or not) and a bound for the optimality gap is
   given for each step of the barrier method. The performance of the
   algorithm is demonstrated via numerical examples. In particular, 20 to
   40 Newton steps are already sufficient to solve the sufficient
   optimality conditions with very high precision (up to the machine
   precision level), even for large systems. Even fewer steps are required
   if the secrecy capacity is the only quantity of interest. The algorithm
   can be significantly simplified for the degraded channel case and can
   also be adopted to include the per-antenna power constraints (instead or
   in addition to the total power constraint). It also solves the dual
   problem of minimizing the total power subject to the secrecy rate
   constraint.}},

Abstract = {{In CANDU reactors some degradation in the CCP (critical channel power,
   or power corresponding to the first occurrence of CHF in any fuel
   channel) will occur with time because of ageing effects such as
   pressure-tube diametral creep, increase in reactor inlet-header
   temperature, increased hydraulic resistance of feeders. To compensate
   for the ageing effects, various options for recovering the loss in CCP
   are described in this paper. They include: (i) increasing the bundle
   heated perimeter, (ii) optimizing the bundle configuration, (iii)
   optimizing core flow and flux distribution, (iv) reducing the bundle
   hydraulic resistance, (v) use of CHF-enhancing bundle appendages, (vi)
   more precise experimentation, and (vii) redefining CHF. The increase in
   CHF power has been quantified based on experiments on full-scale bundles
   and subchannel code predictions. The application of several of these CHF
   enhancement principles has been used in the development of the 43-rod

Abstract = {{Acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) continuous fermentation for
   biobutanol production was simulated and optimized for three case studies
   where the ABE fermentation process was integrated in turn with gas
   stripping, pervaporation, and vacuum separation methods in an attempt to
   partly mitigate the product inhibition effect. Following the
   multi-objective optimization of the three integrated processes, the
   Pareto-optimal solutions were ranked using the net flow method to
   determine the best operating conditions. Results were compared to a
   standard continuous fermentation process without an integrated recovery
   method. The integrated butanol recovery methods improved butanol
   productivity by a factor of 6-10, and sugar conversion by a factor of 3,
   while butanol yield remained essentially unchanged. In addition, the
   butanol average concentration based on all exit streams for the
   fermentation process integrating one of the separation methods is
   approximately 2.25 times higher when compared to the non-integrated
   fermentation process, with values in the vicinity of 30g/L. Results of
   the gas stripping and vacuum fermentation processes were very similar to
   each other but superior to pervaporation in terms of butanol
   productivity and average concentration.}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript, we propose an online trajectory-tracking algorithm
   for nonholonomic Differential-Drive Mobile Robots (DDMRs) in the
   presence of possibly large parametric and measurement uncertainties.
   Most mobile robot tracking techniques that depend on reference RF
   beacons rely on approximating line-of-sight (LOS) distances between
   these beacons and the robot. The approximation of LOS is mostly
   performed using Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements of signals
   propagating between the robot and RF beacons. However, an accurate
   mapping between RSS measurements and LOS distance remains a significant
   challenge and is almost impossible to achieve in an indoor reverberant
   environment. This paper contributes to the development of a neighboring
   optimal control strategy where the two major control tasks, trajectory
   tracking and point stabilization, are solved and treated as a unified
   manner using RSS measurements emitted from Radio Frequency
   IDentification (RFID) tags. The proposed control scheme is divided into
   two cascaded phases. The first phase provides the robot's nominal
   control inputs (speeds) and its trajectory using full-state feedback. In
   the second phase, we design the neighboring optimal controller, where
   RSS measurements are used to better estimate the robot's pose by
   employing an optimal filter. Simulation and experimental results are
   presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed optimal
   feedback controller for solving the stabilization and trajectory
   tracking problems using a DDMR.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Tongue-and-groove plank wood decking is a product that is commonly used
   in post and beam timber construction to transfer gravity loads on roofs
   and floors. Little research or development has been done on plank
   decking since the 1950s and 1960s. An experimental program was
   undertaken at the University of Ottawa's structural laboratory to better
   understand the behavior of plank decking under concentrated loads.
   Destructive tests were conducted on plank decking systems to investigate
   their failure mode characteristics and to quantify their capacity. The
   failure mode of a decking system under a concentrated load was
   consistent with a combination of failure in the decking boards and the
   tongue-and-groove joints. Significant load sharing was observed for
   plank decking under concentrated loads and it was found that the
   assumption of basing the design capacity on that of one board was
   invalid. Placing sheathing on top of a decking system to create a
   diaphragm action had a very significant and positive effect on both the
   stiffness and ultimate capacity of the decking system, which currently
   is ignored in design. The increase in stiffness and capacity can be
   attributed to the sheathing aiding in distributing the concentrated load
   to the unloaded decking elements and preventing the failure of the
   tongue-and-groove joints.}},

Abstract = {{The results of an experimental program investigating the dynamic

   detailed literature review combined with the test results from the
   current project yielded a strong correlation between the increase in

Abstract = {{Motivation is one of the main reasons that a group of patients with the
   same pathology respond differently to a rehabilitation program. It is
   well-known that besides family and close friends, showing the real
   progress to the patients is another significant motivating factor for
   them. This can increase patient's self-satisfaction, engagement, and
   enjoyment. In this study, we have designed and implemented a cloud-based
   rehabilitation system that helps stroke patients enhancing their motor
   functions. Forty five healthy persons (18 females and 27 males) and
   three stroke patients have volunteered to participate in our experiment.
   The derived data from the healthy subjects is served as motion normative
   data that can be used for accurate assessment of hand function. We have
   applied a well-known optical alignment technique, dynamic time warping,
   to compare the time series kinematics patterns of stroke patients with
   those of healthy subjects. The prototype of this system is tested on
   three patients for ten weeks. Results show that patients have improved
   moving and controlling their upper limbs over the course of training.
   Such conclusion is also confirmed clinically; the patients have
   performed the action research arm test under a direct supervision of an
   orthopedic doctor and a professional physiotherapist. Moreover, recovery
   predictions with ARIMA models of stroke patients have given encouraging
   results with percentage of error less than 2.0\% for patient one and
   patient three, and 10.35\% for patient two.}},

Abstract = {{Many cluster-based routing techniques for Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs) have been proposed in the literature. However, most of the
   proposed protocols emphasized on the Cluster Head (CH) selection
   ignoring how the CHs will send the aggregated data back to the Base
   Station (BS). Furthermore, they tend to use nonrealistic parameters and
   assumptions. Such examples include the use of infinite transmission
   range and location awareness. They also used an energy model that is
   fundamentally flawed for modelling radio power consumption in sensor
   networks. In this paper, two Linear Programming (LP) formulations to the
   problems of clustering and routing are presented followed by two
   proposed algorithms for the same based on Particle Swarm Optimization
   (PSO). The clustering algorithm finds the optimal set of CHs that
   maximize the energy efficiency, cluster quality and network coverage.
   The routing algorithm is developed with a novel particle encoding scheme
   and fitness function to find the optimal routing tree that connects
   these CHs to the BS. These two algorithms are then combined into a
   two-tier protocol to provide a complete and practical clustering model.
   The effect of using a realistic network and energy consumption model in
   cluster-based communication for WSN will be investigated. Extensive
   simulations on 50 homogeneous and heterogeneous WSN models are evaluated
   and compared against well-known cluster-based sensor network protocols.
   The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol performs better than
   such protocols in terms of various performance metrics such as
   scalability, Paket Delivery Rate (PDR) at the CHs and delivery of total
   data packets to the BS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of zeolite as a low-cost adsorbent for ammonia removal from
   aqueous solution was studied through batch adsorption experiments. The
   results showed that zeolite was effective in eliminating ammonia from
   aqueous solution. Factorial design and response surface methodology were
   applied to evaluate and optimize the effects of pH, adsorbent dose,
   contact time, temperature and initial ammonia concentration. Low pH
   condition was preferred with the optimum pH found to be 6. High
   adsorbent dose generated high removal rate and low adsorption capacity.
   Results of factorial design and response surface methodology showed that
   temperature was not a significant parameter. The model prediction was in
   good agreement with observed data (R-2 = 0.969). The optimum Q(e) was
   22.90 mg/g achieved at pH 7 and initial TAN concentration of 3000 mg/L.
   The adsorption kinetics followed the Pseudo-second order kinetic model
   (R-2 = 0.998). Equilibrium data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich
   isotherm models with Freundlich model (K-f = 2.24 L/mg, 1/n = 0.28)
   providing a slightly better predication (R-2 = 0.992). The 1/n value of

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study examining the blast load
   performance of ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHPFRC)
   columns. As part of the experimental program nine full-scale columns
   constructed with compact reinforced composite (CRC), a proprietary
   UHPFRC, were tested under simulated blast loading and exposed to varying
   blast pressure impulse combinations using a shock-tube. Parameters
   considered in this study include concrete type, fiber content, fiber
   properties, transverse reinforcement spacing and longitudinal
   reinforcement ratio. The results demonstrate that the use of UHPFRC
   significantly improves the blast performance of reinforced concrete
   columns by reducing maximum and residual displacements, enhancing damage
   tolerance, and eliminating secondary blast fragments. The results also
   indicate that fiber content, fiber properties, seismic detailing and
   longitudinal reinforcement ratio are important factors that can affect
   the blast load behavior and failure mode of UHPFRC columns. The
   analytical investigation examines the suitability of using
   single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) analysis to predict the blast response
   of the UHPFRC columns tested in the research program. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Asymmetric PEI hollow fiber mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with improved
   structure and wetting resistance were fabricated via wet phase inversion
   method. The effects of incorporating hydrophobic MMT into polymer matrix
   in different loadings on the membrane properties were investigated. The
   membranes were characterized in terms of scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), gas permeation
   test, hydrophobicity, wetting resistance and mechanical stability. All
   membranes possessed finger-like structures differing in skin layer
   thickness which increased with clay loading. The results revealed that
   the MMMs have significantly smaller pore size, higher porosity,
   hydrophobicity, LEPw and mechanical stability than plain PEI membrane.
   The membranes were further characterized by CO2 absorption test via
   contactor system using distilled water as absorbent and pure CO2 as
   solute gas. The results showed that the CO2 absorption performance
   increased with addition of MMT nano-clay. The membrane containing 1 wt\%
   MMT recorded the highest absorption flux of 2.35 x 10(-3) mol m(-2)
   s(-1) at the liquid velocity of 3 m s(-1), almost 135\% higher than the
   flux of plain membrane at the same velocity. Comparatively, the flux of
   MMM was superior to several in-house made and commercial membranes. (C)

Abstract = {{Recommender systems are becoming increasingly important not only to
   individual users but also to groups of people. This study focuses on the
   issue of recommending items to communities of interest (i.e., groups)
   that are specifically formed in social media systems. To deal with this
   issue, we introduce a new graph model that profits from fruitful tagging
   information. By using the proposed graph model, we present a stochastic
   method that makes recommendations based on link-structure analysis in a
   probabilistic manner. This method supports two ways of computing group
   ranking scores for items via a preference aggregation approach and via a
   ranking aggregation approach, but ensures the same ranking results. We
   also explore the influence of users and items associated with a group in
   the facilitation of more accurate recommendations. Our empirical
   evaluations with the Last fm dataset corroborate the benefits of our
   graph model on group recommendations, and demonstrate that the proposed
   group recommendation method performs better than existing alternatives.

Abstract = {{Blend membranes comprising sulfonated poly (phenylene ether ether
   sulfone) (SPEES) - charged surface modifying macromolecules (cSMMs) were
   fabricated as an alternative proton exchange membrane (PEM) for H-2/O-2
   fuel cell applications. Prepared membranes were characterized by
   determining the ion exchange capacity, water uptake, proton
   conductivity, oxidative stability and dimensional stability. The water
   uptake of SPEES/cSMM blended membrane was found to be higher than that
   of the pristine SPEES and the Nafion 117 membranes. Proton conductivity
   of the blend membranes is in the range of 10(-3) to 10(-2) S/cm. The
   conductivity of the prepared membranes increases with temperature, in
   particular, the poly (propylene glycol) hydroxy benzene sulfonate
   (PPG-HBS) blended SPEES membrane shows rise in conductivities from 1.61
   x 10(-2) S/cm (25 degrees C) to 5.22 x 10(-2) S/cm (80 degrees C).
   Surface morphology of the membranes was investigated by tapping mode
   atomic force microscopy (AFM), which indicates that the nodule size and
   surface roughness are increased by the incorporation of cSMM into the
   SPEES matrix. Surface modified blended membranes exhibited excellent
   thermal stability and acceptable dimension stability in 80 degrees C,
   which implies that the SPEES/cSMM blended membranes are promising
   materials for PEMFC application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were prepared
   by incorporating fibrous sepiolite modified by
   3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (3-APTMS). Gas transport through the
   prepared MMMs was investigated in detail. Permeabilities of O-2, CO2,
   CH4, and N-2, gases were significantly increased by the addition of 3
   wt.\% of sepiolite. At the same sepiolite loading, the CO2/CH4 and
   CO2/N-2 selectivity of the MMMs at 5 bar were respectively enhanced by
   9\% and 28.2\%, while the O-2/N-2 selectivity did not notably change and
   their values remained nearly constant around 2.5-3. The enhanced
   permeation was attributed to the decreased crystallinity percentage,
   confirmed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, XRD results and microscopic images
   demonstrated that sepiolite fibers were uniformly dispersed in the EVA
   matrix due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between amino groups of
   modified sepiolite and carbonyl groups of EVA. Also, upon the
   incorporation of 3 wt.\% sepiolite, the tensile strength and elongation
   at break were simultaneously enhanced by 46\% and 76\%, respectively.

   numbers, in addition to enhancing the Raman scattering cross section.
   The variation of the band displacement and broadening with the SPPs'
   frequency demonstrates a strongly dispersive phenomenon, ruling out
   chemical, mechanical, and thermal mechanisms. It is believed that strong
   graphene-SPP coupling is responsible for the frequency pulling and

Abstract = {{Novel aliphatic polyurethane (PU) nanohybrids have been prepared using
   varying amount of graphene by dispersing it in the early stage of
   polymerization (in situ) and achieved uniform distribution throughout
   the matrix, required for the improvement of properties. The alteration
   of self-assembly in presence of graphene have been explored through
   X-ray diffraction, small angle neutron scattering, atomic force and
   optical microscopy in the length scale of nanometer, tens of nanometer,
   hundreds of nanometer and micron range, respectively, indicating the
   layer by layer self-assembly of polymer and graphene in nanohybrids. The
   cause of self-assembly has been studied through spectroscopic techniques
   like FTIR and UV-vis measurements revealing strong interaction between
   polymer chain (both hard and soft segments) and graphene which is
   further confirmed from the depression of melting point and decrease in
   heat of fusion with increasing graphene content in the nanohybrids. The
   toughness of nanohybrids in solid state improves considerably as
   compared to pure PU and the mechanical strength in liquid state also
   dramatically increases with graphene content showing a dip at a
   particular frequency depending on the strength of self-assembly (greater
   for higher graphene content nanohybrid) followed by its reformation at
   higher frequency. Sustained drug release has been achieved in presence
   of graphene explaining the phenomena from the greater tortuousity in
   nanohybrids arising from the 2-D graphene and small but uniform cluster
   size of self-assembly as compared to pure PU. The suitability of the
   developed nanohybrids has been testified for its use in biomedical arena
   by checking the complete biocompatibility of the nanohybrids as compared
   to pure PU using bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells. (C) 2015

   intercalated and exfoliated silicate layers for MMM with 1 wt\% loading
   contributed to the enhancement of the membrane morphological and
   mechanical properties. The increase tortuosity in PES/C15A1 reduced the
   CH4 permeance with a significant enhancement for the CO2/CH4 selectivity
   from 22.57 to 46.89. In addition, high degree of intercalation and
   exfoliation of silicate layers was also corroborated by particle size
   measurement (PSM), particle density measurement (PDM) and free-path
   spacing measurement (FPSM) with the increase in aspect ratio, dispersed
   single silicate layers, density and formation of several tactoid classes
   for PES/C15A1. The properties and performance of the MMMs, determined by
   qualitative and quantitative measurements for PES/C15A1 was higher
   compared to PES/C15A5; therefore, the extent of the silicate layers
   dispersion has a significant role in the fabrication of asymmetric MMMs.

Abstract = {{In this study, polyetherimide (PEI) ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were
   fabricated by incorporating different amounts of hydrophilic
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) via the phase inversion technique. The
   PEI/PVP blended membrane showed the highest pure water flux (147.1 L
   m(-2) h(-1)), water content (70.2\%), and surface energy (112.1 mN/m)
   when the 8 wt \% of PVP was blended into the base polymer PEI. This
   particular membrane,,designated as PVP 8, also showed the lowest contact
   angle (56.1 degrees)) hydraulic resistance (2.2 kPa/(L m(-2) h(-1))),
   and shrinkage ratio (4.3\%). The addition of PVP has reduced the tensile
   strength of the PEI membrane because of the decrease in, rigidity. The
   UF experiments with the following proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA),
   egg albumin (EA)) pepsin, and trypsin, had experienced a decrease in
   protein rejection whereas permeate flux increased by increasing PVP
   loading. The BSA adsorption experiment revealed that the adsorbed amount
   of BSA on the surface of the membrane was notably decreased from 0.17 mg
   cm(-2) of neat PEI membrane to 0.08 mg cm(-2) of PVP 8. The flux
   recovery ratio (FRR) experiment also showed that the fouling resistance
   property of the membrane was enhanced with the increment of PVP.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Transcranial direct current simulation (tDCS) is a
   non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has become increasingly
   popular as a potential therapeutic method for a variety of brain
   disorders. Since the treatment outcome may depend on the current density
   delivered to the brain cortical region, a significant challenge is to
   control the current dose reaching the cortical region.
   Objective and methods: This study aims to investigate the effect of
   temperature on current delivery to the brain. We devised a method for
   modulating the amount of current delivered to the brain by changing the
   temperature of the scalp. We developed analytical and numerical models
   that describe the relationship between temperature and electrical
   properties of the scalp based on the following mechanisms: ion mobility
   and blood perfusion in scalp.
   Results and conclusions: The current delivery to brain was investigated
   by changing the temperature between two electrodes that are attached to
   the surface of the scalp, within a tolerable physiological range.
   Results show that by increasing the temperature between two electrodes,
   a higher portion of current is shunted via the scalp and the proportion
   of the current that penetrates the scalp and skull into brain is
   decreased. On the other hand, cooling the area between two electrodes on
   the scalp increases the current delivery to the cortical region of the
   brain. Our results show that cooling the scalp during tDCS can be
   considered as a possible way to effectively control the current delivery
   to the brain and increase the efficacy of tDCS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Preprocessing and parameterizing bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{In several applications of bioimpedance spectroscopy, the measured
   spectrum is parameterized by being fitted into the Cole equation.
   However, the extracted Cole parameters seem to be inconsistent from one
   measurement session to another, which leads to a high standard deviation
   of extracted parameters. This inconsistency is modeled with a source of
   random variations added to the voltage measurement carried out in the
   time domain. These random variations may originate from biological
   variations that are irrelevant to the evidence that we are
   investigating. Yet, they affect the voltage measured by using a
   bioimpedance device based on which magnitude and phase of impedance are
   calculated.
   By means of simulated data, we showed that Cole parameters are highly
   affected by this type of variation. We further showed that singular
   value decomposition (SVD) is an effective tool for parameterizing
   bioimpedance measurements, which results in more consistent parameters
   than Cole parameters. We propose to apply SVD as a preprocessing method
   to reconstruct denoised bioimpedance measurements. In order to evaluate
   the method, we calculated the relative difference between parameters
   extracted from noisy and clean simulated bioimpedance spectra. Both mean
   and standard deviation of this relative difference are shown to
   effectively decrease when Cole parameters are extracted from
   preprocessed data in comparison to being extracted from raw
   measurements.
   We evaluated the performance of the proposed method in distinguishing
   three arm positions, for a set of experiments including eight subjects.
   It is shown that Cole parameters of different positions are not
   distinguishable when extracted from raw measurements. However, one arm
   position can be distinguished based on SVD scores. Moreover, all three
   positions are shown to be distinguished by two parameters,
   R-0/R-infinity and F-c, when Cole parameters are extracted from
   preprocessed measurements. These results suggest that SVD could be
   considered as an effective technique for overcoming the variability of
   bio-impedance spectroscopy measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a 6D RGB-D odometry approach that finds the relative camera

   matching both on the RGB and depth image planes. Furthermore, we feed
   the estimated pose to the highly accurate KinectFusion algorithm, which
   uses a fast ICP (Iterative Closest Point) to fine-tune the
   frame-to-frame relative pose and fuse the depth data into a global
   implicit surface. We evaluate our method on a publicly available RGB-D
   SLAM benchmark dataset by Sturm et al. The experimental results show
   that our proposed reconstruction method solely based on visual odometry
   and KinectFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM system

Abstract = {{An all-fiber approach to terahertz generation using a periodically poled
   optical fiber is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In the
   proposed approach, a continuous-wave THz wave is generated at a
   periodically poled fiber by beating two optical wavelengths from two
   laser sources with the wavelength spacing corresponding to the frequency
   of the THz wave. The key component in the system is the periodically
   poled fiber, which is made by a twin-hole fiber with the fiber core
   residing between two holes. The twin-hole fiber is then thermally poled
   at a temperature of similar to 260 degrees C with a voltage of 3.3 kV
   applied to the silver electrodes inside the two holes to introduce
   second-order nonlinearity. The quasi phase matching (QPM) condition is
   achieved by periodically erasing the thermal poling induced second-order
   nonlinearity with an ultraviolet laser, which enhances the energy
   conversion efficiency. The proposed approach is validated by an
   experiment. The emission of a THz wave centered at 3.8 THz with an
   output power of 0.5 mu W is observed. The frequency tunability between
   2.2 and 3.8 THz is also experimentally demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Regional downstream hydraulic geometry equations are developed using
   flow with a 1.5-year recurrence interval, and corresponding widths,
   depths, and velocities. The study includes 634 gauge stations located
   across Canada and are grouped by characteristics that affect or are
   correlated with bank and bed stability. Jack-knife analysis was done to
   test the predictive capabilities of each grouping. For width prediction,
   grouping the data by geology and vegetative characteristics improved
   predictions in 14 of the 15 categories, with drainage characteristics
   and mode of deposition groupings showing the best results. Grouping the
   data by vegetative characteristics showed the best improvement among
   noncontiguous categories when considering all of the hydraulic geometry
   variables (width, depth, and velocity). These groupings are investigated
   further. The study demonstrates that classifying downstream hydraulic
   geometry equations by local geology and vegetation improves the
   predictive capabilities of the equations. It also shows that though
   regionalization does not need to occur in a contiguous region,
   regionalization still provides better results due to the limited
   resolution of nationally available GIS datasets. As demonstrated in
   previous studies, it is also shown that downstream hydraulic equations
   can be applied to semialluvial rivers. Finally, multiple regression was
   tested with width prediction as a function of flow and up to three
   grouping variables. The interaction of the grouping variables showed no
   improvement in the results.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon photonic crystal waveguides have enabled a range of
   technologies, yet their fabrication continues to present challenges.
   Here, we report on a post-processing method that allows us to tune the
   operational wavelength of slow-light photonic crystal waveguides in
   concert with optical characterization, offsetting the effects of
   hole-radii and slab thickness variations. Our method consist of wet
   chemical surface oxidation, followed by oxide stripping. Theoretical
   modelling shows that the changes in optical behavior were predictable,
   and hence controlled tuning can be achieved by changing the number of
   processing cycles, where each cycle removes approximately 0.25 nm from
   all exposed surfaces, producing a blueshift of 1.6 +/- 0.1 nm in
   operating wavelength. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Affective haptic research is a rapidly growing field. This article
   intends to improve the existing literature and contribute by involving
   consumers directly in the design of a smart haptic jacket by adding

   system is designed for six basic emotions: love, joy, surprise, anger,
   sadness, and fear. Also, it can support several interacts such as a hug,
   poke, tickle or touch. An online survey was designed, based on
   literature, and conducted on 92 respondents, who gave their opinion
   about the physiological impact of emotions and interactions on the human
   body. The results of this survey assisted in the general design and
   implementation of the system. 86 \% of the volunteers who participated
   in the final experiment expressed their interest in the system and said
   that the quality of their multimedia experience was improved through use
   of the jacket. Detailed design architecture is provided, along with the
   details of the hardware and software used for the implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the design and performance of a hybrid system
   consisting of a photocatalytic reactor and a membrane permeation cell.
   Initially, an ultraviolet lamp was installed in the photocatalytic
   reactor to decompose the organic pollutants in the presence of 200 ppm
   titanium-dioxide (TiO2). Individual hydrocarbon pollutants were
   identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of
   wastewater samples. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/multi-walled carbon
   nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposite membranes were fabricated to enhance the
   rejection, flux and fouling resistance for full filtration of pollutants
   from photocatalytic reactor such as decomposed refinery wastewater and
   TiO2 photocatalyst. The nanocomposite membranes were characterized by
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The TiO2 cross-over during permeation
   was detected by using an atomic adsorption spectrometer, which proved
   that TiO2 rejection was more than 99\% for oxidized MWCNT nanocomposite
   membranes. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis was concluded over 90\%
   decomposition which occurred by photocatalytic reaction and practically
   all pollutants were removed by ultrafiltration permeation cell. The
   nanocomposite membrane with 1.0 wt.\% of oxidized MWCNTs incorporated in
   PVDF matrix was found to be the best nanocomposite membrane among all of
   the fabricated membranes for the filtration purposes, due to the over
   99\% rejection and excellent anti-fouling property. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Given a set of events and a set of robots, the dispatch problem is to
   allocate one robot for each event to visit it. In a single round, each
   robot may be allowed to visit only one event (matching dispatch), or
   several events in a sequence (sequence dispatch). In a distributed
   setting, each event is discovered by a sensor and reported to a robot.
   Here, we present novel algorithms aimed at overcoming the shortcomings
   of several existing solutions. We propose pairwise distance based
   matching algorithm (PDM) to eliminate long edges by pairwise exchanges
   between matching pairs. Our sequence dispatch algorithm (SQD)
   iteratively finds the closest event-robot pair, includes the event in
   dispatch schedule of the selected robot and updates its position
   accordingly. When event-robot distances are multiplied by robot
   resistance (inverse of the remaining energy), the corresponding
   energy-balanced variants are obtained. We also present generalizations
   which handle multiple visits and timing constraints. Our localized
   algorithm MAD is based on information mesh infrastructure and local
   auctions within the robot network for obtaining the optimal dispatch
   schedule for each robot. The simulations conducted confirm the
   advantages of our algorithms over other existing solutions in terms of
   average robot-event distance and lifetime.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{74-83}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a generalised complex finite strip method is proposed for
   buckling analysis of thin-walled cold-formed steel structures. The main
   advantage of this method over the ordinary finite strip method is that
   it can handle the shear effects due to the use of complex functions. In
   addition, distortional buckling as well as all other buckling modes of
   cold-formed steel sections like local and global modes can be
   investigated by the suggested complex finite strip method. A combination
   of general loading including bending, compression, shear and transverse
   compression forces is considered in the analytical model. For validation
   purposes, the results are compared with those obtained by the
   Generalized Beam Theory analysis. In order to illustrate the
   capabilities of complex finite strip method in modelling the buckling
   behavior of cold-formed steel structures, a number of case studies with
   different applications are presented. The studies are on both stiffened
   and unstiffened cold-formed steel members. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Functionalization of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanohybrid has
   been performed in template system using two-dimensional layered silicate
   and superior fuel cell membrane has been demonstrated. Sulfonation of
   nanohybrid has been carried out at control condition to maintain the
   mechanical stiffness and roughness of the membrane using chlorosulfonic
   acid and the results have been compared with pure PVDF. The sulfonation
   and ifs relative extent have been confirmed through NMR, FTIR and UV-vis
   measurements showing greater degree of functionalizalion in nanohybrid
   which arises from the specific arrangement of polymer chains on Lop of
   nanoplatelets. The structural change over from common crystallized form
   alpha- to piezoelectric p-phase in nanohybrid has been established and
   the amount of beta-phase has been enhanced after sulfonation as evident
   from deconvoluted XRD patterns and DSC measurement. A plausible
   mechanism has been proposed for this improvement which led to the
   formation of smart membrane. Essential criteria of an ideal membrane
   have been verified through high water uptake, low permeability and
   hydrophilic nature by measuring contact angle. The molecular level
   clustering due to the attachment of sullonate group in main chain has
   been explored which in turn explain the higher barrier property both for
   gas and liquid (fuel). Proton conductivity of functionalized nanohybrid
   has been found to be quite high along with significantly low methanol
   cross over as compared to standard Nafion membrane. I-V characteristics
   of the nanohybrid membrane show high potential at low current density
   with considerably lower value of slope. Membrane electrode assembly
   using functionalized nanohybrid exhibit significantly high value of
   current density and prove its worth for superior fuel cell membrane
   using common thermoplastic polymer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work the degree of fluidized bed electrification and reactor
   wall coating were investigated where a metallocene catalyst and its
   silica support were added to a bed of polyethylene resin and fluidized
   in a carbon steel reactor, 0.1 m in diameter and operating under ambient
   conditions. Tests were conducted to simulate industrial polyethylene
   reactors where both polyethylene and catalyst particles are present
   during the fluidization process. Since majority of the catalyst surface
   area is occupied by its support, the influence of the support was also
   examined. The electrostatic charge measurement technique used was
   similar to that described by Sowinski et al.(1) Results demonstrated
   that both the catalyst and the silica support augmented the fluidized
   bed reactor wall coating due to their inherent large specific charge,
   which was partly gained during their passage through the injection tube.
   This finding demonstrates the possibility that in commercial gas-phase
   polyethylene fluidized bed reactors the catalyst particles could be one
   of the sources leading to reactor wall coating formation and growth.
   Results from both catalyst and its supports were very similar implying
   that the choice of the catalyst support could have a large impact on the
   polyethylene reactor electrostatic charging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Use of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method to model
   nanoplasmonic structures continues to rise -more than 2700 papers have
   been published in 2014 on FDTD simulations of surface plasmons. However,
   a comprehensive study on the convergence and accuracy of the method for
   nanoplasmonic structures has yet to be reported. Although the method may
   be well-established in other areas of electromagnetics, the
   peculiarities of nanoplasmonic problems are such that a targeted study
   on convergence and accuracy is required. The availability of a
   high-performance computing system (a massively parallel IBM Blue Gene/Q)
   allows us to do this for the first time. We consider gold and silver at
   optical wavelengths along with three ``standard{''} nanoplasmonic
   structures: a metal sphere, a metal dipole antenna and a metal bowtie
   antenna - for the first structure comparisons with the analytical
   extinction, scattering, and absorption coefficients based on Mie theory
   are possible. We consider different ways to set-up the simulation
   domain, we vary the mesh size to very small dimensions, we compare the
   simple Drude model with the Drude model augmented with two critical
   points correction, we compare single-precision to double-precision
   arithmetic, and we compare two staircase meshing techniques,
   per-component and uniform. We find that the Drude model with two
   critical points correction (at least) must be used in general.
   Double-precision arithmetic is needed to avoid round-off errors if
   highly converged results are sought. Per-component meshing increases the
   accuracy when complex geometries are modeled, but the uniform mesh works
   better for structures completely fillable by the Yee cell (e.g.,
   rectangular structures). Generally, a mesh size of 0 : 25 nm is required
   to achieve convergence of results to similar to 1\%. We determine how to
   optimally setup the simulation domain, and in so doing we find that
   performing scattering calculations within the near-field does not
   necessarily produces large errors but reduces the computational
   resources required. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Fuel cells are promising alternative in automobile and stationary power
   generation. Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) offer significant
   advantages due to the non-toxicity and renewability of ethanol as well
   as its high power density. Development of the efficient catalysts for
   ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) has attracted great attention and
   represents one of the major challenges in electrocatalysis. Graphene,
   one-atom thick nanocarbon materials, has attracted much attention
   recently in a variety of applications. The sulfonation of graphene is
   able to make it hydrophilic, which enhances its dispersibility in
   aqueous solvents. Furthermore, sulfonation increases the adsorption and
   uniform distribution of the Pt nanoparticles, which increases both the
   electrocatalytic activity and the durability. In this study, theoretical
   calculations demonstrated that the sulfonate functional group can donate
   charge to Pt, enhanced the adsorption energy of Pt, and then reduce the
   adsorption energy of CO on Pt. Then experimentally five kinds of
   Pt/sulfonated-graphene (Pt/sG) catalysts were synthesized via the
   control of pH values during the preparation of five-selected colloidal
   nanoparticles. Among all catalysts, Pt-sG (2.5 nm) has the highest peak
   current density in EOR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Feature Selection for Wearable Smartphone-Based Human Activity
   Recognition with Able bodied, Elderly, and Stroke Patients}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Human activity recognition (HAR), using wearable sensors, is a growing
   area with the potential to provide valuable information on patient
   mobility to rehabilitation specialists. Smartphones with accelerometer
   and gyroscope sensors are a convenient, minimally invasive, and low cost
   approach for mobility monitoring. HAR systems typically pre-process raw
   signals, segment the signals, and then extract features to be used in a
   classifier. Feature selection is a crucial step in the process to reduce
   potentially large data dimensionality and provide viable parameters to
   enable activity classification. Most HAR systems are customized to an
   individual research group, including a unique data set, classes,
   algorithms, and signal features. These data sets are obtained
   predominantly from able-bodied participants. In this paper, smartphone
   accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data were collected from populations
   that can benefit from human activity recognition: able-bodied, elderly,
   and stroke patients. Data from a consecutive sequence of 41 mobility
   tasks (18 different tasks) were collected for a total of 44
   participants. Seventy-six signal features were calculated and subsets of
   these features were selected using three filter-based,
   classifier-independent, feature selection methods (Relief-F,
   Correlation-based Feature Selection, Fast Correlation Based Filter). The
   feature subsets were then evaluated using three generic classifiers
   (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, j48 Decision Tree). Common
   features were identified for all three populations, although the stroke
   population subset had some differences from both able-bodied and elderly
   sets. Evaluation with the three classifiers showed that the feature
   subsets produced similar or better accuracies than classification with
   the entire feature set. Therefore, since these feature subsets are
   classifier-independent, they should be useful for developing and
   improving HAR systems across and within populations.}},

Abstract = {{Antifouling properties of the polysulfone (PSf) and titanium nanotube
   (TNT) mixed matrix ultrafiltration membrane were investigated. The
   membrane was prepared by phase separation process using different
   concentrations of TNT and PSf. The pure water flux, protein removal and
   fouling parameters were studied to analyze the performance of the
   membrane. Morphology of the membrane was characterized by using scanning
   electron microscopy and atdmic force microscopy. The most prominent
   observation was the significant improvement in water flux which
   attributed to improved hydrophilicity. The improvement of hydrophilicity
   was confirmed by water contact angle measurement and porosity
   measurements. This improvement in hydrophilicity is because of hydroxyl
   group present on TNT as determined by ATR-IR spectra. Fouling resistance
   of the membranes assessed by BSA solution filtration showed that 0.3 and
   0.5 wt.\% TNT loading membrane exhibited the best antifouling property
   that resulted in 100\% flux recovery. The results also showed that 03
   wt.\% TNT loading membrane possessed the highest mean pore radius,
   porosity, and water flux. The effect of different washing directions in
   fouling experiment was reported. The perpendicular washing and parallel
   washing were carried out during fouling experiment and effects were
   discussed. The TNT nanocomposite membrane with parallel washing showed
   significant reusability during filtration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Pages = {{109-125}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This article describes the development and validation of a
   trans-critical heat transfer look-up table for water at high subcritical
   and supercritical pressures. As a basis for constructing the table, an
   extensive database of near-critical and supercritical heat transfer
   measurements was compiled and upgraded by the rejection of unreliable or
   inappropriate data, the removal of duplicates and outliers and the
   reduction of data scatter. A large number of available single-phase and
   supercritical heat transfer correlations were assessed against the
   database and the most accurate correlations for each heat transfer
   regime were identified. These correlations were then used to construct a
   skeleton table, which provides values of the heat transfer coefficient
   for a matrix of combinations of 11 values of pressure in the range from
   19 to 30 MPa, 9 values of mass flux in the range from 100 to 5000
   kg/m(2) s,17 values of bulk enthalpy in the range from 1000 to 3000
   kJ/kg, and 8 values of wall superheat in the range from 10 to 500 K. For
   the construction of the final table, the predictions of correlations
   were replaced by experimental values, adjusted following established
   trends to conform to the skeleton table value matrix. Unlike all
   previous prediction methods, the table applies not only to normal heat
   transfer conditions but also to conditions with heat transfer
   deterioration and enhancement, as it includes data obtained under such
   conditions. The table values were further adjusted so that apparent
   discontinuities that were not related to physically plausible changes in
   heat transfer were smoothened out. The predictions of the table were
   assessed statistically against the experimental database. When compared
   to predictions of other available methods, the predictions of the
   present table were found to be generally closer to the experimental
   values for wide ranges of conditions. Finally, the trends followed by
   the smoothened table predictions for different heat transfer modes were
   found to represent more closely the trends of experimental data than
   trends followed by other prediction methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   operating at high gas holdup conditions to provide relevant observations
   for industrial residue hydroprocessors. Scaling approaches for
   three-phase fluidized beds were compared specifically for the scale down
   of the industrially observed high gas holdup conditions. Five
   dimensionless groups, a binary approach for bubble coalescence behaviour
   in multi component liquids, and geometric considerations are proposed to
   achieve dynamic similitude. Experiments were carried out in a 101.6 mm
   diameter co -current gasliquid-solid fluidized bed operating at 0.1 and
   6.5 MPa with liquids that do (e.g., 0.5 wt\% aqueous ethanol) and do not
   (e.g., tap water) significantly inhibit bubble coalescence. A comparison
   of the overall phase holdups for two sizes of cylindrical particles (dsv
   of 1.6 and 3.9 mm) at matching dimensionless groups provided a
   preliminary verification of the proposed scaling approach when bubble
   coalescence was sufficiently and consistently inhibited. The impacts of
   increased liquid viscosity (e.g., greater vacuum distillation tower
   residue feed fraction), varying superficial gas velocity (e.g., inlet
   gas flow rate and gas entrainment in the liquid recycle line), and
   varying superficial liquid velocity (e.g., liquid recycle pump speed)
   were experimentally studied due to their relevance for industrial
   ebullated bed hydroprocessors. For the studied operating conditions, gas
   holdups in the ebullated bed were much greater when bubble coalescence
   was sufficiently inhibited (up to approx. 45 vol\%) compared to a
   coalescing system at equivalent conditions (up to approx. 25 and 35
   vol\% for 0.1 and 6.5 MPa, respectively). When increasing the liquid
   viscosity of the 0.5 wt\% aqueous ethanol, a fraction of the gas was
   entrained in the liquid recirculation, increasing gas holdups and
   exhibiting operational similarities to industrial hythoprocessors. After
   adjusting the gas and liquid flow rates based on the gas recirculation,
   the increased liquid viscosity mainly reduced the solid holdups while
   gas holdups were approximately unchanged. Enhanced bubble break-up or
   bubble coalescence due to particles resulted in an overestimation or
   underestimation, respectively, of the freeboard gas holdups from a
   solids-free estimate based on the bed region phase holdups, where this
   model could not capture the complex bubble-particle interactions.
   Experimental results at high gas holdups conditions were used to
   correlate the bed and freeboard phase holdups based on the proposed
   dimensionless groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The membrane distillation (MD) process is an emerging and
   under-developed technique, which is currently investigated for various
   applications, e.g. desalination and wastewater treatment. As specific
   membranes for MD are not yet commercially available, most of the applied
   membranes for MD experiments are those microfiltration membranes made of
   hydrophobic polymers. Characterization of such kinds of membranes is
   important in order to achieve a better and clearer understanding of
   their performance, which helps to fabricate specific membranes for the
   MD process. In this work, atomic force microscopy, which is a
   high-resolution technique and newly applied for characterization of MD
   membranes, has been used for the topographical study of different
   polytetrafluoroethylene membranes, which are typically recommended for
   various MD applications. The membranes were characterized for their pore
   size, pore size distribution, surface roughness, and nodule aggregate.
   Moreover, the other two important specifications, liquid entry pressure
   and surface hydrophobicity, were measured and compared. A sweeping gas
   MD experimental setup was used for solute rejection evaluation of the
   applied membranes by use of four different feed samples.}},

Abstract = {{Unknown RFID tags appear when the unread tagged objects are moved in or
   tagged objects are misplaced. This paper studies the practically
   important problem of unknown tag detection while taking both
   time-efficiency and energy-efficiency of battery-powered active tags
   into consideration. We first propose a Sampling Bloom Filter which
   generalizes the standard Bloom Filter. Using the new filtering
   technique, we propose the Sampling Bloom Filter-based Unknown tag
   Detection Protocol (SBF-UDP), whose detection accuracy is tunable by the
   end users. We present the theoretical analysis to minimize the time and
   energy costs. SBF-UDP can be tuned to either the time-saving mode or the
   energy-saving mode, according to the specific requirements. Extensive
   simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   protocol. The experimental results show that SBF-UDP considerably
   outperforms the previous related protocols in terms of both
   time-efficiency and energy-efficiency. For example, when 3 or more
   unknown tags appear in the RFID system with 30 000 known tags, the
   proposed SBF-UDP is able to successfully report the existence of unknown
   tags with a confidence more than 99\%. While our protocol runs 9 times
   faster than the fastest existing scheme and reducing the energy
   consumption by more than 80\%.}},

Abstract = {{Three composite nanofiltration (NF) membranes made of different
   substrate materials-polysulfone (PSf), polyethersulfone (PES) and
   polyetherimide (PEI)-were successfully prepared by interfacial
   polymerization technique. Prior to filtration tests, the composite NF
   membranes were characterized using field emission scanning electron
   microscope (FESEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscope (XPS). It was observed that the surface
   properties of composite NF membranes were obviously altered with the use
   of different substrate materials. The separation performance of the
   prepared composite NF membranes was further evaluated by varying
   operating conditions, which included feed salt concentration and
   operating temperature. Experimental results showed that the water flux
   of all TFC membranes tended to decrease with increasing Na2SO4
   concentration in feed solution, due to the increase in feed osmotic
   pressure. Of the three TFC membranes studied, PSf-based membrane
   demonstrated the highest salt rejection but lowest water flux owing to
   its highest degree of polyamide cross-linking as shown in XPS data. With
   respect to thermal stability, PEI-based TFC membrane outperformed the
   rest, overcoming the trade-off effect between permeability and rejection
   when the feed solution temperature was gradually increased from 30 A
   degrees C to 80 A degrees C. In addition, the relatively smoother
   surface of hydrophilic PEI-based membrane when compared with PSf-based
   membrane was found to be less susceptible to BSA foulants, leading to
   lower flux decline. This is because smoother surface of polyamide layer
   would have minimum ``valley clogging,{''} which improves membrane
   anti-fouling resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a plasmonic surface that produces an electrically controlled
   reflectance as a high-speed intensity modulator. The device is conceived
   as a metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor on silicon with its metal
   structured as a thin patch bearing a contiguous nanoscale grating. The
   metal structure serves multiple functions as a driving electrode and as
   a grating coupler for perpendicularly incident p-polarized light to
   surface plasmons supported by the patch. Modulation is produced by
   charging and discharging the capacitor and exploiting the carrier
   refraction effect in silicon along with the high sensitivity of strongly
   confined surface plasmons to index perturbations. The area of the
   modulator is set by the area of the incident beam, leading to a very
   compact device for a strongly focused beam (similar to 2.5 mu m in
   diameter). Theoretically, the modulator can operate over a broad
   electrical bandwidth (tens of gigahertz) with a modulation depth of 3 to
   6\%, a loss of 3 to 4 dB, and an optical bandwidth of about 50 nm. About
   1000 modulators can be integrated over a 50 mm(2) area producing an
   aggregate electro-optic modulation rate in excess of 1 Tb/s. We
   demonstrate experimentally modulators operating at telecommunications
   wavelengths, fabricated as nanostructured Au/HfO2/p-Si capacitors. The
   modulators break conceptually from waveguide-based devices and belong to
   the same class of devices as surface photodetectors and vertical cavity
   surface-emitting lasers.}},

Abstract = {{Previous definitions of a discrete Hankel transform (DHT) have focused
   on methods to approximate the continuous Hankel integral transform. In
   this paper, we propose and evaluate the theory of a DHT that is shown to
   arise from a discretization scheme based on the theory of Fourier-Bessel
   expansions. The proposed transform also possesses requisite
   orthogonality properties which lead to invertibility of the transform.
   The standard set of shift, modulation, multiplication, and convolution
   rules are derived. In addition to the theory of the actual manipulated
   quantities which stand in their own right, this DHT can be used to
   approximate the continuous forward and inverse Hankel transform in the
   same manner that the discrete Fourier transform is known to be able to
   approximate the continuous Fourier transform. (C) 2015 Optical Society

Title = {{Classification of speech-evoked brainstein responses to English vowels}},
Journal = {{SPEECH COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{69-84}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated whether speech-evoked auditory brainstem
   responses (speech ABRs) can be automatically separated into distinct
   classes. With five English synthetic vowels, the speech ABRs were
   classified using linear discriminant analysis based on features
   contained in the transient onset response, the sustained envelope
   following response (EFR), and the sustained frequency following response
   (FFR). EFR contains components mainly at frequencies well below the
   first formant, while the FFR has more energy around the first formant.
   Accuracies of 83.33\% were obtained for combined EFR and FFR features
   and 38.33\% were obtained for transient response features. The EFR
   features performed relatively well with a classification accuracy of
   70.83\% despite the belief that vowel discrimination is primarily
   dependent on the formants. The FFR features obtained a lower accuracy of
   59.58\% possibly because the second formant is not well represented in
   all the responses. Moreover, the classification accuracy based on the
   transient features exceeded chance level which indicates that the
   initial response transients contain vowel specific information. The
   results of this study will be useful in a proposed application of speech
   ABR to objective hearing aid fitting, if the separation of the brain's
   responses to different vowels is found to be correlated with perceptual
   discrimination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the computational power of distributed systems consisting of
   simple autonomous robots moving on the plane. The robots are endowed
   with visual perception, allowing them to see each other, but they do not
   have any means of explicit communication with each other. Further the
   robots are oblivious, meaning that they always act based on their
   current perception of the environment, and they have no memory of the
   past. Such system of simple robots have been studied extensively with
   the objective of achieving coordinated tasks e.g. arranging the robots
   in a line or a circle. In fact it has been shown that obliviousness is
   not a limiting factor to form a single geometric pattern, however
   arbitrary. This paper aims to understand the computational limits
   imposed by the obliviousness of the robots by studying the formation of
   a series of geometric patterns instead of a single pattern. If such a
   series of patterns could be formed this would create some form of memory
   in an otherwise memory-less system. We show that, under particular
   conditions, oblivious robot systems can indeed form a given series of
   geometric patterns starting from any arbitrary configuration. More
   precisely, we characterize the series of patterns that can be formed by
   oblivious robot systems under various additional restrictions such as
   anonymity, asynchrony and lack of common orientation. These results
   provide strong indications that oblivious solutions may be obtained also
   for tasks that intuitively seem to require memory.}},

Abstract = {{With an increasingly aging population, a significant challenge in
   implantology is the creation of biomaterials that actively promote
   tissue integration and offer excellent mechanical properties. Engineered
   surfaces with micro- and nanoscale topographies have shown great
   potential to control and direct biomaterial-host tissue interactions.
   Two simple yet efficient chemical treatments, oxidative nanopatterning
   and anodization, have demonstrated the ability to confer exciting new
   bioactive capacities to commercially pure titanium and Ti-6Al-4V alloy.
   However, the resulting nanoporous and nanotubular surfaces require
   careful assessment in regard to potential adverse effects on the fatigue
   resistance, a factor which may ultimately cause premature failure of
   biomedical implants. In this work, we have investigated the impact of
   oxidative nanopatterning and anodization on the fatigue resistance of
   commercially pure titanium and Ti-6Al-4V. Quantitative (e.g., S-N
   curves) and qualitative analyses were carried out to precisely
   characterize the fatigue response of treated metals and compare it to
   that of polished controls. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging
   revealed the effects of cyclic loading on the fracture surface and on
   the structural integrity of chemically grown nanostructured oxides.
   Results from this study reinforce the importance of mechanical
   considerations in the development and optimization of micro- and
   nanoscale surface treatments for metallic biomedical implants. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The effect of Pt average particle size (1.9-6.7 nm) on the catalytic
   activity of 909 ppm carbon monoxide and ethylene oxidation by O2- froin
   yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was studied at 25-400 degrees C. The
   results show that CO and C2H4 oxidation in the absence of oxygen in the
   gas feed is strongly size dependent in analogy to their catalytic
   oxidation in oxygen-rich environment. Without oxygen, the local
   nano-galvanic cell mechanism is proposed, where CO and C2H4
   electrooxidation at the three-phase boundary (tpb) is accompanied by
   partial surface electroreduction of zirconia. The smallest Pt
   nanoparticles (NPs) (1.9 +/- 0.4 nm) have higher TOF, higher intrinsic
   rates and lower activation energies compared with the larger Pt NPs (4.4
   +/- 03 nm), for example 30.3 vs. 64.8 kJ mol(-1) for CO and 12.5 vs.
   38.4 kJ mol(-1) for C2H4 oxidation, respectively. In the presence of
   oxygen, the catalytic oxidation occurs at significantly lower
   temperatures than without O-2. In this case, the oxidation reaction
   takes place via a sacrificial promoter-type mechanism, proposed earlier
   for catalyst nanoparticles supported on YSZ, where thermally induced O2-
   backspillover migrates from YSZ to the gas-exposed surface of Pt NPs in
   parallel with the electrooxidation reaction at tpb. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring applications for wireless sensor and actor
   networks rely on position estimation in order to process or evaluate the
   observed data. The absence of efficient positioning techniques for
   sensor nodes operating in harsh environments calls for novel approaches.
   While monitoring the Amazon river, unprecedented characteristics of the
   river and its surroundings challenge the node communications and
   drifting of the nodes makes it difficult to use the existing positioning
   methods. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-hop
   localization technique that takes advantage of sensor mobility with
   local information exchange. The collected information is used to enrich
   the environmental data with location information. The maximum hop
   distance for actor affiliation is also adapted according to network
   characteristics to improve energy consumption behavior. The motion of
   the sensor nodes follows the advection of the fluid parcels in the
   river, which is modeled as a combination of a central streamline with a
   meandering motion around the rough surface. This translates into a
   stretching topology with correlated motion for sensor nodes. Through
   extensive simulations, we show that the nodes can be efficiently
   positioned using the proposed approach, as our technique is compliant
   with the movement patterns of the sensor nodes in the realistic mobility
   model of the river.}},

Abstract = {{The development and structure of flows in eccentric annular channels and
   their dependence on inlet conditions, inner-to-outer diameter ratio d/D,
   eccentricity e = 2 Delta y/(D - d), where Delta y is the distance
   between the axes of the inner and outer cylinders, and Reynolds number
   Re, based on the hydraulic diameter and the bulk velocity, were studied
   experimentally, with focus on the phenomena of gap instability and the
   resulting vortex street. Experimental conditions covered a Reynolds
   number range between 0 and 19 000, an eccentricity range from 0 to 0.9
   and inner-to-outer diameter ratios equal to 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75. Much of
   the discussion is based on measurements in the middle of the narrow
   annular gap, where the phenomena of interest could be observed most
   vividly. In the range Re < 10 000, the Strouhal number, the normalized
   mid-gap axial flow velocity and the normalized axial and cross-flow
   fluctuations at mid-gap were found to increase with increasing Re and to
   depend strongly on inlet conditions. At higher Reynolds numbers,
   however, these parameters reached asymptotic values that were less
   sensitive to inlet conditions. We constructed a map for the various
   stages of periodic motions versus eccentricity and Reynolds number and
   found that for e < 0.5 or Re < 1100 the flow was unconditionally stable,
   as far as gap instability is concerned. For e <= 0.5, transition to
   turbulence occurred at Re approximate to 6000, whereas, for 0.6 <= e <=
   0.9, the critical Reynolds number for the formation of periodic motions
   was found to increase with eccentricity from 1100 for e = 0.6 to 3800
   for e = 0.9.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption is one of the most energy efficient techniques for butanol
   separation from dilute fermentation broths. To develop an efficient
   butanol adsorption process, adsorption and desorption are equally
   important since it is paramount to be able to desorb the adsorbed
   butanol to produce a high concentration butanol product. Although there
   are a good number of investigations done to find suitable adsorbents for
   this process, only few studies considered the desorption process. In
   this study, activated carbon F-400 was used as the butanol adsorbent
   since it has a high adsorption rate and capacity and is selective to
   butanol in the presence of other fermentation broth components. The
   thermal desorption process was performed in adsorption-desorption cycles
   both for butanol-water and acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) model
   solutions. The results for 1.5 wt\% feed butanol-water binary solutions
   showed that the butanol adsorption capacity and the recovery of butanol
   were fairly constant (around 302 mg/g and 84 \%, respectively) in
   subsequent adsorption-desorption cycles confirming that all the amount
   of adsorbed butanol is desorbed and the adsorption column could preserve
   its initial adsorption capacity in different cycles. Similar performance
   was obtained for butanol separation from the ABE model solution
   containing 1.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4 and 0.4 wt\% butanol, acetone,
   ethanol, butyric acid, acetic acid, glucose and xylose, respectively.
   The adsorption capacity and recovery for butanol were 170 mg/g and 80
   \%, respectively.}},

Title = {{Efficient detection of faulty nodes with cuckoo search in t-diagnosable
   systems}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{52-64}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{System-level fault diagnosis (SLFD) deals with the detection of all
   faulty nodes in a set of networked units in a parallel or distributed
   system. By allowing nodes to test each other under well-defined
   conditions and carefully inspecting the collection of test outcomes, the
   true set of damaged nodes can be located. In this paper, we tackle the
   SLFD problem by using a recently proposed bio-inspired optimization
   method: the Cuckoo Search. Two formalizations of this scheme were
   independently put forth by Yang and Deb {[}16] and Rajabioun {[}17] for
   numerical optimization. In this work, we have adapted both methods to
   work in the combinatorial search space induced by SLFD and we have
   tested them against other nature-inspired metaheuristics in presence of
   a class of distributed systems called t-diagnosable systems, since they
   are easy to generate and eliminate ambiguity in the optimization-driven
   fault diagnosis. Three well-known test models (i.e. PMC, symmetric and
   asymmetric comparison) that define how the system units test one another
   were employed in the simulations. The empirical results reveal that the
   two cuckoo-based approaches outperformed their competitors in terms of
   solution quality and spatio-temporal requirements, with Yang and Deb's
   version achieving notable improvements over Rajabioun. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) represents a constellation of
   anatomical and clinical features, but definitive diagnosis is often
   difficult. The high prevalence of cam deformity of the femoral head in
   the asymptomatic population as well as clinical factors leading to the
   onset of symptoms raises questions as to what other factors increase the
   risk of cartilage damage and hip pain.
   The purpose was to identify any differences in anatomical parameters and
   squat kinematics among symptomatic, asymptomatic, and control
   individuals and if these parameters can determine individuals at risk of
   developing symptoms of cam FAI.
   Forty-three participants (n = 43) were recruited and divided into three
   groups: symptomatic (12), asymptomatic (17), and control (14).
   Symptomatic participants presented a cam deformity (identified by an
   elevated alpha angle on CT images), pain symptoms, clinical signs, and
   were scheduled for surgery. The other recruited volunteers were blinded
   and unaware whether they had a cam deformity. After the CT data were
   assessed for an elevated alpha angle, participants with a cam deformity
   but who did not demonstrate any clinical signs or symptoms were
   considered asymptomatic, whereas participants without a cam deformity
   and without clinical signs or symptoms were considered healthy control
   subjects. For each participant, anatomical CT parameters (axial alpha
   angle, radial alpha angle, femoral head-neck offset, femoral neck-shaft
   angle, medial proximal femoral angle, femoral torsion, acetabular
   version) were evaluated. Functional squat parameters (maximal squat
   depth, pelvic range of motion) were determined using a motion capture
   system. A stepwise discriminant function analysis was used to determine
   which of the parameters were most suitable to classify each participant
   with their respective subgroup.
   The symptomatic group showed elevated alpha angles and lower femoral
   neck-shaft angles, whereas the asymptomatic group showed elevated alpha
   angles in comparison with the control group. The best discriminating
   parameters to determine symptoms were radial alpha angle, femoral
   neck-shaft angle, and pelvic range of motion (p < 0.001).
   In the presence of a cam deformity, indications of a decreased femoral
   neck-shaft angle and reduced pelvic range of motion can identify those
   at risk of symptomatic FAI.

Abstract = {{A shear deformable theory and a computationally efficient finite element
   are developed to determine the lateral torsional buckling capacity of

   is then used to provide solutions for simply supported beams,
   cantilevers, and developing moment gradient factors for the case of
   linear moments. The formulation is shown to successfully capture
   interaction effects between axial loads and bending moments as well as
   the load height position effect. The validity of the element is verified

Abstract = {{Since its discovery, little work has been done on the vanadium
   chalcogenide VS4. Recently, a facile method for synthesizing VS4 was
   discovered using a graphitic template. Here we show for the first time
   that template free VS4 can be synthesized in a hydrothermal reaction by
   controlling key parameters of the reaction mainly time, temperature, and
   pH. The phase and morphology of VS4 materials are tracked carefully
   using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   under each reaction condition. It is found that lower reaction
   temperatures and longer reaction times are sufficient to form VS4
   crystals, while variations in pH do not appear to greatly affect VS4
   crystallinity but rather surface area and morphology. By use of
   optimized reaction parameters, further characterization shows template
   free VS4 to be comparable with VS4 templated with graphene oxide.
   Initial photo catalytic testing of these materials shows that VS4 has
   the potential to be usectin photocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Toward devising a new efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol
   that overcomes the shortcomings of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard MAC, we
   work on exploiting the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) feature in a more
   efficient fashion. This paper proposes the Variable CCA MAC protocol; a
   new MAC protocol that increases the number of CCAs performed by a node
   beyond the standard value of two. We develop a Markov-based mathematical
   model that describes the functionality of this new protocol. We also
   validate our mathematical model through conducting extensive simulations
   that focus on a rich set of performance parameters, including the
   probability of collision, throughput, channel idle time, channel
   collision time, energy consumption, delay, and reliability. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Surface modified polysulfone (PSf) hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) using
   surface modifying macromolecules (SMM) were spun with air-gaps of 0-50
   cm. Morphological analysis of the prepared fibers were carried out using
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
   The wetting resistances of the membranes were determined by critical
   water entry pressure (CEPw) and contact angle (CA) measurements. The
   HMFs were further subjected to CO2 capture by membrane contactor (MC)
   where water was used as absorbent. The test results indicated that both
   CEPw and CA showed a maximum value at 15 cm air-gap distance. The
   maximum He permeation was also achieved at 15 cm air-gap. The CO2 flux
   of prepared membranes showed a maximum of 4.79 x 10(-3) mol/m(2) s at
   the absorbent flow rate of 300 ml/min. It was deduced that both He
   permeation and CO2 absorption flux were governed by the HFM surface
   porosity. The long-term stability test revealed the reduction of 25\% in
   CO2 flux during the first 55 h of operation for the PSf membrane
   prepared at 15 cm air-gap. This study indicated that the surface
   modified HFMs prepared using an appropriate air-gap could be a promising
   option to increase membrane performance in MC systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Both climate and land use changes can influence water quality and
   quantity in different ways. Thus, for predicting future water quality
   and quantity trends, simulations should ideally account for both
   projected climate and land use changes. In this paper, land use
   projections and climate change scenarios were integrated with a
   hydrological model to estimate the relative impact of climate and land
   use projections on a suite of water quality and quantity endpoints for a
   Canadian watershed. Climatic time series representing SRES change
   scenario A2 were generated by downscaling the outputs of the Canadian
   Regional Climate Model (version 4.1.1) using a combination of quantile
   quantile transformation and nearest neighbor search. The SWAT (Soil and
   Water Assessment Tool) model was used to simulate streamflow, nitrogen
   and phosphorus loading under different climate and land use scenarios.
   Results showed that a) climate change will drive up maximum monthly
   streamflow, nitrate loads, and organic phosphorus loads, while
   decreasing organic nitrogen and nitrite loads; and b) land use changes
   were found to drive the same water quality/quantity variables in the
   same direction as climate change, except for organic nitrogen loads, for
   which the effects of the two stressors had a reverse impact on loading.

Abstract = {{We present a systematic design procedure of photonic crystal (PhC)

   describe the spectroscopic performance of PhC superprism structures, and
   an optimum PhC structure for spectroscopic applications should have
   large angular group dispersion over a large bandwidth, i.e., a flat-top
   dispersion profile. We demonstrate the advantage of such a new design
   consideration by optimizing the geometry of a two-dimensional
   parallelogram-lattice PhC superprism structure. The performance of such
   a superprism spectrometer is further analyzed numerically using
   finite-difference time-domain simulations, which out-performs current

   predicting the variation of the modulus of elasticity with respect to

Title = {{A Fibrin Matrix Promotes the Differentiation of EMSCs Isolated from

Journal = {{MOLECULES AND CELLS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Because Schwann cells perform the triple tasks of myelination, axon
   guidance and neurotrophin synthesis, they are candidates for cell
   transplantation that might cure some types of nervous-system
   degenerative diseases or injuries. However, Schwann cells are difficult
   to obtain. As another option, ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) can be
   easily harvested from the nasal respiratory mucosa. Whether fibrin, an
   important transplantation vehicle, can improve the differentiation of
   EMSCs into Schwann-like cells (SLCs) deserves further research. EMSCs
   were isolated from rat nasal respiratory mucosa and were purified using
   anti-CD133 magnetic cell sorting. The purified cells strongly expressed
   HNK-1, nestin, p75(NTR), S-100, and vimentin. Using nuclear staining,
   the MTT assay and Western blotting analysis of the expression of
   cell-cycle markers, the proliferation rate of EMSCs on a fibrin matrix
   was found to be significantly higher than that of cells grown on a
   plastic surface but insignificantly lower than that of cells grown on
   fibronectin. Additionally, the EMSCs grown on the fibrin matrix
   expressed myelination-related molecules, including myelin basic protein
   (MBP), 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and
   galactocerebrosides (GalCer), more strongly than did those grown on
   fibronectin or a plastic surface. Furthermore, the EMSCs grown on the
   fibrin matrix synthesized more neurotrophins compared with those grown
   on fibronectin or a plastic surface. The expression level of integrin in
   EMSCs grown on fibrin was similar to that of cells grown on fibronectin
   but was higher than that of cells grown on a plastic surface. These
   results demonstrated that fibrin not only promoted EMSC proliferation
   but also the differentiation of EMSCs into the SLCs. Our findings
   suggested that fibrin has great promise as a cell transplantation
   vehicle for the treatment of some types of nervous system diseases or
   injuries.}},

Title = {{Linking the spatial distribution of bed load transport to morphological

Volume = {{120}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides novel observations linking the connections between
   spatially distributed bed load transport pathways, hydraulic patterns,
   and morphological change in a shallow, gravel bed braided river. These
   observations shed light on the mechanics of braiding processes and
   illustrate the potential to quantify coupled material fluxes using
   remotely sensed methods. The paper focuses upon a 300m long segment of
   the Rees River, New Zealand, and utilizes spatially dense observations
   from a mobile acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) to map depth,
   velocity, and channel topography through a sequence of high-flow events.
   Apparent bed load velocity is estimated from the bias in aDcp bottom
   tracking and mapped to indicate bed load transport pathways. Terrestrial
   laser scanning (TLS) of exposed bar surfaces is fused with the aDcp
   surveys to generate spatially continuous digital elevation models, which
   quantify morphological change through the sequence of events. Results
   map spatially distributed bed load pathways that were likely to link
   zones of erosion and deposition. The coherence between the channel
   thalweg, zone of maximum hydraulic forcing, and maximum apparent bed
   load pathways varied. This suggests that, in places, local sediment
   supply sources exerted a strong control on the distribution of bed load,
   distinct from hydraulic forcing. The principal braiding mechanisms
   observed were channel choking, leading to subsequent bifurcation.
   Results show the connection between sediment sources, pathways, and
   sinks and their influence on channel morphology and flow path
   directions. The methodology of coupling spatially dense aDcp surveys
   with TLS has considerable potential to understand connections between
   processes and morphological change in dynamic fluvial settings.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric nanocomposites embedded with nontoxic antimicrobial agents
   have recently gained potential industrial significance, mainly for their
   applicability to preserve food quality and ensure safety. In this study,
   a poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT)/organoclay (CMMT) based
   nanocomposite film doped with sodium benzoate (SB) as antimicrobial
   agent was prepared by a solution mixing process. A homogenous dispersion
   of organoclay (cetyltrimethylammonium-modified montmorillonite {[}CMMT])
   in PBAT matrix was observed by X-ray diffraction and transmission
   electron microscopy. PBAT/CMMT nanocomposite film showed higher barrier
   properties against water and methanol vapor compared to the PBAT film.
   The release of SB from PBAT and its nanocomposite film was measured and
   the relevant data were fitted to the Weibull model. The higher values of
   Weibull's shape factor and scale parameter as corroborated by
   experimental findings indicated faster rate of SB release from
   PBAT/CMMT/SB nanocomposite film, when compared to the pristine PBAT
   film. Bacterial inhibition studies were accomplished against 2 food
   pathogenic bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, by
   determining the zone of inhibition and corresponding growth profiles.
   Both bacterial inhibition studies and growth profiles established that
   PBAT/CMMT/SB demonstrated better antimicrobial activity than PBAT/SB
   film. Therefore, PBAT/CMMT/SB nanocomposite film can be used for food
   packaging application as it showed good barrier properties and
   antimicrobial activity against food pathogenic bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{A new strategy to prepare an ultra non-fouling
   SU-8/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) hybrid microfluidic system is
   presented. We report a simple method to bond both SU-8 and PDMS surfaces
   to prepare the hybrid microfluidic device and then simultaneously modify
   both SU-8 and PDMS surfaces using poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM), a highly
   hydrophilic dendrimer to enhance non-fouling properties of the hybrid
   microfluidic channel. Water contact angle, atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to characterize and
   confirm surface modifications. Finally the non-fouling performance of
   the resulting microfluidic system is tested using both microbeads and
   Escherichia coli O157:H7 bacterial cells. We demonstrate that the
   obtained hybrid microfluidic system shows a significant microbead
   adsorption suppression of 99.7\%, an ultra non-fouling performance that
   has not been reported in the literature before; in addition, 95\%
   bacteria surface adsorption suppression is also obtained. Considering
   the significantly improved non-fouling performance and the ease of
   preparing the hybrid microfluidic system, we anticipate that this
   strategy will find wide applications in biosensing and detection. (C)

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the structures generated by the vortex shedding mechanism
   in turbulent axisymmetric wakes of non-axisymmetric plates, including a
   square plate and a series of fractal plates, and compare the results to
   a disk. For a given characteristic length l, all plates have the same
   frontal area A, since l = A(0.5), but the length of the perimeter and
   the irregularity of the perimeter were varied in a fractal manner thus
   allowing us to investigate the effect of boundary conditions.
   Measurements were taken over a large range of downstream and radial
   distances in order to obtain a more robust measure for the vortex
   shedding energy. It was found that the fractal plates are able to reduce
   the vortex shedding energy by as much as 60\% compared to the disk and
   square plates. It was also found that the frequency at which the vortex
   shedding structures are generated and the manner in which they organise
   themselves in the wake are independent of the boundary conditions of the
   wake generator. The results suggest that the main function of the
   multi-scale segments around the perimeter of the plates is to
   re-distribute the energy to a broader range of scales in the flow, which
   could explain the previously observed increase in drag coefficient for
   the fractal edged plates. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the state-of-the art dynamic sign language
   recognition (DSLR) system for smart home interactive applications. Our
   novel DSLR system comprises two main subsystems: an image processing
   (IP) module and a stochastic linear formal grammar (SLFG) module. Our IP
   module enables us to recognize the individual words of the sign language
   (i.e., a single gesture). In this module, we used the bag-of-features
   (BOFs) and a local part model approach for bare hand dynamic gesture
   recognition from a video. We used dense sampling to extract local 3-D
   multiscale whole-part features. We adopted 3-D histograms of a gradient
   orientation descriptor to represent features. The k-means++ method was
   applied to cluster the visual words. Dynamic hand gesture classification
   was conducted using the BOFs and nonlinear support vector machine
   methods. We used a multiscale local part model to preserve temporal
   context. The SLFG module analyzes the sentences of the sign language
   (i.e., sequences of gestures) and determines whether or not they are
   syntactically valid. Therefore, the DSLR system is not only able to rule
   out ungrammatical sentences, but it can also make predictions about
   missing gestures, which, in turn, increases the accuracy of our
   recognition task. Our IP module alone seals the accuracy of 97\% and
   outperforms any existing bare hand dynamic gesture recognition system.
   However, by exploiting syntactic pattern recognition, the SLFG module
   raises this accuracy by 1.65\%. This makes the aggregate performance of
   the DSLR system as accurate as 98.65\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the combination of tensor product (TP)-based model

   system (CS) structure. A novel two-step design approach is suggested. A
   parallel distributed compensation technique is used in the first step in
   the TP-based design of the inner state feedback control loops which is
   next characterized by simple models using equivalent state feedback
   matrices. The modulus optimum method and the modal equivalent principle
   are used in the second step to design the Mamdani PI-fuzzy controller in
   the outer control loops. The cost effective feature of the original
   cascade CS combination concerns the simplicity of the CS structure, of
   the controllers and of the design approach. The presentation is focused
   on the level control in horizontal three tank systems where two cascade
   CS structures are separately designed to control two water levels. The
   efficiency of the cascade CS structure is proved by real-time
   experimental results for a laboratory three tank system. Comparisons
   with the Mamdani PI-fuzzy CS and with the cascade combination of TP and

Abstract = {{Data centers play a crucial role in the delivery of cloud services by
   enabling on-demand access to the shared resources such as software,
   platform and infrastructure. Virtual machine (VM) allocation is one of
   the challenging tasks in data center management since user requirements,
   typically expressed as service-level agreements, have to be met with the
   minimum operational expenditure. Despite their huge processing and
   storage facilities, data centers are among the major contributors to
   greenhouse gas emissions of IT services. In this paper, we propose a
   holistic approach for a large-scale cloud system where the cloud
   services are provisioned by several data centers interconnected over the
   backbone network. Leveraging the possibility to virtualize the backbone
   topology in order to bypass IP routers, which are major power consumers
   in the core network, we propose a mixed integer linear programming
   (MILP) formulation for VM placement that aims at minimizing both power
   consumption at the virtualized backbone network and resource usage
   inside data centers. Since the general holistic MILP formulation
   requires heavy and long-running computations, we partition the problem
   into two sub-problems, namely, intra and inter-data center VM placement.
   In addition, for the inter-data center VM placement, we also propose a
   heuristic to solve the virtualized backbone topology reconfiguration
   computation in reasonable time. We thoroughly assessed the performance
   of our proposed solution, comparing it with another notable MILP
   proposal in the literature; collected experimental results show the
   benefit of the proposed management scheme in terms of power consumption,
   resource utilization and fairness for medium size data centers.

Abstract = {{Controlled tile drainage (CTD) can reduce pollutant loading. The
   Annualized Agricultural Nonpoint Source model (AnnAGNPS version 5.2) was
   used to examine changes in growing season discharge, sediment, nitrogen,
   and phosphorus loads due to CTD for a similar to 3900-km(2)
   agriculturally dominated river basin in Ontario, Canada. Two tile drain
   depth scenarios were examined in detail to mimic tile drainage control
   for flat cropland: 600 mm depth (CTD600) and 200 mm (CTD200) depth below
   surface. Summed for five growing seasons (CTD600), direct runoff, total
   N, and dissolved N were reduced by 6.6, 3.5, and 13.7\%, respectively.
   However, five seasons of summed total P, dissolved P, and total
   suspended solid loads increased as a result of CTD600 by 0.96, 1.6, and
   0.23\%. The AnnAGNPS results were compared with mass fluxes observed
   from paired experimental watersheds (250, 470 ha) in the river basin.
   The ``test{''} experimental watershed was dominated by CTD and the
   ``reference{''} watershed by free drainage. Notwithstanding
   environmental/land use differences between the watersheds and basin,
   comparisons of seasonal observed and predicted discharge reductions were
   comparable in 100\% of respective cases. Nutrient load comparisons were
   more consistent for dissolved, relative to particulate water quality
   endpoints. For one season under corn crop production, AnnAGNPS predicted
   a 55\% decrease (CTD600) in dissolved N from the basin. AnnAGNPS v. 5.2
   treats P transport from a surface pool perspective, which is appropriate
   for many systems. However, for assessment of tile drainage management
   practices for relatively flat tile-dominated systems, AnnAGNPS may
   benefit from consideration of P and particulate transport in the
   subsurface.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmons have raised much interest over the past few decades in

   gratings supporting long-range surface plasmon polaritons, constructed

   interrogation. Detection limits of similar to 10(-6) RIU and similar to
   8 pg/mm(2) are predicted for bulk and surface sensing, respectively,
   with corresponding figures of merit of similar to 1000 RIU-1 and similar
   to 0.2 nm(-1). Third-order gratings are good choices because they have
   essentially the same sensitivity as first-order gratings but over a
   narrower bandwidth, and they are easier to fabricate due to their larger

Abstract = {{Demand-management programs intend to maintain supply-demand balance and
   reduce the total energy cost. In this paper, we propose a user-aware
   demand-management approach that manages residential loads while taking
   into consideration user preferences. Maximizing users' savings and
   comfort can be two contradicting objectives. We identify a trade-off
   between these two objectives and propose an energy consumption
   optimization model, as well as a game theoretic approach to take this
   trade-off into account. User comfort is modeled in a simple yet
   effective way that considers waiting time, type of appliance, as well as
   a weight factor to prioritize comfort over savings. The proposed game is
   based on a modified regret matching procedure and borrows advantages of
   both centralized and decentralized schemes. Through simulations, we show
   that the proposed approach is scalable, converges in acceptable times,
   introduces a very limited amount of overhead in the system, achieves
   very high cost savings, and preserves users' preferences. Extensive
   simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the optimization
   model and the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{A closed-form solution and finite-element formulation are developed for
   the dynamic analysis of thin-walled members with asymmetric open
   sections subjected to harmonic forces. The dynamic equations of motion
   and associated boundary conditions are derived from Hamilton's
   principle. The formulation is based on a generalized Vlasov-Timoshenko
   beam theory and accounts for the effects of shear deformation caused by
   bending and warping and translational and rotary inertia effects. It
   also captures the effects of flexural-torsional coupling caused by
   cross-sectional asymmetry. From this a general closed-form solution is
   obtained. A family of shape functions is then developed based on the
   exact solution of the coupled field equations and is used to formulate a
   beam finite element. The new element has two nodes with six degrees of
   freedom per node and successfully captures the coupled bending-torsional
   static and steady-state responses of asymmetric thin-walled members
   under harmonic forces. Results based on the closed-form solution and
   finite-element formulation are assessed and validated against other

Abstract = {{The ballistic impact was numerically modeled for AISI 450 steel struck
   by a 17.3 g ogive nose WC-Co projectile using Abaqus/Explicit. The model
   was validated using experimental results and data for different
   projectiles and metal targets. The Abaqus ductile-shear, local principal
   strain to fracture, and absorbed strain energy at failure criteria were
   investigated. Due to the highly dynamic nature of ballistic impacts, the
   absorbed strain energy approach posed serious challenges in estimating
   the effective deformation volume and yielded the largest critical plate
   thicknesses for through-thickness penetration (failure). In contrast,
   the principal strain criterion yielded the lowest critical thicknesses
   and provided the best agreement with experimental ballistic test data
   with errors between 0 and 30\%. This better accuracy was due to early
   failure definition when the very first mesh at the target back side
   reached the strain to fracture, which compensated for the overall model
   overestimation. The ductile-shear criterion yielded intermediate results
   between those of the two comparative approaches. In contrast to the
   ductile-shear criterion, the principal strain criterion requires only
   basic data readily available for practically all materials. Therefore,
   it is a viable alternative for an initial assessment of the ballistic
   performance and pre-screening of a large number of new candidate
   materials as well as for supporting the development of novel armor

   free-standing structure located downstream in the flume. Simultaneously,
   the authors analyze their propagation characteristics. Time-histories of

   placed in the downstream flume section are analyzed to further
   understand the development of hydrodynamic loading. Furthermore, an

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are no longer a futuristic promise
   but rather an attainable technology. The majority of services envisioned
   for VANETs either require the provisioning of multimedia support or have
   this support as an extremely beneficial feature. However, the highly
   dynamic topology of VANETs poses a demanding challenge for the
   fulfillment of the stringent requirements for video streaming. In this
   paper, we provide a deep understanding of the issue of unicast video
   streaming over VANETs and propose a novel protocol, VIRTUS. In video
   streaming, many packets are transmitted consecutively in a short period
   of time. VIRTUS takes this into consideration and extend the duration of
   the decision of nodes to forward packets from a single transmission to a
   time window. Furthermore, VIRTUS calculates the suitability of a node to
   relay packets based on a balance between geographic advancement and link
   stability. We also propose an extension, that separates the process of
   relay node selection from the transmission of video content and adopts a
   density-aware mechanism that adapts its behavior according to local
   density. Consequently, VIRTUS makes use of the reactive aspect of
   receiver-based solutions while remaining scalable to increases in
   transmission rates and density. We report through extensive realistic
   experiments the benefits of using VIRTUS towards delivering video at a
   higher quality, in a timely fashion, with lower overhead and fewer
   collisions.}},

Abstract = {{Network virtualization provides more flexibility in network provisioning
   as it offers physical infrastructure providers (PIP) the possibility of
   smoothly rolling out many separate networks on top of an existing
   infrastructure. A major challenge is the embedding problem of mapping
   virtual networks (VNs) onto PIP infrastructure. In the literature, a
   good deal of research has focused on providing heuristic approaches to
   this NP-hard problem, usually with the assumption that the PIP
   infrastructure is operational at all times. In virtualization
   environment, a single physical node/link failure can result in one or
   more logical link failures as it effects all VNs with a mapping that
   spans over. Setting up a dedicated backup for each VN embedding that is
   not shared with others is an inefficient use of resources. To address
   these concerns, this paper proposes two classes of periodic VN
   protection against link and node failures: (a) in the physical layer, by
   using a path or segment p-cycle technique and a column generation
   optimization model, and (b) in the VN layer, by augmenting the topology
   with redundant resources and subsequently applying a column generation
   mapping model. Our simulations show a clear advantage of our approaches
   over benchmarks in terms of PIP profit, backup cost/rate and resource
   use.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of service compositions represents a challenging area of
   research in mobile networks. The use of formal semantic descriptions of
   service interfaces and functionalities enable automated reasoning over
   service compositions. The growing challenge of finding effective methods
   to satisfy non-functional QoS requirements of customers exacerbates the
   composition problem. Fuzzy reasoning provides an effective means to
   represent QoS concepts that are vague or approximate thus providing a
   flexible best-match service query scheme. This paper presents a new
   fuzzy-induced, semantic-similarity-based service-specific overlay
   network composition over a hybrid service overlay network. The presented
   composition method allows for efficient, accurate, and QoS-aware
   component service discovery, composition, and execution. We demonstrate
   that our approach provides better performance and reduced composition
   delay when compared to other service-composition solutions.}},

Title = {{Synergy between Activity Theory and goal/scenario modeling for
   requirements elicitation, analysis, and evolution}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{109-135}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Context: It is challenging to develop comprehensive, consistent,
   analyzable requirements models for evolving requirements. This is
   particularly critical for certain highly interactive types of
   socio-technical systems that involve a wide range of stakeholders with
   disparate backgrounds; system success is often dependent on how well
   local social constraints are addressed in system design.
   Objective: This paper describes feasibility research, combining a
   holistic social system perspective provided by Activity Theory (AT), a
   psychological paradigm, with existing system development methodologies
   and tools, specifically goal and scenario modeling.
   Method: AT is used to understand the relationships between a system, its
   stakeholders, and the system's evolving context. The User Requirements
   Notation (URN) is used to produce rigorous, analyzable specifications
   combining goal and scenario models. First, an AT language was developed
   constraining the framework for automation, second consistency heuristics
   were developed for constructing and analyzing combined AT/URN models,
   third a combined AT/URN methodology was developed, and consequently
   applied to a proof-of-concept system.
   Results: An AT language with limited tool support was developed, as was
   a combined AT/URN methodology. This methodology was applied to an
   evolving disease management system to demonstrate the feasibility of
   adapting AT for use in system development with existing methodologies
   and tools. Bi-directional transformations between the languages allow
   proposed changes in system design to be propagated to AT models for use
   in stakeholder discussions regarding system evolution.
   Conclusions: The AT framework can be constrained for use in requirements
   elicitation and combined with URN tools to provide system designs that
   include social system perspectives. The developed AT/URN methodology can
   help engineers to track the impact on system design due to requirement
   changes triggered by changes in the system's social context. The
   methodology also allows engineers to assess the impact of proposed
   system design changes on the social elements of the system context. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity of platinum
   and ruthenium nanoparticles is investigated for ethylene complete
   oxidation in the temperature range of 25-220 degrees C. The
   nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited on ionically conductive supports:
   yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and samarium-doped ceria (SDC), and on
   non-ionically conductive supports: carbon black (C) and gamma-alumina
   (gamma-Al2O3) to give <= 0.7 wt\% loading and an average particle sizes
   of 1.9-2.9 nm depending on the support. The presence of O-2-ionic
   conductivity greatly enhanced Pt and Ru catalytic activity compared with
   the same metals deposited on non-ionically conductive supports for C2H4
   complete oxidation. The light off temperatures of Pt/SDC and Ru/SDC were
   60 degrees C and 70 degrees C, respectively, whereas for the same NPs
   deposited on the high surface area carbon, the higher temperatures of 90
   degrees C for Pt/C and 130 degrees C for Ru/C were obtained. The same
   trend was observed with activation energies, which were 22 and 35.1
   kJ/mol for Pt/SDC and Ru/SDC compared with 31 and 52.4 kymol for Pt/C
   and Ru/C, respectively. It is proposed that metal-support interaction
   (MSI), in particular, the electronic effect between NPs and ionic
   conductors is responsible for the high catalytic activity. The
   electronic effect is manifested by the oxygen ion exchange in the
   vicinity of the three-phase boundary similar to the electrochemical
   promotion mechanism, which is thermally self-induced in the case of Pt
   and Ru NPs deposited on SDC and YSZ. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{N-phthaloyl chitosan (NPHCs), which could be dissolved in various
   organic solvents, is synthesized for the modification of poly (ether
   imide) (PEI) ultrafiltration membrane. Blend membrane with 2 wt\% NPHCs
   exhibited higher pure water flux (112.2 l m(-2)h(-1)), higher water
   content (63.4\%) and lower hydraulic resistance (3 kPa/l m(-2)h(-1)).
   The top surface morphology of the control PEI membrane changed from a
   dense surface to visible pores with the increase in NPHCs concentration.
   The surface roughness of PEI membranes increased with an increase in
   NPHCs concentration in the casting solution. Application studies were
   carried out to find the rejection and permeate flux of proteins such as
   bovine serum albumin (BSA), egg albumin (EA), pepsin and trypsin and
   toxic heavy metal ions such as Cr(III), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II). The
   result shows that the flux and separation performances are dependent
   upon the content of NPHCs. Furthermore, the blend membranes were
   subjected to the determination of pore statistics and MWCO. It was found
   that the blending of NPHCs into the PEI membrane had a visible effect
   upon MWCO and pore size. The significant effect of hydrophilicity of
   NPHCs on the fouling of PEI/NPHCs blend membranes by BSA was also
   discussed. It was found that the blend membranes with 2 wt\% NPHCs
   content had a higher FRR (88.6\%), higher reversible fouling (23.7\%)
   and lower irreversible fouling (11.4\%) which explained their improved
   antifouling properties. Thus, the modified chitosan proved to play an
   important role in the improvement of UF membrane performance. (C) 2014

Title = {{A virtual queue-based back-pressure scheduling algorithm for wireless
   sensor networks}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we design a new virtual queue-based back-pressure
   scheduling algorithm (VBR) for achieving significant delay reduction in
   wireless sensor networks (WSN). Our algorithm design comes from an
   observation that classical back-pressure scheduling algorithm usually
   needs a long period of time to form a queue backlog-based gradient in a
   network, which decreases towards the sink in the network, before
   achieving stable packet delivery performance. To address this issue, VBR
   is designed to pre-build proper virtual queue-based gradient at nodes in
   a WSN, which is chosen to be a function of traffic arrival rate, link
   rate, and distance to sink, in order to be adaptive to different network
   and application environments while achieving high network performance.
   Moreover, the queue backlog differential between each pair of neighbor
   nodes is decided by their actual queue lengths and also their virtual
   queue lengths (gradient values). We prove that VBR can maintain
   back-pressure scheduling's throughput optimality. Simulation result
   shows that VBR can obtain significant performance improvement in terms
   of packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and average queue
   length as compared with existing work.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The 6-minute walk test (6MWT: the maximum distance walked in
   6 minutes) is used by rehabilitation professionals as a measure of
   exercise capacity. Today's smartphones contain hardware that can be used
   for wearable sensor applications and mobile data analysis. A smartphone
   application can run the 6MWT and provide typically unavailable
   biomechanical information about how the person moves during the test.
   Methods: A new algorithm for a calibration-free 6MWT smartphone
   application was developed that uses the test's inherent conditions and
   smartphone accelerometer-gyroscope data to report the total distance
   walked, step timing, gait symmetry, and walking changes over time. This
   information is not available with a standard 6MWT and could help with
   clinical decision-making. The 6MWT application was evaluated with 15
   able-bodied participants. A BlackBerry Z10 smartphone was worn on a belt
   at the mid lower back. Audio from the phone instructed the person to
   start and stop walking. Digital video was independently recorded during
   the trial as a gold-standard comparator.
   Results: The average difference between smartphone and gold standard
   foot strike timing was 0.014 +/- 0.015 s. The total distance calculated
   by the application was within 1 m of the measured distance for all but
   one participant, which was more accurate than other smartphone-based
   studies.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrated that clinically relevant 6MWT
   results can be achieved with typical smartphone hardware and a novel
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new type of thin film nanocomposite (TFN) forward
   osmosis (FO) membranes was prepared by incorporating different
   quantities of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) into the polyamide layer via
   interfacial polymerization. The FO performance of all fabricated TFN
   membranes in terms of water permeability and reverse solute flux was
   compared and the best performing membrane which showed good balance
   between permeability and solute flux, among all, was selected for
   further organic fouling investigation. Using 10 mM NaCl concentration in
   feed solution and draw solution of 2 M NaCl, the TFN membrane that was
   embedded with 0.05\% HNTs (i.e. TFN0.05) was identified as the best
   performing membrane due to its high water permeability and low reverse
   solute flux. Confirmed by the results of BSA removal in the presence of
   Ca2+ the TFN0.05 membrane also exhibited significantly higher fouling
   resistance compared to a typical TFC membrane. As an indication to the
   TFN0.05 fouling reversibility, it was found that >96\% permeate flux
   could be recovered after a simple water rinse process. Overall, it can
   be concluded that the addition of an appropriate amount of HNTs into the
   polyamide layer can remarkably improve the antifouling affinity of
   conventional TFC membranes for FO applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{DESALINATION}},

Abstract = {{Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based hollow fiber membranes incorporated with
   graft copolymers beating hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and PAN
   segments were developed for the treatment of heavily polluted natural
   rubber (NR) effluent via direct ultrafiltration (UF) process. The
   effects of the copolymer addition on the membrane properties were
   studied systematically. Their separation and anti-fouling performances
   were firstly tested using the solutions of various proteins such as
   bovine serum albumin, albumin from chicken egg and trypsin as model
   foulants. The membranes were further tested for the UF treatment of real
   NR effluent collected from a local latex concentrate industry. The
   experimental results indicate that the membrane properties, in
   particular pore size and pore size distribution are the dominant factors
   influencing the UF performance and fouling resistance during protein and
   NR filtrations. The best anti-fouling membrane achieved the highest flux
   recovery of 84\% (after first NR filtration cycle) and 76\% (after
   second NR filtration cycle) by simple hydraulic cleansing. With respect
   to organic and inorganic pollutant reduction, all the membranes showed
   remarkable performance in reducing turbidity (>99\%) and color (>97\%).
   Reduction percentages of 68-70\% (total proteins), 29-38\% (COD),
   14-32\% (TOC), 8-11\% (TDS) and 7-8\% (conductivity) could be achieved,
   depending on the membrane properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{297-303}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates post-combustion CO2 capture at ambient
   temperature in a fixed bed by means of CaO-based sorbents. Two sorbents
   were used: limestone and pellets prepared from powdered limestone using
   calcium aluminate cement as a binder. The results showed that
   pre-hydration had a significant effect on CO2 capture performance of the
   two sorbents. For instance, after 8 h pre-hydration, the breakthrough
   time increased from 21 min to 660 min for lime, and from 19 min to 750
   min for pellets. The performance of pellets was more sensitive to
   hydration conditions than for the lime. At breakthrough, full
   carbonation conversion over half of the reactor was achieved in a
   pre-hydrated bed of pellets exposed to a feed with 0.5\% CO2, resulting
   in an average specific capture of 0.51 g CO2/g bed material. This was
   considered a sufficient capture performance, with a distinct mass
   transfer zone (MTZ) located in the upper half of the reactor. However,
   increasing CO2 inlet concentration to 2\% shortened the breakthrough
   time and shifted the MTZ toward the entrance zone of the reactor. It was
   concluded that capturing CO2 from low-CO2 flue gases at ambient
   temperature using a fixed bed of pre-hydrated CaO-based pellets is a
   promising approach that has the potential to achieve reasonable capture
   performance at relatively low cost. The proposed process can be used for
   CO2 capture from CO2-depleted flue gases (residual CO2) from processes
   such as amine scrubbing and calcium looping. And it would allow for the
   possibility that capture could be increased to any given level required
   by new legislation for plant with carbon capture. (C) 2014 Published by

Title = {{Laminate squeeze casting of carbon fiber reinforced aluminum matrix
   composites}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{154-158}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Carbon fiber reinforced aluminum matrix composites show an excellent
   combination of lightweight, mechanical properties, ease of processing
   and low costs. However, standard liquid infiltration squeeze casting
   often requires complex preforms in order to control fiber configuration
   and distribution. It also requires relatively high pressures to overcome
   the pressure drop across the preform, which can lead to preform
   compaction and damage and can limit the maximum component thickness that
   can be thoroughly infiltrated. Therefore, a laminate squeeze casting
   process is investigated as alternative whereby alternate layers of fiber
   fabrics and aluminum sheets are hot consolidated. Liquid infiltrates the
   fiber fabrics from their two respective neighboring aluminum layers,
   thereby reducing the infiltration distance from the entire component
   height to only half the thickness of individual fiber layers. This
   results in a rapid and thorough infiltration. Composites with fiber
   contents between 7 and 14 vol\% are successfully fabricated. Despite
   complete melting of the aluminum layers at 850 degrees C, optical and
   scanning electron microscopy investigations show that hydrostatic
   pressure practically preserves the laminate configuration during
   fabrication and no fiber agglomeration occurs. The composites show good
   fiber-matrix bonding. No noticeable fiber damage is observed despite
   some carbide formation primarily at interfaces. A composite hardness
   over 50\% higher compared to the reference 6061 matrix alloy is achieved
   at a carbon fiber content of 7.4 vol\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Bentonite has been proven to be effective in enhancing the membrane
   behavior of clay, by which landfill liners can have better barrier
   performance toward the migration of contaminants. In this study, sodium
   bentonite amended locally available natural clay (Fukakusa clay) was
   investigated for its membrane behavior. The chemico-osmotic efficiency
   coefficient, omega, was obtained under different concentrations of KCl
   solution (1, 5, 10, and 50 mM) at pH ranging from 4.0 to 11.0. It was
   found that to continually decreased as the KCl concentration increased,
   which is consistent with Gouy-Chapman theory. pH values were found to
   have a significant effect on membrane behaviors, especially on the
   alkaline condition. According to the results, the membrane behavior
   under alkaline condition was 1.2-2.5 times higher than that under acidic
   conditions. The similarity of membrane behavior between 4.0 and 7.0
   reflect the existence, but very slight erosion effect, of acidic
   solution. It was further found that bentonite amended Fukakusa clay
   possess excellent buffer capacity to resist pH change. The mechanisms of
   the membrane performance change were discussed with the assistance of
   X-ray Diffraction patterns (XRD), free swelling results, X-ray
   Fluorescence results (XRF), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and
   camera images. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evolution and stability of shock waves in dissipative gases
   characterized by activated inelastic collisions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Previous experiments have revealed that shock waves driven through
   dissipative gases may become unstable, for example, in granular gases
   and in molecular gases undergoing strong relaxation effects. The
   mechanisms controlling these instabilities are not well understood. We
   successfully isolated and investigated this instability in the canonical
   problem of piston-driven shock waves propagating into a medium
   characterized by inelastic collision processes. We treat the standard
   model of granular gases, where particle collisions are taken as
   inelastic, with a constant coefficient of restitution. The inelasticity
   is activated for sufficiently strong collisions. Molecular dynamic
   simulations were performed for 30 000 particles. We find that all shock
   waves investigated become unstable, with density nonuniformities forming
   in the relaxation region. The wavelength of these fingers is found to be
   comparable to the characteristic relaxation thickness. Shock Hugoniot
   curves for both elastic and inelastic collisions were obtained
   analytically and numerically. Analysis of these curves indicates that
   the instability is not of the Bethe-Zeldovich-Thompson or
   D'yakov-Kontorovich type. Analysis of the shock relaxation rates and
   rates for clustering in a convected fluid element with the same
   thermodynamic history ruled out the clustering instability of a
   homogeneous granular gas. Instead, wave reconstruction of the early
   transient evolution indicates that the onset of instability occurs
   during repressurization of the gas following the initial relaxation of
   the medium behind the lead shock. This repressurization gives rise to
   internal pressure waves in the presence of strong density gradients.
   This indicates that the mechanism of instability is more likely of the
   vorticity-generating Richtmyer-Meshkov type, relying on the action of
   the inner pressure wave development during the transient relaxation.}},

Abstract = {{The in situ bearing capacity of sandy soils is determined or estimated
   using plate load tests (PLTs), cone penetration tests (CPTs), or
   standard penetration tests (SPTs). The contribution of matric suction
   toward the bearing capacity of unsaturated sands is, however, not
   estimated from these tests. In this paper, SPTs and PLTs were conducted
   in situ on sandy soil in Ottawa, Canada under saturated and unsaturated
   conditions to demonstrate the contribution of matric suction on the
   bearing capacity results. In addition, relationships are proposed to
   estimate the bearing capacity of sands under both saturated and
   unsaturated conditions from the SPTs results. Comparisons are provided
   between the measured and estimated bearing capacity values for three
   different sands from the literature using the proposed relationships.
   The results of the study suggest that the proposed relationships can be
   used in the estimation of the bearing capacity of both saturated and

Title = {{Fixed and self-paced treadmill walking for able-bodied and transtibial

Abstract = {{A self-paced treadmill automatically adjusts speed in real-time to match
   the user's walking speed, potentially enabling more natural gait than
   fixed-speed treadmills. This research examined walking speed changes for
   able-bodied and transtibial amputee populations on a self-paced
   treadmill in a multi-terrain virtual environment and examined gait
   differences between fixed and self-paced treadmill speed conditions.
   Twelve able-bodied (AB) individuals and 12 individuals with unilateral
   transtibial amputation (TT) walked in a park-like virtual environment
   with level, slopes, and simulated uneven terrain scenarios.
   Temporal-spatial and range-of-motion parameters were analyzed.
   Within the self-paced condition, all participants significantly varied
   walking speed (p < 0.001) across different walking activities. Compared
   to level walking, participants reduced speed for uphill and hilly
   activities (p < 0.001). TT also reduced speed downhill (p < 0.001).
   Generally, differences in temporal-spatial and range-of-motion
   parameters between fixed and self-paced speed conditions were no longer
   significantly different with a speed covariate. However, for uphill
   walking, both groups decreased stride length during self-paced trials,
   and increased stride length during fixed-speed trials to maintain the
   constant speed (p < 0.01).
   The results from this study demonstrated self-paced treadmill mode is
   important for virtual reality systems with multiple movement scenarios
   in order to elicit more natural gait across various terrain. Fixed-speed
   treadmills may induce gait compensations to maintain the fixed speed.

Abstract = {{For mobile multimedia systems, advances in battery technology have been
   much slower than those in memory, graphics, and processing power, making
   power consumption a major concern in mobile systems. The computational
   complexity of video codecs, which consists of CPU operations and memory
   accesses, is one of the main factors affecting power consumption. In
   this article, we propose a method that achieves near-optimal video
   quality while respecting user-defined bounds on the complexity needed to
   decode a video. We specifically focus on the motion compensation
   process, including motion vector prediction and interpolation, because
   it is the single largest component of computation-based power
   consumption. We start by formulating a scenario with a single receiver
   as a rate-distortion optimization problem and we develop an efficient
   decoder-complexity-aware video encoding method to solve it. Then we
   extend our approach to handle multiple heterogeneous receivers, each
   with a different complexity requirement. We test our method
   experimentally using the H.264 standard for the single receiver scenario
   and the H.264 SVC extension for the multiple receiver scenario. Our
   experimental results show that our method can achieve up to 97\% of the
   optimal solution value in the single receiver scenario, and an average
   of 97\% of the optimal solution value in the multiple receiver scenario.
   Furthermore, our tests with actual power measurements show a power
   saving of up to 23\% at the decoder when the complexity threshold is
   halved in the encoder.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides new guidance concerning the hydrodynamic loads on
   submerged intake structures located in shallow water under breaking and
   non-breaking waves. Results from a series of experiments conducted in a
   large wave flume at 1:15 scale to study the hydrodynamic forces exerted
   on a generic intake structure located on a sloping seabed in shallow
   water below breaking and non-breaking irregular waves are presented.
   Based on analysis of the experimental data, empirical relationships are
   developed to describe the peak loads in terms of characteristic wave
   parameters such as significant wave height and peak wave period. The
   distribution of the peak loads across different parts of the intake
   structure is also described. Drag and inertia force coefficients for the
   horizontal forcing on the intake structure and for the main structural
   sub-components are derived and presented. It is shown that the
   well-known Morison equation, with appropriate drag and inertia force
   coefficients, can provide reasonable estimates of the moderate
   horizontal loads, but the peak loads are less well predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospinning was used to fabricate beadless microfibrous

   380 nm from a 10 wt.\% PAN in dimethylformamide (DMF) dope solution at
   applied voltage of 18 kV and 20 cm fiber collection distance. Urease (EC
   3.5.1.5) was then covalently immobilized on dispersed microfibrous ePAN
   mats following the chemical treatment of fibers with ethylenediamine
   (EDA) and glutaraldehyde (GA). The optimal concentration of GA for
   immobilization was 5\%. The amount of loaded urease reached 157 mu g/mg
   mat, exhibiting 54\% of the free urease activity. The surface chemistry
   of as-spun and chemically treated fibers was examined with Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM) was used to study the morphology and diameter of the
   pristine, chemically treated, and urease-immobilized microfibrous mats.
   Immobilized urease showed increased temperature for maximum activity
   (from 37 to 50 degrees C for free and immobilized urease, respectively)
   and improved storage stability (20 days). The immobilized urease was
   also less sensitive to the changes in pH, especially in acid conditions.
   In addition, nearly 70\% of initial activity of the immobilized urease
   was retained after 15 cycles of reuse, which proved the applicability of
   the electrospun fibers as successful enzyme carriers. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional, unsteady simulations of isothermal turbulent flows in
   a rod bundle with a split-vane spacer grid have been performed using a
   segregated turbulence model, which is a combination of scale adaptive

   conducted within the framework of an international blind CFD benchmark
   exercise. A finer mesh than that submitted to the benchmark exercise was
   used for the present study, which improved the agreement of the
   turbulence predictions with the measurements. For the first time,
   several vortices were identified in the vicinity of the vanes. The
   strongest among these vortices, which was a central vortex in the core
   of each subchannel, was generated by the vane pair in each subchannel.
   Each vane also created a strong stream across the gap between two rods
   and towards an adjacent subchannel. Axial profiles of turbulent kinetic
   energy in each subchannel core exhibited two peaks, a low peak in the
   near-vane zone and a larger peak one hydraulic diameter downstream of
   the vanes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decades, developments in transesophageal echocardiography
   (TEE) have opened new horizons in reconstructive surgery of the aortic
   valve (AV), whereby corrections are made to normalize the geometry and
   function of the valve, and effectively treat leaks. To the best of our
   knowledge, we propose the first integrated framework to process
   subject-specific 3D+t TEE AV data, determine age-matched material
   properties for the aortic and leaflet tissues, build a finite element
   model of the unpressurized AV, and simulate the AV function throughout a
   cardiac cycle. For geometric reconstruction purposes, dedicated software
   was created to acquire the 3-D coordinates of 21 anatomical landmarks of
   the AV apparatus in a systematic fashion. Measurements from ten 3D+t TEE
   datasets of normal AVs were assessed for inter- and intra-observer
   variability. These tests demonstrated mean measurement errors well
   within the acceptable range. Simulation of a complete cardiac cycle was
   successful for all ten valves and validated the novel schemes introduced
   to evaluate age-matched material properties and iteratively scale the
   unpressurized dimensions of the valves such that, given the determined
   material properties, the dimensions measured in vivo closely matched
   those simulated in late diastole. The leaflet coaptation area,
   describing the quality of the sealing of the valve, was measured
   directly from the medical images and was also obtained from the
   simulations; both approaches correlated well. The mechanical stress
   values obtained from the simulations may be interpreted in a comparative
   sense whereby higher values are indicative of higher risk of tearing
   and/or development of calcification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Poly(2-(N-carbazolyl)ethyl acrylate), a poly(acrylate) comprised of
   carbazole-side groups attached via a flexible chain to the polymer
   backbone (PVAK) has been tested as host for solution-processed polymer
   light-emitting devices (PLEDs). This non-conjugated polymer proved to be
   an excellent candidate to host wide-bandgap phosphors. Notably, this
   polymer exhibited a high thermal stability (T-d = 322 degrees C), a
   glass transition temperature (T-g) of 91 degrees C and a wide bandgap
   corresponding to the pendent carbazole units and the disrupted
   p-conjugation of the polymer main chain, making this polymeric host a
   suitable candidate for wide bandgap triplet emitters. When tested as a
   host for FIrpic and Ir(ppy)(3), the resulting blue and green
   light-emitting devices showed a maximum luminous efficiency of 18.25 and
   17.74 cd/A, respectively, which are comparable to recent reports of
   devices made using other carbazole-based oxygen-rich polymeric hosts.
   The polymer was also characterized by UV-visible absorption,
   photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. (C) 2014

Title = {{Adaptive ``load-distributed{''} muscle coordination method for
   kinematically redundant musculoskeletal humanoid systems}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{59-69}},

Abstract = {{Muscle force control of musculoskeletal humanoid systems has been
   studied for years in the motor control, biomechanics and robotics
   disciplines. However, the study of ``load-distributed{''} muscle control
   has seldomly been contemplated. In this paper, we consider muscle force
   control as a problem of muscle coordination. We propose a general muscle
   coordination method for a system driven by agonist and antagonist
   muscles. In our method, a set of linear equations is derived by
   connecting the acceleration description in both joint and muscle space
   where the pseudo inverse solution to these equations provides an initial
   optimal muscle force distribution. Thereafter, we redistribute the
   forces throughout the muscles by deriving a gradient direction for
   muscle force. This allows the muscles to satisfy force constraints and
   generate a distribution of forces throughout all the muscles. Moreover,
   to ensure that our proposed method is adaptive to modeling errors, we
   have constructed an estimated system model, which is added to the system
   to represent the real plant. By updating the parameters of the estimated
   model based on prediction error, the estimated model approaches the real
   plant gradually in real-time. The overall proposed method is evaluated
   on a bending-stretching movement of a musculoskeletal arm. We used two
   models (arm with 6 and 10 muscles) to verify the method. The force
   distribution analysis verifies the ``load-distribution{''} property of
   the computed muscle force. The efficiency comparison shows that the
   computational time does not increase significantly with the increase of
   muscle number. The tracking error statistics of the two models show the
   validity of the method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its great potential to improve the overall performance of data
   transmission with its dynamic and adaptive spectrum allocation
   capability in comparison with many other networking technologies,
   cognitive radio (CR) networking technology has been increasingly
   employed in networking and communication infrastructures for smart
   grids. However, a secondary user (SU) of a CR network has to be squeezed
   out from a channel when a primary user reclaims the channel, which may
   occur in a randomized fashion. The random interruption of SU traffic may
   cause packet losses and delays for SU data, and it will in turn affect
   the stability of the monitoring and control of smart grids. In this
   paper, we address this problem and investigate the modeling and
   stability analysis of the automatic generation control (AGC) of a smart
   grid for which CR networks are used as the infrastructure for the
   aggregation and communication of both system-wide information and local
   measurement data. For this purpose, a randomly switched power system
   model is proposed for the AGC of the smart grid. By modeling the CR
   network as an On-Off switch with sojourn times, the stability of the AGC
   of the smart grid is analyzed. In particular, we investigate the smart
   grid with two main types of CR networks: 1) the sojourn times are
   arbitrary but bounded and 2) the sojourn times follow an independent and
   identical distribution process. The sufficient conditions are obtained
   for the stability of the AGC of the smart grid with these two CR
   networks, respectively. Simulation results show the effects of the CR
   networks on the dynamic performance of the AGC of the smart grid and
   illustrate the usefulness of the developed sufficient conditions in the
   design of CR networks in order to ensure the stability of the AGC of the
   smart grid.}},

   to configure the rehabilitation task based on user's psychophysiological

Abstract = {{The soil movement information over time is required for the design of
   foundations placed in expansive soils. This information is also helpful
   for the assessment of pre-wetting and controlled wetting mitigation
   alternatives for expansive soils. Several researchers during the past
   fifteen years have proposed different methods for the prediction of the
   soil movements over time. The available methods can be categorized into
   (i) consolidation theory-based methods, (ii) water content-based
   methods, and (iii) suction-based methods. In this paper, a
   state-of-the-art of the prediction methods is succinctly summarized. The
   methods are critically reviewed in terms of their predictive capacity
   along with their strengths and limitations. The review highlights the
   need for prediction methods that are conceptually simple yet efficient
   for use in conventional engineering practice for different types of

   the first-principle process model at ten operating points. The TSK fuzzy
   model structure and the initial TSK fuzzy models are obtained by the
   modal equivalence principle in terms of placing the local state-space
   models in the rule consequents of the TSK fuzzy models. An operating
   point selection algorithm to guide modeling is proposed, formulated on
   the basis of ranking the operating points according to their importance
   factors, and inserted in the third step of the fuzzy modeling approach.
   The optimization problems are defined such that to minimize the
   objective functions expressed as the average of squared modeling errors
   over the time horizon, and the variables of these functions are a part
   of the parameters of the input membership functions. Two representative
   nature-inspired algorithms, namely a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm
   and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, are implemented to
   solve the optimization problems and to obtain optimal TSK fuzzy models.
   The validation and the comparison of SA and PSO and of the new TSK fuzzy
   models are carried out for an ABS laboratory equipment. The real-time
   experimental results highlight that the optimized TSK fuzzy models are
   simple and consistent with both training data and validation data and
   that these models outperform the initial TSK fuzzy models. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Porous polyetherimide (PEI) and polyethersullone (PES) hollow fiber
   membranes were spun under the same spinning conditions and the
   fabricated membranes were characterized using various analytical
   methods. The membranes were then subjected to gas-liquid contactor
   experiments. While the PEI casing solution was thermodynamically less
   stable, the PES casting solution was less viscous which resulted in a
   more porous membrane structure. The mean pore size and effective surface
   porosity obtained by the gas permeation test showed superior properties
   of the PES membrane. Both PEI and PES membranes had sufficiently high
   LEPw values even though both polymers were known to be relatively
   hydrophilic, most likely clue to their small pore sizes. The absorption
   flux of the PES membrane was 4.4 x 10(-3) mol m(-2) s(-1) at the liquid
   flow velocity V-liquid of 1.8 m s(-1), which was 267\% higher than that
   of the PEI membrane 1.2 x 10(-3) mol m(-2) s(-1)) clue to the larger
   pore size and smaller tortuosity of the PES membrane. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52-53}},
Pages = {{360-375}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The synchrosqueezing transform can effectively improve the readability
   of time-frequency representation of mono-component and constant
   frequency signals. However, for multicomponent and time-variant
   frequency signals, it still suffers from time-frequency blurs. In order
   to address this issue, the synchrosqueezing transform is improved using
   iterative generalized demodulation. Firstly, the complex nonstationary
   signal is decomposed into mono-components of constant frequency by
   iterative generalized demodulation. Then, the instantaneous frequency of
   each mono-component is accurately estimated via the synchrosqueezing
   transform, by exploiting its merit of enhanced time-frequency
   resolution. Finally, the time-frequency representation of the original
   signal is obtained by superposing the time-frequency representations of
   all the mono-components with restored instantaneous frequency. This
   proposed method generalizes the synchrosqueezing transform to
   multi-component and time-variant frequency signals, and it has fine
   time-frequency resolution and is free of cross-term interferences. The
   proposed method was validated using both numerically simulated and lab
   experimental vibration signals of planetary gearboxes under
   nonstationary conditions. The time-variant planetary gearbox
   characteristic frequencies were effectively identified, and the gear
   faults were correctly diagnosed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A structured method for the design-for-frequency of a brace-soundboard
   system using a scalloped brace}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{96-103}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Design-for-frequency of mechanical systems has long been a practice of
   iterative procedures in order to construct systems having desired
   natural frequencies. Especially problematic is achieving acoustic
   consistency in systems using natural materials such as wood. Inverse
   eigenvalue problem theory seeks to rectify these shortfalls by creating
   system matrices of the mechanical systems directly from the desired
   natural frequencies. In this paper, the Cayley-Hamilton and determinant
   methods for solving inverse eigenvalue problems are applied to the
   problem of the scalloped braced plate. Both methods are shown to be
   effective tools in calculating the dimensions of the brace necessary for
   achieving a desired fundamental natural frequency and one of its higher
   partials. These methods use the physical parameters and mechanical
   properties of the material in order to frame the discrete problem in
   contrast to standard approaches that specify the structure of the matrix
   itself. They also demonstrate the ability to find multiple solutions to
   the same problem. The determinant method is found to be computationally
   more efficient for partially described inverse problems due to the
   reduced number of equations and parameters that need to be solved. The
   two methods show great promise for techniques which could lead to the
   design of complex mechanical systems, including musical instrument
   soundboards, directly from knowledge of the desired natural frequencies.

Abstract = {{Optical time stretch has been employed for ultrafast optical imaging

   between two adjacent time-stretched pulses is a disadvantageous factor

   by reducing the pulse repetition rate to avoid the temporal overlap. To
   increase the spatial resolution without reducing the frame rate, we
   propose a novel technique based on polarization-division multiplexing,
   using a polarization modulator to generate two polarization interleaved
   pulse trains. Since two adjacent optical pulses are orthogonally
   polarized, the spacing between two adjacent pulses for one polarization
   direction is doubled, and the spatial resolution is doubled by using a
   dispersive element with two times the dispersion. The proposed approach
   is experimentally evaluated. An imaging system with an increased spatial
   resolution is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the generation of high-speed spiking and bursting signals
   in a long time-delayed broadband optoelectronic oscillator (OEO). The
   OEO is configured in a delayed feedback loop employing a long optical
   fiber delay line and other elements including a tunable laser, a phase
   modulator (PM) and a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating (LCFBG), a
   photodetector, and an electrical amplifier. The joint operation of the
   PM and the LCFBG forms an ultrawideband microwave photonic filter (MFP).
   Taking advantage of the multiple time scales arising from the MPF and
   the long optical fiber delay line, we are able to generate
   sub-nanosecond neuron-like spiking and bursting signals that emulate the
   response found to be the primary mode of electrical firing in biological
   neurons. Since our OEO can operate at a much higher speed and can be
   controlled using both time-delayed feedback employing low-loss optical
   fiber and electrical/optical injection locking techniques, it has
   interest in emerging photonics applications such as neuromorphic
   information processing and reservoir computing tasks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a review on the recent development of thin film
   composite (TFC) membrane, which has received increasing attention in the
   field of water desalination process. The development of new thin films
   and substrates, and the effect of additives are mostly focused in this
   review. In particular, nanotechnology has shown its impact on the
   development of TFC membranes by incorporating nanoparticles and
   nanofibers in the substrate as well as in the top thin film. The search
   for novel monomers and novel fabrication methods of thin film,
   modification of substrate, and optimization of operational conditions is
   also the topic of this review article. It still remains a challenge to
   produce high impact TFC membranes with antifouling and biofouling
   properties, chemical resistance, improved mechanical strength and
   thermal stability. For this purpose, further insights into the phase
   inversion and interfacial polymerization processes are necessary.
   Currently, it seems that there is no end in the near future for the
   further development of TFC Membranes, which will be followed by the
   expansion of the scope of their applications in various chemical and
   biochemical industrial sectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The direct nucleation and growth of ferrite and cementite has been
   investigated in an Fe-C metallic glass using X-ray diffraction,

   ferrite/amorphous interfaces, indicating that the transformation rate is
   controlled by the low mobility of these interfaces compared to the
   mobility of C atoms. A thermodynamic description is proposed to explain

Abstract = {{Polyvinylideneflouride (PVDF) hollow fiber mixed matrix membranes (MMMs)
   were fabricated through wet phase inversion method using general MMT and
   Cloisite 15A as inorganic fillers. The effect of clay filler loadings
   (1,3 and 5 wt\% of polymer), their particle size and hydrophobicity on
   the membrane morphology, structure and performance in gas-liquid
   contacting process were investigated. The fabricated MMMs were
   characterized by scanning electron microscopic (SEM), gas permeation
   test, hydrophobicity, wetting resistance and CO2 absorption test. As
   expected, MMMs showed asymmetrical structure, differing in finger-like
   portion, porosity and pore size. The fabricated MMMs with higher
   finger-like area and surface porosity showed higher permeance than plain
   membrane. Furthermore, the wetting resistance in terms of surface
   hydrophobicity and liquid entry pressure of water increased with
   loading. From the point of view of physical CO2 absorption, the
   membranes incorporated with small particle size filler (general
   MMT-filled PVDF membranes) exhibited higher absorption fluxes than those
   embedded with large particle size fillers. The highest absorption flux
   for membrane containing 1 wt\% general MMT is 1.0 x 10(-3) mol m(-2)
   s(-1) at the flow rate of 3.1 m s(-1). That flux was approximately 54\%
   and 82\% higher than the flux of MMMs with embedded Cloisite 15A of the
   same loading and plain PVDF membrane, respectively. The obtained flux of
   synthesized membrane was superior compared to several in-house made and
   commercial membranes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The method was used in an intensive tracer field survey over an 83km
   reach of the North Saskatchewan River downstream of the capital region
   wastewater treatment plant. Hydrodynamics data were also collected
   simultaneously by measuring streamwise water velocity and depth using an
   acoustic Doppler current profiler. The full mixing length for this
   surface bank outfall at the observed low flow condition was inferred to
   be 130km. The employed technique effectively improved the understanding
   of mixing patterns in complex flows by providing tracer and hydrodynamic

Abstract = {{Fuel cells (FCs) have evolved as a potential alternative energy
   harnessing device, with direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) as one of the
   front-runners. Although it has achieved significant progress, and is
   currently getting available in the commercial market; however, from a
   broader perspective, DMFCs, like most other devices, suffer from certain
   critical drawbacks. This, in turn, demands considerable progress to be
   made in order to realize ultimate commercialization, i.e., cheap,
   reliable, durable, and portable DMFCs with easily accessible fuel. In
   this respect, one important area of real concern is the DMFC electrodes,
   consisting of catalysts and catalyst-supporting matrices. Sluggish
   reaction rates and use of highly expensive and scarce catalysts are two
   critical drawbacks. Conducting polymers (CPs) have found extensive use
   in the fabrication of these matrices and have resulted in better
   dispersion, distribution and anchoring of catalysts, which is important
   to enhance their reaction efficiencies. This review attempts to
   summarize the potential contributions of CPs, their critical roles, and
   possible future trends toward fabricating catalyst-supporting matrices

Abstract = {{According to the U.S. Department of Energy, a plug in Electrical Vehicle
   (PEV) can be defined as a vehicle that consumes the power from a battery
   with a capacity of no less than 4 kw/h and the vehicle can be recharged

   emerging field that has drawn from electrical powertrain technologies
   and electrical vehicles charging infrastructures in the transition
   toward a green smart environment. There is a need to create a solid
   network communication platform, standards, best practices and protocols
   for E-mobility. As we see, in the academic domain, less attention has
   been paid in the area of reviewing the e-mobility protocols and the
   available requirements needed for a smooth transition to the smart gird.
   This article focuses on the most common standards and open protocols in
   the field of e-mobility, especially the communication means between the
   PEV, Electrical Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), Central Back Office and
   possibly Roaming Center. Moreover, this paper provides an Open System

Abstract = {{Existing Object Naming Service (ONS) architectures that are based on
   Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are built on top of chord-like DHT
   networks, which are DHT P2P networks constructed by projecting the
   network nodes on a ring network and then adding long edges to each node
   to improve the lookup performance. A main weakness in these
   architectures is the lack of geographic awareness at the nodes. This
   paper proposes the enhancement of these architectures with geographic
   awareness using a technique, called Geographic-Aware Content Addressable
   Network (GCAN), that runs on top of any chord-like DHT network. GCAN
   uses the procedures of chord-like DHT networks as blackboxes. Thus, it
   requires only minimum additions to existing DHT-based ONS architectures.
   As a result, it inherits the scalability, reliability, and the maturity
   of chord-like DHT networks. DHT-based ONS architectures that are built
   with GCAN are guaranteed to have routing, join, leave complexities in
   O(log n), while the routing table size is also in circle minus(log n) on
   average, where n is the number of the network nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile robots can provide a wide range of value-added services to
   wireless sensor networks during their operational lifetime. One of them
   has to do with the replacement of damaged sensors with other functional,
   passive ones. This scenario has been recently studied as the
   ``Robot-Assisted Sensor Relocation{''} (RASR) problem. RASR solutions
   traditionally focus only on one aspect of the problem: minimizing the
   total distance traveled by the robot. The existing centralized solutions
   do not take into account the reliability of the passive nodes that are
   selected as substitutes for the damaged nodes, for instance, their
   current battery level. With this in mind, we propose a multi-objective
   optimization (MOO) formulation of the problem, named Reliable
   Robot-Assisted Sensor Relocation (RRASR), where we consider two more
   objectives in addition to the trajectory length. These objectives result
   from the fact that a given passive sensor selected to replace a damaged
   sensor in the region may not be in perfect condition and that another
   passive sensor may be a better option. Due to the nature of MOO
   problems, we must present a diverse set of solutions that exhibit a
   trade-off among the different decision objectives to a network manager
   so they may take appropriate action. We evaluate the performance of four
   state-of-the-art evolutionary MOO algorithms with sensor networks of
   varying sizes and inflicted damage levels. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first time RASR is approached from an MOO angle.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of real-world problems are characterized by multimodal
   functions, i.e., they demand the identification of several locally or
   globally optimal solutions. In the field of multimodal optimization,
   researchers actively address the development of niching techniques by
   inventing new methods and also by coupling existing methods with global
   optimization metaheuristics. In this paper, we put forward a general
   niching framework for the Variable Mesh Optimization (VMO) metaheuristic
   algorithm, coined as Variable Mesh Optimization with Niching (VMO-N). We
   argue that the basic VMO formulation can be easily adapted to multimodal
   optimization scenarios without extra adjustments. We refer to the
   recently published Niche-Clearing-based Variable Mesh Optimization
   (NC-VMO), as an instantiation of the VMO-N framework proposed here.
   Since the niche clearing procedure in NC-VMO requires a priori knowledge
   of the fitness landscape, we also introduce the Niche-based VMO via
   Adaptive Species Discovery (VMO-ASD) as another instance of VMO-N, in
   order to show its applicability to a wider range of multimodal problems.
   VMO-ASD results with some of the benchmark functions for the CEC'2013
   Special Session and Competition on Niching Methods for Multimodal
   Function Optimization confirm that VMO-N is a plausible general VMO
   niching framework for multimodal problems. We demonstrate the advantages
   of VMO-N over the canonical version of the algorithm, VMO-ASD over
   NC-VMO and also report on VMO-N's performance against other
   state-of-the-art niching algorithms. Further pursuits of strongly
   competitive versions of VMO-N will demand the use of more suitable
   niching methods than both clearing and ASD within the framework although
   this is not the focal point of this study.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and scalable information discovery is one of the most
   important services in any large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)
   application, particularly in the EPCglobal Network. Although a number of
   distributed architectures have been proposed in the literature, both
   their scalability and their lookup time efficiency remain vulnerable,
   mainly because of their reliance on flat Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking.
   The purpose of this paper is to introduce a hierarchical distributed
   architecture for EPCglobal Discovery Services, called HEDSA, which
   improves the scalability and the lookup time of the flat P2P
   architectures, represented by FEDSA. The idea behind the hierarchy
   concept of HEDSA is that any Electronic Product Code (EPC) can be mapped
   to one and only one country, which is the issuing country of the
   corresponding company prefix. An emulation of FEDSA and HEDSA has been
   implemented on Planetlab using Chord algorithm, the objective being to
   compare the scalability and the lookup time of the two architectures.
   Several experiments have shown that HEDSA is much more efficient, both
   in terms of the number of hops and the lookup time, than FEDSA.
   Therefore, HEDSA is more suitable for large-scale IoT discovery services
   applications, such as the EPCglobal Network, provided that the
   identifiers can be mapped to one and only one geographical location.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Thing (IoT) cloud system is a field attracting a great deal
   of recent attention. Vehicular networks is a key area in IoT, as they

   assistance such as like real-time traffic forecasting, advertisements
   and on board entertainment. Most of these applications rely on high
   quality video sharing, which is still an open research topic in
   Vehicular networks. We proposed a Cloud-MERVS technique for video
   streaming in Vehicular networks, which integrates IoT cloud system
   techniques and the Multi-channel Error Recovery Video Streaming (MERVS),
   to provide a more satisfying driving and travel experience. There are
   two types of service providers in cloud computing: Control Service
   Providers (CSPs) and Video Service Providers (VSPs). CSPs are
   responsible for collecting advertisement messages from the VSPs. The
   VSPs are the real video and service providers. Some VSPs are connected
   to a selected CSP to form a Group Service Provider (GSP), which is
   organized in a hierarchical structure for to improve efficiency. The

   frame length aggregation strategy to the current frame aggregation
   schemes in 802.11. Our simulations demonstrate improved results in data

Abstract = {{Planetary gearboxes often run under time-variant conditions, thus
   resulting in nonstationary signals. How to extract fault features from
   nonstationary vibration signals is a key issue of planetary gearbox
   fault diagnosis. Considering the merits of reassigned wavelet scalogram,
   i.e. fine time-frequency resolution and free from cross term
   interferences, it is used to analyze the vibration signals in joint
   time-frequency domain. The effectiveness of reassigned wavelet scalogram
   in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis under nonstationary conditions is
   validated by both lab experimental and in-situ signals. For the lab
   experimental signals, the gear characteristic frequencies and their time
   evolving features are identified. From the comparison between normal and
   faulty signal analysis results, the sun gear fault is diagnosed. For the
   in-situ signals, their time-frequency structures are also resolved.
   According to the presence of periodical impulses and their repeating
   period, the planet gear fault is detected.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a linear time-invariant (LTI) state feedback
   operator for nonholonomic mobile robots to track a pre-defined
   trajectory on a 2D planar region. Designing an on-line smooth state
   feedback control law is still among the major challenges for solving the
   trajectory tracking problem of nonholonomic systems including
   differential drive mobile robots. To address this problem, numerous
   nonlinear feedback control laws have been proposed to date. Most of
   these feedback control laws yield online solutions to the trajectory
   tracking problem with satisfactory tracking errors asymptotically. In
   most cases, they suffer from an overwhelming degree of computational
   complexity even to track a 2D trajectory using a simple unicycle-like
   nonholonomic system. The proposed control law offers an advantage of
   being smooth and LTI state-feedback in addition to its capability to
   address problems of partially observed systems. The shortcoming of the
   proposed control law is that the LTI feedback operator is computed
   off-line before the robot applies its control signal into the left and
   right wheels through their actuators. The theoretical results are
   supported by computer simulations followed by experiments with an e-puck

Abstract = {{Among the major challenges in tracking a pre-defined trajectory of a
   nonholonomic mobile robot operating in indoor environments is to
   determine an appropriate feedback control. In the technical literature,
   numerous controllers have been proposed to date for solving trajectory
   tracking and/or regulation problems of mobile robots. Most of them are
   quite promising to implement and mobile robots can operate in quite
   complex environments with these controllers. Nevertheless, one of the
   shortcomings of most of the existing controllers is the requirement of
   sophisticated hard wares, which, in some cases, more costly than the
   mobile robot itself. In addition, the analytical expression for most of
   the controllers is quite complex even for a simple nonholonomic system,
   an unicycle, for example. In this paper, we propose a neghboring optimal
   controller coupled with the state estimation for a differential drive
   mobile robot to track a pre-defined trajectory using signal strength
   measurements from RF (radio frequency) sensors placed in its operating
   environment. We emphasize that the RF sensors have limited communication
   range with the robot. The proposed controller is easy to implement, does
   not require sophisticated hardware for processing, and has relatively
   easier expression for the feedback controller. A numerical example is
   provided to validate the theoretical results. Computer simulations will
   be backed by experimental results for future investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Implementing aliasing-free (zero-aliasing) space compressors for
   built-in self-testing of very large scale integration circuits and
   systems is of great significance, especially in view of the
   technological paradigm shift in recent years from system-on-board to
   system-on-chip design. This paper investigates and provides new approach
   to realizing aliasing-free elementary-tree space compaction hardware
   targeting specifically embedded cores-based system-on-chips for single
   stuck-line faults, extending well-known concept from conventional
   switching theory, viz. that of compatibility relation as used in the
   minimization of incompletely specified sequential machines. For a pair
   of response data outputs of the circuit under test, the paper introduces
   the notion of fault detection compatibility and conditional fault
   detection compatibility (conditional upon some other response output
   pair being simultaneously fault detection compatible) with respect to
   two-input AND/NAND and XOR/XNOR logic. The process is illustrated in the
   paper with details of synthesis of space compressors for the
   International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) 85 combinational
   and ISCAS 89 full-scan sequential benchmark circuits using fault
   simulation programs ATALANTA, FSIM and HOPE, exemplifying the relevance
   of the technique from the standpoint of simplicity, resultant low area
   overhead and full fault coverage for single stuck-line faults, making it
   thus a logical choice in commercial design environments.}},

Abstract = {{IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks, also known as
   6LoWPAN, is becoming more and more a de facto standard for such
   communications for the Internet of Things, be it in the field of home
   and building automation, of industrial and process automation, or of
   smart metering and environmental monitoring. For all of these
   applications, scalability is a major precondition, as the complexity of
   the networks continuously increase.
   To maintain this growing amount of connected nodes a various 6LoWPAN
   implementations are available. One of the mentioned was developed by the
   authors' team and was tested on an Automated Physical Testbed for
   Wireless Systems at the Laboratory Embedded Systems and Communication
   Electronics of Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, which allows
   the flexible setup and full control of arbitrary topologies. It also
   supports time-varying topologies and thus helps to measure performance
   of the RPL implementation.
   The results of the measurements prove an excellent stability and a very
   good short and long-term performance also under dynamic conditions. In
   all measurements, there is an advantage of minimum 10 \% with regard to
   the average times, like global repair time; but the advantage with reagr
   to average values can reach up to 30 \%. Moreover, it can be proven that
   the performance predictions from other papers are consistent with the
   executed real-life implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-class learning is an important task in Data Science. One of the
   ways to achieve good performance on this task is to use Error Correcting
   Output Codes (ECOC), which is a powerful ensemble learning method that
   transforms a multi-class problem into a series of binary classifiers
   which it uses indirectly to learn the original multi-class problem. A
   crucial component of ECOC is the design of the coding matrix, which
   determines which binary problems should be combined to achieve
   multi-class classification. There are two general ways of designing the
   coding matrix. One is rooted in information theory while the other is
   data driven. In this work, we investigate the data-driven approach which
   was previously shown to bear greater promise and propose a better search
   through the coding-matrix space, keeping in mind the tradeoff between
   efficiency and effectiveness, as well as considerations about
   class-imbalance issues in the underlying binary problems. After
   consolidating our hy! potheses with a study on artificial domains, we
   propose the Unsupervised Deep Search Algorithm (UDS) coupled with
   re-sampling, to address both concerns. Our results on real world domains
   show that our method outperforms traditional multi-class learning
   methods.}},

   MODELING (BIM) TO OPTIMIZE THE SELECTION OF SUSTAINABLE BUILDING

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION}},

Abstract = {{One of the challenges in sustainability analysis and its development is
   the optimum selection of sustainable materials to meet the project's
   requirements while doing sustainable design. This can only be achieved
   when project team adopt the use of a strategic approach while selecting
   the materials, although this could be a complex task for decision
   makers. Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers designers the ability
   to assess different design alternatives at the conceptual stage of a
   project. As a method of integration and through its modeling techniques,
   BIM can be used to assess the impacts of design alternatives on the
   energy saving of buildings all over their life. Furthermore, BIM has the
   potential to help designers select the right type of materials during
   the early design stage, and make vital decisions when selecting the
   materials that have sustainable impact on the building's life cycle.
   The main purpose of this study is to propose a methodology that
   integrates BIM with decision-making problem-solving approaches (i.e.
   Entropy-TOPSIS) in order to efficiently optimize the selection of
   sustainable building components at the conceptual design stage of
   building projects. Therefore, a Decision Support System (DSS) is
   developed by using Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques
   to aid the design team decide on and select the optimum type of
   sustainable building components and design families while doing
   conceptual design of proposed projects, based on three main criteria
   (i.e. environmental factors, economic factors-{''}cost efficiency,{''}
   and social well-being) in an attempt to identify the influence of design
   variations on the whole building's sustainable performance.
   The multi-criteria procedure embedded in the DSS relies on numerical
   models to simulate alternative situations, as well as ranking the
   alternatives and select the best ones based on both the owners'
   strategic preferences and the availability of sustainable materials in
   the market. The set of models included in the DSS describes the
   relationship between sustainability criteria, manufacturers' sustainable
   materials and the interactions between project team that take place
   during the design of sustainable building projects. This paper aims at
   exposing the feasibility of using BIM for analysing the life cycle costs
   of sustainable buildings at the conceptual stage. The design
   alternatives suggested by the DSS are evaluated in an integrated
   environment that joins BIM concept and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) method to
   analyze the operational cost of the whole building. An actual building
   project is used to validate the workability and capability of the
   proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{An intelligent fault signature extraction scheme based on oscillatory
   behaviors is reported in this paper for bearing fault diagnosis. The
   proposed method is based on the joint application of morphological
   component analysis (MCA) and tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT)
   to decompose a signal into two signal components (i.e., low- and high
   oscillation components) according to whether they having sustained
   oscillations. As bearing fault-induced transients (low-oscillation
   component) oscillate differently from periodic interferences and noise
   (high oscillation component and residual), they can be separated via the
   MCA with the aid of TQWT which is parameterized by Q-factor and plays a
   role of distinguishing signal components presenting different
   oscillatory behaviors. The low- and high-oscillation components can be
   obtained by solving the objective function formulated based on MCA and
   TQWT. The determination of Q-factor for each signal component
   representation is also explored in this paper. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is examined by experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Lane detection and tracking and departure warning systems are important
   components of Intelligent Transportation Systems. They have particularly
   attracted great interest from industry and academia. Many architectures
   and commercial systems have been proposed in the literature. In this
   paper, we discuss the design of such systems regarding the following
   stages: pre-processing, detection, and tracking. For each stage, a short
   description of its working principle as well as their advantages and
   shortcomings are introduced. Our paper may possibly help in designing
   new systems that overcome and improve the shortcomings of current
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) refer to the set of smart
   components such as object detection and tracking systems used to protect
   drivers and road users. An important task that should be performed by
   ADAS is the measurement of the distance between a vehicle and a detected
   object. This helps to anticipate the position of objects in the lane,
   prevents collisions and improves the safety on the road. For this
   purpose, Distance Measurement Systems (DMS) including Vision-based
   techniques, Millimeter wave radars, Infrared ranging, and LIDAR are used
   in the automotive industry. In this paper, we discuss the design of such
   systems and their use in smart vehicles. Particular attention is given
   to vision-based techniques because they are considered among the most
   accurate systems used to identify targets and to measure the distance
   from them to a vehicle.}},
