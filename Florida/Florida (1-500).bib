Abstract = {{Radical copolymerization of divinyl monomers in the presence of chain
   transfer agents leads to soluble hyperbranched polymers. In this work,
   hyperbranched poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)
   (PPEG-MA) with degradable cross-linker branch points derived from
   glucarodilactone methacrylate was prepared via reversible addition
   fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to provide insight
   into hyperbranch formation during copolymerizations of multiolefinic
   compounds. The number average molecular weight of the polymers increased
   non-linearly with monomer conversion, implying that the incorporation of
   the divinyl cross-linker led to chain branching and a rapid increase in
   molecular weight at high conversion. The degree of branching was varied
   by controlling the feed ratio of monomer to cross-linker to chain
   transfer agent. Hydrolytic degradation of the sugar-derived dilactone
   branch points was examined under acidic, neutral, and basic aqueous
   conditions. To provide fundamental insight into the growth of primary
   chains during RAFT polymerizations of multiolefinic compounds, the
   resulting hyperbranched polymers were subjected to cross-link cleavage
   to obtain linear polymers. The molecular weights of the resulting
   polymer segments were similar to the theoretical molecular weights
   expected for linear analogues prepared with similar ratios of monomer to
   RAFT agent. Not only does this approach lead to new examples of
   degradable polymers with complex architectures, but also to important
   mechanistic insights into hyperbranch formation via polymerization of
   multiolefinic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to develop a fast and convergence proofed
   CBCT reconstruction framework based on the compressed sensing theory
   which not only lowers the imaging dose but also is computationally
   practicable in the busy clinic. We simplified the original mathematical
   formulation of gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR) to
   minimize the number of forward and backward projections for line search
   processes at each iteration. GPSR based algorithms generally showed
   improved image quality over the FDK algorithm especially when only a
   small number of projection data were available. When there were only 40
   projections from 360 degree fan beam geometry, the quality of GPSR based
   algorithms surpassed FDK algorithm within 10 iterations in terms of the
   mean squared relative error. Our proposed GPSR algorithm converged as
   fast as the conventional GPSR with a reasonably low computational
   complexity. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed GPSR algorithm is
   attractive for use in real time applications such as on-line IGRT.}},

Title = {{Utilization of the SAVANNA model to analyze future patterns of
   vegetation cover in Kruger National Park under changing climate}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{342}},

Abstract = {{Within southern Africa's savanna ecosystems, woody and herbaceous
   species have differing growth characteristics that allow a tenuous
   co-existance. The high dependence of humans on the landscape, through
   agricultural production, tourism, and natural resource extraction makes
   understanding savanna vegetation dynamics essential. Studies analyzing
   resilience of savannas suggest potential state changes in vegetation
   structure from continuous grasslands with sporadic woody cover to less
   biologically productive landscapes. One of the biggest questions in this
   landscape is the impact of climate change. The spatially explicit
   SAVANNA model is used to analyze the impact of climate change on
   vegetation cover across Kruger National Park's (KNP) main land system
   classifications (Satara, Skukuza, Letaba, and Phalaborwa). Manipulating
   climate inputs and management regimes allowed us to analyze the
   resilience of savanna vegetation under multiple Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios. Trends in future climate indicate an
   increase in temperatures greater than 1.0 degrees Celsius and a slight
   decrease in precipitation by 2080. Model results indicate a long-term
   decrease in multiple size classes of vegetation across all the four land
   systems. However, the model runs show differing response to climate
   change between the woody and herbaceous cover types. Spatial trends
   across the park follow closely with the north-south climate gradient.
   The most spatially distinct land system was Skukuza, which exhibited
   some of the highest initial net primary production (NPP) values and also
   the greatest decreases in NPP into the future. While this region is
   projected to lose large proportions of its herbaceous and shrub
   vegetation it is projected to increase in tree green leaf, mostly
   related to increasing fine leaf vegetation (Acacia sp.). The northern
   land systems were already dominated by mopane, but under all model
   scenarios mopane will increase in Letaba and Phalaborwa. This mopane
   increase will offset the loss of herbaceous and shrub vegetation,
   resulting in little to no decrease in NPP across time for these land
   systems. This work illustrates that landscape resilience is not only
   impacted by the severity of changing climate but the degree to which we
   manage such systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing literature concerning the role of the home math
   environment in children's math development. In this study, we examined
   the relation between these constructs by specifically addressing three
   goals. The first goal was to identify the measurement structure of the
   home math environment through a series of confirmatory factor analyses.
   The second goal was to examine the role of the home math environment in
   predicting parent report of children's math skills. The third goal was
   to test a series of potential alternative explanations for the relation
   between the home math environment and parent report of children's
   skills, specifically the direct and indirect role of household income,
   parent math anxiety, and parent math ability as measured by their
   approximate number system performance. A final sample of 339 parents of
   children aged 3 through 8 drawn from Mechanical Turk answered a
   questionnaire online. The best fitting model of the home math
   environment was a bifactor model with a general factor representing the
   general home math environment, and three specific factors representing
   the direct numeracy environment, the indirect numeracy environment, and
   the spatial environment. When examining the association of the home math
   environment factors to parent report of child skills, the general home
   math environment factor and the spatial environment were the only
   significant predictors. Parents who reported doing more general math
   activities in the home reported having children with higher math skills,
   whereas parents who reported doing more spatial activities reported
   having children with lower math skills.}},

Abstract = {{We used temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and
   synchrotron-radiation-based photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) to
   investigate the adsorption and oxidation of methanol (CH3OH) on
   Tb2O3(111) and TbO2(111) thin films grown on Pt(111). We find that
   methanol mainly desorbs from the Tb2O3 surface through both molecular
   and recombinative processes and that a relatively small amount of
   adsorbed methanol (<20\%) dehydrogenates to CH2O and H2O with these
   species desorbing between about 160 and 300 K. Oxidation of the terbia
   film enhances the surface reactivity as similar to 50\% of the adsorbed
   methanol on TbO2 oxidizes to mainly CH2O and water as well as CO2 that
   desorbs near 600 K during TPRS. Quantification of the product yields
   suggests that all of the excess surface 0 atoms, resulting from
   oxidation of Tb2O3 to TbO2, are removed during TPRS by reaction with
   adsorbed CH3OH. We did not detect CO or H-2 production under any
   conditions. PES measurements show that several adsorbed intermediates
   form on the TbOx surfaces at temperatures as lbw as 140 K, including
   mainly methoxy (CH3O-) as well as smaller quantities of a more oxidized
   species, thought to be either CH2O2 or CHO2. XPS spectra collected as a
   function of the surface temperature provide evidence that the adsorbed
   CH3O- groups serve as the main intermediate for both CH2O and CH3OH
   formation at temperatures below 400 K, while the more oxidized species
   is a spectator to CH2O formation but undergoes complete oxidation on
   TbO2 at- temperature above 450 K. The high reactivity of the TbO2
   surface correlates with the presence of labile oxygen atoms that are
   generated during oxidation of the Tb2O3 film.}},

Abstract = {{Flow through nanopores has received a great deal of attention during the
   past decade due to its versatile areas of application in biology and
   engineering. The asymmetrical geometry of conical nanopores has made
   these devices advantageous in rectification of ionic current for
   counting and detection of biofluidic entities such as proteins and DNAs.
   Protein solutions exhibit non-Newtonian theological behavior which
   mathematically alludes to a nonlinear relation between shear stress and
   shear rate. In this study, the electroosmotic flow (EOF) of
   non-Newtonian solutions through a conical nanopore with a constant
   charge density on the wall is investigated numerically. Using the
   assumption of continuity, the ionic transport in the EO flow is modeled
   by combining the Poisson, Nernst Plank, and Navier Stokes equations for
   potential field, ionic concentration, and velocity distributions,
   respectively. The biofluid is assumed to behave as a non-Newtonian
   power-law fluid with constant physical properties. For both overlapping
   and nonoverlapping electric double layers, the effects of biofluid
   theological behavior, surface charge density, applied voltage, and the
   ratio of the pore radius to the Debye length on the ionic current
   rectification and the EOF are studied.}},

Abstract = {{An image-based skeletal dosimetry model for internal electron sources
   was created for the ICRP-defined reference adult female. Many previous
   skeletal dosimetry models, which are still employed in commonly used
   internal dosimetry software, do not properly account for electron escape
   from trabecular spongiosa, electron cross-fire from cortical bone, and
   the impact of marrow cellularity on active marrow self-irradiation.
   Furthermore, these existing models do not employ the current ICRP
   definition of a 50 mu m bone endosteum (or shallow marrow). Each of
   these limitations was addressed in the present study. Electron transport
   was completed to determine specific absorbed fractions to both active
   and shallow marrow of the skeletal regions of the University of Florida
   reference adult female. The skeletal macrostructure and microstructure
   were modeled separately. The bone macrostructure was based on the
   whole-body hybrid computational phantom of the UF series of reference
   models, while the bone microstructure was derived from microCT images of
   skeletal region samples taken from a 45 years-old female cadaver. The
   active and shallow marrow are typically adopted as surrogate tissue
   regions for the hematopoietic stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells,
   respectively. Source tissues included active marrow, inactive marrow,
   trabecular bone volume, trabecular bone surfaces, cortical bone volume,
   and cortical bone surfaces. Marrow cellularity was varied from 10 to 100
   percent for active marrow self-irradiation. All other sources were run
   at the defined ICRP Publication 70 cellularity for each bone site. A
   total of 33 discrete electron energies, ranging from 1 keV to 10 MeV,
   were either simulated or analytically modeled. The method of combining
   skeletal macrostructure and microstructure absorbed fractions assessed
   using MCNPX electron transport was found to yield results similar to
   those determined with the PIRT model applied to the UF adult male
   skeletal dosimetry model. Calculated skeletal averaged absorbed
   fractions for each source-target combination were found to follow
   similar trends of more recent dosimetry models (image-based models) but
   did not follow results from skeletal models based upon assumptions of an

Abstract = {{Damaged axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS),
   including those of the spinal cord, have extremely limited endogenous
   capacity to regenerate. This is the result of both the intrinsic and
   extrinsic inhibitory factors that limit the regeneration of adult
   neurons. Despite attempts to limit or eliminate the extrinsic inhibitory
   components, regeneration of adult neurons in the CNS is still limited.
   Therefore, additional factors that can further enhance the intrinsic
   plasticity of adult neurons need to be considered. Herein, we examine
   the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a known growth
   factor for neuronal survival and plasticity, using an in vivo delivery
   method for a localized and sustained delivery to the spinal cord. A
   highly versatile injectable biomaterial platform for the sustained
   delivery of BDNF was developed using a physical blend of hyaluronic acid
   (HA) and methytcellulose (MC), in combination with poly
   -lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microparticles. Contemporary studies
   examining the plasticity of the CNS suggest that the spinal cord is an
   important site for activity dependent learning that can mediate motor
   function after injury or disease. Here we utilized such a learning
   paradigm in combination with local and sustained BDNF application (at
   L3-S2) to foster spinal learning after complete spinal cord injury in
   rodents. Our data suggest that composite biomaterial systems such as the
   one described herein can be utilized for the sustained and localized
   delivery of therapeutics following damage to the spinal cord.}},

   approaches. In radiation detection system design based on such
   technique, it is highly desired to have abilities to accurately and

   reactions. In this work, simulation results were compared with
   measurement outcomes to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of
   the code MCNPX 2.7.0 in the simulation of delayed gamma-rays from
   photofission of uranium and plutonium samples. First, high-energy
   delayed gamma-rays (Ey-2.7-4.5 MeV) from photofission of U-238 were
   simulated and validated against the energy spectra measured in between
   linac pulses. Second, low-energy delayed gamma-ray spectra (Ey-0.6-2.7

Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Complete evolution of a lightning discharge, from its initiation at an
   altitude of about 4 km to its ground attachment, was optically observed
   for the first time at the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville, Florida.
   The discharge developed during the late stage of a cloud flash and was
   initiated in a decayed branch of the latter. The initial channel section
   was intermittently illuminated for over 100 ms, until a bidirectionally
   extending channel (leader) was formed. During the bidirectional leader
   extension, the negative end exhibited optical and radio-frequency
   electromagnetic features expected for negative cloud-to-ground strokes
   developing in virgin air, while the positive end most of the time
   appeared to be inactive or showed intermittent channel luminosity
   enhancements. The development of positive end involved an abrupt
   creation of a 1-km long, relatively straight branch with a streamer
   corona burst at its far end. This 1-km jump appeared to occur in virgin
   air at a remarkably high effective speed of the order of 106 m/s. The
   positive end of the bidirectional leader connected to another
   bidirectional leader to form a larger bidirectional leader, whose
   negative end attached to the ground and produced a 36-kA return stroke.}},

Abstract = {{We present and discuss current waveforms associated with 13 bipolar
   lightning flashes recorded at the Santis Tower during the period from
   June 2010 to January 2015. During this period, a total of 427 flashes
   were recorded, of which 13 (3\%) were classified as bipolar flashes. The
   majority of the recorded flashes (10 out of 13) exhibited a polarity
   reversal during the initial continuous current, therefore belonging to
   Category I according to the classification proposed by Rakov (2003). Of
   the three remaining flashes, two were characterized by different
   polarities of the initial stage current and the following return stroke
   or strokes (Category II), and one flash involved return strokes of
   opposite polarity within the same flash (Category III). In Category I
   bipolar flashes, the polarity reversal is usually assumed to be
   associated with in-cloud processes. However, two of our 10 Category I
   flashes appeared to be each a sequence of two upward discharges of
   opposite polarity, initiated from the tower within tens of milliseconds
   of each other. This is the first time that such a sequence has been
   observed from the same tower. We suggest that the traditional
   classification of bipolar flashes should be modified to distinguish
   between two types of Category I flashes: those in which the polarity
   reversal during the initial stage is associated with in-cloud processes
   (Category Ia) and those in which the polarity reversal is due to
   initiation of two opposite-polarity leaders from the tower (Category
   Ib).}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the fate and transport of antibiotics in porous media can
   help reduce their contamination risks to soil and groundwater systems.
   In this work, batch and column experiments were conducted to determine
   the interactions between two representative antibiotics, sulfacetamide
   (SA) and levofloxacin (LEV), and sand porous media under various
   solution pH, humic acid (HA) concentration, grain size, and moisture
   content conditions. Batch sorption experimental results indicated that
   the sand had relatively strong bonding affinity to LEV, but little
   sorption of SA under different pH, HA concentration, grain size
   conditions. Results from the packed sand column experiments showed that
   SA had extremely high mobility in the porous media for all combinations
   of pH, HA concentration, grain size, and moisture content. The mass
   recovery of SA was higher than 98.5\% in all the columns with the
   exception of the one packed with fine sand (97.2\%). The retention of
   LEV in the columns was much higher and the recovery rates ranged from
   0\% to 71.1\%. Decreases in solution pH, HA concentration, grain size,
   or moisture content reduced the mobility of LEV in the columns under the
   tested conditions. These results indicated that type of antibiotics and
   environmental conditions also played an important role in controlling
   their fate and transport in porous media. Mathematical models were
   applied to simulate and interpret experimental data, and model
   simulations described the interactions between the two antibiotics and
   sand porous media very well. Findings from this study elucidated the key
   factors and processes controlling the fate of SA and LEV in porous
   media, which can inform the prediction and assessment of the
   environmental risks of antibiotics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Here, a simple zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle sizing is reported for
   aramid fibers that simultaneously provides interfacial reinforcement and
   UV absorption to develop improved fiber-reinforced composites. Through a
   one-step nanoparticle deposition, the modified aramid fiber showed an
   increase in interfacial shear strength of 18.9\% with the addition of
   ZnO nanoparticles when tested by single-fiber pullout. The aramid fibers
   were then treated with a hydrolysis process common to aramid fibers to
   oxidize the surface and elucidate the importance of oxygen functional
   groups at the interface. These oxidized fibers proved to further enhance
   the interface between the fiber surface and nanoparticle, leading to a
   33.3\% increase relative to the bare fiber. Additionally, due to the
   absorption properties of ZnO, the retainment of mechanical properties of
   coated fibers was determined after exposure to an artificial UV light
   source. After 24 h of exposure, fibers coated with ZnO nanoparticles
   retained 25\% more tensile strength and 21\% more modulus than uncoated
   bare fibers. This work shows that ZnO nanoparticles may serve as a
   novel, yet simple, multifunctional fiber sizing with which to increase
   the interfacial strength of aramid fiber composites and improve the
   resistance to UV irradiation, enabling stronger and more-durable
   structural fiber composites.}},

Abstract = {{Deuterium incorporation depths of similar to 0.13-0.65 mu m were
   obtained in bulk, single-crystal Ga2O3 during exposure to H-2 plasmas
   for 0.5 h at 100-270 degrees C. The data were fit using the Florida
   Object Oriented Process Simulator simulation code. The estimated
   diffusivities were in the range of 2.3 x 10(-14)-6 x 10(-13) cm(2)/V.s
   over this temperature range. The activation energy for diffusion was
   0.30 +/- 0.08 eV, suggesting that the diffusing deuterium migrates as an
   interstitial. The solubility of the deuterium exhibited an activation
   energy of 0.35 eV. Subsequent annealing at 500 degrees C removed similar
   to 85\% of the deuterium out of the Ga2O3, with an activation energy of
   1.35 eV. This indicates that the outdiffusion is mediated through
   defects or molecule formation. The thermal stability of deuterium
   retention is lower (similar to 150 degrees C shift to lower
   temperatures) than when the deuterium is incorporated in the Ga2O3 by
   direct ion implantation, due to trapping at residual damage in the
   latter case. The incorporation depths of deuterium in the Ga2O3 are
   significantly less than in bulk ZnO under the same conditions, where we
   observed incorporation to similar to 25 mu m. Published by AIP

Title = {{Freshwater Detention by Oyster Reefs: Quantifying a Keystone Ecosystem
   Service}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Oyster reefs provide myriad ecosystem services, including water quality
   improvement, fisheries and other faunal support, shoreline protection
   from erosion and storm surge, and economic productivity. However, their
   role in directing flow during non-storm conditions has been largely
   neglected. In regions where oyster reefs form near the mouth of
   estuarine rivers, they likely alter ocean-estuary exchange by acting as
   fresh water ``dams{''}. We hypothesize that these reefs have the
   potential to detain fresh water and influence salinity over extensive
   areas, thus providing a ``keystone{''} ecosystem service by supporting
   estuarine functions that rely on the maintenance of estuarine (i.e.,
   brackish) conditions in the near-shore environment. In this work, we
   investigated the effects of shore-parallel reefs on estuarine salinity
   using field data and hydrodynamic modeling in a degraded reef complex in
   the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Results suggested that freshwater
   detention by long linear chains of oyster reefs plays an important role
   in modulating salinities, not only in the oysters' local environment,
   but over extensive estuarine areas (tens of square kilometers). Field
   data confirmed the presence of salinity differences between landward and
   seaward sides of the reef, with long-term mean salinity differences of
   >30\% between sides. Modeled results expanded experimental findings by
   illustrating how oyster reefs affect the lateral and offshore extent of
   freshwater influence. In general, the effects of simulated reefs were
   most pronounced when they were highest in elevation, without gaps, and
   when riverine discharge was low. Taken together, these results describe
   a poorly documented ecosystem service provided by oyster reefs; provide
   an estimate of the magnitude and spatial extent of this service; and
   offer quantitative information to help guide future oyster reef
   restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Thin-film optoelectronic devices based on polycrystalline
   organolead-halide perovskites have recently become a topic of intense
   research. Single crystals of these materials have been grown from
   solution with electrical properties superior to those of polycrystalline

   architectures based on organoleadhalide perovskite single crystals, we
   developed a process to form epitaxial layers of methylammonium lead
   iodide (MAPbI(3)) on methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) single
   crystals. The formation of the MAPbI(3) layer is found to be dominated
   by the diffusion of halide ions, leading to a shift in the
   photoluminescence and absorption spectra. X-ray diffraction measurements
   confirm the single-crystal nature of the MAPbI(3) layer, while carrier
   transport measurements show that the converted layer retains the high
   carrier mobility typical of single-crystal perovskite materials. Such
   heterostructures on perovskite single crystals open possibilities for
   new types of devices.}},

   Vision}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMAGING}},

Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of a tree canopy is an important
   step in order to measure canopy geometry, such as height, width, volume,
   and leaf cover area. In this research, binocular stereo vision was used
   to recover the 3D information of the canopy. Multiple images were taken
   from different views around the target. The Structure-from-motion (SfM)
   method was employed to recover the camera calibration matrix for each
   image, and the corresponding 3D coordinates of the feature points were
   calculated and used to recover the camera calibration matrix. Through
   this method, a sparse projective reconstruction of the target was
   realized. Subsequently, a ball pivoting algorithm was used to do surface
   modeling to realize dense reconstruction. Finally, this dense
   reconstruction was transformed to metric reconstruction through ground
   truth points which were obtained from camera calibration of binocular
   stereo cameras. Four experiments were completed, one for a known
   geometric box, and the other three were: a croton plant with big leaves
   and salient features, a jalapeno pepper plant with median leaves, and a
   lemon tree with small leaves. A whole-view reconstruction of each target
   was realized. The comparison of the reconstructed box's size with the
   real box's size shows that the 3D reconstruction is in metric
   reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the ways that sample rate, sample time, and number
   of test replications can affect the random uncertainty in a measurement.
   Typical steady timewise experiments seek the average values of measured
   variables. Even in this case, sample rate and sample time can affect the
   signal standard deviations and yield different random uncertainty
   estimates. In addition, many random error sources vary slowly relative
   to the test time and take on a single value. Test replications can
   convert systematic uncertainties to random uncertainties by allowing
   their values to change from test to test. The goal is to record
   individual tests at a sample rate and time that capture the short
   timescale error sources, and to replicate tests on the scale of long
   timescale error sources. This paper presents how to leverage these
   effects to reduce the overall uncertainty of a measured result without
   increasing the cost of the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The US Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology is used in Spain to
   evaluate traffic operation and quality of service. The effect of passing
   manoeuvre on two-lane highway operational performance is considered
   through adjustment factors to average travel speeds and percent time
   spent following. The procedure is largely based on simulations in TWOPAS
   and passing behaviours observed during US calibrations in the 1970s. It
   is not clear whether US driving behaviour and vehicles' performance are
   comparable with Spanish conditions. The objective of this research is to
   adapt the HCM 2010 methodology to Spanish driver behaviour, for base
   conditions (i.e. no passing restrictions). To do so, TWOPAS was
   calibrated and validated based on current Spanish passing field data.
   The calibration used a genetic algorithm. The case study included an
   ideal two-lane highway with varying directional traffic flow rate,
   directional split and percentage of trucks. The updated methodology for
   base conditions is simpler than the current HCM 2010 and does not rely
   on interpolation from tables. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The influence of anionic dispersing agents, such as sodium poly(acrylic
   acid), sodium hexametaphosphate, and sodium silicate on the dissolution
   of crude kaolin was examined by measuring the dissolved metals produced
   in the absence and presence of dispersing agents. For this purpose, the
   rheological and structural changes caused by the dissolution of kaolin
   metal constituents were studied in batch mode using several parameters,
   namely, solids (wt.\%), pH, contact time (aging), and dispersing agent
   dose. A noteworthy increase in kaolin dissolution was caused by the
   presence of dispersing agents, particularly poly(acrylic acid) and
   sodium hexametaphosphate. These agents produced conspicuously large
   amounts of dissolved Al in comparison to the other experimental
   treatments. Little dissolved Si was measured under similar conditions in
   distilled water, but the amount of Si released using dispersing agents
   was nearly double that observed in distilled water only. Excess
   dispersing agents interacted with kaolin and dissolved accessory
   elements in the kaolin (i.e. Fe, Ca, Mg) and thus released enough Fe to

Abstract = {{In many applications data classification may be hindered by the
   existence of multiple contexts that produce an input sample. To
   alleviate the problems associated with multiple contexts, context-based
   classification is a process that uses different classifiers depending on
   a measure of the context. Context-based classifiers offer the promise of
   increasing performance by allowing classifiers to become experts at
   classifying input samples of certain types, rather than trying to force
   single classifiers to perform well on all possible inputs. This study
   introduces a novel mixture of experts (ME) model, the mixture of hidden
   Markov model experts, for context-based classification of samples that
   are variable length sequences; and derives the update equations for a
   single probabilistic model that to learn the experts and a gate that
   connects the experts. The model has a similar high-level structure to
   the ME model but has the novelty that the gates and the experts are HMMs
   and the input data are sequences. Experimental results are presented on
   three datasets including one for landmine detection. Detailed analysis
   of the model is provided; which, over multiple runs and cross-validation
   experiments, show superior results over the compared algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Barium titanate nanofibers were uniaxially aligned by electrospinning
   onto a rotating copper wire drum and alignment was maintained during
   calcination of the fibers. Two methods for maintaining alignment during
   calcination were tested, by either using carbon tape or a peeling off
   method to remove the aligned fibers from the mandrel followed by
   calcination. The carbon tape removal method led to the formation of
   shorter aligned nanowires while the peeling off method resulted in
   longer nanofibers. Additionally, the effects of calcination temperature
   and time on crystal structure were also examined. The degree of
   tetragonality in the barium titanate nanofibers increased at higher
   calcination temperatures and times. Piezoelectricity was confirmed in
   the nanofibers calcined using piezoeresponse force microscopy, yielding
   a d(33) value of 15.5 pm/V. Using the methods presented here, large
   quantities of aligned piezoelectric barium titanate and other ceramic
   fibers or wires can be produced to fulfill their demand in novel

Abstract = {{Text mining is a growing field of applications, which enables the
   analysis of large text data sets using statistical methods. In recent
   years, exponential increase in the size of these data sets has strained
   existing systems, requiring more computing power, server hardware,
   networking interconnects, and power consumption. For practical reasons,
   this trend cannot continue in the future. Instead, we propose a
   reconfigurable hardware accelerator designed for text analytics systems,
   which can simultaneously improve performance and reduce power
   consumption. Situated near the last level of memory, it mitigates the
   need for high-bandwidth processor-to-memory connections, instead
   capitalizing on close data proximity, massively parallel operation, and
   analytic-inspired functional units to maximize energy efficiency, while
   remaining flexible to easily map common text analytic kernels. A
   field-programmable gate array-based emulation framework demonstrates the
   functional correctness of the system, and a full eight-core accelerator
   is synthesized for power, area, and delay estimates. The accelerator can
   achieve two to three orders of magnitude improvement in energy
   efficiency versus CPU and general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPU)
   for various text mining kernels. As a case study, we demonstrate how
   indexing performance of Lucene, a popular text search and analytics
   platform, can be improved by an average of 70\% over CPU and GPU while
   significantly reducing data transfer energy and latency.}},

Abstract = {{The shortage and congestion of lower spectra motivate the exploration of
   the broadband and underutilized mmWave to be used in future public
   mobile communications, and subsequently future HSR mobile
   communications, which has the potential to provide multi-gigabit rate
   radio access for train passengers. However, due to the inferior
   propagation characteristics of mmWave and particularity of HSR
   scenarios, there are many design challenges ahead. In this article, we
   tackle those challenges by developing technical solutions for mmWave
   broadband HSR systems. We first propose feasible multiple access
   techniques and frame structures based on OFDM and SC communications,
   respectively. We then present promising train-trackside network
   architectures based on different MIMO techniques, including BF and SM,
   which have been viewed as the key enabling technologies to realize
   mmWave communications in outdoor environments. Moreover, we discuss the
   inherent defects of each architecture and offer the corresponding
   solutions or recommendations. Finally, we conduct performance
   evaluation, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed
   architectures. We hope this article will stimulate further research on
   the innovative use of mmWave in high-speed rail systems.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical liquids addition systems have been used at municipal landfills
   as a leachate management method and to enhance biostabilization of
   waste. Drawbacks of these systems include a limitation on pressurized
   injection and the occurrence of seepage. A novel vertical well system
   that employed buried wells constructed below a lift of compacted waste
   was operated for 153 days at a landfill in Florida, USA. The system
   included 54 wells installed in six clusters of nine wells connected with
   a horizontally-oriented manifold system. A cumulative volume of 8430
   m(3) of leachate was added intermittently into the well clusters over
   the duration of the project with no incidence of surface seeps.
   Achievable average flow rates ranged from 9.3 x 10(-4) m(3) s(-1) to
   14.2 x 10(-4) m(3) s(-1), which was similar to or greater than flow
   rates achieved in a previous study using traditional vertical wells at
   the same landfill site. The results demonstrated that pressurized
   liquids addition in vertical wells at municipal solid waste landfills
   can be achieved while avoiding typical operational and maintenance
   issues associated with seeps.}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), primary users (PUs) can leverage
   secondary users (SUs) as cooperative relays to increase their
   transmission rates, while SUs will in return obtain more spectrum access
   opportunities, leading to cooperative CRNs (CCRNs). Prior research works
   in CCRNs mainly focus on providing ubiquitous access and high throughput
   for users, but have rarely taken energy efficiency into consideration.
   Besides, most existing works assume that the SUs are passively selected
   by PUs regardless of SUs' willingness to help, which is obviously not
   practical. To address energy issue, this paper proposes an
   energy-efficient cooperative strategy by leveraging temporal and spatial
   diversity of the primary network. Specifically, SUs with delay-tolerant
   packets can proactively make the cooperative decisions by jointly
   considering primary channel availability, channel state information,
   PUs' traffic load, and their own transmission requirements. We formulate
   this decision-making problem based on the optimal stopping theory to
   maximize SUs' energy efficiency. We solve this problem using a dynamic
   programming approach and derive the optimal cooperative policy.
   Extensive simulations are then conducted to evaluate the performance of
   our proposed strategy. The results show significant improvements of SUs'
   energy efficiency compared with existing cooperative schemes, which
   demonstrate the benefits of our proposed cooperative strategy in
   conserving energy for SUs.}},

Title = {{Polishing Characteristics of Transparent Polycrystalline Yttrium
   Aluminum Garnet Ceramics Using Magnetic Field-Assisted Finishing}},
Journal = {{Journal of Micro and Nano-Manufacturing}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Transparent polycrystalline yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) ceramics have
   garnered an increased level of interest for high-power laser
   applications due to their ability to be manufactured in large sizes and
   to be doped in relatively substantial concentrations. However, surface
   characteristics have a direct effect on the lasing ability of these
   materials, and a lack of a fundamental understanding of the polishing
   mechanisms of these ceramics remains a challenge to their utilization.
   The aim of this paper is to study the polishing characteristics of YAG
   ceramics using magnetic field-assisted finishing (MAF). MAF is a useful
   process for studying the polishing characteristics of a material due to
   the extensive variability of, and fine control over, the polishing
   parameters. An experimental setup was developed for YAG ceramic
   workpieces, and using this equipment with diamond abrasives, the
   surfaces were polished to subnanometer scales. When polishing these
   subnanometer surfaces with 0-0.1 mu m mean diameter diamond abrasive,
   the severity of the initial surface defects governed whether
   improvements to the surface would occur at these locations. Polishing
   subnanometer surfaces with colloidal silica abrasive caused a worsening
   of defects, resulting in increasing roughness. Colloidal silica causes
   uneven material removal between grains and an increase in material
   removal at grain boundaries causing the grain structure of the YAG
   ceramic workpiece to become pronounced. This effect also occurred with
   either abrasive when polishing with iron particles, used in MAF to press
   abrasives against a workpiece surface, that are smaller than the grain
   size of the YAG ceramic.}},

Title = {{Three-Dimensional Heat Transfer Analysis of Metal Fasteners in Roofing
   Assemblies}},
Journal = {{BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Heat transfer analysis was performed on typical roofing assemblies using
   HEAT3, a three-dimensional heat transfer analysis software. The
   difference in heat transferred through the roofing assemblies considered
   is compared between two cases-without any steel fasteners and with steel
   fasteners. In the latter case, the metal roofing fasteners were arranged
   as per Factor Mutual Global (FMG) approvals, in the field, perimeter,
   and corner zones of the roof. The temperature conditions used for the
   analysis represented summer and winter conditions for three separate
   Climate Zones (CZ) namely Climate Zone 2 or CZ2 represented by Orlando,
   FL; CZ3 represented by Atlanta, GA; and CZ6 zone represented by St.
   Paul, MN. In all the climatic conditions, higher energy transfer was
   observed with increase in the number of metal fasteners attributed to
   high thermal conductivity of metals as compared to the insulation and
   other materials used in the roofing assembly. This difference in heat
   loss was also quantified in the form of percentage change in the overall
   or effective insulation of the roofing assembly for better understanding
   of the practical aspects. Besides, a comparison of 2D heat transfer
   analysis (using THERM software) and 3D analysis using HEAT3 is also
   discussed proving the relevance of 3D over 2D heat transfer analysis.}},

   formation bright pulse discharges occurring at the tip of dart-stepped
   leaders of rocket triggered lightning with a time resolution of 0.1 mu s

   pulse discharges appeared to initiate at a location immediately below
   the bottom of its previous pulse discharge and to propagate in
   bidirectional (upward and downward) waves with a speed on the order of
   10(7) m/s. The downward waves of the pulse discharges tended to slow
   down significantly after they propagated a distance of about 2 m. Based
   on the results observed in this study and those published in

   Bare Ground Production System in Florida}},
Journal = {{HORTTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{699-706}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Seepage is characterized as an inefficient irrigation method with regard
   to water and nutrient use. There is a need for an economically viable
   irrigation alternative to seepage, which increases crop productivity and
   profitability in Florida. The use of plastic mulch and drip irrigation
   for cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) production increases plant
   population per area and reduces the irrigation water requirement.
   However, plasticulture has a high capital investment and operating cost.
   The objectives of this study were to compare the profitability of
   plasticulture cabbage production and traditional seepage bare ground
   irrigation systems for Florida cabbage production, and to determine the
   breakeven point for cabbage grown under plasticulture given a range of
   market prices. The preharvest cost per acre for the plasticulture system
   was significantly higher than the cost for the seepage system (\$ 4726
   and \$ 3035 per acre, respectively). However, for all planting dates
   considered in this study, the plasticulture system resulted in a
   significant increase in marketable yields when compared with the seepage
   system. The resulting increase in potential revenue offset the increase
   in preharvest costs and assured a positive net return on investment over
   the whole range market prices. It was also observed that low air
   temperatures combined with reduced solar radiation can prevent optimum
   plant development for cabbage transplanted between November and
   mid-December. Therefore, the return on investment may be reduced during
   less favorable climatic conditions for cabbage growth, making the
   plasticulture system less economically desirable for certain planting
   dates.}},

Abstract = {{Many important network functions require online membership lookup
   against a large set of addresses, flow labels, signatures, and so on.
   This paper studies a more difficult, yet less investigated problem,
   called multi-set membership lookup, which involves multiple (sometimes
   in hundreds or even thousands) sets. The lookup determines not only
   whether an element is a member of the sets but also which set it belongs
   to. To facilitate the implementation of multi-set membership lookup in
   on-die memory of a network processor for line-speed packet inspection,
   the existing work uses the variants of Bloom filters to encode set IDs.
   However, through a thorough analysis of the mechanism and the
   performance of the prior art, much to our surprise, we find that Bloom
   filters-which were originally designed for encoding binary membership
   information-are actually not efficient for encoding set IDs. This paper
   takes a different solution path by separating membership encoding and
   set ID storage in two data structures, called index filter and set-id
   table, respectively. With a new ID placement strategy called uneven
   candidate-entry distribution and a two-level design of an index filter,
   we demonstrate through analysis and simulation that when compared with
   the best existing work, our new approach is able to achieve significant
   memory saving under the same lookup accuracy requirement, or achieve
   significantly better lookup accuracy under the same memory constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Joint FoUntain coding and Network coding (FUN) is proposed to boost
   information spreading over multi-hop lossy networks. The novelty of our
   FUN approach lies in combining the best features of fountain coding,
   intra-session network coding, and cross-next-hop network coding. This
   paper provides an in-depth study of FUN codes. First, we theoretically
   analyze the throughput of FUN codes. Second, we identify several
   practical issues that may undermine the actual performance, such as
   buffer overflow, and quantify the resulting throughput degradation.
   Finally, we propose a systematic design to overcome these issues.
   Simulation results in TDMA multi-hop networks show that our methods
   yield near-optimal throughput and are significantly better than fountain
   codes and existing network coding schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The deployment of ruggedized surface observing platforms by university
   research programs in the path of landfalling tropical cyclones has
   yielded a wealth of information regarding the near-surface wind flow
   characteristics. Data records collected by Texas Tech University's Wind
   Engineering Mobile Instrument Tower Experiment and StickNet probes and
   by the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program along the Gulf Coast of the
   United States from 2004 to 2008 were compiled to examine influences on
   near-surface gust factors. Archived composite reflectivity data from
   coastal WSR-88D instruments were also merged with the tower records to
   investigate the influence of precipitation structure. Wind records were
   partitioned into 10-min segments, and the ratio of the peak
   moving-average 3-s-gust wind speed to the segment mean was used to
   define a gust factor. Observations were objectively stratified into
   terrain exposure categories to determine if factors beyond those
   associated with surface frictional effects can be extracted from the
   observations. Wind flow characteristics within exposure classes were
   weakly influenced by storm-relative position and precipitation
   structure. Eyewall observations showed little difference in mean gust
   factors when compared with other regions. In convective precipitation,
   only peak gust factors were slightly larger than those found in
   stratiform conditions, with little differences in the mean. Gust factors
   decreased slightly with decreasing radial distance in rougher terrain
   exposures and did not respond to radar-observed changes in precipitation
   structure. In two limited comparisons, near-surface gusts did not exceed
   the magnitude of the wind maximum aloft detected through wind profiles
   that were derived from WSR-88D velocity azimuth displays.}},

   temperature. Higher temperature reached during combustion of urea
   promoted the formation of better crystallinity, nano-sized and

Abstract = {{In this work, highly uniform single crystal Fe2O3 nanorods have been
   synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method in the presence of
   dihydrogen phosphate ions. Phosphate ions were speculated capping to the
   sidewalls of Fe2O3 nanocrystals, and resulted in the anisotropic growth
   of hematite crystals along their {[}006] zone axis. Fe2O3 nanorods with
   various aspect ratios have been realized by applying different phosphate
   concentration of 0.1-0.4 mM. The electrochemical properties of Fe2O3
   nanorods showed that the samples with the smallest aspect ratio
   possessed superior specific capacitance and stability. It was speculated
   that the larger specific area of the Fe2O3 nanorods with the shortest
   axial length facilitated the efficient access of electrolyte ions to the
   electrode surface, and thus would aid in delivering the high
   pseudocapacitance. These results provide a promising route to obtain the
   desired hematite-based energy storage materials.}},

Abstract = {{An extension to the sparsity promoting iterated constrained endmember
   (SPICE) algorithm, named as SPICEE, has been presented. In ICE and
   SPICE, endmembers are estimated using a pseudoinverse method, which may
   generate endmembers that are not physically possible when representing
   normalized reflectance spectra. Although this problem can be alleviated
   by increasing the regularization, too much regularization leads to
   finding erroneous endmembers. To solve these problems, in this letter, a
   quadratic optimization solution is proposed that constrains the
   endmembers to have values between zero and one. The results on three
   data sets indicate that when regularization is large enough, SPICE and
   SPICEE generate similar answers; and when regularization is small to
   none, SPICEE stays more robust. In doing so, besides generating
   realistic endmembers, SPICEE helps in decreasing the effort necessary
   for fine-tuning the regularization parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive prior studies aimed at the development of diagnostic methods
   for planetary gearboxes have mainly examined acceleration and acoustic
   emission signals. Recently, due to the relationship between gear mesh
   stiffness and transmission error (TE), TE-based techniques have emerged
   as a promising way to analyze dynamic behavior of spur and helical
   gears. However, to date, TE has not been used as a measure to detect
   faults in planetary gears. In this paper, we propose a new methodology
   for model-based fault diagnostics of planetary gears using TE signals. A
   lumped parametric model of planetary gear dynamics was built to extract
   simulated TE signals, while accounting for the planet phasing effect,
   which is a peculiar characteristic of the planetary gear. Next, gear
   dynamic analysis was performed using TE signals, and TE-based damage
   features were calculated from the processed TE signals to quantitatively
   represent health conditions. The procedures described aforesaid were
   then applied to a case study of a planetary gear in a wind turbine gear
   train. From the results, we conclude that TE signals can be used to
   detect the faults, while enhancing understanding of the complex dynamic
   behaviors of planetary gears.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile hotspots have made the dream of ubiquitous Internet access come
   true, while the widespread applications are still hindered by the
   limited power of smart phones. To address this issue, we propose a novel
   distributed cooperative data transmission scheme for energy-rechargeable
   mobile devices. In particular, we not only let a mobile phone help the
   nearby client devices connect to the Internet via its cellular
   accessing, but also let those clients replenish the mobile hotspot
   energy via wireless power transfer. We mathematically formulate the
   mutually beneficial relationship between mobile hotspots and clients
   into an optimization problem, with the objective of conducting the
   cooperative wireless data and energy transmission to maximize the system
   utility. Resorting to methods from combinatorics and matching theory, we
   develop a near optimal solution for many-to-one matching when there is a
   single mobile hotspot and a distributed matching strategy for the
   general case by considering the nature of data communication and the
   characteristic of wireless power transfer. By extensive simulation, we
   show that the proposed distributed solution achieves a performance close
   to the centralized method, and it outperforms the greedy matching
   strategy and the classic Gale-Shapley matching strategy in different
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a model validation framework is proposed and applied to a
   large vibro-acoustic finite element (FE) model of a passenger car. The
   framework introduces a p-box approach with an efficient quantification
   scheme of uncertainty sources and a new area metric which is relevant to
   the responses in the frequency domain. To prioritize the input
   uncertainties out of the enormous FE model, the experts' knowledge is
   utilized to select candidate input parameters which have large potential
   influences on the response of interests (ROI) among several thousands of
   input parameters. Next, a variance-based sensitivity analysis with an
   orthogonal array is introduced in effort to quantify the influence of
   the selected input parameters on the ROIs. The employment of the
   eigenvector dimension reduction method and orthogonal combinations of
   interval-valued input parameters provides the p-box of the ROI even if
   the size of the FE model is very large. A color map and the u-pooling of
   the p-boxes over the frequency band as well as the p-box at different
   frequencies are introduced to assess the model error and quantitative
   contributions of the aleatory and the epistemic input uncertainties to
   the overall variability of the ROIs in the frequency domain. After
   assessing the model error, the FE model is updated. It was found that
   the sensitivity results and the experts' knowledge about the associated
   components effectively determine the modifications of the component
   models and the input parameter values during the updating process.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical procedure for calibration and validation is addressed as
   an industrial application for the analysis problem of piston insertion
   into the housing in the pyrotechnically actuated device. Three
   parameters are identified in the model that affect the solution greatly
   but they are not known a priori. Bayesian approach is employed to
   calibrate these parameters in the form of distributions, which account
   for the uncertainty of the model and test data. In order to validate the
   model, similar new problems are introduced, analyzed and tested for
   validation purpose. As a result, the predictions in the new problems are
   found to work equally well as in the calibration problem, which suggests
   that it is useful in the subsequent new design without additional test
   procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Essential tremor (ET) is a common cause of significant disability, but
   its etiologies and pathogenesis are poorly understood. Research has been
   hampered by the variable definition of ET and by non standardized
   research approaches. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders
   and Stroke (USA) invited experts in ET and related fields to discuss
   current knowledge, controversies, and gaps in our understanding of ET
   and to develop recommendations for future research. Discussion focused
   on phenomenology and phenotypes, therapies and clinical trials,
   pathophysiology, pathology, and genetics. Across all areas, the need for
   collaborative and coordinated research on a multinational level was
   expressed. Standardized data collection using common data elements for
   genetic, clinical, neurophysiological, and pathological studies was
   recommended. Large cohorts of patients should be studied prospectively
   to collect bio-samples, characterize the natural history of the clinical
   syndrome including patient-oriented outcomes, investigate potential
   etiologies of various phenotypes, and identify pathophysiological
   mechanisms. In particular, cellular and system-level mechanisms of
   tremor oscillations should be elucidated because they may yield
   effective therapeutic targets and biomarkers. A neuropathology
   consortium was recommended to standardize postmortem analysis and
   further characterize neuropathological observations in the cerebellum
   and elsewhere. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies on large
   patient cohorts (>10,000 patients) may allow the identification of
   common genes contributing to risk, and whole exome or genome sequencing
   may enable the identification of genetic risk and causal mutations in
   cohorts and well-characterized families. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hybrid multicore processors (HMPs) are poised to dominate the landscape
   of the next generation of computing on the desktop as well as on
   exascale systems. HMPs consist of general purpose GPU cores along with
   specialized cores and are expected to provide benefits to a wide
   spectrum of applications at significantly lower energy requirements per
   FLOP (FLoating-point Operations per Second).
   In this paper, we describe a comprehensive strategy for efficiently
   implementing a key kernel of spectral solvers on GPUs and HMPs
   consisting of CPU and GPUs. Our implementations represent significant
   computational improvements of the kernel on GPU. We also provide load
   balancing strategies for a combination of CPU and GPU cores. We show
   that depending upon whether performance or energy optimization is
   critical, separate load balancing strategies should be used on HMPs. We
   provide performance, power and energy evaluation as well as modeling and
   validation for a variety of CPU-GPU core combinations. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The stability of polymer thin films is crucial to a broad range of
   technologies, including sensors, energy storage, filtration, and
   lithography. Recently, the demonstration of rapid deposition on solid
   substrates of ordered monolayers of polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGN)
   has increased potential for inks to additively manufacture such
   components. Herein, enhanced stability against dewetting of these
   self-assembled PGN films (gold nanoparticle functionalized with
   polystyrene (AuNP-PS)) is discussed in context to linear polystyrene
   (PS) analogues using high throughput surface gradients: surface energy
   (20-45 mN/m) and temperature (90-160 degrees C). PGNs exhibit a lower
   surface (gamma(p)) and interfacial (gamma(sp)) energy relative to linear
   polymers, which results in increased thermal and energetic stability by
   10-25 degrees C and 5-15 mN/m, respectively. This enhanced wetting
   dewetting transition is qualitatively consistent with the behavior of
   star macromolecules and depends on the architecture of the polymer
   canopy. Increased film stability through canopy architecture expands the
   manufacturability of thin film hybrids and refines postprocessing
   conditions to maximize local PGN order.}},

Title = {{Removal of phyto-accessible copper from contaminated soils using zero
   valent iron amendment and magnetic separation methods: Assessment of
   residual toxicity using plant and MetPLATE (TM) studies}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{219}},

Abstract = {{Zero valent iron (ZVI) has been widely tested and used in remediation of
   both contaminated soils and groundwater, and in general, the in situ
   amendment of the contaminated media is used as remediation approach.
   However, concerns remain as to the potential detrimental effects of both
   the immobilized ZVI and the adsorbed pollutants as the treated system
   could undergo transformations over time. Accordingly, plans for soil
   remediation by in situ immobilization of sorbents should include a
   long-term monitoring of the treated systems. Here, we report on a
   comparative study in which artificially Cu-contaminated sandy and
   organic soils characterized by different metal binding capacities were
   treated by either (i) in situ immobilization of ZVI in the soils, or
   (ii) by a ZVI amendment followed by magnetic retrieval of formed ZVI-Cu
   complexes prior to plant growth studies. The latter relies on the
   combination of the high metal adsorption capacity and magnetism of ZVI.
   Two plant species, Lactuca sativa (lettuce) and Brassica juncea (Indian
   mustard) were used to assess the efficiency of the two treatment methods
   in eliminating the bioavailable fraction of Cu. Overall, the results
   showed that, if soil remediation by in situ immobilization reduces the
   bio-accessible fraction of Cu, treatment using ZVI amendment followed by
   magnetic separation performs better. The latter resulted in less Cu
   accumulated in the shoots and roots of plants. In parallel to the plant
   growth study, we used MetPLATE (TM), a short-term bioassay based on the
   inhibition of the beta-galactosidase enzyme by the bioavailable fraction
   of heavy metal cations, to predict the efficiency of the two treatment
   methods with regard to the elimination of Cu phyto-toxicity. The results
   of the bioassay confirmed the trends of phyto-toxicity results,
   suggesting that MetPLATE (TM) could be an adequate alternative to the
   more expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming plant growth
   studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can be used to activate the
   dysfunctional lower limb muscles of individuals with neurological
   disorders to produce cycling as a means of rehabilitation. However,
   previous literature suggests that poor muscle control and
   nonphysiological muscle fiber recruitment during FES-cycling causes
   lower efficiency and power output at the cycle crank than able-bodied
   cycling, thus motivating the investigation of improved control methods
   for FES-cycling. In this paper, a stimulation pattern is designed based
   on the kinematic effectiveness of the rider's hip and knee joints to
   produce a forward torque about the cycle crank. A robust controller is
   designed for the uncertain, nonlinear cycle-rider system with
   autonomous, state-dependent switching. Provided sufficient conditions
   are satisfied, the switched controller yields ultimately bounded
   tracking of a desired cadence. Experimental results on four able-bodied
   subjects demonstrate cadence tracking errors of 0.05 +/- 1.59 and 5.27
   +/- 2.14 revolutions per minute during volitional and FES-induced
   cycling, respectively. To establish feasibility of FES-assisted cycling
   in subjects with Parkinson's disease, experimental results with one
   subject demonstrate tracking errors of 0.43 +/- 4.06 and 0.17 +/- 3.11
   revolutions per minute during volitional and FES-induced cycling,
   respectively.}},

Title = {{Effects of needle inner surface topography on friction and biopsy length}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{412-418}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The effects of inner surface topography on friction force and the
   coefficient of friction between an inner surface of needle and tissue
   phantom during needle insertion and on biopsy length are examined using
   polished, and unpolished needles. In this paper, the inner surfaces of
   the needles are altered by magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF), and the
   needle inner surfaces were smoothed from 0.43 to 0.02 mu m Sa (referred
   to as the smoothly polished needle) or 0.26 mu m Sa (referred to as the
   roughly polished needle). With polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a
   tissue-mimicking phantom material, the smoothly polished needle results
   in the smallest inner friction force (0.0024 N/mm), the smallest
   coefficient of friction (0.35), and the longest biopsy length (34.3 mm).
   The roughly polished needle produces the largest inner friction force
   (0.0041 N/mm), the largest coefficient of friction (0.56), and the
   shortest biopsy length (30.5 mm). Although the inner surface roughness
   of the roughly polished needle is lower than that of the unpolished
   needle, the inner friction force and coefficient of friction are larger
   than those of the unpolished needle. This may be caused by the ridges
   and grooves in the circumferential direction of the roughly polished
   needle made with MAF. Based on the surface topography data, the ratchet
   mechanism is utilized to calculate the coefficient of friction. The
   results suggest a higher coefficient of friction in the roughly polished
   needle. The biopsy tests also show the shortest biopsy sample is
   extracted using the roughly polished needles, which exhibit the greatest
   inner friction force.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Marine species with planktonic larvae often have high spatial and
   temporal variation in recruitment that leads to subsequent variation in
   the ecology of benthic adults. Using a combination of published and
   unpublished data, we compared the population structure of the salt marsh
   snail, Littoraria irrorata, between the South Atlantic Bight and the
   Gulf Coast of the United States to infer geographic differences in
   recruitment and to test the hypothesis that the Deepwater Horizon oil
   spill led to widespread recruitment failure of L. irrorata in Louisiana
   in 2010. Size-frequency distributions in both ecoregions were bimodal,
   with troughs in the distributions consistent with a transition from
   sub-adults to adults at similar to 13 mm in shell length as reported in
   the literature; however, adult snails reached larger sizes in the Gulf
   Coast. The ratio of sub-adults to adults was 1.5-2 times greater in the
   South Atlantic Bight than the Gulf Coast, consistent with higher
   recruitment rates in the South Atlantic Bight. Higher recruitment rates
   in the South Atlantic Bight could contribute to higher snail densities
   and reduced adult growth in this region. The ratio of sub-adults to
   adults in Louisiana was lower in 2011 than in previous years, and began
   to recover in 2012-2014, consistent with widespread recruitment failure
   in 2010, when large expanses of spilled oil were present in coastal
   waters. Our results reveal an important difference in the ecology of a
   key salt marsh invertebrate between the two ecoregions, and also suggest
   that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill may have caused widespread
   recruitment failure in this species and perhaps others with similar
   planktonic larval stages.}},

Abstract = {{Severe economic damage from citrus greening disease, caused by
   `Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' bacteria, has stimulated development
   of methods to reduce mating and reproduction in populations of its
   insect vector, Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae). Male D. citri
   find mating partners by walking on host plants, intermittently producing
   vibrational calls that stimulate duetting replies by receptive females.
   The replies provide orientational feedback, assisting the search
   process. To test a hypothesis that D. citri mating can be disrupted
   using vibrational signals that compete with and/or mask female replies,
   courtship bioassays were conducted in citrus trees with or without
   interference from female reply mimics produced by a vibrating buzzer.
   Statistically significant reductions occurred in the rates and
   proportions of mating when the buzzer produced reply mimics within 0.4 s
   after male courtship calls compared with undisturbed controls.
   Observations of courtship behaviors in the two bioassays revealed
   activity patterns that likely contributed to the reductions. In both
   disruption and control tests, males reciprocated frequently between
   structural bifurcations and other transition points where signal
   amplitudes changed. Males in the disruption bioassay had to select among
   vibrational signals combined from the buzzer and the female at each
   transition point. They often turned towards the buzzer instead of the
   female. There was a statistically significant reduction in the
   proportion of males mating if they contacted the buzzer, possibly due to
   its higher vibration amplitude and duration in comparison with female
   replies. Potential applications of D. citri mating disruption technology
   in citrus groves are discussed.}},

Title = {{Thermoacoustic imaging of rabbit knee joints}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Knee joint is one of the largest and most complex joints of the
   body. Knee joint diseases are common, and current clinical imaging
   technologies such as x-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance
   imaging, and ultrasound imaging have limitations in the diagnosis of
   knee joint diseases. Emerging imaging technologies such as diffuse
   optical tomography and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) have been applied to
   the detection of osteoarthritis (OA). However, they are limited to small
   joints such as the finger and difficult to be used for large joints such
   as the knee. Thermoacoustic imaging (TAI), also an emerging modality,
   provides high contrast and deep tissue penetration. Here, the authors
   apply TAI to the knee joint and demonstrate the potential of TAI for
   imaging large joints.
   Methods: Adult New Zealand male rabbits (average weight = 2 kg) were
   chosen for this study. In a TAI experiment, a rabbit was placed in a
   holder to keep in a genuflex position after being injected with
   pentobarbital through its ear margin intravenous (30 mg/kg). The holder
   and the rabbit were then positioned under the horn antenna of the TAI
   system for signal acquisition and image reconstruction. After the
   experiment, the imaged knee joint was dissected and photographed.
   Identical procedures were performed for several rabbits (n = 4).
   Finally, detailed comparative analyses between TAI images and anatomical
   pictures of the knee joint were conducted.
   Results: There were high similarities between the reconstructed TAI
   images and anatomical pictures of the knee joint, in terms of the shape
   and size of various knee joint tissues. TAI could clearly image
   ligament, fat pad, and other joint tissues. The differences in
   appearance of TAI images due to motion effect of the knee joint were
   also discussed.
   Conclusions: TAI could reveal details of rabbit knee joint in high
   resolution. As the recovered TAI images represent the dielectric
   property distributions of joint tissues, TAI may offer a new tool for
   noninvasive detection of joint diseases such as OA. (C) 2016 American

Title = {{The mammalian LINC complex regulates genome transcriptional responses to
   substrate rigidity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical integration of the nucleus with the extracellular matrix
   (ECM) is established by linkage between the cytoskeleton and the
   nucleus. This integration is hypothesized to mediate sensing of ECM
   rigidity, but parsing the function of nucleus-cytoskeleton linkage from
   other mechanisms has remained a central challenge. Here we took
   advantage of the fact that the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and
   cytoskeleton) complex is a known molecular linker of the nucleus to the
   cytoskeleton, and asked how it regulates the sensitivity of genome-wide
   transcription to substratum rigidity. We show that gene
   mechanosensitivity is preserved after LINC disruption, but reversed in
   direction. Combined with myosin inhibition studies, we identify genes
   that depend on nuclear tension for their regulation. We also show that
   LINC disruption does not attenuate nuclear shape sensitivity to
   substrate rigidity. Our results show for the first time that the LINC
   complex facilitates mechano-regulation of expression across the genome.}},

Abstract = {{Low-dose antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus pegylated granulocyte
   colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) preserves beta-cell function for at
   least 12 months in type 1 diabetes. Herein, we describe metabolic and
   immunological parameters 24 months following treatment. Patients with
   established type 1 diabetes (duration 4-24 months) were randomized to
   ATG and pegylated G-CSF (ATG+G-CSF) (N = 17) or placebo (N = 8). Primary
   outcomes included C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) following a mixed
   meal tolerance test (MMTT) and flow cytometry. ``Responders{''}
   (12-month C-peptide >= baseline), ``super responders{''} (24-month
   C-peptide >= baseline), and ``non responders{''} (12-month C-peptide <
   baseline) were evaluated for biomarkers of outcome. At 24 months,
   MMTT-stimulated AUC C-peptide was not significantly different in
   ATG(+)G-CSF (0.49 nmol/L/min) versus placebo (0.29 nmol/L/min). Subjects
   treated with ATG(+)G-CSF demonstrated reduced CD4(+) T cells and
   CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratio and increased CD16(+)CD56(hi) natural killer
   cells (NK), CD4(+) effector memory T cells (Tem), CD4(+)PD-1(+) central
   memory T cells (Tcm), Tcm PD-1 expression, and neutrophils.
   FOXP3(+)Helios(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) were elevated in ATG+G-CSF
   subjects at 6, 12, and 18 but not 24 months. Immunophenotyping
   identified differential HLA-DR expression on monocytes and NK and
   altered CXCR3 and PD-1 expression on T-cell subsets. As such, a group of
   metabolic and immunological responders was identified. A phase II study
   of ATG+G-CSF in patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes is ongoing and
   may support ATG+G-CSF as a prevention strategy in high-risk subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Swarms, flocks, and other group formations can be found in nature in
   many organisms ranging from simple bacteria to mammals. Such collective
   and coordinated behavior is effective for avoiding predators and/or for
   increasing the chances of finding food (foraging). In this technical
   note we develop a mathematical model for analyzing the benefits of
   social foraging in a noisy environment. We identify conditions on the
   nutrient profile ensuring that local agent actions will lead to cohesive
   foraging. For convex, smooth nutrient profiles, we formalize the way in
   which swarming for social foraging is better at handling the effects of
   noise when compared to the average of individual foraging strategies.
   Under a swarming discipline, observational noise realizations that
   induce trajectories differing too much from the group average are likely
   to be discarded because of each individual's need to maintain cohesion.
   As a result, the group trajectories are less affected by noise.
   Simulation experiments indicate our theoretical results are robust to
   inter-agent communication constraints and non-convex nutrient profiles.
   These results suggest that swarming-like approaches for the control of
   networked agents may provide an additional level of robustness.}},

Journal = {{NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1130+}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The potential impact of global temperature change on global crop yield
   has recently been assessed with different methods. Here we show that
   grid-based and point-based simulations and statistical regressions (from
   historic records), without deliberate adaptation or CO2 fertilization
   effects, produce similar estimates of temperature impact on wheat yields
   at global and national scales. With a 1 degrees C global temperature
   increase, global wheat yield is projected to decline between 4.1\% and
   6.4\%. Projected relative temperature impacts from different methods
   were similar for major wheat-producing countries China, India, USA and
   France, but less so for Russia. Point-based and grid-based simulations,
   and to some extent the statistical regressions, were consistent in
   projecting that warmer regions are likely to suffer more yield loss with
   increasing temperature than cooler regions. By forming a multi-method
   ensemble, it was possible to quantify `method uncertainty' in addition
   to model uncertainty. This significantly improves confidence in
   estimates of climate impacts on global food security.}},

Abstract = {{Drilled shaft foundations supporting mast arm assemblies are subjected
   to significant torsion and lateral load during severe wind loading
   (e.g., hurricane). Past centrifuge studies in granular soils suggest
   that the design of such foundations should be performed for a coupled
   load case, since the lateral resistance is considerably reduced by the
   concurrent application of torsion. However, current design practice
   still considers lateral load and torsion independently due to the lack
   of field verification of centrifuge results. This paper reports on a
   full-scale test program to investigate the coupled load behavior of
   drilled shafts. A novel load test setup (with a heavy-duty mast arm
   assembly) and instrumentation were used for the combined torsion and
   lateral loading (e.g., wind loading). The study revealed a significant
   reduction in lateral resistance due to the influence of torque as
   observed from previous centrifuge studies. Torsional resistance was
   reduced (approximately 20\%) by the impact of lateral load when compared
   with the anticipated torsional resistance based on unit skin friction
   values, derived from the axial load test results (i.e., no influence of
   lateral load). A comparison of measured torsional resistance during the
   combined loading with the predicted values using different approaches
   was also made. O'Neill and Hassan's beta (beta) method (sand) and alpha
   method (clay) are found to predict the torsional resistance reasonably
   well (+/- 10\%), while all other methods based on the standard
   penetration test and cone penetration test considered in the study
   overpredicted or underpredicted the resistance.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{In this work, three-dimensional metal-matrix composites (MMCs)
   reinforced by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires are modeled and simulated,
   by adopting an SMA constitutive model accounting for elastic
   deformation, phase transformation and plastic behavior. A modeling
   method to create composites with pre-strained SMA wires is also proposed
   to improve the self-healing ability. Experimental validation is provided
   with a composite under three-point bending. This modeling method is
   applied in a series of finite element simulations to investigate the
   self-healing effects in pre-cracked composites, especially the role of
   the SMA reinforcement, the softening property of the matrix, and the
   effect of pre-strain in the SMA. The results demonstrate that SMA
   reinforcements provide stronger shape recovery ability than other,
   non-transforming materials. The softening property of the metallic
   matrix and the pre-strain in SMA are also beneficial to help crack
   closure and healing. This modeling approach can serve as an efficient
   tool to design SMA-reinforced MMCs with optimal self-healing properties
   that have potential applications in components needing a high level of
   reliability. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Spacecraft relative guidance via spatio-temporal resolution in
   atmospheric density forecasting}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{32-43}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Spacecraft equipped with the capability to vary their ballistic
   coefficient can use differential drag as the control force to perform
   propellant-less relative maneuvers. Because atmospheric drag is
   proportional to atmospheric density, uncertainty in atmospheric density
   makes the generation and tracking of drag based guidances difficult.
   Spatio-temporal resolution, or the mapping of density information to
   altitude and time, is shown in this work to improve atmospheric density
   estimation from forecasted density for spacecraft in LEO. This is
   achieved by propagating simulated orbits for two spacecraft using
   forecasted density. Additionally, a receding-horizon control algorithm
   is introduced, with the goal of improving the tracking of guidances.
   Using a simulated perfect forecast of the atmospheric density for
   propagation of the orbits, relative guidance trajectories are generated
   and tracked, establishing the benefit of adding spatio-temporal
   resolution. Next, imperfect density forecasting is added, indicating
   that the benefit of spatio-temporal resolution is retained in the
   presence of imperfect forecasting. Finally, a receding-horizon control
   algorithm is used with imperfect forecasting, demonstrating that
   receding-horizon control improves the tracking of guidances compared to
   single-horizon control. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Metallic fuel additives have been considered for soot emission control
   over the last few decades. However, the exact mechanisms of soot
   reduction are poorly understood and still remain controversial. In
   response to the need for identifying the state of the iron additive in
   the diffusion flame, laser-induced fluorescence and absorption
   spectroscopy were performed in a laboratory-scale isooctane diffusion
   laminar flame seeded with 4000 ppm iron pentacarbonyl as the metallic
   additive. The results of the spectroscopic techniques reveal that the
   dominant iron species throughout the primary flame region was Fe atoms,
   rather than any form of iron oxide. Moreover, elemental iron was
   observed to diminish through the soot oxidation region. The primary
   conclusion is that the catalytic effect of Fe atoms and possibly iron
   oxides enhanced soot oxidation in the burnout regime of the flame,
   thereby reducing the overall soot emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The normal compositional model (NCM) has been extensively used in
   hyperspectral unmixing. However, previous research has mostly focused on
   the estimation of endmembers and/or their variability, based on the
   assumption that the pixels are independent random variables. In this
   paper, we show that this assumption does not hold if all the pixels are
   generated by a fixed endmember set. This introduces another concept,
   endmember uncertainty, which is related to whether the pixels fit into
   the endmember simplex. To further develop this idea, we derive the NCM
   from the ground up without the pixel independence assumption, along
   with: 1) using different noise levels at different wavelengths and 2)
   using a spatial and sparsity promoting prior for the abundances. The
   resulting new formulation is called the spatial compositional model
   (SCM) to better differentiate it from the NCM. The SCM maximum a
   posteriori objective leads to an optimization problem featuring
   Noiseweighted least-squares minimization for unmixing. The problem is
   solved by projected gradient descent, resulting in an algorithm that
   estimates endmembers, abundances, noise variances, and endmember
   uncertainty simultaneously. We compared SCM with current
   state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic and real images. The results
   show that SCM can, in the main, provide more accurate endmembers and
   abundances. Moreover, the estimated uncertainty can serve as a
   prediction of endmember error under certain conditions.}},

Title = {{Structural Vulnerability Assessment of Community-Based Routing in
   Opportunistic Networks}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic networks enable mobile devices to communicate with each
   other through routes that are built dynamically, while messages are en
   route between the sender and the destination(s). The social structure
   and interaction of users of such devices dictate the performance of
   routing protocols in those networks. Community structures, commonly
   exhibited by social networks, is also observed in the encounter patterns
   in opportunistic networks and has an astounding impact in designing
   forwarding algorithms for such types of networks. In this paper, we
   explore the structural vulnerability of social-based forwarding and
   routing methods in opportunistic networks. In particular, we introduce
   Community Vulnerability Assessment (CVA), a new problem on assessing the
   performance reliability of opportunistic routing strategies in Delay
   Tolerant Networks (DTN) from a community structure point of view. Given
   a positive number k, CVA aims to find out the k most vulnerable devices
   in the network whose non-participation (due to out-of-service or
   permanent out-of-range) transforms the current network community
   structure to a totally different one. As the first study in this
   direction, we analyze and provide key insights into the separation of
   network communities, evaluated via the Normalized Mutual Information
   (NMI). Based on these findings, we suggest an approximation algorithm
   for the special case when k = 1, and a heuristic, genEdge, for the
   general case. To certify the effectiveness of our proposed approaches,
   we first test them on synthesized data with known community structures,
   and then we show the impact of node removal on community structures in
   real social networks. Finally we evaluate the performance via different
   forwarding and routing strategies in multiple real-world DTN traces. Our
   results indicate that, in many forwarding and routing methods, the
   nonparticipation of only some important devices is significant enough to
   degrade the entire network's performance.}},

Abstract = {{Unlicensed spectra fusion technology for LTE holds the promise of
   alleviating the licensed spectra scarcity and enhancing capacity. It
   allows LTE to effectively utilize the unlicensed spectra distributed
   over high frequency bands with significant different propagation
   characteristics from its licensed spectra. However, the interference
   caused by other systems over unlicensed spectra, particularly the public
   unlicensed spectra, is viewed as the most serious challenge. In this
   paper, aiming to guarantee the feasibility in existing LTE systems, we
   design a novel unlicensed spectra fusion scheme based on the popular
   standard TDD-LTE. To mitigate the interference, we develop an
   interference coordination scheme which is carried out in two stages:
   screen the available unlicensed channels for every UE, and allocate
   unlicensed spectra based on Hungarian algorithm. We have conducted
   extensive simulation study and demonstrate that our proposed scheme can
   handle interference coordination effectively and enhance throughput
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Tracheal intubation disrupts physiological homeostasis of secretion
   production and clearance, resulting in secretion accumulation within
   endotracheal tubes (ETTs). Novel in vitro and in vivo models were
   developed to specifically recapitulate the clinical manifestations of
   ETT occlusion. The novel Sharklet (TM) micropatterned ETT was evaluated,
   using these models, for the ability to reduce the accumulation of both
   bacterial biofilm and airway mucus compared to a standard care ETT.
   Novel ETTs with micropattern on the inner and outer surfaces were placed
   adjacent to standard care ETTs in in vitro biofilm and airway patency
   (AP) models. The primary outcome for the biofilm model was to compare
   commercially-available ETTs (standard care and silver-coated) to
   micropatterned for quantity of biofilm accumulation. The AP model's
   primary outcome was to evaluate accumulation of artificial airway mucus.
   A 24-h ovine mechanical ventilation model evaluated the primary outcome
   of relative quantity of airway secretion accumulation in the ETTs
   tested. The secondary outcome was measuring the effect of secretion
   accumulation in the ETTs on airway resistance. Micropatterned ETTs
   significantly reduced biofilm by 71\% (p = 0.016) compared to smooth
   ETTs. Moreover, micropatterned ETTs reduced lumen occlusion, in the AP
   model, as measured by cross-sectional area, in distal (85\%, p = 0.005),
   middle (84\%, p = 0.001) and proximal (81\%, p = 0.002) sections
   compared to standard care ETTs. Micropatterned ETTs reduced the volume
   of secretion accumulation in a sheep model of occlusion by 61\% (p <
   0.001) after 24 h of mechanical ventilation. Importantly, micropatterned
   ETTs reduced the rise in ventilation peak inspiratory pressures over
   time by as much as 49\% (p = 0.005) compared to standard care ETTs.
   Micropatterned ETTs, demonstrated here to reduce bacterial contamination
   and mucus occlusion, will have the capacity to limit complications
   occurring during mechanical ventilation and ultimately improve patient
   care.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft crew members are occupationally exposed to considerable levels
   of cosmic radiation at flight altitudes. Since aircrew (pilots and
   passengers) are in the sitting posture for most of the time during
   flight, and up to now there has been no data on the effective dose rate
   calculated for aircrew dosimetry in flight altitude using a sitting
   phantom, we therefore calculated the effective dose rate using a phantom
   in the sitting and standing postures in order to compare the influence
   of the posture on the radiation protection of aircrew members. We found
   that although the better description of the posture in which the
   aircrews are exposed, the results of the effective dose rate calculated
   with the phantom in the sitting posture were very similar to the results
   of the phantom in the standing posture. In fact we observed only a 1\%
   difference. These findings indicate the adequacy of the use of dose
   conversion coefficients for the phantom in the standing posture in
   aircrew dosimetry. We also validated our results comparing the effective
   dose rate obtained using the standing phantom with values reported in
   the literature. It was observed that the results presented in this study
   are in good agreement with other authors (the differences are below
   30\%) who have measured and calculated effective dose rates using
   different phantoms.}},

Abstract = {{Cotton and peanut grown under irrigation make up over 769,000 ha in the
   Southeast USA. The consumptive use of water for irrigation has
   significantly impacted groundwater resources, spring flows and
   streamflows in many parts of this region, particularly during severe
   droughts. This situation is further complicated with extreme weather
   events and climate variability. In this study, we compare yields and
   water use in a non-irrigated sod-based rotation system (SBR;
   bahiagrass-bahiagrass-peanut-cotton) to an irrigated conventional
   rotation system (ICR; peanut-cotton-cotton). Root mass of oat cover crop
   following peanut or cotton in a SBR and ICR system was also measured. A
   soil water assessment model (SWAT) was used to simulate irrigation water
   demands over a 34 yr period (1980-2013) under different soil types to
   quantify water saving potential of SBR. The average peanut yield in ICR
   from 2002 to 2013 was 4509 kg ha(-1), while that in SBR was 4874 kg
   ha(-1). Likewise the average cotton yield in ICR during the same period
   was 1237 kg ha(-1), while that in SBR was 1339 kg ha(-1). Oats had
   greater root mass in SBR than ICR. Simulation results indicate that
   crops in SBR consistently had substantially lower irrigation
   requirements (between 11 and 22 cm yr(-1)) than those in ICR in dry
   years. The water-saving potential of SBR varies positively with
   increasing sand content in soil.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a drastic rise in the construction of web
   knowledge bases (e.g., Freebase, YAGO, DBPedia). These knowledge bases
   store structured information about real-world people, places,
   organizations, etc. However, due to the limitations of human knowledge,
   web corpora, and information extraction algorithms, the knowledge bases
   are still far from complete. To infer the missing knowledge, we propose
   the Ontological Pathfinding (OP) algorithm to mine first-order inference
   rules from these web knowledge bases. The OP algorithm scales up via a
   series of optimization techniques, including a new parallel-rule-mining
   algorithm, a pruning strategy to eliminate unsound and inefficient rules
   before applying them, and a novel partitioning algorithm to break the
   learning task into smaller independent sub-tasks. Combining these
   techniques, we develop a first rule mining system that scales to
   Freebase, the largest public knowledge base with 112 million entities
   and 388 million facts. We mine 36,625 inference rules in 34 h; no
   existing system achieves this scale.
   Based on the mining algorithm and the optimizations, we develop an
   efficient inference engine. As a result, we infer 0.9 billion new facts
   from Freebase in 17.19 h. We use cross validation to evaluate the
   inferred facts and estimate a degree of expansion by 0.6 over Freebase,
   with a precision approaching 1.0. Our approach outperforms
   state-of-the-art mining algorithms and inference engines in terms of
   both performance and quality.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{106-114}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple flows can be used to measure viscosities. If the viscosity is
   high enough and depends on temperature, frictional heating presents a
   technical difficulty. Yet in many visco-metric flows formulas predicting
   the temperature and the velocity distribution are available. The
   resulting flow may or may not be stable to small perturbations. If it is
   unstable it will not be seen in an experiment. Our aim is to show that
   stability depends on how the experiment is controlled, whether by
   holding a kinematic or a dynamic variable fixed, eg., wall speed or wall
   stress. In a plane Couette flow, controlled by the wall speed, stability
   to long wave length perturbations is established for all points of the
   base curve. In both a rotational Couette flow and a Poiseulle flow
   stability obtains at least part way along the upper branch. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A fast normalized cross correlation (FNCC) based machine vision
   algorithm was proposed in this study to develop a method for detecting
   and counting immature green citrus fruit using outdoor colour images
   toward the development of an early yield mapping system. As a template
   matching method, FNCC was used to detect potential fruit areas in the
   image, which was the very basis for subsequent false positive removal.
   Multiple features, including colour, shape and texture features, were
   combined in this algorithm to remove false positives. Circular Hough
   transform (CHT) was used to detect circles from images after background
   removal based on colour components. After building disks centred in
   centroids resulted from both FNCC and CHT, the detection results were
   merged based on the size and Euclidian distance of the intersection
   areas of the disks from these two methods. Finally, the number of fruit
   was determined after false positive removal using texture features. For
   a validation dataset of 59 images, 84.4 \% of the fruits were
   successfully detected, which indicated the potential of the proposed
   method toward the development of an early yield mapping system.}},

Abstract = {{The use of alternatives, especially recycled materials, as substitute to
   naturally mined aggregates in concrete is an issue that is garnering
   more consideration with respect to the construction industry. This
   research contribution presents work in which bottom ash from a waste to
   energy facility was used as a partial aggregate replacement in Portland
   cement concrete (PCC). Compressive strength testing of specimens
   demonstrated a decrease in strength with increasing ash replacement
   percentages. This effect was significantly larger for the samples
   containing < 9.5 mm ash fraction, this was attributed to the reactivity
   of the aluminum in the ash. The effect of aging the ash on concrete
   properties was assessed through an accelerated carbonation experiment.
   Carbonation was found to have little effect on the strength and
   durability properties of ash-amended PCC. Ash-amended concrete
   containing the larger ash size fraction was able to meet set design
   strengths at low replacement percentages (25 \%).}},

Abstract = {{We consider an amplify-and-forward relay network composed of a source,
   two relays, and a destination. In this network, the two relays are
   untrusted in the sense that they may perform Byzantine attacks by
   forwarding altered symbols to the destination. Note that every symbol
   received by the destination may be altered, and hence, no clean
   reference observation is available to the destination. For this network,
   we identify a large family of Byzantine attacks that can be detected in
   the physical layer. We further investigate how the channel conditions
   impact the detection against this family of attacks. In particular, we
   prove that all Byzantine attacks in this family can be detected with
   asymptotically small miss detection and false alarm probabilities by
   using a sufficiently large number of channel observations if and only if
   the network satisfies a non-manipulability condition. No pre-shared
   secret or secret transmission is needed for the detection of these
   attacks, demonstrating the value of this physical-layer security
   technique for counteracting Byzantine attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Modern bearing steels are critically important ultra-high strength
   structural materials used in a multitude of industrial systems, and
   subject to the highest loading conditions for billions of cycles. They
   are unique among structural materials because of the localized nature of
   rolling contact fatigue (RCF) loading, leading to extreme sensitivity of
   fatigue life to microstructural attributes. The complex phenomena
   displayed by RCF from nanometer to millimeter length scales make
   reliable bearing life prediction in the gigacycle regime difficult. A
   comprehensive review is provided for cyclic fatigue loading experienced
   by the subsurface volume of RCF-affected material. Microstructural
   evolution in the subsurface region is presented. Traditional empirical
   probabilistic approaches to subsurface-initiated bearing life
   prediction, and their limitations are discussed. Reasons why modern
   ultra-clean bearing steels can exhibit life in the gigacycle regime are
   outlined, including the important effects of compressive mean stress.
   Quantifying material property changes in the subsurface and computation
   of evolving stress fields are discussed. Refinements to
   material-specific bearing life prediction in the gigacycle regime using
   microstructure sensitive elasto-plastic stress fields are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{This is the second of a two-part series of papers which presents the

   tests of a stainless steel tube. Whereas the first paper in this series
   focused on the effect of mass flux, inlet subcooling, equilibrium
   quality, pressure, and axial distance from the inlet on two-phase
   convection heat flux for vertical upward flow only, this paper focuses
   on the effect of flow direction with respect to gravity. Nine different
   flow directions were examined, including horizontal, 30 inclined and
   declined, 45 inclined and declined, 60 inclined and declined, and
   vertical upward and downward. The experimental data covers liquid
   Reynolds numbers ranging from 800 to 230,000 and local pressures ranging

   direction on the measured film, transition, and nucleate boiling heat
   transfer coefficients as well as the critical heat flux. Finally, new
   heat transfer correlations to predict the data are presented for film
   boiling, nucleate boiling, and transition boiling. These correlations
   can be used for numerical simulations of cryogenic chilldown to help
   predict the chilldown time and propellant consumption for different

Abstract = {{Histopathology is crucial to diagnosis of cancer, yet its interpretation
   is tedious and challenging. To facilitate this procedure, content-based
   image retrieval methods have been developed as case-based reasoning
   tools. Especially, with the rapid growth of digital histopathology,
   hashing-based retrieval approaches are gaining popularity due to their
   exceptional efficiency and scalability. Nevertheless, few hashing-based
   histopathological image analysis methods perform feature fusion, despite
   the fact that it is a common practice to improve image retrieval
   performance. In response, we exploit joint kernel-based supervised
   hashing (JKSH) to integrate complementary features in a hashing
   framework. Specifically, hashing functions are designed based on
   linearly combined kernel functions associated with individual features.
   Supervised information is incorporated to bridge the semantic gap
   between low-level features and high-level diagnosis. An alternating
   optimization method is utilized to learn the kernel combination and
   hashing functions. The obtained hashing functions compress multiple
   high-dimensional features into tens of binary bits, enabling fast
   retrieval from a large database. Our approach is extensively validated
   on 3121 breast-tissue histopathological images by distinguishing between
   actionable and benign cases. It achieves 88.1\% retrieval precision and
   91.3\% classification accuracy within 16.5 ms query time, comparing
   favorably with traditional methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Supplier wholesale pricing for a retail chain: Implications of
   centralized vs. decentralized retailing and procurement under quantity
   competition}},
Journal = {{OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{98-110}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We consider pricing decisions for a supplier who sells a product via a
   retail chain with localized retail stores throughout a region. The
   retail chain can influence the competition for channel profit between
   its retail stores and the supplier via its procurement strategy. Retail
   store orders may be horizontally decentralized or centrally managed by
   the retail chain, depending on the chain's ordering strategy. In the
   case of decentralization at the retail stage, the chain may prefer to
   coordinate procurement from the supplier to achieve better pricing
   terms. We model this problem as a Stackelberg game between the supplier
   and the retail chain and its stores, under joint ownership of the retail
   chain. When the retail stores are horizontally decentralized, they
   engage in quantity competition in the regional market. Given the
   supplier's pricing decisions, we analyze the retail chain's procurement
   strategy and store order quantity dedsions. Then, the store order
   quantities are used to solve the supplier's wholesale price setting
   problem. These analyses then determine the equilibria of the Stackelberg
   game between the supplier and the retail chain under the leadership of
   either party. Our results indicate that the retail chain will have a
   first mover advantage, while the supplier might in certain cases gain a
   first mover disadvantage. Furthermore, the profit-maximizing strategy
   for the channel may in some cases require the supplier's leadership,
   while in other cases, the retail chain's leadership maximizes channel
   profit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticles in alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) transfer
   some of the field's energy to their surroundings in the form of heat, a
   property that has attracted significant attention for use in cancer
   treatment through hyperthermia and in developing magnetic drug carriers
   that can be actuated to release their cargo externally using magnetic
   fields. To date, most work in this field has focused on the use of AMFs
   that actuate heat release by nanoparticles over large regions, without
   the ability to select specific nanoparticle-loaded regions for heating
   while leaving other nanoparticle-loaded regions unaffected. In parallel,
   magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a promising approach to
   image the distribution of magnetic nanoparticle tracers in vivo, with
   sub-millimeter spatial resolution. The underlying principle in MPI is
   the application of a selection magnetic field gradient, which defines a
   small region of low bias field, superimposed with an AMF (of lower
   frequency and amplitude than those normally used to actuate heating by
   the nanoparticles) to obtain a signal which is proportional to the
   concentration of particles in the region of low bias field. Here we
   extend previous models for estimating the energy dissipation rates of
   magnetic nanoparticles in uniform AMFs to provide theoretical
   predictions of how the selection magnetic field gradient used in MPI can
   be used to selectively actuate heating by magnetic nanoparticles in the
   low bias field region of the selection magnetic field gradient.
   Theoretical predictions are given for the spatial decay in energy
   dissipation rate under magnetic field gradients representative of those
   that can be achieved with current MPI technology. These results
   underscore the potential of combining MPI and higher amplitude/frequency
   actuation AMFs to achieve selective magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH)
   guided by MPI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to navigate through space involves complex interactions
   between multiple brain systems. Although it is clear that spatial
   navigation is impaired during aging, the networks responsible for these
   altered behaviors are not well understood. Here, we used a
   within-subject design and {[}F-18] FDG-microPET to capture whole-brain
   activation patterns in four distinct spatial behaviors from young and
   aged rhesus macaques: constrained space (CAGE), head-restrained passive
   locomotion (CHAIR), constrained locomotion in space (TREADMILL), and
   unconstrained locomotion (WALK). The results reveal consistent networks
   activated by these behavior conditions that were similar across age. For
   the young animals, however, the coactivity patterns were distinct
   between conditions, whereas older animals tended to engage the same
   networks in each condition. The combined observations of less
   differentiated networks between distinct behaviors and alterations in
   functional connections between targeted regions in aging suggest changes
   in network dynamics as one source of age-related deficits in spatial

Abstract = {{Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices with graphene as the metal gate
   electrode, silicon dioxide with thicknesses ranging from 5 to 20 nm as
   the dielectric, and p-type silicon as the semiconductor are fabricated
   and characterized. It is found that Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling
   dominates the gate tunneling current in these devices for oxide
   thicknesses of 10 nm and larger, whereas for devices with 5 nm oxide,
   direct tunneling starts to play a role in determining the total gate
   current. Furthermore, the temperature dependences of the F-N tunneling
   current for the 10 nm devices are characterized in the temperature range
   77-300 K. The F-N coefficients and the effective tunneling barrier
   height are extracted as a function of temperature. It is found that the
   effective barrier height decreases with increasing temperature, which is
   in agreement with the results previously reported for conventional MOS
   devices with polysilicon or metal gate electrodes. In addition, high
   frequency capacitance-voltage measurements of these MOS devices are
   performed, which depict a local capacitance minimum under accumulation
   for thin oxides. By analyzing the data using numerical calculations
   based on the modified density of states of graphene in the presence of
   charged impurities, it is shown that this local minimum is due to the
   contribution of the quantum capacitance of graphene. Finally, the
   workfunction of the graphene gate electrode is extracted by determining
   the flat-band voltage as a function of oxide thickness. These results
   show that graphene is a promising candidate as the gate electrode in
   metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Leaf Extract from Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd. Promote Glycogen
   Synthesis in T2DM Mice}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of leaf extract
   from Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd. on type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
   and the active ingredients of this effect. In addition, this study
   determined, for the first time, the underlying molecular and
   pharmacological mechanisms of the extracts on hyperglycemia using
   long-term double high diet-fed and streptozotocin (STZ) induced type II
   diabetic mice. In the present study, leaf extract, phloridzin and
   trilobatin were assessed in vivo (gavage) and in vitro (non-invasive
   micro-test technique, NMT) in experimental T2DM mice. The biochemical
   parameters were measured including blood glucose and blood lipid level,
   liver biochemical indexes, and hepatic glycogen. The relative expression
   of glycometabolism-related genes was detected. The effect of leaf
   extracts on physiological glucose flux in liver tissue from control and
   T2DM mice was also investigated. Body weight of experimental T2DM mice
   increased significantly after the first week, but stabilized over the
   subsequent three weeks; body weight of all other groups did not change
   during the four weeks' study. After four weeks, all treatment groups
   decreased blood glucose, and treatment with leaf extract had numerous
   positive effects: a) promoted in glucose uptake in liver, b) increased
   synthesis of liver glycogen, c) reduced oxidative stress, d)
   up-regulation of glucokinase (GK), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2),
   insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression in
   liver, e) down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-P) expression,
   and f) ameliorated blood lipid levels. Both treatment with trilobatin or
   phloridzin accelerated liver glycogen synthesis, decreased oxidative
   stress and increased expression of GK. IRS and phosphoenolpyruvate
   carboxykinase (PEPCK) were both up-regulated after treatment with
   trilobatin. Expression of GLUT2, PEPCK and G-6-P were also increased in
   liver tissue after treatment with phloridzin. Our data indicate that
   leaf extract from L. polystachyus Rehd. has a preferable hypoglycemic
   effects than trilobatin or phloridzin alone. Leaf extract significantly
   increased glucose uptake and hepatic glycogen synthesis while also
   inducing a decline of hepatic gluconeogenesis and oxidative stress in
   T2DM mice. From this study, we draw conclusions that L.polystachyus
   promoted glycogen synthesis in T2DM mice, and that the active compounds
   were not only the trilobatin or phloridzin.}},

Title = {{Effects of alkali and alkaline-earth metal dopants on magnesium oxide

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{528}},

Abstract = {{The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethane and ethylene was
   studied over alkali metal (Li and Na) and alkaline earth metal (Mg and
   Ca) doped rare earth oxides (Sm2O3,TbOx, PrOy and CeO2) catalysts
   supported on nanoparticle magnesium oxide (n-MgO). It was found that the
   Li-TbOx/n-MgO catalyst outperformed all other combinations of rare earth
   oxide and dopant, in terms of initial activity and selectivity, except
   at temperatures below 600 degrees C where the undoped Sm2O3/n-MgO,
   Ca-Sm2O3/n-MgO and Ca-CeO2/n-MgO catalysts resulted in higher C2+
   yields. Li doping was most efficient in yielding C2+ products over all
   rare earth oxides, followed by doping with Na. These dopants result in
   the most basic sites on the surface according to CO2 desorption
   experiments. However, these sites are blocked at lower reaction
   temperatures, which can explain why most Li- and Na-doped catalysts are
   not active below 650 degrees C. Below reaction temperatures of 650
   degrees C moderately basic sites, which bind CO2 up to similar to 350
   degrees C, are important and correlate well with OCM activity. Li doping
   also resulted in the highest ethylene yields, which is a more desirable
   product than ethane, and the highest ethylene yield (9.7\%) was obtained
   over the Li-CeO2/n-MgO (at 800 degrees C). However, Li-doped catalysts
   are not very stable, and the Na-TbOx/n-MgO catalyst therefore
   outperformed the Li-TbOx/n-MgO catalyst after only a few hours on
   stream. Removal of both Li and Na during reaction was also confirmed and
   is probably the reason for the loss in selectivity with time on stream.
   Tb2O3 is the only TbOx phase observed with XRD on the Na- and Li-doped
   TbOx/n-MgO catalysts after reaction and this is important since Tb2O3 is
   likely more selective to C2+ products than TbO1.81 in the OCM reaction.

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{How the human brain plans, executes, and monitors continuous and fluent
   speech has remained largely elusive. For example, previous research has
   defined the cortical locations most important for different aspects of
   speech function, but has not yet yielded a definition of the temporal
   progression of involvement of those locations as speech progresses
   either overtly or covertly. In this paper, we uncovered the
   spatio-temporal evolution of neuronal population-level activity related
   to continuous overt speech, and identified those locations that shared
   activity characteristics across overt and covert speech. Specifically,
   we asked subjects to repeat continuous sentences aloud or silently while
   we recorded electrical signals directly from the surface of the brain
   (electrocorticography (ECoG)). We then determined the relationship
   between cortical activity and speech output across different areas of
   cortex and at sub-second timescales. The results highlight a
   spatio-temporal progression of cortical involvement in the continuous
   speech process that initiates utterances in frontal motor areas and ends
   with the monitoring of auditory feedback in superior temporal gyrus.
   Direct comparison of cortical activity related to overt versus covert
   conditions revealed a common network of brain regions involved in speech
   that may implement orthographic and phonological processing. Our results
   provide one of the first characterizations of the spatio-temporal
   electrophysiological representations of the continuous speech process,
   and also highlight the common neural substrate of overt and covert
   speech. These results thereby contribute to a refined understanding of
   speech functions in the human brain.}},

Title = {{Development of a predictive model to estimate permeability of
   dense-graded asphalt mixture based on volumetrics}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{426-433}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Asphalt mixtures with a coarser gradation typically provide greater
   rutting resistance due to a better structural network to resist shear,
   but they may present other issues, such as higher permeability.
   Increased permeability can facilitate water intrusion, which makes the
   pavement more vulnerable to moisture damage, stripping and erosion of
   unbound bases. Also, higher permeability promotes oxidation of asphalt
   binder, which may result in increased brittleness and susceptibility to
   cracking. The objective of this study was to develop a predictive model
   to estimate permeability of dense-graded asphalt mixture based on
   volumetrics. Eight Superpave mixtures were prepared: 9.5-mm fine and
   coarse graded, 12.5-mm coarse, 19-mm fine and coarse, 25-mm fine and
   37.5-mm fine and coarse. Four target air void contents were defined for
   each mixture: 4\%, 7\%, 9\% and 11\%. Permeability tests were conducted
   using a falling head device according to the Florida Department of
   Transportation (FDOT) procedure FM 5-565. Permeability increased with
   air void content and nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS); however, the
   effect of gradation was not conclusive as the primary control sieve
   point insufficiently defined gradation coarseness. In addition, voids
   filled with asphalt (VFA) exhibited a great correlation with
   permeability. Furthermore, two separate predictive models for 37.5-mm
   and 9.5 to 25-mm NMAS mixes were successfully developed based on
   regression analyses. These models provide a valuable decision tool to
   validate mixtures at a design stage on the basis of maximum permeability
   thresholds established by highway agencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A thermal analysis of flexible filler injection for unbonded
   post-tensioning tendons}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{599-608}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Grout is widely used in bonded post-tensioned bridge construction as an
   anti-corrosive material for protecting the steel strands. Several
   occurrences of tendon failures in U.S. bridges, however, have led to an
   interest in unbonded tendons where a flexible filler, such as wax,
   grease, or gel, is injected into the tendon duct instead of cement
   grout. In general, the consistency of these flexible fillers in ambient
   temperature falls within the realm of semi-solids and, thus, they are
   not readily injectable without preheating. A major concern with flexible
   filler injection is, therefore, maintaining an adequately elevated
   filler temperature to keep the material's viscosity sufficiently low for
   complete filling of the duct and to avoid a blockage that might result
   in a burst pipe or duct. This paper presents a simplified heat transfer
   model that computes the decrease in temperature of the moving filler
   front during injection as it cools while interacting with the
   surrounding strands and duct. The proposed model has been validated by
   multiple mockup experiments conducted with different filler materials
   and injection rates. A comprehensive parametric study has been conducted
   to determine the sensitivity of the filler front temperature to several
   practical factors, such as effective strand surface area, tendon length,
   injection rate, ambient temperature, injection temperature, and number
   of strands in a tendon system. The required minimum injection pressure
   for different flow velocities and tendon lengths has also been
   determined. The experimental results confirm the model's applicability
   to a wide range of tendon lengths and strand patterns, and its
   usefulness in determining tendon constructability. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Life cycle assessment and costing of urine source separation: Focus on

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{487-495}},

Abstract = {{Urine source separation has the potential to reduce pharmaceutical
   loading to the environment, while enhancing nutrient recovery. The focus
   of this life cycle assessment (LCA) was to evaluate the environmental
   impacts and economic costs to manage nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
   drugs (NSAIDs) (i.e., diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen)
   and nutrients in human urine. Urine source separation was compared with
   centralized wastewater treatment (WWT) (biological or upgraded with
   ozonation). The current treatment method (i.e., centralized biological
   WWT) was compared with hypothetical treatment scenarios (i.e.,
   centralized biological WWT upgraded with ozonation, and urine source
   separation). Alternative urine source separation scenarios included
   varying collection and handling methods (i.e., collection by vacuum
   truck, vacuum sewer, or decentralized treatment), pharmaceuticals
   removal by ion-exchange, and struvite precipitation. Urine source
   separation scenarios had 90\% lower environmental impact (based,on the
   TRACI impact assessment method) compared with the centralized wastewater
   scenarios due to reduced potable water production for flush water,
   reduced electricity use at the wastewater treatment plant, and nutrient
   offsets from struvite precipitation. Despite the greatest reduction of
   pharmaceutical toxicity, centralized treatment upgraded with ozone had
   the greatest ecotoxicity impacts due to ozonation, operation and
   infrastructure. Among urine source separation scenarios, decentralized
   treatment of urine and centralized treatment of urine collected by
   vacuum truck had negligible cost differences compared with centralized
   wastewater treatment. Centralized treatment of urine collected by vacuum
   sewer and centralized treatment with ozone cost 30\% more compared with
   conventional wastewater treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{CoxMn3-xO4 (CMO) nanopowders with a wide compositional range (0.9 <= x
   <= 2.7) are synthesized using a gel combustion method. The effect of Co
   content and calcination temperature on the crystal structure of the CMO
   nanopowders is studied using X-ray diffraction. A highly crystalline
   cubic spinel structure can be obtained at a relatively low temperature
   (similar to 700 degrees C) for CMO with a Co content of 1.8. Further
   increases in Co content to 2.7 leads to a higher formation temperature
   (similar to 800 degrees C) required in order to form a crystalline cubic
   structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the Co and Mn
   cations have mixed valence states. Energy dispersive X-ray elemental
   mapping indicates that Co and Mn cations are homogeneously distributed
   in the CMO nanopowders. Thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform
   infrared, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray fluorescence are
   utilized to investigate the formation of the CMO nanopowders, as well as
   the compositional and structural properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{571}},
Pages = {{1147-1154}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved surface active agents such as surfactant and natural organic
   matter can affect the distribution and fate of dense nonaqueous liquids
   (DNAPLs) in soil and groundwater systems. This work investigated how two
   common groundwater surface active agents, humic acid (HA) and Tween 80,
   affected tetrachloroethylene (PCE) migration and source zone
   architecture in saturated porous media under environmentally relevant
   conditions. Batch experiments were first conducted to measure the
   contact angles and interfacial tensions (IFT) between PCE and quartz
   surface in water containing different amount of surface active agents.
   Results showed that the contact angle increased and IFT decreased with
   concentration of surface active agent increasing, and Tween 80 was much
   more effective than HA. Five 2-D flow cell experiments were then
   conducted. Correspondingly, Tween 80 showed strong effects on the
   migration and distribution of PCE in the porous media due to its ability
   to change the medium wettability from water-wet into
   intermediate/NAPL-wet The downward migration velocities of the PCE in
   three Tween 80 cells were slower than those in the other two cells. In
   addition, the final saturation of the PCE in the cells containing
   surface active agents was higher than that in the water-only cell.
   Results from this work indicate that the presence of surface active
   agents in groundwater may strongly affect the fate and distribution of
   DNAPL through altering porous medium wettability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Here we report a rapid and scalable bottom-up technique for
   layer-by-layer (LBL) assembling near-infrared-active colloidal photonic
   crystals consisting of large (>= 1 mu m) silica microspheres. By
   combining a new electrostatics-assisted colloidal transferring approach
   with spontaneous colloidal crystallization at an air/water interface, we
   have demonstrated that the crystal transfer speed of traditional
   Langmuir-Blodgett-based colloidal assembly technologies can be enhanced
   by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. Importantly, the crystalline quality of
   the resultant photonic crystals is not compromised by this rapid
   colloidal assembly approach. They exhibit thickness-dependent
   near-infrared stop bands and welldefined Fabry-Perot fringes in the
   specular transmission and reflection spectra, which match well with the
   theoretical calculations using a scalar-wave approximation model and
   Fabry-Perot analysis. This simple yet scalable bottom-up technology can
   significantly improve the throughput in assembling large area,
   multilayer colloidal crystals, which are of great technological
   importance in a variety of optical and non-optical applications ranging
   from all-optical integrated circuits to tissue engineering. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology, an emerging technology, has witnessed rapid development
   in production and application. Engineered nanomaterials revolutionize
   the industry due to their unique structure and superior performance. The
   release of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) into the environment,
   however, may pose risks to the environment and public health. To advance
   current understanding of environmental behaviors of ENPs, this work
   provides an introductory overview of ENP fate and transport in porous
   media. It systematically reviews the key factors controlling their fate
   and transport in porous media. It first provides a brief overview of
   common ENPs in the environment and their sources. The key factors that
   govern ENP transport in porous media are then categorized into three
   groups: (1) nature of ENPs affecting their transport in porous media,
   (2) nature of porous media affecting ENP transport, and (3) nature of
   flow affecting ENP transport in porous media. In each group, findings in
   recent literature on the specific governing factors of ENP transport in
   porous media are discussed in details. Finally, this work concludes with
   remarks on the importance of ENP transport in porous media and
   directions for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the first report of graphene paper functionalized with
   fractal platinum nanocauliflower for use in electrochemical biosensing
   of small molecules (glucose) or detection of pathogenic bacteria
   (Escherichia coli O157:H7). Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy show that graphene
   oxide-coated nanocellulose was partially reduced by both thermal
   treatment, and further reduced by chemical treatment (ascorbic acid).
   Fractal nanoplatinum with cauliflower-like morphology was formed on the
   reduced graphene oxide paper using pulsed sonoelec-trodeposition,
   producing a conductive paper with an extremely high electroactive
   surface area (0.29 +/- 0.13 cm(2)), confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The platinum surface was
   functionalized with either glucose oxidase (via chitosan encapsulation)
   or a RNA aptamer (via covalent linking) for demonstration as a point of
   care biosensor. The detection limit for both glucose (0.08 +/- 0.02 mu
   M) and E. coli O157:H7 (approximate to 4 CFU mL(-1)) were competitive
   with, or superior to, previously reported devices in the biosensing
   literature. The response time (6 s for glucose and 12 min for E. coli)
   were also similar to silicon biochip and commercial electrode sensors.
   The results demonstrate that the nanocellulose-graphene-nanoplatinum
   material is an excellent paper-based platform for development of
   electrochemical biosensors targeting small molecules or whole cells for
   use in point of care biosensing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   ammoniated coal fly ash}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{613-619}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOX) emission, many coal-fired
   electric utilities employ NOx control devices that utilize ammonia
   injection; this process, although successful at reducing NOx, results in
   a fly ash with elevated concentrations of ammonia. The reuse of
   ammoniated fly ash (AFA) raises environmental concerns due to the
   potential for ammonia to leach from the fly ash and impact water
   supplies. Leaching of AFA was examined for both unencapsulated (raw fly
   ash) and encapsulated (concrete) uses. Synthetic precipitation leaching
   procedure (SPLP) results revealed that AFA used in an unencapsulated
   application released up to 98\% of the initial ammonia content within
   the fly ash. When the AFA was encapsulated in Portland cement concrete,
   monolith leaching tests showed release of 18-37\% of the initial
   ammonia, while size-reduced concretes released 58-68\% in batch tests.
   The high percentage of NH3 leached from the raw material suggests that
   unencapsulated uses might not be a viable option for AFA; comparison of
   leached concentrations from AFA amended concrete to regulatory risk
   thresholds support an acceptable leachability threshold which would be
   substantially higher than those thresholds commonly used to prevent
   inhalation risks to workers for NH3, indicating inhalation is likely the
   critical pathway for reuse of AFA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The empower that is derived from solar, geothermal and tidal sources
   drives the productive processes of the geobiosphere and is responsible
   for developing exergy gradients (work potential) to be transformed into
   secondary exergy sources (wind, and chemical potential of rain water)
   and tertiary sources (chemical and geopotential energy of river
   discharges and the available energy of breaking waves). In this paper we
   use the geobiosphere emergy baseline (GEB) to compute transformities for
   secondary and tertiary renewable exergy sources. We also refine methods
   used to compute secondary and tertiary sources.
   In particular, we develop an emergy accounting procedure for landscape
   systems that prevents double counting. We suggest that when evaluating
   landscape systems, the geobiosphere tripartite (solar, tide, geothermal)
   solar equivalent inflows be summed, and compared to the largest of the
   secondary and tertiary flows. The driving energy for the landscape
   system is then the larger of these two values.
   Additionally, we suggest that defining spatial and temporal boundaries
   is critical to emergy evaluations. Spatial boundaries should be three
   dimensional and include a depth below the land surface, in order to
   compute geothermal exergy inflows, and a height above the land surface,
   to include adsorption of geostrophic winds and other atmospheric
   phenomena. Moreover, specifying the temporal boundaries of an analysis
   helps to allocate driving emergy sources properly, especially related to
   landscape scale analyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Valorization of lignin and cellulose in acid-steam-exploded corn stover
   by a moderate alkaline ethanol post-treatment based on an integrated
   biorefinery concept}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Due to the unsustainable consumption of fossil resources,
   great efforts have been made to convert lignocellulose into bioethanol
   and commodity organic compounds through biological methods. The
   conversion of cellulose is impeded by the compactness of plant cell wall
   matrix and crystalline structure of the native cellulose. Therefore,
   appropriate pretreatment and even post-treatment are indispensable to
   overcome this problem. Additionally, an adequate utilization of
   coproduct lignin will be important for improving the economic viability
   of modern biorefinery industries.
   Results: The effectiveness of moderate alkaline ethanol post-treatment
   on the bioconversion efficiency of cellulose in the acid-steam-exploded
   corn stover was investigated in this study. Results showed that an
   increase of the alcoholic sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentration from
   0.05 to 4\% led to a decrease in the lignin content in the posttreated
   samples from 32.8 to 10.7\%, while the cellulose digestibility
   consequently increased. The cellulose conversion of the 4\% alcoholic
   NaOH integrally treated corn stover reached up to 99.3\% after 72 h,
   which was significantly higher than that of the acid steam exploded corn
   stover without post-treatment (57.3\%). In addition to the decrease in
   lignin content, an expansion of cellulose I lattice induced by the 4\%
   alcoholic NaOH post-treatment played a significant role in promoting the
   enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover. More importantly, the lignin
   fraction (AL) released during the 4\% alcoholic NaOH post-treatment and
   the lignin-rich residue (EHR) remained after the enzymatic hydrolysis of
   the 4\% alcoholic NaOH post-treated acid-steam-exploded corn stover were
   employed to synthesize lignin-phenol-formaldehyde (LPF) resins. The
   plywoods prepared with the resins exhibit satisfactory performances.
   Conclusions: An alkaline ethanol system with an appropriate NaOH
   concentration could improve the removal of lignin and modification of
   the crystalline structure of cellulose in acid-steam-exploded corn
   stover, and consequently significantly improve the conversion of
   cellulose through enzymatic hydrolysis for biofuel production. The
   lignin fractions obtained as byproducts could be applied in high
   performance LPF resin preparation. The proposed model for the integral
   valorization of corn stover in this study is worth of popularization.}},

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations predict the stability and properties of
   two-dimensional (2D) group IV-V MX compounds (M = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; X = P,
   As, Sb, Bi) in two distinct crystallographic configurations: a low
   symmetry Cm layer inspired by the layered bulk structures of SiP, SiAs,
   GeP, and GeAs, and a high symmetry P (6) over bar m2 structure
   previously predicted for 2D SiP. The calculations predict that the Cm
   structure is more stable for X = As, Sb, and Bi, and the P (6) over bar
   m2 structure for X = P. The electronic properties of the two structures
   are quite different. Specifically, the Cm band gaps are systematically
   larger by about 15\% for most compounds, and the band offsets indicate
   that all of these compounds in the Cm crystal structure will form type
   II heterojunctions in contact with their P (6) over bar m2 polymorphs.
   Pourbaix diagrams predict that a few of the 2D IV-V compounds are stable
   when exposed to water. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Novel bio-based polyurethanes (PUs) were synthesized from transgenic
   soybean oil (TSBO) and then modified with hydroxyl-terminated dimethyl
   silicone (HTMS) to coat urea prills for controlling nitrogen (N)
   release. Different kinds of coated ureas were prepared from these
   hydrophobic PUs. Physicochemical properties of the coatings were
   characterized in the laboratory. The N release characteristics of the
   PU-coated ureas (PCUs) in water were determined at 25 degrees C.
   Experimental results showed that the presence of HTMS in the PUs reduced
   the coating porosity, increased the water-contact angle of the coating
   material, and thus slowed the nutrient release from the PCUs. These
   results suggested that HTMS improved the structure and properties of
   coating materials for controlled release. These findings showed that
   bio-based PUs derived from TSBOs made excellent coating material,
   particularly after HTMS modification, and thus may replace
   petroleum-based PUs for controlled-release fertilizers. (C) 2016 Wiley

Title = {{Hydrologic controls on aperiodic spatial organization of the
   ridge-slough patterned landscape}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4457-4467}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{A century of hydrologic modification has altered the physical and
   biological drivers of landscape processes in the Everglades (Florida,
   USA). Restoring the ridge-slough patterned landscape, a dominant feature
   of the historical system, is a priority but requires an understanding of
   pattern genesis and degradation mechanisms. Physical experiments to
   evaluate alternative pattern formation mechanisms are limited by the
   long timescales of peat accumulation and loss, necessitating model-based
   comparisons, where support for a particular mechanism is based on model
   replication of extant patterning and trajectories of degradation.
   However, multiple mechanisms yield a central feature of ridge-slough
   patterning (patch elongation in the direction of historical flow),
   limiting the utility of that characteristic for discriminating among
   alternatives. Using data from vegetation maps, we investigated the
   statistical features of ridge-slough spatial patterning (ridge density,
   patch perimeter, elongation, patch size distributions, and spatial
   periodicity) to establish more rigorous criteria for evaluating model
   performance and to inform controls on pattern variation across the
   contemporary system. Mean water depth explained significant variation in
   ridge density, total perimeter, and length : width ratios, illustrating
   an important pattern response to existing hydrologic gradients. Two
   independent analyses (2-D periodograms and patch size distributions)
   provide strong evidence against regular patterning, with the landscape
   exhibiting neither a characteristic wavelength nor a characteristic
   patch size, both of which are expected under conditions that produce
   regular patterns. Rather, landscape properties suggest robust scale-free
   patterning, indicating genesis from the coupled effects of local
   facilitation and a global negative feedback operating uniformly at the
   landscape scale. Critically, this challenges widespread invocation of
   scale-dependent negative feedbacks for explaining ridge-slough pattern
   origins. These results help discern among genesis mechanisms and provide
   an improved statistical description of the landscape that can be used to
   compare among model outputs, as well as to assess the success of future
   restoration projects.}},

Abstract = {{Loss-of-excitation (LOE) relays work under pre-defined operating

   characteristics might not be suitable for current system conditions. In
   this study, an adaptive real-time data-based analytical methodology is
   proposed for improving LOE protection performance. The core idea is to
   generate in real time an adaptive operating characteristic for the Mho
   relay, based on the well know Berdy's method. The adaptive Mho operating
   characteristic is derived through the proposed methodology using the
   generator capability curve. Validation is obtained through comparative
   simulation test cases using DigSilent Power Factory((R)) program. Test
   case results show that the proposed protection adaptive analytical
   methodology displays secure and effective high speed LOE detection,
   indicating potential for real-life applications.}},

Title = {{Correntropy induced joint power and admission control algorithm for

Journal = {{IET COMMUNICATIONS}},

Pages = {{2154-2161}},

Abstract = {{The authors consider the joint admission and power control problem in a
   dense small cell network, which contains multiple interference links.
   The goal is to mainly maximise the number of the admitted links, and at
   the same time minimise the transmit power. The authors formulate the
   admission control and power control problem as a joint optimisation
   problem, which is however non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard).
   Such NP-hard problem can be relaxed to a p-norm problem (0 < p < 1) by
   using the correntropy induced metric. The correntropy is a novel
   non-linear similarity measure, which has been successfully used in the
   robust and spares signal processing, especially when the data contain
   large outliers. Thus, in this work the authors propose a new correntropy
   induced joint power and admission control algorithm. To achieve a faster
   convergence speed, the authors also propose an adaptive kernel size
   method, in which the kernel size is determined by the error so that the
   convergence speed is the fastest during the iterations. Simulation
   results show that the proposed approach can achieve much better results
   than the existing works.}},

Title = {{An electrochemical approach to measuring oxidative stability of solid
   polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{34-41}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Polymer electrolytes are an interesting class of electrolytes that hold
   promise for safer, flexible, high-energy batteries. Block copolymer
   electrolytes that contain polystyrene, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and
   lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide salt (LiTFSI) are compatible
   with lithium metal. However, the compatibility of PEO-based electrolyte
   with advanced lithium positive electrodes has not been conclusively
   demonstrated. Therefore, oxidative stability of PEO+LiTFSI and the block
   copolymer electrolyte with common current collectors and against inert
   working electrodes have been investigated electrochemically. The solid
   nature of these polymer electrolytes is a challenge for electrochemical
   investigations, since most electrochemical experiments have been
   designed for liquid electrolyte. In order to quantitatively evaluate
   polymer electrolyte stability, an electrochemical approach especially
   designed for solid electrolytes is presented. This approach uses a set
   of linear sweep voltammograms from different, large overpotentials to
   open circuit voltage, which the authors term variable reverse linear
   sweep voltammetry. By allowing the cell to relax between each
   polarization, the first data points of each voltammogram are not mass
   transfer limited. This yields current versus overpotential data that can
   be analyzed with a kinetic model, such as the Butler-Volmer model. The
   block copolymer electrolyte has been found to be quite stable to
   electrochemical oxidation, up to 5 V at 40 degrees C. The degradation
   reaction has been found to be slow with large thermal activation energy.

Abstract = {{There is an incredible need to help disabled veterans and police
   officers to remotely perform patrolling and law enforcement duties.
   Currently a disabled officer is medically retired following a severe
   duty related injury, depriving the individual of a career and the talent
   of an experienced officer in his/her prime. This results in billions of
   dollars of wasted talents and resources. This paper presents a detailed
   development and analysis of a telepresence robot designated as TeleBot\#
   to assess how it can be used to help disabled officers return to active
   duty. The principal contribution of this paper comprises of robust
   communication architecture for efficient human interaction with the
   robot that almost resembles a law enforcement officer and capable of
   receiving commands that are issued by a disabled officer from a remote
   location. Two high definition cameras in the head assembly of TeleBot
   wirelessly transmit live video stream of the TeleBots visual field to
   the remote operator wearing a virtual reality based stereoscopic
   display. Additionally, a voice recognition system enables the TeleBot to
   greet people and accept voice based commands from the operator. The
   user-friendly software embedded on the system provides seamless
   communication between the officer at a remote location and the public
   through TeleBot. The striking factor of this design is affordability in
   terms of cost.}},

Abstract = {{Stress is calculated routinely in atomistic simulations. The widely used
   microscopic stress formulas derived from classical or quantum mechanics,
   however, are distinct from the concept of Cauchy stress, i. e., the true
   mechanical stress. This work examines various atomistic formulations for
   local stress and their inconsistencies. Using standard mathematic
   theorems and the law of mechanics, we show that Cauchy stress results
   unambiguously from the definition of internal force density, thereby
   removing the long-standing confusion about the atomistic basis of the
   fundamental property of Cauchy stress and leading to a new atomistic
   formula for local stress The new atomistic stress formula has clear
   physical meaning and well-defined values, satisfies the conservation
   law, and is fully consistent with the concept of Cauchy stress.

Title = {{Deciding Degree of Conservativeness in Initial Design Considering Risk

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Early in the design process, there is often mixed epistemic model
   uncertainty and aleatory parameter uncertainty. Later in the design
   process, the results of high-fidelity simulations or experiments will
   reduce epistemic model uncertainty and may trigger a redesign process.
   Redesign is undesirable because it is associated with costs and delays;
   however, it is also an opportunity to correct a dangerous design or
   possibly improve design performance. In this study, we propose a
   margin-based design/redesign method where the design is optimized
   deterministically, but the margins are selected probabilistically. The
   final design is an epistemic random variable (i.e., it is unknown at the
   initial design stage) and the margins are optimized to control the
   epistemic uncertainty in the final design, design performance, and
   probability of failure. The method allows for the tradeoff between
   expected final design performance and probability of redesign while
   ensuring reliability with respect to mixed uncertainties. The method is
   demonstrated on a simple bar problem and then on an engine design
   problem. The examples are used to investigate the dilemma of whether to
   start with a higher margin and redesign if the test later in the design
   process reveals the design to be too conservative, or to start with a
   lower margin and redesign if the test reveals the design to be unsafe.
   In the examples in this study, it is found that this decision is related
   to the variance of the uncertainty in the high-fidelity model relative
   to the variance of the uncertainty in the low-fidelity model.}},

Abstract = {{Porous NiO and NiO/graphene (NiOG) thin film electrodes were prepared by
   electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique and investigated as
   anodes for lithium ion batteries. The porous NiO structure was designed
   to better buffer the mechanical stress induced by the volume change of
   NiO as well as inhibit the aggregation of nanoparticles during
   conversion reaction. Aiming to facilitate better reaction kinetics
   compared to pure NiO electrode, graphene nanoplates were added to form
   NiOG composite film where additional graphene could be helpful for the
   electron transfer as conductive medium. As a result, porous NiOG
   composite thin film electrode exhibits high rate capability (759, 774,
   614, 447, 243 and 104 mAh g (1) at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,1, 2, and 5 A g (1),
   respectively) and excellent cycling performance (no capacity decrease
   for 500 cycles at 0.5 A g (1)). From analyzing cyclic voltammetry (CV)
   curves, rate and cyclical performance, and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), it was concluded that NiOG composite electrodes
   exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance compared to NiO
   electrodes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   testing at 7 and 28 days, an automated air void analysis, including a
   new method of clustering evaluation, was performed. Study results
   revealed that air void clustering is not responsible for decreased
   compressive strength of retempered concrete because neither aggregate

   impacted the severity of void clustering. Strength loss was found to
   correlate with total air and water content rather than air void

Abstract = {{A well-known intragranular dislocation source, the Frank-Read (FR)
   source plays an important role in size-dependent dislocation
   multiplication in crystalline materials. Despite a number of studies in
   this topic, a systematic investigation of multiple aspects of the FR
   source in different materials is lacking. In this paper, we employ large
   scale quasistatic concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) simulations to
   model an edge dislocation bowing out from an FR source in Cu, Ni, and
   Al. First, a number of quantities that are important for the FR source
   process are quantified in the coarse-grained domain. Then, two key
   characteristics of the FR source, including the critical shear stress
   and critical dislocation configuration, are investigated. In all
   crystalline materials, the critical stresses and the aspect ratio of the
   dislocation half-loop height to the FR source length scale well with
   respect to the FR source length. In Al, the critical stress calculated
   by CAC simulations for a given FR source length agrees reasonably well
   with a continuum model that explicitly includes the dislocation core
   energy. Nevertheless, the predictions of the isotropic elastic theory do
   not accurately capture the FR source responses in Cu and Ni, which have
   a relatively large stacking fault width and elastic anisotropy. Our
   results highlight the significance of directly simulating the FR source
   activities using fully 3D models and shed light on developing more
   accurate continuum models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing penetration of renewable energy into the power grid
   system, the volatility of real-time electricity prices increases
   significantly. This brings challenges for independent power producers to
   provide optimal bidding strategies. The traditional approaches of only
   attending the day-ahead market might not be profitable enough without
   taking advantage of real-time price volatility. In this paper, we study
   the optimal bidding strategies for the independent power producers
   utilizing self-scheduling strategies to participate in the real-time
   market considering real-time electricity price volatility, with the
   objective of maximizing the total expected profit. Considering the
   correlations of renewable energy generation outputs among different time
   periods, the correlations of real-time prices are captured in our
   modeling framework, in which we explore a multistage stochastic scenario
   tree to formulate the price uncertainties. Accordingly, the derived
   multistage stochastic self-scheduling unit commitment problem is
   transformed as a deterministic equivalent mixed-integer linear
   programming formulation. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we
   develop strong valid inequalities for the derived stochastic unit
   commitment polytope to speed up the algorithms to solve the problem. In
   particular, we derive strong valid inequalities that can provide the
   convex hull descriptions for the two-period case and a special class of
   the three-period cases with rigorous proofs provided. Furthermore,
   strong valid inequalities, including facet-defining proofs, for
   multistage cases are proposed to further strengthen the model. Finally,
   numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our derived strong
   valid inequalities by incorporating them in a branch-and-cut framework.}},

Abstract = {{Gait analysis is a useful tool to understand behavioral changes in
   preclinical arthritis models. While observational scoring and
   spatiotemporal gait parameters are the most widely performed gait
   analyses in rodents, commercially available systems can now provide
   quantitative assessments of spatiotemporal patterns. However,
   inconsistencies remain between testing platforms, and laboratories often
   select different gait pattern descriptors to report in the literature.
   Rodent gait can also be described through kinetic and kinematic
   analyses, but systems to analyze rodent kinetics and kinematics are
   typically custom made and often require sensitive, custom equipment.
   While the use of rodent gait analysis rapidly expands, it is important
   to remember that, while rodent gait analysis is a relatively modern
   behavioral assay, the study of quadrupedal gait is not new. Nearly all
   gait parameters are correlated, and a collection of gait parameters is
   needed to understand a compensatory gait pattern used by the animal. As
   such, a change in a single gait parameter is unlikely to tell the full
   biomechanical story; and to effectively use gait analysis, one must
   consider how multiple different parameters contribute to an altered gait
   pattern. The goal of this article is to review rodent gait analysis
   techniques and provide recommendations on how to use these technologies
   in rodent arthritis models, including discussions on the strengths and
   limitations of observational scoring, spatiotemporal, kinetic, and
   kinematic measures. Recognizing rodent gait analysis is an evolving
   tool, we also provide technical recommendations we hope will improve the
   utility of these analyses in the future. (C) 2016 Osteoarthritis

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) is becoming a method of choice
   for repair and strengthening of many environmentally aged structures,
   bridges in particular. Durability of such CFRP repairs/strengthening
   efforts still remains uncertain. This paper presents the findings from
   structural and materials testing conducted on a CFRP-wrapped bridge
   girder that was taken out of service from the Indian River Bridge
   located in Melbourne, FL. The bridge girders, originally constructed in
   the 1960s, experienced corrosion damage during their service life in a
   brackish water environment. Following the repair of corrosion damage
   using conventional methods, repaired regions were wrapped with CFRP.
   Test results showed a modest increase in strength as a result of CFRP
   wrapping; fiber-reinforced polymer wrap, however, may have resulted in a
   reduction of chloride contamination following installation of the repair
   system. Furthermore, comparison of test results between the laboratory
   and field load tests indicated that AASHTO load distribution factors are
   conservative for this cast-in-place beam and slab bridge.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a distributed algorithm for time synchronization in mobile
   wireless sensor networks. The problem of time synchronization is
   formulated as nodes estimating their skews and offsets from noisy
   difference measurements of offsets and logarithm of skews; the
   measurements acquired by time-stamped message exchanges between
   neighbors. The algorithm ensures that the estimation error is mean
   square convergent (variance converging to 0) under certain conditions. A
   sequence of scheduled update instants is used to meet the requirement of
   decreasing time-varying gains that need to be synchronized across nodes
   with unsynchronized clocks. Moreover, a modification on the algorithm is
   also presented to improve the initial convergence speed. Simulations
   indicate that highly accurate global time estimates can be achieved with
   the proposed algorithm for long time durations, while the errors in
   competing algorithms increase over time.}},

Abstract = {{Auction-based secondary spectrum market provides a platform for spectrum
   holders to share their under-utilized licensed bands with secondary
   users (SUs) for economic benefits. However, it is challenging for SUs to
   directly participate due to their limited battery power and capability
   in computation and communications. To shift complexity away from users,
   in this paper, we propose a novel multi-round service-oriented
   combinatorial spectrum auction with two-tier framework support. In Tier
   I, we introduce several secondary service providers (SSPs) to provide
   end-users with services by using purchased licensed bands even if the
   end-users do not have cognitive radio capability. When an SU submits its
   service request with certain bidding allowance to its SSP, the SSP will
   help find out which bands within its area are available and bid for the
   desired ones from the market in Tier II. Specifically, we formulate the
   bidding process at the SSP as an optimization problem by considering
   interference management, spectrum uncertainty, flow routing, and budget
   allowance. In Tier II, considering two possible manners of the seller,
   we propose two social-welfare-maximizing auction mechanisms accordingly,
   including the winner determination based on weighted conflict graph and
   the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves-styled price charging mechanism. Extensive
   simulations have been conducted and the results have demonstrated the
   higher revenue of the proposed scheme compared with the traditional
   commodity-oriented single-round truthful schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Parameter uncertainty in hydrologic modeling is commonly evaluated, but
   assessing the impact of spatial input data uncertainty in spatially
   descriptive `distributed' models is not common. This study compares the
   significance of uncertainty in spatial input data and model parameters
   on the output uncertainty of a distributed hydrology and sediment
   transport model, HYdrology Simulation using Time-ARea method (HYSTAR).
   The Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (SCEM-UA) algorithm was used
   to quantify parameter uncertainty of the model. Errors in elevation and
   land cover layers were simulated using the Sequential Gaussian/Indicator
   Simulation (SGS/SIS) techniques and then incorporated into the model to
   evaluate their impact on the outputs relative to those of the parameter
   uncertainty. This study demonstrated that parameter uncertainty had a
   greater impact on model output than did errors in the spatial input
   data. In addition, errors in elevation data had a greater impact on
   model output than did errors in land cover data. Thus, for the HYSTAR
   distributed hydrologic model, accuracy and reliability can be improved
   more effectively by refining parameters rather than further improving
   the accuracy of spatial input data and by emphasizing the topographic
   data over the land cover data.}},

Number = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A 4-node co-rotational quadrilateral composite shell element is
   presented. The local coordinate system of the element is a co-rotational
   framework defined by the two bisectors of the diagonal vectors generated
   from the four corner nodes and their cross product. Thus, the element
   rigid-body rotations are excluded in calculating the local nodal
   variables from the global nodal variables. Compared with other existing
   co-rotational finite-element formulations, the present element has two
   features: (i) The two smallest components of the mid-surface normal
   vector at each node are defined as the rotational variables, leading to
   the desired additive property for all nodal variables in a nonlinear
   incremental solution procedure; (ii) both element tangent stiffness
   matrices in the local and global coordinate systems are symmetric owing
   to the commutativity of the nodal variables in calculating the second
   derivatives of strain energy with respect to the local nodal variables
   and, through chain differentiation with respect to the global nodal
   variables. In the modeling of composite structures, the first-order
   shear deformable laminated plate theory is adopted in the local element
   formulation, where both the thickness deformation and the normal stress
   in the direction of the shell thickness are ignored, and an assumed
   strain method is employed to alleviate the membrane and shear locking
   phenomena. Several examples involving composite plates and shells with
   large displacements and large rotations are presented to testify to the
   reliability and convergence of the present formulation.}},

Abstract = {{In Parkinson's disease (PD), the characteristic triphasic agonist and
   antagonist muscle activation pattern during ballistic movement is
   impaired: the number of agonist muscle bursts is increased, and the
   amplitudes of the agonist and antagonist bursts are reduced. The
   breakdown of the triphasic electromyographic (EMG) pattern has been
   hypothesized to underlie bradykinesia in PD. Progressive resistance
   exercise has been shown to improve clinical measures of bradykinesia,
   but it is not clear whether the benefits for bradykinesia are
   accompanied by changes in agonist and antagonist muscle activity. This
   study examined the spatiotemporal changes in agonist and antagonist
   muscle activity following 24 mo of progressive resistance exercise and
   the combined relationship between spatiotemporal muscle activity and
   strength measures and upper limb bradykinesia. We compared the effects
   of progressive resistance exercise training (PRET) with a nonprogressive
   exercise intervention, modified Fitness Counts (mFC), in patients with
   PD. We randomized 48 participants with mild-to-moderate PD to mFC or
   PRET. At the study endpoint of 24 mo, participants randomized to PRET
   compared with mFC had significantly faster movement velocity,
   accompanied by significant increases in the duration, magnitude, and
   magnitude normalized to duration of the 1st agonist burst and fewer
   number of agonist bursts before peak velocity. The antagonist muscle
   activity was increased relative to baseline but did not differ between
   groups. Spatiotemporal EMG muscle activity and muscle strength were
   significantly associated with upper limb bradykinesia. These findings
   demonstrate that progressive resistance exercise improves upper limb
   movement velocity and restores some aspects of the triphasic EMG
   pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Landfill gas (LFG) generation is predicted by a first-order decay (FOD)
   equation that incorporates two parameters: a methane generation
   potential (L-0) and a methane generation rate (k). Because non-hazardous
   waste landfills may accept many types of waste streams, multiphase
   models have been developed in an attempt to more accurately predict
   methane generation from heterogeneous waste streams. The ability of a
   single-phase FOD model to predict methane generation using
   weighted-average methane generation parameters and tonnages translated
   from multiphase models was assessed in two exercises. In the first
   exercise, waste composition from four Danish landfills represented by
   low-biodegradable waste streams was modeled in the Afvalzorg Multiphase
   Model and methane generation was compared to the single-phase
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Waste Model and
   LandGEM. In the second exercise, waste composition represented by IPCC
   waste components was modeled in the multiphase IPCC and compared to
   single-phase LandGEM and Australia's Solid Waste Calculator (SWC). In
   both cases, weight-averaging of methane generation parameters from waste
   composition data in single-phase models was effective in predicting
   cumulative methane generation from -7\% to +6\% of the multiphase
   models. The results underscore the understanding that multiphase models
   will not necessarily improve LFG generation prediction because the
   uncertainty of the method rests largely within the input parameters. A
   unique method of calculating the methane generation rate constant by
   mass of anaerobically degradable carbon was presented (k(c)) and
   compared to existing methods, providing a better fit in 3 of 8
   scenarios. Generally, single phase models with weighted-average inputs
   can accurately predict methane generation from multiple waste streams
   with varied characteristics; weighted averages should therefore be used
   instead of regional default values when comparing models.Implications:
   Translating multiphase first-order decay model input parameters by
   weighted average shows that single-phase models can predict cumulative
   methane generation within the level of uncertainty of many of the input
   parameters as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC), which indicates that decreasing the uncertainty of the input
   parameters will make the model more accurate rather than adding multiple
   phases or input parameters.}},

Title = {{Electromyographic evidence in support of a knock-in mouse model of DYT1
   Dystonia}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionDYT1 dystonia is an autosomal-dominant movement disorder
   characterized by abnormal, often repetitive, movements and postures. Its
   hallmark feature is sustained or intermittent contractions of muscles
   involving co-contractions of antagonist muscle pairs. The symptoms are
   relieved with the anticholinergic drug trihexyphenidyl. The primary
   mutation is a trinucleotide deletion (GAG) in DYT1/TOR1A, which codes
   for torsinA. Previous studies showed that (1) heterozygous Dyt1 GAG
   knock-in mice, which have an analogous mutation in the endogenous gene,
   exhibit motor deficits and altered corticostriatal synaptic plasticity
   in the brain and (2) these deficits can be rescued by trihexyphenidyl.
   However, brain imaging studies suggest that the Dyt1 knock-in mouse
   models nonmanifesting mutation carriers of DYT1 dystonia. The aim of
   this work was to examine the hallmark features of DYT1 dystonia in the
   Dyt1 knock-in mice by analyzing muscular activities.
   MethodsWireless telemetry devices with biopotential channels were
   implanted to the bicep and the rectus femori muscles in Dyt1 knock-in
   mice, and muscular activities were recorded before and after
   trihexyphenidyl administration.
   Results(1) Consistent with DYT1 dystonia patients, Dyt1 knock-in mice
   showed sustained contractions and co-contractions of the antagonistic
   bicep femoris and rectus femoris. (2) The abnormal muscle contractions
   were normalized by trihexyphenidyl.
   ConclusionThe results suggest that the motor deficits in Dyt1 knock-in
   mice are likely produced by abnormal muscle contractions, and Dyt1
   knock-in mice can potentially be used as a manifesting disease model to
   study pathophysiology and develop novel therapeutics. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{BackgroundMuscle activity during rapid eye movement sleep is markedly
   increased in people with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and
   people with Parkinson's disease (PD) who have freezing of gait. This
   study examined whether individuals with rapid eye movement sleep
   behavior disorder who do not have a diagnosis of PD show abnormalities
   in gait initiation that resemble the impairments observed in PD and
   whether there is a relationship between these deficits and the level of
   rapid eye movement sleep without atonia.
   MethodsGait initiation and polysomnography studies were conducted in 4
   groups of 10 participants: rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder,
   PD with and without freezing of gait, and controls.
   ResultsSignificant reductions were seen in the posterior shift of the
   center of pressure during the propulsive phase of gait initiation in the
   groups with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and PD with
   freezing of gait when compared with controls and PD nonfreezers. These
   reductions negatively correlated with the amount of rapid eye movement
   sleep without atonia. The duration of the initial dorsiflexor muscle
   burst during gait initiation was significantly reduced in both PD groups
   and the rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder cohort.
   ConclusionsThese results provide evidence that people with rapid eye
   movement sleep behavior disorder, prior to a diagnosis of a degenerative
   neurologic disorder, show alterations in the coupling of posture and
   gait similar to those seen in PD. The correlation between increased
   rapid eye movement sleep without atonia and deficits in forward
   propulsion during the push-off phase of gait initiation suggests that
   abnormities in the regulation of muscle tone during rapid eye movement
   sleep may be related to the pathogenesis of freezing of gait. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper develops a Mathematical approach to optimize a time-dependent
   deployment plan of autonomous vehicle (AV) lanes on a transportation
   network with heterogeneous traffic stream consisting of both
   conventional vehicles (CVs) and AVs, so as to minimize the social cost
   and promote the adoption of AVs. Specifically, AV lanes are exclusive
   lanes that can only be utilized by AVs, and the deployment plan
   specifies when, where, and how many AV lanes to be deployed. We first
   present a multi-class network equilibrium model to describe the flow
   distributions of both CVs and AVs, given the presence of AV lanes in the
   network. Considering that the net benefit (e.g., reduced travel cost)
   derived from the deployment of AV lanes will further promote the AV
   adoption, we proceed to apply a diffusion model to forecast the
   evolution of AV market penetration. With the equilibrium model and
   diffusion model, a time-dependent deployment model is then formulated,
   which can be solved by an efficient solution algorithm. Lastly,
   numerical examples based on the south Florida network are presented to
   demonstrate the proposed models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Hypertension-linked mechanical changes of rat gut}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{296-302}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular
   disease caused by a persistent increase in arterial blood pressure that
   has lasting effects on the mechanical properties of affected tissues
   like myocardium and blood vessels. Our group recently discovered that
   gut dysbiosis is linked to hypertension in several animal models and
   humans; however, whether hypertension influences the gut's mechanical
   properties remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis
   that hypertension increases fibrosis and thus mechanical properties of
   the gut. A custom indentation system was used to test colon samples from
   Wistar Kyoto (WKY) normotensive rats and Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats
   (SHR). Using force-displacement data, we derived an steady-state modulus
   metric to quantify mechanical properties of gastrointestinal tissue. We
   observed that SHR proximal colon has a mean steady-state modulus almost
   3 times greater than WKY control rat colon (5.11 +/- 1.58 kPa and 18.17
   +/- 11.45 kPa, respectively). These increases were associated with
   increase in vascular smooth muscle cells layer and collagen deposition
   in the intestinal wall in the SHR.
   Statement of Significance
   Mechanical characterization of biological materials can provide insight
   into health and disease of tissue. Recent investigations into a variety
   of cardiovascular pathologies show coincident changes in the micro biome
   and pathology of the gut. In this study, we sought to quantify changes
   in the gut in hypertension through mechanical characterization. Our
   methods and simple models for characterization, adapted from Hertz
   indentation models, prove useful to identify a meaningful steady-state
   modulus metric for small and irregular tissues from laboratory animals.
   Our data, for the first time, establish a stiffening of the gut wall in
   Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats. This observation suggests significant
   structural and functional changes in the gut correlate with

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Disturbance regimes are shifting in response to climate change, land-use
   change, species' invasions, and other stressors, challenging ecologists
   to improve understanding of the mechanisms controlling plant recovery
   under different conditions. In this study, we investigate mechanisms
   that underpin plant recolonization of two types of disturbance:
   disturbances that remove standing plant biomass, but leave the
   underlying soil structure largely intact, and those that remove standing
   biomass and physically disrupt soil structure. In the southeastern
   United States, salt marshes, drought and invasive feral hogs (Sus
   scrofa) are associated with disturbances of these respective types and
   both leave behind mudflats dotted with patches of cordgrass (Spartina
   alterniflora), the system's dominant foundation species. To test how
   disturbance type and remnant patch size may interact to affect cordgrass
   recolonization, we transplanted replicate cordgrass patches of three
   sizes into one mudflat that experienced vegetation-only disturbance (VD)
   during a recent drought, and a second mudflat where hog activities had
   disrupted the soil structure creating a soil + vegetation disturbance
   (soil + VD). Over one year, we monitored plant performance and
   properties of soil. Compared with the drought-associated VD where
   patches, regardless of their size, expanded vigorously, large and medium
   patches grew little and smaller patches even less in the hog-associated
   soil + VD mudflat. Moreover while biogeochemical properties varied
   little in the VD compared with adjacent vegetated marsh areas, the
   mudflats with soil + VD had less soil-binding organic matter and, hence,
   were too soft to support crab burrows, leading to a reduction in oxygen
   availability and cordgrass expansion. These results indicate that
   cordgrass recovery is far faster from disturbances that do not degrade
   soil structure than those that do and therefore advocate for
   disturbance-specific management strategies. Specifically, while
   transplanting patches is effective in restoring marshes disturbed by
   drought, wrack, or other factors that leave soil structure intact,
   preventative measures, like hog population culling, are essential to
   mitigating the ecological impacts of soil structure-altering
   disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represent a major advance in
   hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. Along with recent updates in HCV
   screening policy and expansions in insurance coverage, treatment demand
   in the United States is changing rapidly. Our objective was to project
   the characteristics and number of people needing antiviral treatment and
   HCV-associated disease burden in the era of oral DAAs. We used a
   previously developed and validated Hepatitis C Disease Burden Simulation
   model (HEP-SIM). HEP-SIM simulated the actual clinical management of HCV
   from 2001 onward, which included antiviral treatment with pegylated
   interferon (Peg-IFN)-based therapies as well as the recent oral DAAs,
   risk-based and birth-cohort HCV screening, and the impact of the
   Affordable Care Act. We also simulated two hypothetical scenariosno
   treatment and treatment with Peg-IFN-based therapies only. We estimated
   that in 2010, 2.5 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.9-3.1) million
   noninstitutionalized people were viremic, which dropped to 1.9 (95\% CI,
   1.4-2.6) million in 2015, and projected to drop below 1 million by 2020.
   A total of 1.8 million HCV patients will receive HCV treatment from the
   launch of oral DAAs in 2014 until 2030. Based on current HCV management
   practices, it will take 4-6 years to treat the majority of patients
   aware of their disease. However, 560,000 patients would still remain
   unaware by 2020. Even in the oral DAA era, 320,000 patients will die,
   157,000 will develop hepatocellular carcinoma, and 203,000 will develop
   decompensated cirrhosis in the next 35 years. Conclusions:
   HCV-associated disease burden will still remain substantial in the era
   of oral DAAs. Increasing HCV screening and treatment capacity is
   essential to further decreasing HCV burden in the United States.

Title = {{Evaluation of leaf wetness duration models for operational use in

Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Leaf wetness duration (LWD) plays a key role in disease development and
   is often used as an input in disease-warning systems. LWD is often
   estimated using mathematical models, since measurement by sensors is
   rarely available and/or reliable. A strawberry disease-warning system
   called ``Strawberry Advisory System{''} (SAS) is used by growers in
   Florida, USA, in deciding when to spray their strawberry fields to
   control anthracnose and Botrytis fruit rot. Currently, SAS is
   implemented at six locations, where reliable LWD sensors are deployed. A
   robust LWD model would facilitate SAS expansion from Florida to other
   regions where reliable LW sensors are not available. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the use of mathematical models to estimate
   LWD and time of spray recommendations in comparison to on site LWD
   measurements. Specific objectives were to (i) compare model estimated
   and observed LWD and resulting differences in timing and number of
   fungicide spray recommendations, (ii) evaluate the effects of weather
   station sensors precision on LWD models performance, and (iii) compare
   LWD models performance across four states in the USA. The LWD models
   evaluated were the classification and regression tree (CART), dew point
   depression (DPD), number of hours with relative humidity equal or
   greater than 90 \% (NHRH aeyen90 \%), and Penman-Monteith (P-M). P-M
   model was expected to have the lowest errors, since it is a physically
   based and thus portable model. Indeed, the P-M model estimated LWD most
   accurately (MAE < 2 h) at a weather station with high precision sensors
   but was the least accurate when lower precision sensors of relative
   humidity and estimated net radiation (based on solar radiation and
   temperature) were used (MAE = 3.7 h). The CART model was the most robust
   for estimating LWD and for advising growers on fungicide-spray timing
   for anthracnose and Botrytis fruit rot control and is therefore the
   model we recommend for expanding the strawberry disease warning beyond
   Florida, to other locations where weather stations may be deployed with
   lower precision sensors, and net radiation observations are not
   available.}},

Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{27-36}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Crop models are widely used in agricultural impact studies. However,
   many studies have reported large uncertainties from single-model-based
   simulation analyses, suggesting the need for multi-model simulation
   capabilities. In this study, the APSIM-Nwheat model was integrated into
   the Decision Support System for Agro-technology (DSSAT), which already
   includes two wheat models, to create multi-model simulation capabilities
   for wheat cropping systems analysis. The new model in DSSAT
   (DSSAT-Nwheat) was evaluated using more than 1000 observations from
   field experiments of 65 treatments, which included a wide range of
   nitrogen fertilizer applications, water supply (irrigation and rainout
   shelter), planting dates, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations,
   temperature variations, cultivars, and soil types in diverse climatic
   regions that represented the main wheat growing areas of the world.
   DSSAT-Nwheat reproduced the observed grain yields well with an overall
   root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.89 t/ha (13\%). Nitrogen
   applications, water supply, and planting dates had large effects on
   observed biomass and grain yields, and the model reproduced these crop
   responses well. Crop total biomass and nitrogen uptake were reproduced
   well despite relatively poor simulations of observed leaf area
   measurements during the growing season. The low sensitivity of biomass
   simulations to poor simulations of leaf area index (LAI) were due to
   little changes in intercepted solar radiation at LAI >3 and water and
   nitrogen stress often limiting photosynthesis and growth rather than
   light interception at low LAI.
   The responses of DSSAT-Nwheat to temperature variations and elevated
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations were close to observed responses. When
   compared with the two other DSSAT-wheat models (CERES and CROPSIM),
   these responses were similar, except for the responses to hot
   environments, due to different approaches in modeling heat stress
   effects.
   The comprehensive evaluation of the DSSAT-Nwheat model with field
   measurements, including a comparison with two other DSSAT-wheat models,
   created a multi-model simulation platform that allows the quantification
   of model uncertainties in wheat impact assessments. (C) 2016 Published

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this analysis was to apply symbolic aggregate
   approximation (SAX) time-series analysis to accelerometer data for
   activity pattern visualization stratified by self-reported mobility
   difficulty. A total of 2393 (71.6 +/- 7.9 years old) participants wore
   an accelerometer on the hip (4 + d; 10 + h) during the national health
   and nutrition examination survey (NHANES), a biannual series of health
   assessments of the US population. One minute epoch data was used to
   perform SAX, which converted accelerometry time series data into four
   activity levels. Intelligent icons of normalized activity transition
   prevalence, a visual representation of time-series data, were examined
   among those who self-reported mobility difficulty. Mobility difficulty
   questions assessed various levels difficulty performing activities such
   as walking a quarter mile, walking up ten steps, stooping/crouching/
   kneeling, and walking between rooms on the same floor. Daily activity
   counts were estimated across difficulty level using weighted-linear
   regression after adjusted for demographics, lifestyle factors, medical
   conditions, and accelerometer wear time. Those reporting higher mobility
   difficulty tended to be older, female, less educated, not married, and
   smokers. Additionally, those with higher mobility difficulty
   self-reported lower education, lower income, lower moderate-to-vigorous
   physical activity, and higher history of adverse medical conditions.
   Using SAX-derived intelligent icons, those with no difficulty showed
   high variations of transitions across all activity levels. With higher
   difficulty, the variations in transitions were lower and constricted
   around low activity level transitions. Among those who reported
   unable/don't do mobility-related activities, there were only transitions
   in the lower tiered activity levels with high prevalence of prolonged
   low level activity. Adjusted estimates of daily activity were lower as
   higher difficulty reported occurred but only significant for those
   reporting unable/don't do mobility-related activity (p < 0.01). In
   summary, this analysis showed apparent differences in stratified
   activity patterns even when traditional regression analyses on
   volumetric accelerometer data yielded null results.}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesized that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a
   hub in the network that mediates appetitive responses whereas the
   amygdala is thought to mediate both aversive and appetitive processing.
   Both structures may facilitate adaptive responses to emotional challenge
   by linking perception, attention, memory, and motor circuits. We provide
   an initial exploration of these hypotheses by recording simultaneous
   EEG-fMRI in eleven participants viewing affective pictures. MPFC- and
   amygdala-seeded functional connectivity maps were generated by applying
   the beta-series correlation method. The mPFC-seeded correlation map
   encompassed visual regions, sensorimotor areas, prefrontal cortex, and
   medial temporal lobe structures, exclusively for pleasant content. For
   the amygdala-seeded correlation map, a similar set of distributed brain
   areas appeared in the unpleasant-neutral contrast, with the addition of
   structures such as the insula and thalamus. A substantially sparser
   network was recruited for the pleasant-neutral contrast. Using the late
   positive potential (LPP) to index the intensity of emotional engagement,
   functional connectivity was found to be stronger in trials with larger
   LPP. These results demonstrate that mPFC-mediated functional
   interactions are engaged specifically during appetitive processing,
   whereas the amygdala is coupled to distinct sets of brain regions during
   both aversive and appetitive processing. The strength of these
   interactions varies as a function of the intensity of emotional
   engagement.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the flexibility of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) to form the
   backhaul subnetworks, future generation networks may have to integrate
   various kinds of WMNs under possibly various administrative domains.
   Aiming at establishing secure access and communications among the
   communication entities in a multi-domain WMN environment, in this paper,
   we intend to address the cross-domain authentication and key agreement
   problem. We present a light-weight cross-domain authentication and key
   agreement protocol, namely CAKA, under certificateless-based public key
   cryptosystem. CAKA has a few attractive features. First, mutual
   authentication and key agreement between any pair of users from
   different WMN domains can be easily achieved with two-round
   interactions. Second, no central domain authentication server is
   required and fast authentication for various roaming scenarios is
   supported by using a repeated cross-domain algorithm. Third, no
   revocation and renewal of certificates and key escrow are needed.
   Finally, it provides relatively more security features without
   increasing too much overhead of computation and storage. Our analysis
   shows that the proposed CAKA protocol is highly efficient in terms of
   communication overhead and resilient to various kinds of attacks.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty of wheat water use: Simulated patterns and sensitivity to

Journal = {{FIELD CROPS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{198}},
Pages = {{80-92}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Projected global warming and population growth will reduce future water
   availability for agriculture. Thus, it is essential to increase the
   efficiency in using water to ensure crop productivity. Quantifying crop
   water use (WU; i.e. actual evapotranspiration) is a critical step
   towards this goal. Here, sixteen wheat simulation models were used to
   quantify sources of model uncertainty and to estimate the relative
   changes and variability between models for simulated WU, water use
   efficiency (WUE, WU per unit of grain dry mass produced), transpiration
   efficiency (T-eff, transpiration per kg of unit of grain yield dry mass
   produced), grain yield, crop transpiration and soil evaporation at
   increased temperatures and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide
   concentrations ({[}CO2]). The greatest uncertainty in simulating water
   use, potential evapotranspiration, crop transpiration and soil
   evaporation was due to differences in how crop transpiration was
   modelled and accounted for 50\% of the total variability among models.
   The simulation results for the sensitivity to temperature indicated that
   crop WU will decline with increasing temperature due to reduced growing
   seasons. The uncertainties in simulated crop WU, and in particularly due
   to uncertainties in simulating crop transpiration, were greater under
   conditions of increased temperatures and with high temperatures in
   combination with elevated atmospheric {[}CO2] concentrations. Hence the
   simulation of crop WU, and in particularly crop transpiration under
   higher temperature, needs to be improved and evaluated with field
   measurements before models can be used to simulate climate change
   impacts on future crop water demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents an application of the embedded data collector (EDC)
   approach using strain and acceleration measurements at the top and
   bottom of a pile (drilled shaft) during dynamic loading (Statnamic) for
   estimation of static side and tip resistance. For assessment of the skin
   friction, wave propagation along the pile was modeled as a
   one-dimensional (1D) wave equation with nonlinear static skin friction
   and viscous damping. The soil-pile system was divided into segments, and
   each segment was characterized with independent multilinear skin
   friction. The skin friction of each segment was determined by
   least-squares fitting of computed particle velocities to the measured
   data at the top and bottom of the pile. For assessment of the tip
   resistance, the pile tip was modeled as a singledegree-of-freedom
   nonlinear system. A nonlinear stiffness-displacement relationship was
   determined by balancing force and energy from inertia, damping, and
   stiffness against the measured tip data. The technique was applied to a
   side- and tip-grouted drilled shaft 7.8 m in length with various cross
   sections (1.05-m diameter for top segment and 1.20-m diameter for bottom
   segment). The estimated static resistance was compared to results from
   top-down static compression loading and the segmental unloading point
   approach during Statnamic testing.}},

Title = {{Uncertainties in the Estimation of Local Peak Pressures on Low-Rise
   Buildings by Using the Gumbel Distribution Fitting Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The lack of a standard accepted method to estimate local peak pressure
   coefficients from wind tunnel data can lead to inconsistent definitions
   and interpretations, particularly because cost and time constraints
   associated with wind tunnel tests of low-rise buildings necessitate
   relatively short (equivalent full-scale) durations. This paper focuses
   on a Gumbel distribution fitting method widely used in practice. Because
   the sources of uncertainty regarding estimated peaks include the use of
   short-duration records (in practice) and the assumption that the
   observed peaks from wind tunnel pressure data are Gumbel-distributed,
   this is quantified in detail in terms of the parameters determining the
   required minimum record length. It is shown that 15 observed peaks can
   lead to local peak pressure estimates with adequate precision for many
   design scenarios. However, the conversion of peak coefficients from a
   short duration to those of a longer duration requires an increase in the
   number of observed peaks to maintain precision.}},

   of high rate algal pond biotechnology}},
Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{219}},
Pages = {{757-761}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{High rate algal pond (HRAP) was combined with constructed wetland (CW)
   to intensify nitrogen removal through optimizing nitrification and
   denitrification. Nitrification and denitrification process mainly
   depends on the oxygen content and carbon source level in CWs. Algal
   biomass was enriched in HRAP, and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration
   was increased via photosynthesis. Algal debris increased COD as
   degradable bioresource. The results showed that HRAP-CW hybrid systems
   effectively promoted the nitrogen removal performance due to rich DO and
   COD. The extension of hydraulic retention time in HRAP significantly
   improved NH4-N and TN removals by 10.9\% and 11.1\% in hybrid systems,
   respectively. The highest NH4-N and TN removals in hybrid systems
   respectively reached 67.2\% and 63.5\%, which were significantly higher
   than those in single CW. The study suggested that the hybrid system had
   the application potentials in nitrogen removal from wastewater. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Converting optical diameter measured by an optical particle counter
   (OPC) to aerodynamic diameter measured by an aerodynamic particle sizer
   (APS) is of interest because the OPC is more affordable and portable. In
   this study, optical diameter was compared with volume equivalent
   diameter derived from aerodynamic diameter using mono disperse oleic
   acid and sodium chloride test aerosols generated by a Vibrating Orifice
   Aerosol Generator (VOAG). While prior studies assumed optical diameter
   to be equal to volume equivalent diameter, experimental results showed
   the assumption to be valid only if the aerosol has the same optical
   properties as standard polystyrene (PSL) particles. For oleic acid
   aerosol, the optical diameter was less than the derived volume
   equivalent diameter because its refractive index (m=1.46) is less than
   of PSL (m=1.60). While the refractive index of sodium chloride (m=1.54)
   is close to that of PSL, a much larger optical diameter of sodium
   chloride than its volume equivalent diameter was observed due to its
   irregular crystallography. Regression equations derived from the
   calibration were verified by testing with a validated respirable
   sampler. With known refractive index and shape factor, these equations
   can convert optical diameter directly to aerodynamic diameter with a
   residual bias less than 1 mu m. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2692-2701}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The use of impact rollers has increased for many decades due to its
   diverse advantages. However, the current lack of theoretical
   verification and research-based technical guidelines that can
   effectively describe the effect of impact rollers is probably the
   greatest deficiency in our ability to accurately predict the benefits of
   deep compaction provided by impact compaction rollers. The 3-D Finite
   Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted using LS-DYNA to simulate the depth
   of influence for various impact rollers. Results indicated that the
   width of the contact area between the drum and the soil primarily
   controls the depth of compaction. The softer the soil is, the deeper the
   roller sinks in the soil. Also, the wider the contact area is, the
   deeper the compaction depth is. Thereby, the depth of compaction is
   highly dependent upon the stiffness of the soil. It was found that the
   surface pressure controls the degree of compaction and the surface
   pressure of the impact rollers is higher than that of the cylindrical
   rollers due to the dynamic effect. However, the distribution of the
   pressure is significantly variable for the impact rollers than the
   cylindrical rollers. It was concluded that the impact rollers seem to
   have more potential for use in final compaction of thicker layers.}},

Abstract = {{Developing in vivo functional and structural neuroimaging assays in Dyti
   Delta GAG heterozygous knock-in (Dyt1 KI) mice provide insight into the
   pathophysiology underlying DYT1 dystonia. In the current study, we
   examined in vivo functional connectivity of large-scale cortical and
   subcortical networks in Dyt1 KI mice and wild-type (WT) controls using
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an
   independent component analysis. In addition, using diffusion MRI we
   examined how structural integrity across the basal ganglia and
   cerebellum directly relates to impairments in functional connectivity.
   Compared to WT mice, Dyt1 KI mice revealed increased functional
   connectivity across the striatum, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex;
   and reduced functional connectivity in the motor and cerebellar
   cortices. Further, Dyt1 KI mice demonstrated elevated free water (FW) in
   the striatum and cerebellum compared to WT mice, and increased FW was
   correlated with impairments in functional connectivity across basal
   ganglia, cerebellum, and sensorimotor cortex. The current study provides
   the first in vivo MRI-based evidence in support of the hypothesis that
   the deletion of a 3-base pair (Delta GAG) sequence in the Dyt1 gene
   encoding torsinA has network level effects on in vivo functional
   connectivity and microstructural integrity across the sensorimotor
   cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{322-327}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Recently, gypsum drywall products imported to the United States (US)
   were found to cause metal corrosion and tarnishing in some homes, often
   necessitating that this drywall be discarded. Research assessed the
   potential implications of recycling and landfilling corrosive imported
   drywall. Samples of corrosive drywall were collected from homes in
   Florida, US and these characteristics were assessed relative to
   domestically-produced drywall purchased from retail outlets. The total
   and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) leachable heavy
   metal concentrations were measured and compared to risk-based regulatory
   thresholds to assess the possible land application risk. In a majority
   of samples, concentrations were below levels of regulatory concern. The
   mean concentration of several elements exceeded the thresholds in a few
   samples for the direct exposure assessment (As) and the groundwater
   leaching assessment (Al, B, Hg, Mn, Sr and V); but the results did not
   suggest that corrosive drywall would present a greater risk than
   domestic drywall. To assess landfilling concerns, the potential for
   sulfur gases emissions upon disposal was evaluated. Experiments
   indicated that corrosive drywall would not pose a greater risk of
   long-term H2S emissions compared to domestic drywall. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The gas-liquid stratified flow boiling heat transfer of water in a
   natural circulation thermosyphon was investigated experimentally. The
   flow boiling test was carried out in a visual thermosyphon loop system
   with a 0.8-m-long, horizontally arranged, evaporator tube with an inner
   diameter of 15.0 mm and under a heat load of 1.0 kW. The development of
   the gas-liquid stratified flow in the evaporator and its effects on
   thermal performance of the thermosyphon loop were analyzed. The results
   show that flow pattern in the evaporator was gradually developed from
   the slug/stratified-wavy flow to the stratified-wavy/stratified-mist
   flow along the flow direction. Simultaneously, a periodic transition of
   the flow pattern was observed. A countercurrent flow at the exit of
   evaporator has emerged to prevent the development of the stratified-wavy
   flow to the mist flow which subsequently resulted in a drop in
   superheat. Moreover, two scales of dynamic instabilities were observed.
   The large scale was found to be the typical pressure drop type
   oscillation. The small scale, however, was found to be highly related to
   the flow pattern transition. Due to the countercurrent flow and
   backflow, a continuous density oscillation was observed. Finally, a
   modified correlation was developed for the local heat transfer
   coefficient that could account for the effect of the subcool and flow
   pattern transition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solar-blind photodetectors have received a great deal of interest owing
   to their high selectivity for deep ultra-violet tight in the presence of
   visible tight. The development of alternative materials and innovative
   device designs are necessary for such solar-blind photodetectors, as the
   currently available commercial devices have issues pertaining to
   chemical and thermal instability, cost, and material handling due to
   their rigidity. Here, we fabricated solar-blind photodetectors based on
   exfoliated quasi-two-dimensional beta-Ga2O3 flakes with optimal
   opto-electrical properties (direct bandgap of similar to 4.9 eV),
   chemical and thermal stability, and then systematically characterized
   their photoresponsive properties. The fabricated device structures were
   based on back-gated field-effect transistors, allowing us to control the
   dark currents. These photodetectors exhibit extraordinary
   photoresponsive properties including the highest responsivity (1.8 x
   10(5) A W-1) among reported semiconductor thin-film solar-blind
   photodetectors.}},

Title = {{Gold Nanoparticle Monolayers from Sequential Interfacial Ligand Exchange
   and Migration in a Three-Phase System}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Using a three-phase system, centimeter-scale monolayer gold nanoparticle
   (Au NP) films have been prepared that have long-range order and
   hydrophobic ligands. The system contains an interface between an aqueous
   phase containing Au NPs and an oil phase containing one of various types
   of amine ligands, and a water/air interface. As the Au NPs diffuse to
   the water/oil interface, ligand exchange takes place which temporarily
   traps them at the water/oil interface. The ligand-exchanged particles
   then spontaneously migrate to the air/water interface, where they
   self-assemble, forming a monolayer under certain conditions. The
   spontaneous formation of the NP film at the air/water interface was due
   to the minimization of the system Helmholtz free energy. However, the
   extent of surface functionalization was dictated by kinetics. This
   decouples interfacial ligand exchange from interfacial self-assembly,
   while maintaining the simplicity of a single system. The interparticle
   center-to-center distance was dictated by the amine ligand length. The
   Au NP monolayers exhibit tunable surface plasma resonance and excellent
   spatial homogeneity, which is useful for surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering. The ``air/water/oil{''} self-assembly method developed here
   not only benefits the fundamental understanding of NP ligand
   conformations, but is also applicable to the manufacture of plasmonic
   nanoparticle devices with precisely designed optical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-coated plastic substrates, such as polyethylene terephthalate
   (PET), are regularly used in flexible electronic devices. Here we
   demonstrate a new application of the graphene-coated nanoporous PET
   membrane for the selective separation of metal ions in an ion exchange
   manner. Irradiation with swift heavy ions is used to perforate graphene
   and PET substrate. This process could create graphene nanopores with
   carboxyl groups, thus forming conical holes in the PET after chemical
   etching to support graphene nanopores. Therefore, a monolayer nanoporous
   graphene membrane with a PET substrate is constructed successfully to
   investigate its ionic selective separation. We find that the permeation
   ratio of ions strongly depends on the temperature and H+ concentration
   in the driving solution. An electric field can increase the permeation
   ratio of ions through the graphene nanopores, but it inhibits the ion
   selective separation. Moreover, the structure of the graphene nanopore
   with carboxyl groups is resolved at the density functional theory level.
   The results show the asymmetric structure of the nanopore with carboxyl
   groups, and the analysis indicates that the ionic permeation can be
   attributed to the ion exchange between metal ions and protons on the two
   sides of graphene nanopores. These results would be beneficial to the
   design of membrane separation materials made from graphene with
   efficient online and gffiine bulk separation.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive decline is a major concern in the aging population. It is
   normative to experience some deterioration in cognitive abilities with
   advanced age such as related to memory performance, attention
   distraction to interference, task switching, and processing speed.
   However, intact cognitive functioning in old age is important for
   leading an independent day-to-day life. Thus, studying ways to
   counteract or delay the onset of cognitive decline in aging is crucial.
   The literature offers various explanations for the decline in cognitive
   performance in aging; among those are age-related gray and white matter
   atrophy, synaptic degeneration, blood flow reduction, neurochemical
   alterations, and change in connectivity patterns with advanced age. An
   emerging literature on neurofeedback and Brain Computer Interface (BCI)
   reports exciting results supporting the benefits of volitional
   modulation of brain activity on cognition and behavior. Neurofeedback
   studies based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rtfMRI) have shown behavioral changes in schizophrenia and behavioral
   benefits in nicotine addiction. This article integrates research on
   cognitive and brain aging with evidence of brain and behavioral
   modification due to rtfMRI neurofeedback. We offer a state-of-the-art
   description of the rtfMRI technique with an eye towards its application
   in aging. We present preliminary results of a feasibility study
   exploring the possibility of using rtfMRI to train older adults to
   volitionally control brain activity. Based on these first findings, we
   discuss possible implementations of rtfMRI neurofeedback as a novel
   technique to study and alleviate cognitive decline in healthy and
   pathological aging.}},

Abstract = {{There exist significant challenges in the synthesis of solely
   biomass-derived p-xylene and terephthalic acid (TPA), the monomer
   precursors of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Herein, we describe a
   flexible synthetic route to prepare either p-xylene or TPA from
   biomass-derived isoprene and acrolein, which avoids harsh reaction
   conditions such as high pressure or extreme low temperature. The route
   starts from 4-methylcyclohex- 3-enecarbaldehyde, the product of
   Diels-Alder reaction of isoprene and acrolein. Then p-xylene was
   successfully obtained by subsequent reduction and aromatization
   reactions using either environment-friendly solvents or in neat. In
   addition, this route was further modified for a process to prepare both
   p-xylene and TPA. By using the same intermediate after Diels-Alder
   reaction, an aromatization reaction was followed by a reduction to
   p-xylene or an oxidation to directly TPA in an overall yield of 32\%
   over three steps.}},

Abstract = {{A single-cylinder compression ignition engine undergoing dual-fuel
   operation with soybean biodiesel and an artificial hydrogen-rich syngas
   (postulated from glycerin reformation) was tested at varying engine
   loads and gaseous/liquid fuel flowrates. Overall, increasing syngas
   usage promotes premixed combustion, with only relatively small
   deviations in injection timing required to maintain efficient engine
   operation. Fuel consumption increased while emissions of particulates
   fell with greater syngas usage due largely to a shift to flame
   propagation-controlled combustion. Increases in nitrogen dioxide
   emissions are tied closely to syngas usage, and composed an unusually
   large portion of all nitrogen oxide emissions via greater levels of
   flame quenching. The experimental results are combined with an energy
   analysis of a biodiesel production process in order to determine the
   amount of glycerin (subsequently converted to a syngas) and, biodiesel
   required for a small-scale plant to be self-sufficient. Calculations
   indicate that only 10.88\% of the glycerin by-product generated and
   3.65\% of the biodiesel produced by the facility is needed to provide
   all of the plant's energy requirements. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{The topic of probing waveform design has received considerable attention
   due to its numerous applications in active sensing. Apart from having
   the desirable property of constant magnitude, it is also anticipated
   that the designed sequence possesses low sidelobe autocorrelation and/or
   specified spectral shape. In this paper, the alternating direction
   method of multipliers (ADMM), which is a powerful variant of the
   augmented Lagrangian scheme for dealing with separable objective
   functions, is applied for synthesizing the probing sequences. To achieve
   impulse-like autocorrelation, we formulate the design problem as
   minimizing a nonlinear least-squares cost function in the frequency
   domain subject to the constraint that all sequence elements are of unit
   modulus. Via introducing auxiliary variables, we are able to separate
   the objective into linear and quadratic functions where the unimodular
   constraint is only imposed on the former, which results in an ADMM-style
   iterative procedure. In particular, fast implementation for the most
   computationally demanding step is investigated and local convergence of
   the ADMM method is proved. To deal with the spectral shape requirement,
   we borrow the concept in frequency-selective filter design where
   passband and stopband magnitudes are bounded to formulate the
   corresponding optimization problem. In this ADMM algorithm development,
   unit-step functions are utilized to transform the multivariable
   optimization into a quadratic polynomial problem with a single variable.
   The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via computer
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The material and magnetic properties of multi-micron-thick (up to 6 mu
   m) L1(0) CoPt magnetic films electroplated onto silicon substrates are
   investigated as candidate materials for integration in silicon based
   microsystems. The influence of various process conditions on the
   structure and magnetic properties of electroplated CoPt thick-films is
   studied in order to better understand the complex
   process/structure/property relationships associated with the
   electroplated films. Process variables studied here include different
   seed layers, electroplating current densities (ranging from 25-200
   mA/cm(2)), deposition times (up to 60 min), and post-deposition
   annealing times and temperatures. Analyses include film morphology, film
   thickness, composition, surface roughness, grain size, phase volume
   fractions, and L1(0) ordering parameter. Key correlations are found
   relating process and structure variations to the extrinsic magnetic
   properties (remanence, coercivity, squareness, and energy product).
   Strong hard magnetic properties (B-r similar to 0.8T, H-ci similar to
   800 kA/m, squareness close to 0.9, and BHmax of 100 kJ/m(3)) are
   obtained for films deposited on Si/TiN/Ti/Cu at current densities of 100

   behaving as a self-organizing system and achieving a good compromise

Abstract = {{We report on the experimental demonstration of an aerosol solar reactor
   for the thermal reduction of ceria, as part of a thermochemical redox
   cycle for splitting H2O and CO2. The concept utilizes a cavityreceiver
   enclosing an array of alumina tubes, each containing a downward
   gravity-driven aerosol flow of ceria particles countercurrent to an
   inert sweep gas flow for intrinsic separation of reduced ceria and
   oxygen. A 2 kWth lab-scale prototype with a single tube was tested under
   radiative fluxes approaching 4000 suns, yielding reaction extents of up
   to 53\% of the thermodynamic equilibrium at 1919 K within residence
   times below 1 s. Upon thermal redox cycling, fresh primary particles of
   2.44 mu m mean size initially formed large agglomerates of 1000 mu m
   mean size, then sintered into stable particles of 150 mu m mean size.
   The reaction extent was primarily limited by heat transfer for large
   particles/agglomerates (mean size > 200 mu m) and by the gas phase
   advection of product O-2 for smaller particles.}},

Title = {{Parameter governing the far-field features of round jets}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{This study is inspired by the observation and hypothesis that the
   spreading and decay behaviors of a jet directly depend on the
   momentum-mixing mechanism between the jet and surrounding fluid. This
   mixing behavior is dictated by the kinematic viscosity. for a laminar
   jet, which can be dramatically enhanced in a turbulent flow and is
   represented by the eddy viscosity epsilon. Similarly, pulsation in a
   synthetic jet is identified as another mechanism for enhancing mixing,
   which can be captured by an enhanced eddy viscosity beyond what is
   observed in a corresponding turbulent continuous jet. To this end, an
   effective-eddy-viscosity concept is proposed to model any excitation of
   a jet that could result in enhanced mixing beyond what is predicted by
   the kinematic viscosity. Our previous study found that e is actuator
   dependent and its relationship with the spreading or decay behavior of a
   jet is not obvious. To remove the actuator dependence, this study
   performs a dimensional analysis to relate the spreading and decay
   behaviors to a scaled effective eddy viscosity epsilon/root K (K is the
   momentum flux). This quantity physically represents a competition
   between the radial diffusion and the axial convection of the jet axial
   momentum. The experimental results confirm that epsilon/root K governs
   the spreading and decay rates of the far field for any round jets.}},

Abstract = {{The reference adult computational phantoms of the international
   commission on radiological protection (ICRP) described in Publication
   110 are voxel-type computational phantoms based on whole-body computed
   tomography (CT) images of adult male and female patients. The voxel
   resolutions of these phantoms are in the order of a few millimeters and
   smaller tissues such as the eye lens, the skin, and the walls of some
   organs cannot be properly defined in the phantoms, resulting in
   limitations in dose coefficient calculations for weakly penetrating
   radiations. In order to address the limitations of the ICRP-110
   phantoms, an ICRP Task Group has been recently formulated and the voxel
   phantoms are now being converted to a high-quality mesh format. As a
   part of the conversion project, in the present study, the skeleton
   models, one of the most important and complex organs of the body, were
   constructed. The constructed skeleton models were then tested by
   calculating red bone marrow (RBM) and endosteum dose coefficients (DCs)
   for broad parallel beams of photons and electrons and comparing the
   calculated values with those of the original ICRP-110 phantoms. The
   results show that for the photon exposures, there is a generally good
   agreement in the DCs between the mesh-type phantoms and the original
   voxel-type ICRP-110 phantoms; that is, the dose discrepancies were less
   than 7\% in all cases except for the 0.03 MeV cases, for which the
   maximum difference was 14\%. On the other hand, for the electron
   exposures (<= 4 MeV), the DCs of the mesh-type phantoms deviate from
   those of the ICRP-110 phantoms by up to similar to 1600 times at 0.03
   MeV, which is indeed due to the improvement of the skeletal anatomy of
   the developed skeleton mesh models.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report a simple and scalable soft-lithography-based templating
   technology for fabricating Au-covered oxide (titania and zirconia)
   gratings by using DVDs as a structural template. The resulting plasmonic
   gratings simultaneously exhibit very high surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) sensitivity (up to similar to 940 nm per refractive index unit, nm
   per RIU) and figure of merit (FOM, up to 62.5). The effects of thermal
   annealing of the templated oxide gratings on their final plasmonic
   properties have been systematically investigated by both experiments and
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Higher SPR
   sensitivities and slightly reduced FOMs have been observed for the
   annealed gratings. Additionally, the amplitude of the SPR dips gradually
   decreases with increasing annealing temperatures. Scanning electron
   microscopy and X-ray diffraction show that the annealing process
   enlarges the crystal domain sizes of the oxides and smoothens the final
   plasmonic grating surface. Systematic FDTD simulations reveal that the
   SPR properties (e.g., dip amplitude) of Au-covered oxide gratings are
   significantly affected by the deformation of the track-pitch structure
   caused by thermal annealing, agreeing with the experimental results. The
   outstanding SPR performance combined with the high thermal stability of
   the crystalline oxides could make the templated plasmonic gratings a
   promising SPR platform for many important sensing applications, such as
   in situ probing heterogeneous catalytic reactions under realistic
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of multilayered OLEDs with a solution processed emitting

   emission at the EML/ETL interface and energetic disorder measurements,
   it is revealed that there is an energy shift in the solution processed
   EML along with a band tail broadening compared with the device with an
   evaporated EML, resulting in inefficient hole blocking at the EML/ETL
   interface and a decrease in device efficiency. Using an ETL with a deep

Abstract = {{Aqueous solutions of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) are investigated by
   dynamic light scattering (DIS) and water penetration/wettability in
   porous hydrophobic chalk. The polydispersity index (PDI) and wettability
   are correlated with change in the population density of submicellar
   fragments. It is concluded that the number of submicellar fragments in
   aqueous surfactant solution is significantly reduced as a function of
   SDS concentration and in presence of different additives, namely sodium
   chloride (NaCl), dodecanol (C12OH) and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium
   bromide (C(12)TAB). The decrease in wettability and changes in
   polydispersity index (PDI) of micelles is correlated with the
   concentration of submicellar aggregates in aqueous solutions. The
   decrease in PDI as observed by DLS is a result of formation of stable
   micelles and subsequent reduction in population of submicellar
   aggregates. The water penetration in dustless chalk is primarily
   controlled by the rate of diffusion and subsequent adsorption of
   submicellar aggregates to the porous capillaries. With formation of
   stable micelles and reduction in number of submicellar aggregates, a
   peculiar reduction in water penetration is noted. The observed trend is
   described in terms of concentration of submicellar fragments under
   different conditions of surfactant solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this work, saturated and unsaturated structured heterogeneous sand
   columns were used to examine the fate of graphene oxide (GO)
   nanoparticles in heterogeneous porous media under various conditions. A
   two-domain model considering mass exchange between zones was applied to
   describe GO retention and transport in structured, heterogeneous porous
   media, which matched the transport experimental breakthroughs well.
   Experimental and model results showed that GO retention and transport in
   all the heterogeneous columns were dominated by the preferential flow
   phenomena. Under saturated conditions, the coarse sand with higher
   hydraulic conductivity was the fast-flow domain (FFD), and the fine sand
   was the slow-flow domain (SFD), and both FFD and SFD affected GO
   particles fate in structured heterogeneous media. When the heterogeneous
   columns were drained, the fine sand with higher moisture content became
   the FFD, and the coarse sand was the SFD, however, preferential flows in
   the FFD dominated GO retention and transport processes. For all the
   columns, the mobility of GO decreased with the increasing ionic strength
   (IS), and the previous retained particles were released by reducing
   solution IS, indicating part of the retained particles were trapped in
   the secondary minimum energy well.}},

Abstract = {{The nuclear envelope is a unique topological structure formed by lipid
   membranes in eukaryotic cells. Unlike other membrane structures, the
   nuclear envelope comprises two concentric membrane shells fused at
   numerous sites with toroid-shaped pores that impart a ``geometric{''}
   genus on the order of thousands. Despite the intriguing architecture and
   vital biological functions of the nuclear membranes, how they achieve
   and maintain such a unique arrangement remains unknown. Here, we used
   the theory of elasticity and differential geometry to analyze the
   equilibrium shape and stability of this structure. Our results show that
   modest inand out-of-plane stresses present in the membranes not only can
   define the pore geometry, but also provide a mechanism for destabilizing
   membranes beyond a critical size and set the stage for the formation of
   new pores. Our results suggest a mechanism wherein nanoscale buckling
   instabilities can define the global topology of a nuclear envelope-like
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{A large piston-displacement electrothermal micromirror with closed-loop
   control of both piston scan and tilting of the mirror plate is

   Constant scan velocity in an ultra large piston scan range has been
   demonstrated by the proposed closed-loop piston control scheme which can
   be easily implemented without considerably increasing system complexity.
   The experimental results show that the usable linear scan range
   generated by the micromirror has been extended up to 505 mu m. The
   measured spectral resolution in a compact spectrometer reaches 20
   cm(-1), or 0.57 nm at 532 nm wavelength. Compared to other presented
   systems, this microspectrometer will benefit from the closed-loop
   thermal actuator approach utilizing both the piston servo and tilt
   control to provide more consistent spectral response, improved spectral
   resolution and enhanced robustness to disturbances. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{Objective. Lost sensations, such as touch, could one day be restored by
   electrical stimulation along the sensory neural pathways. Such
   stimulation, when informed by electronic sensors, could provide
   naturalistic cutaneous and proprioceptive feedback to the user.
   Perceptually, microstimulation of somatosensory brain regions produces
   localized, modality-specific sensations, and several spatiotemporal
   parameters have been studied for their discernibility. However,
   systematic methods for encoding a wide array of naturally occurring
   stimuli into biomimetic percepts via multi-channel microstimulation are
   lacking. More specifically, generating spatiotemporal patterns for
   explicitly evoking naturalistic neural activation has not yet been
   explored. Approach. We address this problem by first modeling the
   dynamical input-output relationship between multichannel
   microstimulation and downstream neural responses, and then optimizing
   the input pattern to reproduce naturally occurring touch responses as
   closely as possible. Main results. Here we show that such optimization
   produces responses in the S1 cortex of the anesthetized rat that are
   highly similar to natural, tactile-stimulus-evoked counterparts.
   Furthermore, information on both pressure and location of the touch
   stimulus was found to be highly preserved. Significance. Our results
   suggest that the currently presented stimulus optimization approach
   holds great promise for restoring naturalistic levels of sensation.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile crowdsourcing (MC) is a transformative paradigm that engages a
   crowd of mobile users (i.e., workers) in the act of collecting,
   analyzing, and disseminating information or sharing their resources. To
   ensure quality of service, MC platforms tend to recommend MC tasks to
   workers based on their context information extracted from their
   interactions and smart-phone sensors. This raises privacy concerns hard
   to address due to the constrained resources on mobile devices. In this
   paper, we identify fundamental tradeoffs among three metrics-utility,
   privacy, and efficiency-in an MC system and propose a flexible
   optimization framework that can be adjusted to any desired tradeoff
   point with joint efforts of MC platform and workers. Since the
   underlying optimization problems are NP-hard, we present efficient
   approximation algorithms to solve them. Since worker statistics are
   needed when tuning the optimization models, we use an efficient
   aggregation approach to collecting worker feedbacks while providing
   differential privacy guarantees. Both numerical evaluations and
   performance analysis are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed framework.}},

Title = {{Pyrophosphate Sensor Based on Principal Component Analysis of Conjugated
   Polyelectrolyte Fluorescence}},
Journal = {{ACS Omega}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{648-655}},

Abstract = {{The pyrophosphate anion (PPi) plays an important role in biochemical
   processes. Therefore, a simple but reliable analytical technique is
   essential for selective detection of PPi in biochemical systems. Here,
   we present a principal component analysis (PCA) method for analytical
   determination of PPi concentration using a fluorescent conjugated
   polyelectrolyte (CPE) combined with a polyamine modifier. The CPE has
   anionic side chains and dissolves molecularly in water, as indicated by
   its structured fluorescence emission spectrum. However, addition of
   tris(3-aminoethyl) amine (tetraamine or N4) quenches the CPE
   fluorescence emission. Tetraamine, which is a polycation at neutral pH,
   binds multiple anionic CPE chains, leading to aggregate formation,
   resulting in aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching. Addition of PPi
   to the polymer-amine aggregate reverses the process, resulting in
   fluorescence recovery. The relatively higher concentration of PPi
   compared to that of the polymer allows it to effectively compete to bind
   the amine, thus releasing molecularly dissolved polymer chains.
   Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of the P1/N4 complex and of
   P1/N4/PPi confirms the change in size of the CPE aggregates that occurs
   upon reversible aggregation. Application of PCA to the fluorescence
   emission data set of standard samples yields two principal components,
   which are used to create a predictive model for PPi analysis. The PCA
   method is able to directly determine the concentration of PPi with
   approximately 95\% accuracy within the concentration range from 100 mu M
   to 3 mM, without the need for a reference state as is typically needed
   for ratiometric fluorescence assays.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency spectra and timing patterns of brief, 1-10 ms broadband sound
   impulses produced by movement and feeding activities of Prostephanus
   truncatus and Sitophilus zeamais last instars and adults in maize were
   investigated to find spectral and temporal pattern information useful
   for distinguishing among these species and stages. The impulse spectra
   were categorized into five different types of frequency patterns
   (profiles), designated Broadband, HighF, MidF1, MidF2 and LowF to
   indicate differences in their peak energies and broadness of frequency
   range. Groups (trains) of three or more closely spaced impulses, termed
   bursts, were observed to occur frequently in all recordings, as has been
   reported for sounds produced by other insects. Mean rates of bursts,
   mean counts of impulses per burst, and mean rates of impulses in bursts
   were calculated and compared among the two species and stages. The
   counts of broadband and MidF2 impulses per burst and the rates of
   broadband and MidF2 impulses in bursts were significantly different for
   adult than for 4th instar S. zeamais and either stage of P. truncatus.
   These findings can be useful in developing an acoustic sensor system for
   automated detection of hidden insects including P. truncatus and S.
   zeamais in bulk storage warehouses. The findings are discussed in
   relation to different movement and feeding behavior patterns that have
   been identified in these important pests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, a genetic algorithm (GA) with priority-based
   representation is proposed for a flexible job shop scheduling problem
   (FJSP) which is one of the hardest operations research problems.
   Investigating the effect of the proposed representation schema on FJSP
   is the main contribution to the literature. The priority of each
   operation is represented by a gene on the chromosome which is used by a
   constructive algorithm performed for decoding. All active schedules,
   which constitute a subset of feasible schedules including the optimal,
   can be generated by the constructive algorithm. To obtain improved
   solutions, iterated local search (ILS) is applied to the chromosomes at
   the end of each reproduction process. The most widely used FJSP data
   sets generated in the literature are used for benchmarking and
   evaluating the performance of the proposed GA methodology. The
   computational results show that the proposed GA performed at the same
   level or better with respect to the makespan for some data sets when
   compared to the results from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Contact lenses for ophthalmic drug delivery have become very popular,
   due to their unique advantages like extended wear and more than 50\%
   bioavailability. To achieve controlled and sustained drug delivery from
   contact lenses, researchers are working on various systems like
   polymeric nanoparticles, microemulsion, micelle, liposomes, use of
   vitamin E, etc. Numerous scientists are working on different areas of
   therapeutic contact lenses to treat ocular diseases by implementing
   techniques like soaking method, molecular imprinting, entrapment of
   drugladen colloidal nanoparticles, drug plate/film, ion ligand polymeric
   systems, supercritical fluid technology, etc. Though sustained drug
   delivery was achieved using contact lens, the critical properties such
   as water content, tensile strength (mechanical properties), ion
   permeability, transparency and oxygen permeability were altered, which
   limit the commercialization of therapeutic contact lenses. Also issues
   like drug stability during processing/fabrication (drug integrity test),
   zero order release kinetics (prevent burst release), drug release during
   monomer extraction step after fabrication (to remove un-reacted
   monomers), protein adherence, drug release during storage in packaging
   solution, shelf life study, cost-benefit analysis, etc. are still to be
   addressed. This review provides an expert opinion on different
   methodology to develop therapeutic contact lenses with special remark of
   their advantages and limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Single phase Cu2O films have been prepared via an electrodeposition
   technique onto ITO glass substrates at room temperature. Likewise, Cu2O
   films were deposited using a potentiostatic process from an alkaline
   electrolyte containing copper (II) nitrate and 1 M sodium citrate.
   Single phase Cu2O films were electrodeposited at a cathodic deposition
   potential of -500 mV for a reaction period of 90 min, and pH of 12 to
   yield a film thickness of 0.49 mu m. The mechanism for nucleation of
   Cu2O films was found to vary with deposition potential. Applying the
   Scharifi<er and Hills model at -500 and -600 mV to describe the
   mechanism of nucleation for the electrochemical reaction, the nucleation
   mechanism consisted of a mix between instantaneous and progressive
   growth mechanisms at -500 mV, while above -600 mV the growth mechanism
   was instantaneous. Using deposition times from 30 to 90 min at -500 mV
   deposition potential, pure Cu2O films with different microstructures
   were electrodeposited. Changing the deposition time from 30 to 90 min
   varied the microstructure from cubic to more complex polyhedra. The
   transmittance of electrodeposited Cu2O films ranged from 20 to 70\% in
   visible range, and samples exhibited a 2.4 eV band gap. The electrical
   resistivity for electrodeposited Cu2O films was found to decrease with
   increasing deposition time from 0.854 x 10(5) Omega-cm at 30 min to
   0.221 x 10(5) Omega-cm at 90 min without any thermal treatment following
   the electrodeposition process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The spread of virus-induced infectious diseases through airborne routes
   of transmission is a global concern for economic and medical reasons. To
   study virus transmission, it is essential to have an effective aerosol
   collector such as the growth tube collector (GTC) system that utilizes
   water-based condensation for collecting virus-containing aerosols. In
   this work, we characterized the GTC system using bacteriophage MS2 as a
   surrogate for a small RNA virus. We investigated using RNA extraction
   and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to study
   the total virus collection efficiency of the GTC system. Plaque assays
   were also used to enumerate viable viruses collected by the GTC system
   compared to that by a commercially available apparatus, the SKC (R)
   Biosampler. The plaque assay counts were used to enumerate viable
   viruses whereas RT-PCR provides a total virus count, including those
   viruses inactivated during collection. The effects of relative humidity
   (RH) and other conditions on collection efficiency were also
   investigated. Our results suggest that the GTC has a collection
   efficiency for viable viruses between 0.24 and 1.8\% and a total virus
   collection efficiency between 18.3 and 79.0\%, which is 1-2 orders of
   magnitude higher than that of the SKC (R) Biosampler. Moreover, higher
   RH significantly increases both the viable and total collection
   efficiency of the GTC, while its effect on the collection efficiency of
   the SKC (R) Biosampler is not significant.}},

Title = {{Undergraduate Students' Beliefs about Engineering Problem Solving}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background Problem solving is considered to be a central activity of
   engineering practice. While some studies have shown how various beliefs
   affect students' abilities to solve problems, studies are needed that
   explicitly examine the beliefs and assumptions students bring to the
   problem-solving process.
   Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this qualitative research was to
   describe students' engineering problem-solving processes and develop a
   conceptual model that illustrates students' beliefs about problem
   solving. Our research question was, What beliefs do students have about
   engineering problem solving?
   Design/Method We analyzed data from retrospective semistructured
   interviews carried out after a problem-solving session. We interviewed
   nine engineering students about the processes they used to solve the
   problems and the assumptions and beliefs that guided their problem
   solving. We then used grounded theory to identify and analyze statements
   from the interviews and to develop a conceptual model of student
   beliefs.
   Results The resulting model has five major categories: the
   problem-solving process itself, the role of classroom problems, the role
   of workplace problems, personal characteristics that affect problem
   solving, and resources that assist problem solving. Students identify a
   sharp distinction between classroom problems and workplace problems.
   Conclusions Our conceptual model provides an initial framework for
   understanding how students' beliefs affect their approaches to
   engineering problems. In contrast to stage models, our model shows that
   students' epistemic beliefs about problem solving are contextual. Future
   work is needed to understand the limits and extend the applicability of
   our model.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Using an automated data processing algorithm, we examined electric field
   records of 5498 negative cloud-to-ground flashes reported by the U.S.
   National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) within 50 to 500 km of the
   Lightning Observatory in Gainesville (LOG), Florida. Out of the 5498
   flashes, 3496 (64\%) had detectable preliminary breakdown (PB) pulse
   trains. Only 3077 flashes with a single PB pulse train and NLDN-reported
   first-return-stroke (RS) peak current >= 50 kA were selected for
   detailed analysis. The arithmetic mean values of PB pulse train
   duration, PB-RS interval, and PB/RS pulse peak ratio were 2.7 ms, 8.8
   ms, and 0.15, respectively. The PB-RS interval was found to decrease
   with increasing RS peak current (Spearman correlation coefficient was
   statistically significant and equal to 0.80). The range-normalized PB
   pulse peak exhibited statistically significant positive correlation with
   the RS peak current, with Spearman correlation coefficient being 0.48.
   Thus, it appears that the high-intensity (>= 50 kA) negative lightning
   is characterized by shorter (and, by inference, faster) stepped leaders
   and more pronounced PB pulse trains.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Solute diffusive exchange between low-permeability aquitards and
   high-permeability aquifers acts as a significant mediator of long-term
   contaminant fate. Aquifer contaminants diffuse into aquitards, but as
   contaminant sources are depleted, aquifer concentrations decline,
   triggering back diffusion from aquitards. The dynamics of the
   contaminant source depletion, or the source strength function, controls
   the timing of the transition of aquitards from sinks to sources. Here,
   we experimentally evaluate three archetypical transient source depletion
   models (step-change, linear, and,exponential), and we use novel
   analytical solutions to accurately account for dynamic aquitard-aquifer
   diffusive transfer. Laboratory diffusion experiments were conducted
   using a well controlled flow chamber to assess solute exchange between
   sand aquifer and kaolinite aquitard layers. Solute concentration
   profiles in the aquitard were measured in situ using electrical
   conductivity. Back diffusion was shown to begin earlier and produce
   larger mass flux for rapidly depleting sources. The analytical models
   showed very good correspondence with measured aquifer breakthrough
   curves and aquitard concentration profiles. The modeling approach links
   source dissolution and back diffusion, enabling assessment of human
   exposure risk and calculation of the back diffusion initiation time, as
   well as the resulting plume persistence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Lignin-based pH-responsive nanocapsules were successfully fabricated via
   an interfacial miniemulsion polymerization. Lignin was first grafted
   with allyl groups through etherification and further dispersed in an
   oil-in-water (O/W) miniemulsion system via ultrasonication. Then
   allyl-functionalized lignin was reacted with a thiol-based cross-linking
   agent in the interfaces of miniemulsion droplets to form nano capsules
   via a thiol-ene radical reaction. The FTIR and H-1 NMR spectra indicated
   the successful grafting of allyl groups on lignin. TEM images showed
   that lignin nanocapsules had particle sizes ranging from 50 to 300 nm.
   These newly synthesized nanocapsules could be readily loaded with
   hydrophobic coumarin-6 during the preparation of a miniemulsion system
   with 0.713 mmol/g entrapment efficiency. Moreover, the release of
   encapsulated coumarin-6 could be controlled by varying pH in the
   solution due to the existence of acid-labile beta-thiopropionate
   cross-linkages in the capsule shell. An approximately linear release
   profile was observed at pH 7.4, whereas the release followed a
   Korsmeyer-Peppas profile at pH 4. The syntheses of lignin-based
   nanocapsules not only provide a facile approach to utilize the waste
   biomaterials from biorefinery industries, but also have great potential
   for applications in a controllable delivery of hydrophobic molecules
   such as drugs, essential oils, antioxidants, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Global navigation satellite systems-reflectometry (GNSS-R) is an
   emerging remote sensing technique that makes use of navigation signals
   as signals of opportunity in a multistatic radar configuration, with as
   many transmitters as navigation satellites are in view. GNSS-R
   sensitivity to soil moisture has already been proven from ground-based
   and airborne experiments, but studies using space-borne data are still
   preliminary due to the limited amount of data, collocation, footprint
   heterogeneity, etc. This study presents a sensitivity study of
   TechDemoSat-1 GNSS-R data to soil moisture over different types of
   surfaces (i.e., vegetation covers) and for a wide range of soil moisture
   and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values. Despite the
   scattering in the data, which can be largely attributed to the
   delay-Doppler maps peak variance, the temporal and spatial (footprint
   size) collocation mismatch with the SMOS soil moisture, and MODIS NDVI
   vegetation data, and land use data, experimental results for low NDVI
   values show a large sensitivity to soil moisture and a relatively good
   Pearson correlation coefficient. As the vegetation cover increases (NDVI
   increases) the reflectivity, the sensitivity to soil moisture and the
   Pearson correlation coefficient decreases, but it is still significant.}},

Abstract = {{The crystallization mechanisms for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)(3) (LATP) glass
   ceramics were studied using thermophysical property characterization
   techniques. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed two
   separate exothermic events that were ascribed to the initial growth and
   growth to coherency of a dendritic phase. It was found that the commonly
   used Johnson-Mehl-Avrami is not a suitable kinetic model for this
   material. Rather, the Sestak-Berggren (SB) autocatalytic kinetic model
   was used to analyze the DSC data and the activation energy for initial
   growth (259 kJ/mol) and coherency (272 kJ/mol) was calculated using
   isoconversional methods. The calculated parameters for the SB model were
   used to compare experimental and calculated values for heat flow during
   the crystallization of LATP and good fits were found for both exothermic
   events.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into mechanical properties and amorphization behavior
   of ultrafine-grained (0.3 mu m) boron carbide (B4C) is conducted and
   compared to a baseline coarse-grained (10 mu m) boron carbide. Static
   and dynamic uniaxial compressive strength, and static and dynamic
   Vickers indentation hardness were determined, and Raman spectroscopy was
   then conducted on indented regions to quantify and compare the intensity
   of amorphization. In relation to coarse-grained B4C the
   ultrafine-grained material exhibited, on average, a 33\% higher static
   compressive strength, 20\% higher dynamic compressive strength, 10\%
   higher static Vickers hardness, and 23\% higher dynamic Vickers
   hardness. In addition, there was an 18\% reduction in
   indentation-induced radial crack length in ultrafine-grained B4C, which
   corresponded to an increase in estimated fracture toughness. Although
   traditional coarse-grained B4C exhibits an 8.6\% decrease in hardness
   from the static to dynamic regimes, ultrafine-grained B4C showed only
   negligible change under similar conditions, suggesting a reduced
   propensity for amorphization. Raman spectroscopic analysis confirmed
   this result by revealing significantly lower amorphization intensity in
   ultrafine-B4C compared to coarse-grained B4C. These results may have
   significant positive implications in the implementation of
   ultrafine-grained boron carbide as a material for improved performance
   in impact and other high-pressure applications.}},

Title = {{Structural Changes in 2D BiSe Bilayers as n Increases in
   (BiSe)(1+delta)(NbSe2)(n) (n=1-4) Heterostructures}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{(BiSe)(1+delta)(NbSe2)(n) heterostructures with n = 1-4 were synthesized
   using modulated elemental reactants. The BiSe bilayer structure changed
   from a rectangular basal plane with n = 1 to a square basal plane for n
   = 2-4. The BiSe in-plane structure was also influenced by small changes
   in the structure of the precursor, without significantly changing the
   out-of-plane diffraction pattern or value of the misfit parameter, S.
   Density functional theory calculations on isolated BiSe bilayers showed
   that its lattice is very flexible, which may explain its readiness to
   adjust shape and size depending on the environment. Correlated with the
   changes in the BiSe basal plane structure, analysis of scanning
   transmission electron microscope images revealed that the occurrence of
   antiphase boundaries, found throughout the n = 1 compound, is
   dramatically reduced for the n = 2-4 compounds. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy measurements showed that the Bi 5d(3/2), 5.d(5/2) doublet
   peaks narrowed toward higher binding energies as n increased from 1 to
   2, also consistent with a reduction in the number of antiphase
   boundaries. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and Hall
   coefficient measurements of nominally stoichiometric samples in
   conjunction with structural refinements and XPS data suggest a constant
   amount of interlayer charge transfer independent of n. Constant
   interlayer charge transfer is surprising given the changes in the BiSe
   in-plane structure. The structural flexibility of the BiSe layer may be
   useful in designing multiple constituent heterostructures as an
   interlayer between structurally dissimilar constituents.}},

Abstract = {{The grouping problem in RFID systems is to efficiently group all tags
   according to a given partition such that tags in the same group will
   have the same group ID. Unlike previous research on unicast transmission
   from a reader to a tag, grouping provides a fundamental mechanism for
   efficient multicast transmissions and aggregate queries in large
   RFID-enabled applications. A message can be transmitted to a group of
   tags simultaneously in multicast, which improves the efficiency by times
   when comparing with unicast. This paper studies this practically
   important but not yet thoroughly investigated grouping problem in large
   RFID system. We start with a straightforward solution called the
   Enhanced Polling Grouping (EPG) protocol. We then propose a
   time-efficient Filter Grouping (FIG) protocol that uses Bloom filters to
   remove the costly ID transmissions. We point out the limitation of the
   Bloom-filter based solution due to its intrinsic false positive problem,
   which leads to our final ConCurrent Grouping (CCG) protocol. With a
   drastically different design, CCG is able to outperform FIG by
   exploiting collisions to inform multiple tags of their group ID
   simultaneously and by removing any wasteful slots in its frame-based
   execution. We further enhance CCG to make it perform better with very
   large groups. Simulation results demonstrate that our best protocol CCG
   can reduce the execution time by a factor of 11 when comparing with a
   baseline polling protocol.}},

Abstract = {{In an energy harvesting vehicular network, efficient file transfer
   between two charging stations is challenging due to the lack of
   communication infrastructure. Naturally, a source station can allocate
   the packets to a set of vehicles, which serve as relays to
   opportunistically deliver these packets to the destination station while
   performing their own tasks. In this paper, we show that, with
   packet-level erasure coding (e.g., fountain codes), only a few redundant
   packets are required to achieve a significant reduction in file delay.
   As more redundant packets are added, however, the file delay improvement
   diminishes, and the storage cost rises. In both the single and
   multiple-destination scenarios, the fundamental tradeoffs between coding
   and file delay are characterized. For the multiple-destination scenario,
   there exists a unique and optimal coding rate that minimizes the average
   file delay. We propose a greedy algorithm that can achieve this minimum
   delay in practice. Finally, the proposed tradeoffs are verified through
   intensive numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decades many companies have to retrieve and treat their
   end-of-use products when products leave their end users in order to
   contribute to environmental protection and avoid defiance of relevant
   legislations. The utilization of returned products in a proper way is
   the best choice to conform to the above requirement, and save the cost
   in the production and maintenance process as well. With the development
   of information technologies, especially the internet of things used in
   product life cycle data management, the product life cycle information
   can be tracked, detected, stored and used in the returned product
   process. In this paper, an integer linear programming model is presented
   based on the detail product information for the optimization of
   procurement, manufacturing, recovering and disposal decisions. The model
   considers three recovery options, several value levels of returns and
   the value deterioration during the processing time period in order to
   satisfy the products and components demand in the production planning. A
   numerical example and sensitivity analysis are used to illustrate the
   performance and applicability of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Bamboo was used as feedstock to prepare low-cost and effective
   biosorbents to remove a hydrophilic ionic liquid,
   1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride ({[}BMIM]{[}Cl]), from aqueous
   solutions. The results showed that modified biochar (BB-K-N) had better
   adsorption performance than both pristine biochar (BB) and intermediate
   biochar (BB-K) toward {[}BMIM]{[}0]. Characterization of `the
   biosorbents showed that BB-K-N had high surface areas, large pore
   volume, large micropore volume, and abundant oxygen containing
   functional groups. Microporous structure provided appropriate pore
   space, polar groups on adsorbent surface displayed strong interactions
   with the adsorbate, which facilitated adsorption of {[}BMIM{[}Cl]. The
   sorption experimental data of BB-K-N were described the best by the
   pseudo-second order model and the Freundlich model. In addition to their
   good sorptive properties, the exhausted adsorbents were regenerated
   effectively by 0.1 mol/l HCl. Furthermore, adsorption of {[}BMIM]{[}Cl]
   on the modified biochar greatly reduced its biological toxicity towards
   seedlings growth. The seedings growth of {[}BMIM]{[}Cl]-laden BB-K-N
   group were similar to that of control groups. (C) 2016 Taiwan Institute

Abstract = {{A Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) that incorporates a closed-loop
   controlled, electrothermally actuated microelectromechanical systems
   (MEMS) micromirror is proposed and experimentally verified. The scan
   range and the tilting angle of the mirror plate are the two critical
   parameters for MEMS-based FTS. In this work, the MEMS mirror with a
   footprint of 4.3 mm x 3.1 mm is based on a modified lateral-shift-free
   (LSF) bimorph actuator design with large piston and reduced tilting.
   Combined with a position-sensitive device (PSD) for tilt angle sensing,
   the feedback controlled MEMS mirror generates a 430 mu m stable linear
   piston scan with the mirror plate tilting angle less than +/- 0.002
   degrees. The usable piston scan range is increased to 78\% of the MEMS
   mirror's full scan capability, and a spectral resolution of 0.55 nm at
   531.9 nm wavelength, has been achieved. It is a significant improvement
   compared to the prior work.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of balancing diversity and performance in
   surrogate-based global optimization when we look for two diverse
   competitive designs. A previous formulation that maximizes the average
   performance of the two designs with constraint on diversity is compared
   to a new formulation that maximizes diversity for a given loss in
   performance with respect to a single global optimum. The loss in
   performance is estimated using the surrogate. Three test functions are
   used to compare the curves of diversity vs. performance obtained from
   the two formulations. Significantly, for the examples, the search for
   the two diverse designs produced also designs much closer in performance
   to the global optimum than the two designs satisfying the diversity
   constraint or goal. Therefore, if three designs are accepted as the
   outcome of the search, the loss of performance may be drastically
   reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Crop models are important tools for impact assessment of climate change,
   as well as for exploring management options under current climate. It is
   essential to evaluate the uncertainty associated with predictions of
   these models. We compare two criteria of prediction error; MSEPfixed,
   which evaluates mean squared error of prediction for a model with fixed
   structure, parameters and inputs, and MSEPuncertain(X), which evaluates
   mean squared error averaged over the distributions of model structure,
   inputs and parameters. Comparison of model outputs with data can be used
   to estimate the former. The latter has a squared bias term, which can be
   estimated using hindcasts, and a model variance term, which can be
   estimated from a simulation experiment. The separate contributions to
   MSEPuncertain (X) can be estimated using a random effects ANOVA. It is
   argued that MSEPuncertain (X) is the more informative uncertainty
   criterion, because it is specific to each prediction situation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Actigraphy has attracted much attention for assessing physical activity
   in the past decade. Many algorithms have been developed to automate the
   analysis process, but none has targeted a general model to discover
   related features for detecting or predicting mobility function, or more
   specifically, mobility impairment and major mobility disability (MMD).
   Men (N = 357) and women (N = 778) aged 70-89 years wore a tri-axial
   accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X) on the right hip during free-living
   conditions for 8.4 +/- 3.0 d. One-second epoch data were summarized into
   67 features. Several machine learning techniques were used to select
   features from the free-living condition to predict mobility impairment,
   defined as 400 m walking speed <0.80 m s(-1). Selected features were
   also included in a model to predict the first occurrence of MMD-defined
   as the loss in the ability to walk 400 m. Each method yielded a similar
   estimate of 400 m walking speed with a root mean square error of similar
   to 0.07 m s(-1) and an R-squared values ranging from 0.37-0.41.
   Sensitivity and specificity of identifying slow walkers was
   approximately 70\% and 80\% for all methods, respectively. The top five
   features, which were related to movement pace and amount (activity
   counts and steps), length in activity engagement (bout length),
   accumulation patterns of activity, and movement variability
   significantly improved the prediction of MMD beyond that found with
   common covariates (age, diseases, anthropometry, etc). This study
   identified a subset of actigraphy features collected in free-living
   conditions that are moderately accurate in identifying persons with
   clinically-assessed mobility impaired and significantly improve the
   prediction of MMD. These findings suggest that the combination of
   features as opposed to a specific feature is important to consider when
   choosing features and/or combinations of features for prediction of
   mobility phenotypes in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Ride-sourcing refers to an emerging urban mobility service that private
   car owners drive their own vehicles to provide for-hire rides. This
   paper analyzes the ride-sourcing market using an aggregate model where
   the matchings between customers and drivers are captured by an exogenous
   matching function. It is found that without any regulatory intervention
   a monopoly ride-sourcing platform will maximize the joint profit with
   its drivers. On the other hand, the first-best solution is not
   sustainable when the matching function exhibits increasing returns to
   scale and the cost function of the platform is subject to economies of
   scale. Regardless of the examined market scenarios, the average waiting
   time of customers is proportional to the average searching time of
   drivers. We establish conditions for regulators to solely regulate the
   commission charged by the platform to guarantee the second-beSt. We
   further investigate the competition of ride-sourcing platforms and find
   that competition does not necessarily lower the price level or improve
   social welfare. In the latter case, regulators may rather encourage the
   merger of the platforms and regulate them directly as a monopolist. (C)

Abstract = {{Behavioral evidence from phylogenetically diverse animals and from
   humans suggests that, by extracting temporal information inherent in the
   olfactory signal, olfaction is more involved in interpreting space and
   time than heretofore imagined. If this is the case, the olfactory system
   must have neural mechanisms capable of encoding time at intervals
   relevant to the turbulent odor world in which many animals live. Here,
   we review evidence that animals can use populations of rhythmically
   active or `bursting' olfactory receptor neurons (bORNs) to extract and
   encode temporal information inherent in natural olfactory signals. We
   postulate that bORNs represent an unsuspected neural mechanism through
   which time can be accurately measured, and that `smelling time'
   completes the requirements for true olfactory scene analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The demands of tissue engineering have driven a tremendous amount of
   research effort in 3D tissue culture technology and, more recently, in
   3D printing. The need to use 3D tissue culture techniques more broadly
   in all of cell biology is well-recognized, but the transition to 3D has
   been impeded by the convenience, effectiveness, and ubiquity of 2D
   culture materials, assays, and protocols, as well as the lack of 3D
   counterparts of these tools. Interestingly, progress and discoveries in
   3D bioprinting research may provide the technical support needed to grow
   the practice of 3D culture. Here we investigate an integrated approach
   for 3D printing multicellular structures while using the same platform
   for 3D cell culture, experimentation, and assay development. We employ a
   liquid-like solid (LLS) material made from packed granular-scale
   microgels, which locally and temporarily fluidizes under the focused
   application of stress and spontaneously solidifies after the applied
   stress is removed. These rheological properties enable 3D printing of
   multicellular structures as well as the growth and expansion of cellular
   structures or dispersed cells. The transport properties of LLS allow
   molecular diffusion for the delivery of nutrients or small molecules for
   fluorescence-based assays. Here, we measure viability of 11 different
   cell types in the LLS medium, we 3D print numerous structures using
   several of these cell types, and we explore the transport properties in
   molecular time-release assays.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid instabilities limit the ability of features to hold their shape in
   many types of 3D printing as liquid inks solidify into written
   structures. By 3D printing directly into a continuum of jammed granular
   microgels, these instabilities are circumvented by eliminating surface
   tension and body forces. However, this type of 3D printing process is
   potentially limited by inertial instabilities if performed at high
   speeds where turbulence may destroy features as they are written. Here,
   we design and test a high-speed 3D printing experimental system to
   identify the instabilities that arise when an injection nozzle
   translates at 1 m/s. We find that the viscosity of the injected material
   can control the Reynold's instability, and we discover an additional,
   unanticipated instability near the top surface of the granular microgel
   medium.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of muscle forces during motion involves solving an
   indeterminate problem (more unknown muscle forces than joint moment
   constraints), frequently via optimization methods. When the dynamics of
   muscle activation and contraction are modeled for consistency with
   muscle physiology, the resulting optimization problem is dynamic and
   challenging to solve. This study sought to identify a robust and
   computationally efficient formulation for solving these dynamic
   optimization problems using direct collocation optimal control methods.
   Four problem formulations were investigated for walking based on both a
   two and three dimensional model. Formulations differed in the use of
   either an explicit or implicit representation of contraction dynamics
   with either muscle length or tendon force as a state variable. The
   implicit representations introduced additional controls defined as the
   time derivatives of the states, allowing the nonlinear equations
   describing contraction dynamics to be imposed as algebraic path
   constraints, simplifying their evaluation. Problem formulation affected
   computational speed and robustness to the initial guess. The formulation
   that used explicit contraction dynamics with muscle length as a state
   failed to converge in most cases. In contrast, the two formulations that
   used implicit contraction dynamics converged to an optimal solution in
   all cases for all initial guesses, with tendon force as a state
   generally being the fastest. Future work should focus on comparing the
   present approach to other approaches for computing muscle forces. The
   present approach lacks some of the major limitations of established
   methods such as static optimization and computed muscle control while
   remaining computationally efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Many dynamic events exist in real manufacturing systems, such as
   arbitrary machine breakdowns and dynamic job arrivals, which makes the
   scheduling problem even more complicated. In this paper, we address a
   serial-batching scheduling problem with the above dynamic events. Jobs
   need to be processed on the serial-batching machines of two
   manufacturers and then transported by vehicles to a customer for further
   processing. The objective of the scheduling problem is to minimize the
   makespan, and the problem is proved to be strongly NP-hard. Some
   structural properties and a lower bound of the problem are also proved
   or derived. On the basis of job arrival times, we divide the problem
   into two phases and propose different rules regarding these two phases.
   Based on these properties and rules, a heuristic algorithm is developed
   to solve the problem and its worst case performance is analyzed. The
   heuristic algorithm is tested on a large set of randomly generated
   problem instances, and the relative gaps between the found lower bound
   and the solutions of the proposed heuristic algorithm are reported. The
   experimental results illustrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of
   the proposed heuristic algorithm compared with other four classic
   approaches.}},

Title = {{Femoral sizer design can increase anterior notching during total knee
   arthroplasty}},
Journal = {{KNEE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background: The anteroposterior (AP) portions of the distal femur are
   generally resected externally rotated relative to the posterior condylar
   line (PCL) in non-navigated/measured-resection total knee arthroplasty
   (TKA). Some femoral sizing devices allow rotational adjustment before
   sizing (rotation-modified sizing devices), while others do not
   (rotation-unmodified sizing devices). When rotation-unmodified sizing
   devices are used, the stylus attached to the sizing device identifies
   the proximal/anterior flange cut assuming the femoral component is
   aligned parallel to the PCL. However, if the AP cutting device is
   externally rotated then unexpected notching of the anterior cortex can
   occur.
   Methods: We simulated TKA surgery in 100 Japanese yams osteoarthritic
   knees using three-dimensional planning software. The femoral component
   was aligned parallel to the PCL and the AP component position was
   determined so proximal anterior flange was just touching the anterior
   cortex. Next, the femoral component was externally rotated parallel to
   the surgical epicondylar axis (SEA). If the proximal anterior flange
   penetrated femoral bone, the length and thickness of anterior notching
   were measured.
   Results: The proximal anterior flange rested on the anterior cortex or
   penetrated the femoral bone in all knees. There was a strong positive
   correlation between PCA and length of anterior notching. Anterior
   notching more than 10 mm length or one-millimeter thickness occurred in
   most cases (82.4\% and 70.6\%, respectively) where the posterior
   condylar angle (PCA) was more than four degrees.
   Conclusions: Anterior femoral notching is influenced by the design of
   the femoral sizing guide and subsequent rotation of cutting blocks,
   especially in knees with a large PCA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Deep hierarchical representations of the data have been found out to
   provide better informative features for several machine learning
   applications. In addition, multilayer neural networks surprisingly tend
   to achieve better performance when they are subject to an unsupervised
   pretraining. The booming of deep learning motivates researchers to
   identify the factors that contribute to its success. One possible reason
   identified is the flattening of manifold-shaped data in higher layers of
   neural networks. However, it is not clear how to measure the flattening
   of such manifold-shaped data and what amount of flattening a deep neural
   network can achieve. For the first time, this paper provides
   quantitative evidence to validate the flattening hypothesis. To achieve
   this, we propose a few quantities for measuring manifold entanglement
   under certain assumptions and conduct experiments with both synthetic
   and real-world data. Our experimental results validate the proposition
   and lead to new insights on deep learning.}},

Title = {{Experimental and Numerical Evaluation of Unbonded Posttensioning Tendons
   Subjected to Wire Breaks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The development of corrosion as a result of tendon exposure to moisture
   or corrosive media often leads to wire fractures. Such fractures in
   unbonded tendons are expected to induce global strand and anchor
   response through the progression of prestress loss from the break to the
   end anchors. Radial pressure, interwire friction, and lateral
   confinement, however, affect the magnitude of prestress loss carried to
   the anchors and have important implications on breakage detectability by
   tendon monitoring methods that rely on anchor response. This paper
   presents an experimental investigation of tendon behavior after
   successive wire cuts in confined and unconfined conditions and
   demonstrates the effects of confinement on stress recovery. In addition
   to analysis of strand prestress loss and axial strain along individual
   wires, the strand's dynamic postbreakage response was examined.
   Moreover, the effects of deviators on stress recovery were tested with a
   multistrand tendon specimen. A finite-element model of a seven-wire
   strand was developed and experimentally validated. Both experimental and
   numerical results showed significant prestress loss even at distant
   locations from wire breaks and confirm a correlation between wire
   breakage and modal properties, which can be a useful damage indicator.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new class of algorithms for solving the
   mixed-integer bilevel min-max optimization problem. This problem
   involves two players, a leader and a follower, who play a Stackelberg
   game. In particular, the leader seeks to minimize over a set of discrete
   variables the maximum objective that the follower can achieve. The
   complicating features of our problem are that a subset of the follower's
   decisions are restricted to be integer-valued, and that the follower's
   decisions are constrained by the leader's decisions. We first describe
   several bilevel min-max programs that can be used to obtain lower and
   upper bounds on the optimal objective value of the problem. We then
   present algorithms for this problem that finitely terminate with an
   optimal solution when the leader variables are restricted to take binary
   values. Finally, we report the results of a computational study aimed at
   evaluating the quality of our algorithms on two families of randomly
   generated problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the investigation outcomes of the recent Super
   Typhoon Haiyan (also known as Hurricane Yolanda) in the Philippines
   using a basic structure damage rating technique. The rating technique
   ranked damaged conditions based on a 0 to 3 rating. A total of 156
   structures were analyzed using the rating technique. Unlike previously
   published condition ratings, the technique does not include functional
   assessments such as mechanical and electrical systems and does not
   directly consider habitant safety nor costs to structure. The intent of
   the rating is to provide a quantitative measure of the effects of
   Haiyan. The outcomes indicate that wind damage dominated as the major
   cause of failures (53\%) and that roof damage is the most significant of
   the damage modes (21\%). The rating gives a first-order assessment of
   the damaged conditions of the structures pertaining to the loading
   effects (wind, water or storm surge, or combined) from Super Typhoon
   Haiyan. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Muscle damage is currently assessed through methods such as muscle
   biopsy, serum biomarkers, functional testing, and imaging procedures,
   each with its own inherent limitations, and a pressing need for a safe,
   repeatable, inexpensive, and noninvasive modality to assess the state of
   muscle health remains. Our aim was to develop and assess near-infrared
   (NIR) optical imaging as a novel noninvasive method of detecting and
   quantifying muscle damage. An immobilization-reambulation model was used
   for inducing muscle damage and recovery in the Lower hindlimbs in mice.
   Confirmation of muscle damage was obtained using in vivo indocyanine
   green enhanced NIR optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and ex
   vivo tissue analysis. The soleus of the immobilized-reambulated hindlimb
   was found to have a greater amount of muscle damage compared to that in
   the contralateral non immobilized limb, confirmed by in vivo indocyanine
   green enhanced NIR optical imaging (3.86-fold increase in radiant
   efficiency), magnetic resonance imaging (1.41-fold increase in T-2), and
   an ex vivo spectrophotometric assay of indocyanine green uptake
   (1.87-fold increase in normalized absorbance). Contrast-enhanced NIR
   optical imaging provides a sensitive, rapid, and noninvasive screening
   method that can be used for imaging and quantifying muscle damage and
   recovery in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely applied in various areas,
   one of the typical applications is in face. Many versions of PCA have
   been developed for face recognition. However, most of these approaches
   are sensitive to grossly corrupted entries in a 2D matrix representing a
   face image. In this paper, we try to reduce the influence of grosses
   like variations in lighting, facial expressions and occlusions to
   improve the robustness of PCA. In order to achieve this goal, we present
   a simple but effective unsupervised preprocessing method,
   two-dimensional whitening reconstruction (TWR), which includes two
   stages: 1) A whitening process on a 2D face image matrix rather than a
   concatenated 1D vector; 2) 2D face image matrix reconstruction. TWR
   reduces the pixel redundancy of the internal image, meanwhile maintains
   important intrinsic features. In this way, negative effects introduced
   by gross-like variations are greatly reduced. Furthermore, the face
   image with TWR preprocessing could be approximate to a Gaussian signal,
   on which PCA is more effective. Experiments on benchmark face databases
   demonstrate that the proposed method could significantly improve the
   robustness of PCA methods on classification and clustering, especially
   for the faces with severe illumination changes.}},

Abstract = {{Structural hydrogel materials are being considered and investigated for
   a wide variety of biotribological applications. Unfortunately, most of
   the mechanical strength and rigidity of these materials comes from high
   polymer concentrations and correspondingly low polymer mesh size, which
   results in high friction coefficients in aqueous environments. Recent
   measurements have revealed that soft, flexible, and large mesh size
   hydrogels can provide ultra low friction, but this comes at the expense
   of mechanical strength. In this paper, we have prepared a low friction
   structural hydrogel sample of polyhydroxyethyl-methacrylate (pHEMA) by
   polymerizing an entangled polymer network on the surface through a
   solution polymerization route. The entangled polymer network was made
   entirely from uncrosslinked polyacrylamide (pAAm) that was polymerized
   from an aqueous solution and had integral entanglement with the pHEMA
   surface. Measurements revealed that these entangled polymer networks
   could extend up to similar to 200 mu m from the surface, and these
   entangled polymer networks can provide reductions in friction
   coefficient of almost two orders of magnitude (mu > 0.7 to mu < 0.01).}},

Abstract = {{Soft matter mechanics are characterized by high strains and
   time-dependent elastic properties, which complicate contact mechanics
   for emerging applications in biomedical surfaces and flexible
   electronics. In addition, hydrated soft matter precludes using
   interferometry to observe real areas of contact. In this work, we
   present a method for measuring the real area of contact in a soft,
   hydrated, and transparent interface by excluding colloidal particles
   from the contact region. We confirm the technique by presenting a
   Hertz-like quasi-static indentation (loading time > 1.4 hrs) by a
   polyacrylamide probe into a stiff flat surface in a submerged
   environment. The real contact area and width were calculated from in
   situ images of the interface processed to reduce image noise and
   thresholded to define the perimeter of contact. This simple technique of
   in situ particle exclusion microscopy (PEM) may be widely applicable for
   determining real areas of contact of soft, transparent interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Computer vision systems are becoming a scientific but also a commercial
   tool for food quality assessment. In the field, these systems can be
   used to predict yield, as well as for robotic harvesting or the early
   detection of potentially dangerous diseases. In postharvest handling, it
   is mostly used for the automated inspection of the external quality of
   the fruits and for sorting them into commercial categories at very high
   speed. More recently, the use of hyperspectral imaging is allowing the
   detection of not only defects in the skin of the fruits but also their
   association to certain diseases of particular importance. In the
   research works that use this technology, wavelengths that play a
   significant role in detecting some of these dangerous diseases are
   found, leading to the development of multispectral imaging systems that
   can be used in industry. This article reviews recent works that use
   colour and non-standard computer vision systems for the automated
   inspection of citrus. It explains the different technologies available
   to acquire the images and their use for the non-destructive inspection
   of internal and external features of these fruits. Particular attention
   is paid to inspection for the early detection of some dangerous diseases
   like citrus canker, black spot, decay or citrus Huanglongbing.}},

Title = {{An injectable capillary-like microstructured alginate hydrogel improves

Abstract = {{Background: A new post-myocardial infarction (MI) therapy is injection
   of high-water-content polymeric biomaterial gels (hydrogels) into
   damaged myocardium to modulate cardiac negative remodeling and preserve
   heart function.
   Methods: We investigated the therapeutic potential of a novel
   gelatinized alginate hydrogel with a unique micro-structure of uniform
   capillary-like channels (termed Capgel). Shortly (48 h) after induced
   anterior MI, Sprague Dawley rats received intramyocardial injection of
   Capgel directly into the antero-septal wall at the infarct border zone
   (n = 12) or no injection (n = 10, controls). Echocardiograms were
   performed at 48 h (week 0) and 4 weeks (week 4) to evaluate left
   ventricular function.
   Results: Echocardiograms showed 27\% improvement of left ventricular
   systolic function over time with gel injection: fractional shortening
   increased from 26 +/- 3\% at week 0 to 33 +/- 2\% at week 4 (p = 0.001).
   Capgel was present at the injection site after 4 weeks, but was minimal
   at 8 weeks. The remaining gel was heavily populated by CD68(+)
   macrophages with CD206(+) clusters and blood vessels. An in vitro
   experiment was performed to assess Angiotensin-(1-7) released from
   Capgel. Angiotensin-(1-7) was released from the Capgel in a sustained
   manner for 90 days.
   Conclusions: Use of Capgel, a degradable, bioactive hydrogel composed of
   gelatinized capillary-alginate gel, appears safe for intramyocardial
   injection, is associated with improved left ventricular function after
   MI in rats, and may provide a long-term supply of Angiotensin-(1-7). (C)

Abstract = {{Many practical complex networks, such as the Internet, WWW and social
   networks, are discovered to follow power-law distribution in their
   degree sequences, i.e., the number of nodes with degree in these
   networks is proportional to for some exponential factor . However, these
   networks also expose their vulnerabilities to a great number of threats
   such as adversarial attacks on the Internet, cyber-crimes on the WWW or
   malware propagations on social networks. Although power-law networks
   have been found robust under random attacks and vulnerable to
   intentional attacks via experimental observations, how to better
   understand their vulnerabilities from a theoretical point of view still
   remains open. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of power-law
   networks under random attacks and adversarial attacks using the in-depth
   probabilistic analysis on the theory of random power-law graph models.
   Our results indicate that power-law networks are able to tolerate random
   failures if their exponential factor is 2.9, and they are more robust
   against intentional attacks if is smaller. Furthermore, we reveal the
   best range for the exponential factor by optimizing the complex networks
   in terms of both their vulnerabilities and costs. When , the network
   maintenance cost is very expensive, and when the network robustness is
   unpredictable since it depends on the specific attacking strategy.}},

Volume = {{264}},

Abstract = {{When producing asphalt concrete mixture with high amounts of reclaimed
   asphalt pavement (RAP), the mixing temperature plays a significant role
   in the resulting spatial distribution of the components as well as on
   the quality of the resulting mixture, in terms of workability during
   mixing and compaction as well as in service mechanical properties.
   Asphalt concrete containing 50\% RAP was investigated at mixing
   temperatures of 140, 160 and 180 degrees C, using a multiscale approach.
   At the microscale, using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy the RAP
   binder film thickness was visualized and measured. It was shown that at
   higher mixing temperatures this film thickness was reduced. The
   reduction in film thickness can be attributed to the loss of volatiles
   as well as the mixing of RAP binder with virgin binder at higher
   temperatures. X-ray computer tomography was used to characterize
   statistically the distribution of the RAP and virgin aggregates
   geometric features: volume, width and shape anisotropy. In addition
   using X-ray computer tomography, the packing and spatial distribution of
   the RAP and virgin aggregates was characterized using the nearest
   neighbour metric. It was shown that mixing temperature may have a
   positive effect on the spatial distribution of the aggregates but did
   not affect the packing. The study shows a tendency for the RAP
   aggregates to be more likely distributed in clusters at lower mixing
   temperatures. At higher temperatures, they were more homogeneously
   distributed. This indicates a higher degree of blending both at
   microscale (binder film) and macroscale (spatial distribution) between
   RAP and virgin aggregates as a result of increasing mixing temperatures
   and the ability to quantify this using various imaging techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic textures (DTs) that represent moving scenes such as flames,
   smoke, and waves, exhibit fixed dynamics within a period of time and
   have been successfully modeled using linear dynamic systems (LDS). In
   this paper, we show that the widely used LDS model can be approximated
   using a principal component regression (PCR) model with the main
   advantage of simplicity. Furthermore, to capture the nonlinearity of
   training frames, we extend traditional PCR to its kernelized version and
   introduce kernel principal component regression (KPCR) to model and
   synthesize DTs. To ensure algorithm stability, we remove the standard
   state model and directly apply the quantized kernel least mean squares
   algorithm from signal processing domain to approximate the performance
   achieved with KPCR. We term this improvement kernel adaptive dynamic
   texture synthesis (KADTS), which also has the benefits of computational
   and memory efficiency. These advantages make KADTS ideally suited for
   real-world applications, since the majority of electronic devices,
   including cell phones and laptops, suffer from limited memory and
   real-time constraints. We demonstrate, via both theoretical and
   experimental analyses, the connections between DT synthesis using KPCR
   and KADTS with a regularization network theory. We also show the
   superiority of our proposed algorithms for DT synthesis compared with
   other dynamic system-based benchmarks. MATLAB code is available from our
   project homepage http://bmal.hust.edu.cn/project/dts.html.}},

Abstract = {{The bowing of edge dislocations from a row of collinear obstacles in Al
   is studied using concurrent atomistic-continuum simulations of
   submicron-sized realizations containing up to 238 million atoms. Results
   show that (1) as the number of adjacent bowed-out dislocation segments
   increases, the critical dislocation depinning stress approaches that for
   an infinite array of obstacles and (2) for the unstable overall
   semi-elliptic dislocation configuration, the presence of intermediate
   obstacles reduces the dislocation half-loop height, but doesn't affect

Abstract = {{Despite its superior mechanical properties, boron carbide suffers from
   amorphization, a pressure-induced phenomenon that disturbs crystalline
   order and likely reduces shear strength. Numerous experimental and
   computational studies have investigated the structure and origins of
   amorphization, yet strategies to mitigate this deleterious phenomenon
   elude. However, recent investigations have revealed three new research
   avenues for addressing this issue. First, we identify crystallographic
   cage spaces that may accommodate foreign atoms to potentially prevent
   structural collapse. Second, we propose polymorph-level tailoring
   through strict control of processing conditions. Finally, we demonstrate
   that reducing grain size to nanometer scale increases hardness and may
   counter amorphization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using biomass (e.g. crop residues) and its derivatives as biosorbents
   have been recognized as an eco-friendly technique for wastewater
   decontamination. In this study, mechanically modified cottonwood was
   further activated with KOH to improve its sorption of Pb2+. In addition,
   its potential as a biofilter to safeguard radish (Raphanus sativus, L.)
   against Pb-stress was evaluated in a gravity-fed drip irrigation system.
   Physiochemical properties of the chemo-mechanically activated cottonwood
   (CMACW) and the mechanically activated cottonwood (MACW) before and
   after sorption process were characterized using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), digital selected-area electron
   diffraction (SAED) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
   After activation, several sorption mechanisms (i.e. precipitation,
   electrostatic outer and inner-sphere complexation) were responsible for
   the higher sorption capacity of CMACW as compared with MACW (8.55 vs.
   7.28 mg g(-1)). Sorption kinetics and isotherms fitted better with the
   pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models as compared with the
   pseudo-first-order and Freundlich models, respectively. In the
   gravity-fed drip irrigation system, the CMACW biofilter reduced the
   accumulation of Pb in radish roots and shoots and avoided reaching the
   toxic limits in some cases. Soil types had a significant effect on Pb2+
   bioavailability because of the difference in sorption ability. Findings
   from this study showed that CMACW biofilter can be used as a safeguard
   for wastewater irrigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an experimental study on the quasi-static behavior and
   dynamic behavior of a polycrystalline molybdenum material is presented.
   Due to the material's limited tensile ductility, successfully acquiring
   data for impact conditions is very challenging. For the first time,
   Taylor impact tests were successfully conducted on this material for
   impact velocities in the range of 140-165 m/s. For impact velocities
   beyond this range, the very high tensile pressures generated in the
   specimen immediately after impact lead to failure. A constitutive model
   accounting for the key features of the Mo plastic behavior, i.e. its
   tension-compression asymmetry and plastic anisotropy was developed. An
   implicit solver was used to simulate the impact deformation. A good
   agreement was obtained between predictions and experimental outlines of
   the specimens. Furthermore, it was shown that the model can be used to
   gain understanding of the dynamic deformation process in terms of time
   evolution of the pressure, the extent of the plastically deformed zone,
   distribution of the local plastic strain rates, and when the transition
   to quasi stable deformation occurs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Growth and termination of a rutile IrO2(100) layer on Ir(111)}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{652}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{213-221}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the oxidation of Ir(111) by gas-phase oxygen atoms at
   temperatures between 500 and 625 K using temperature programmed
   desorption (TPD), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), low energy ion
   scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) and density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations. We find that a well-ordered surface oxide with (root 3 x
   root 3)R30 degrees periodicity relative to Ir(111) develops prior to the
   formation of a rutile IrO2(100) layer. The IrO2(100) layer reaches a
   saturation thickness of about four oxide layers under the oxidation
   conditions employed, and decomposes during TPD to produce a single,
   sharp O-2 desorption peak at-770 K. Favorable lattice matching at the
   oxide-metal interface is likely responsible for the preferential growth
   of the IrO2(100) facet during the initial oxidation of Ir(111), with the
   resulting coincidence lattice generating a clear (6 x 1) moire pattern
   in LEED. Temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) experiments
   reveal that CO and H2O molecules bind only weakly on the IrO2(100)
   surface and LEISS measurements show that the oxide surface is highly
   enriched in O-atoms. These characteristics provide strong evidence that
   the rutile IrO2(100) layer is oxygen-terminated, and thus lacks reactive
   Ir atoms that can strongly bind molecular adsorbates. Oxygen binding
   energies predicted by DFT suggest that on-top O-atoms will remain
   adsorbed on IrO2(100) at temperatures up to similar to 625 K, thus
   supporting the conclusion that the rutile IrO2 layer grown in our
   experiments is oxygen-terminated. As such, the appearance of only a
   single O-2 TPD peak indicates that the singly coordinate, on-top O-atoms
   remain stable on the IrO2(100) surface up to temperatures at which the
   oxide layer begins to thermally decompose. (C) 2016 Published by

Title = {{Phase-field models for simulating physical vapor deposition and grain
   evolution of isotropic single-phase polycrystalline thin films}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{111-120}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Two models are presented based on the phase-field methodology to
   simulate thin film growth during physical vapor deposition (PVD),
   including subsurface microstructure evolution, for isotropic
   single-phase polycrystalline materials. The first model couples previous
   phase-field modeling efforts on ballistic deposition of single-phase
   materials and grain orientation evolution in polycrystalline materials
   in a sequential simulation algorithm. The second model incorporates both
   PVD and grain evolution dynamics into a single free energy functional
   for use in a phase-field model. To illustrate the capability of the
   proposed models in capturing combined thin film growth and subsurface
   grain evolution, PVD simulations of a generic single-phase
   polycrystalline metal are performed on substrates with different grain
   sizes. In both models, when the initial substrate grain sizes are
   smaller than the expected surface features, the thin film grains coarsen
   via grain boundary (GB) migration until the GBs become aligned with the
   valleys between the columnar surface features. Thus, each columnar
   feature is associated with a distinct subsurface grain, in qualitative
   agreement with experimental observations. Differences between the models
   arise when initial substrate grain sizes are larger than the surface
   columnar features. For example, when using the single free energy
   functional approach, grains contain noticeable internal low-angle
   variations, which are not captured using the coupled model. (C) 2016

Title = {{Shock interaction with three-dimensional face centered cubic array of
   particles}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present three-dimensional fully resolved numerical
   simulations of shock propagation in air over a face centered cubic (fcc)
   array of particles. It is well know that shock interaction with a single
   particle results in nonmonotonic drag on the particle and that the peak
   force is an order of magnitude greater than the steady-state force.
   However, there is currently a substantial lack of numerical results for
   shock propagation over multiple particles. We therefore compute the
   unsteady inviscid drag coefficient as a function of time for the fcc
   array of particles and investigate the effect of varying the shock Mach
   number and the volume fraction. We compare the unsteady drag for the fcc
   array against the unsteady drag for a single spherical particle and
   against the unsteady drag for a structured one-dimensional array of
   spherical particles and make relevant observations. We also plot the
   local Mach number contours to explain the various observed complex
   physical mechanisms occurring during shock-particle interaction.
   Finally, since shock interaction with particles lead to transmitted and
   reflected waves, we compute the average pressure in the computational
   domain to characterize the strength of the transmitted shock wave to
   study pressure attenuation behind the particle barrier. By analyzing the
   pressure field we can determine the effect of particles on the flow.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of bonded FRP durability by means of accelerated conditioning
   is sometimes thought to be too harsh compared to ambient environmental
   conditions; consequently, this may result in underestimate of the actual
   durability. To assess the efficacy of utilizing accelerated conditioning
   protocols (ACP) for FRP-concrete bond durability testing, results from
   laboratory and field conditions (Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa, FL)
   were compared. Direct tension pull-off test patches were applied to the
   approach span girders and notched beam three-point bending test
   specimens were placed on the dolphins adjacent to the bridge. These
   results were compared to notched beam specimens exposed to ACP. Testing
   indicated that characteristics of the FRP-concrete bond failure modes
   changed in some of the field samples within 6 months of field exposure,
   which may be an indication of durability problems. Moreover, ACP under
   elevated temperatures (60 degrees C) of notched three-point bending test
   resulted in a 36\% loss of strength compared to no strength degradation
   after 18 months of field conditioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Rapid thermal annealing of 10 nm thick Si-doped HfO2 thin films was
   performed to study the influence of isochronal and isothermal anneals on
   the ferroelectric and electrical properties of thin film
   metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitors. The anneal temperature and time
   dependence of the ferroelectric Si-doped HfO2 thin films was
   investigated by applying 700 degrees C-900 degrees C rapid thermal
   anneals for 5 s-60 s durations. An antiferroelectric-like to
   ferroelectric transition with increasing anneal temperature is observed
   in the Si-doped HfO2 thin films. The electrical properties of Si-doped
   HfO2 thin films exhibit a strong temperature dependence and a
   significant time dependence for the temporal range studied in this work.
   The breakdown field in the ferroelectric HfO2 thin films ranges from
   3.8-5.3 MV/cm depending on the anneal temperature and atomic layer
   deposition cycle ratio. The remanent polarization, breakdown field, and
   leakage current is discussed in the context of the Si-doping, anneal
   temperature, and anneal time. Dynamic hysteresis currents are used to
   illustrate specific cases of the cycling behavior for the Si-doped HfO2

Abstract = {{A high-energy electron beam was applied to irradiate graphite for the
   preparation of graphene oxide,(GO) with a controllable oxygen content.
   The obtained GO sheets were analyzed with various characterization
   tools. The results revealed that-the oxygen-containing groups of GO
   increased with increasing irradiation dosages. Hence,
   oxygen-content-controllable synthesis of GO can be realized by changing
   the irradiation dosages: The GO sheets with different irradiation
   dosages were then used to adsorb aqueous Pb(II). The effects of contact
   time, pH, initial lead ion,concentration, and ionic strength on Pb(II)
   sorption onto different GO sheets were examined. The sorption process
   was found to be very fast (completed within 20 min) at pH 5.0. Except
   ionic strength, which showed no/little effect on lead sorption, the
   other factors affected the sorption of aqueous Pb(II) onto GO. The
   Maximum Pb(II) sorption capacities of GO increased with irradiation
   dosages, confirming that electron-beam irradiation was an effective way
   to increase the oxygen content of GO. These results suggested that
   irradiated GO with a controllable oxygen content is a promising
   nanomaterial for environmental cleanup, particularly for the treatment
   of cationic metal ions, such as Pb(II).}},

Title = {{Displacement correlations between a single mesenchymal-like cell and its
   nucleus effectively link subcellular activities and motility in cell
   migration analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Cell migration is an essential process in organism development and
   physiological maintenance. Although current methods permit accurate
   comparisons of the effects of molecular manipulations and drug
   applications on cell motility, effects of alterations in subcellular
   activities on motility cannot be fully elucidated from those methods.
   Here, we develop a strategy termed cell-nuclear (CN) correlation to
   parameterize represented dynamic subcellular activities and to quantify
   their contributions in mesenchymal-like migration. Based on the
   biophysical meaning of the CN correlation, we propose a cell migration
   potential index (CMPI) to measure cell motility. When the effectiveness
   of CMPI was evaluated with respect to one of the most popular cell
   migration analysis methods, Persistent Random Walk, we found that the
   cell motility estimates among six cell lines used in this study were
   highly consistent between these two approaches. Further evaluations
   indicated that CMPI can be determined using a shorter time period and
   smaller cell sample size, and it possesses excellent reliability and
   applicability, even in the presence of a wide range of noise, as might
   be generated from individual imaging acquisition systems. The novel
   approach outlined here introduces a robust strategy through an analysis
   of subcellular locomotion activities for single cell migration
   assessment.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Poly(styrene-block-ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) is a model hierarchically
   nanostructured polymer that contains PEO crystallites within microphase
   segregated block copolymer morphology. In order to investigate dynamics
   in this hierarchically nanostructured polymer, water was used as a
   selective, interacting probe molecule. First, the equilibrium effect of
   water sorption on the polymer structure was examined. Then, the coupled
   dynamics of structural changes and water diffusion were studied. At
   moderate water activity, crystallite dissolution caused water diffusion
   to appear non-Fickian (determined by Fourier Transform infrared -
   attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy). PEO deliquescence was so
   extreme at high water activity that dynamics could not be measured in a
   homopolymer control. In the block copolymer at unity water activity, a
   second stage of water sorption occurred that was attributed to
   relaxation of the glassy PS phase. Water desorption was ten times faster
   than sorption. Desorption is thought to be less hindered by tortuosity
   resulting from PEO crystallites. These results are of interest for a
   wide-range of applications including batteries and fuel cells, water
   desalination, food packaging, and biomedical implants. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Secure multiparty computation (SMC) offers a technique to preserve
   functionality and data privacy in mobile applications. Current protocols
   that make this costly cryptographic construction feasible on mobile
   devices securely outsource the bulk of the computation to a cloud
   provider. However, these outsourcing techniques are built on specific
   secure computation assumptions and tools, and applying new SMC ideas to
   the outsourced setting requires the protocols to be completely rebuilt
   and proven secure. In this work, we develop a generic technique for
   lifting any secure two-party computation protocol into an outsourced
   two-party SMC protocol. By augmenting the function being evaluated with
   auxiliary consistency checks and input values, we can create an
   outsourced protocol with low overhead cost. Our implementation and
   evaluation show that in the best case our outsourcing additions execute
   within the confidence intervals of two servers running the same
   computation and consume approximately the same bandwidth. In addition,
   the mobile device itself uses minimal bandwidth over a single round of
   communication. This work demonstrates that efficient outsourcing is
   possible with any underlying SMC scheme and provides an outsourcing
   protocol that is efficient and directly applicable to current and future
   SMC techniques. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{362}},
Pages = {{179-185}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Fluoropolymers have unique mechanical, chemical, and tribological
   properties (low friction coefficients) but their use as solid lubricants
   is inhibited by high wear rates (1-5X10(-4) mm(3)/Nm). The addition of
   certain types of alpha-alumina has been shown to reduce the wear rate of
   PTFE by over three orders of magnitude, but due to its extremely high
   molecular weight PTFE cannot be screw injection molded. However, PFA, a
   perfluorinated copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and a
   perfluorinated alkylvinyl ether (PAVE), can be. Teflon (R) PFA 340
   samples with various weight fractions of alpha-alumina (0\%, 5\%, 7.5\%,
   10\%) were injection molded, and samples from each mold were wear tested
   against stainless steel (P=6.3 MPa, nu=50.8 mm/s). Experiments showed
   that the friction behavior of the PFA 340-alpha alumina composite was
   very close to that of both unfilled PFA 340 and PTFE-alpha alumina
   composites. The wear rate of unfilled PFA 340 was 1.4X10(-4) mm(3)/Nm,
   and dropped to 4.0X10(-8) mm(3)/Nm for the PFA-alpha alumina composites.
   Just as in the case of PTFE-alpha alumina composites, these PFA
   composites generated brown-colored tribofilms on both the polymer and
   metal surfaces, which were indicative of tribochemical changes. ATR-IR
   and FTIR spectra of each surface showed evidence for the generation of
   perfluorinated carboxylate salts and waters of hydration. This spectral
   similarity between PTFE and PFA 340 samples shows that the same
   tribological mechanism found in PTFE-alpha alumina composites is
   responsible for ultralow wear in PFA-alpha alumina composites as well.

Title = {{Effect of bulk growth temperature on antiphase domain boundary
   annihilation rate in MOCVD-grown GaAs on Si(001)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{450}},
Pages = {{39-44}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{GaAs is a material of interest as a potential buffer layer in future
   Ill-V semiconductor-based transistor technologies integrated on Si
   wafers. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of growth
   temperature on the propagation and annihilation of antiphase domain
   boundaries (APBs) in GaAs films grown on Si(001) by metal-organic
   chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). No intentional wafer off-cuts or high
   temperature pre-growth anneals (> 1000 degrees C) were employed as both
   of these practices complicate integration with other devices. To
   evaluate the role of growth temperature on the APB evolution, a 200 nm
   thick layer of GaAs was grown on the Si at a fixed temperature of 530
   degrees C so that all samples started with the same approximate APB
   density. Subsequently, 600 nm of GaAs was grown at temperatures varying
   between 530 degrees C and 650 degrees C. Chemical etching combined with
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to profile the density of
   the APBs in each sample as a function of depth. The APB annihilation
   rate, i.e. the exponential decay rate of APB density with respect to
   film thickness, increases from 2.6 mu m(-1) to 10.7 mu m(-1) as the
   growth temperature increases from 530 degrees C to 610 degrees C and
   then saturates. The increase in annihilation rate with increasing
   temperatures suggests that the higher temperatures remove kinetic
   barriers to the reduction of the overall APB interfacial area. An
   activation energy of 1.1 eV was extracted using an Arrhenius
   relationship and likely corresponds to the energy needed for APBs to
   kink from \{110\} to higher-index planes, e.g. \{112\}. Dark field
   transmission electron microscopy showed that at higher growth
   temperatures the APBs can shift from vertical \{110\} habit planes to
   \{112\} planes leading to self-annihilation with sufficient thickness.

Abstract = {{Silicon undergoes multiple phase transformations during indentation, and
   its final phase depends primarily upon the rate of unloading. In this
   study, single-crystal silicon was subjected to static and dynamic
   indentations in order to evaluate the propensity for particular phase
   transformations as a function of unloading strain rate. Raman
   spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were employed to map
   the phase distribution within and beneath the indent impression. It was
   found that silicon behavior is strongly dependent on unloading strain
   rate, with the preferred final phase switching from crystalline
   polytypes to nanocrystalline Si. The manuscript provides data in the
   intermediate strain rate range (10(3)-10(5) s(-1)) that is not currently
   available in literature and links published nanoindentation to shock
   testing results, crucial to predicting material response at a range of

Title = {{Effects of alternative polymer modifications on cracking performance of

Abstract = {{The use of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) polymer-modified asphalt
   (PMA) binder has successfully enhanced pavement cracking performance.
   Meanwhile, state agencies hesitate to allow the use of alternative PMA
   binders that meeting existing specification requirements for PG 76-22
   SBS PMA binder, due to a lack of experience and documented performance.
   A previous study identified four out of seven alternative PMA binders
   that exhibited excellent elastomeric behavior and fracture properties.
   This study extends these prior efforts by assessing whether binder
   results translate to improved cracking performance of resultant
   mixtures. Superpave indirect tension (IDT) tests were conducted to
   obtain the fracture properties of asphalt mixtures with the four
   alternative PMA binders, as well as a standard PG 76-22 (3\% SBS) PMA
   binder and a PG 67-22 unmodified base binder. Results showed that these
   alternative PMA binders, produced with SBS plus polypropylene composite,
   terpolymer plus polypropylene composite, SBS plus oxidized polyethylene
   wax and a fourth non-SBS polymer of unknown composition, not only
   reduced the rate of damage accumulation but also improved the failure
   limit of the resultant mixtures. The energy ratio (ER) parameter which
   has been closely tied to field pavement cracking performance was
   calculated for each mixture, and the results showed that these
   alternative PMA binder exhibited equivalent or better cracking
   performance than the PG 76-22 SBS PMA binder. Finally, the binder
   fracture energy density (FED) results satisfactorily rank mixture
   cracking performance thereby supporting the use of the binder fracture
   energy (BFE) test as an effective tool to quantitatively evaluate the
   relatively cracking performance of asphalt binder. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{An investigation on stressing and breakage response of a prestressing
   strand using an efficient finite element model}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical response of a wire strand is inherently complex because
   the helical wires undergo evolving stress and contact conditions as the
   strand is loaded. Further complications are added to the strand behavior
   if one or more of the wires break due to strand degradation over time.
   Although a detailed investigation on strand behavior is critically
   important for predicting the capacity of a broken strand as well as
   developing new monitoring approaches for wire break detection, there is
   little study available in the literature on wire breakage in a stressed
   strand. This paper provides an extensive investigation on stressing and
   post-breakage dynamic behavior of a prestressing strand. A finite
   element model is generally useful to study the global strand response,
   along with many localized phenomena that have strong influence on its
   performance, but are difficult to capture either experimentally or
   through closed-form analytical models. Investigations on certain
   behaviors, such as wire breaks, however, require a relatively large or
   even a full-scale model to adequately develop contact and frictional
   conditions. Moreover, such a sizeable model can account for any
   deviation points and may avoid edge effects. Consequently, several
   finite element parameters, such as the load ramp profile and duration,
   effects of damping and interwire friction, become critical for an
   accurate and efficient model. This paper first presents the use of a
   parametrized model to study strand behavior and evaluates the effects of
   these modeling parameters on strand response; load distribution and
   redistribution among the wires at the onset of interwire motion are also
   considered. The model is then used to simulate wire breakage in a
   prestressing strand, so that various aspects of post-breakage response
   can be examined. Numerical results show that a linear load ramp or
   stressing too quickly may lead to an inaccurate axial tension developed
   in the strand, whereas the inclusion of nominal mass-based damping has
   been found effective in achieving a quasi-static solution at a
   reasonable computational cost. In addition, the wire break simulation
   results indicate that breakage of an outer wire results in greater
   prestress loss than breakage of the center wire, which might have
   important implications for non-destructive wire breakage detection. (C)

Abstract = {{Intra-urban assessment of air pollution exposure has become a priority
   study while international attention was attracted to PM2.5 pollution in
   China in recent years. Land Use Regression (LUR), which has previously
   been proved to be a feasible way to describe the relationship between
   land use and air pollution level in European and American cities, was
   employed in this paper to explain the correlations and spatial
   variations in Shanghai, China. PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations at 35-45
   monitoring locations were selected as dependent variables, and a total
   of 44 built environmental factors were extracted as independent
   variables. Only five factors showed significant explanatory value for
   both PM2.5 and NO2 models: longitude, distance from monitors to the
   ocean, highway intensity, waterbody area, and industrial land area for
   PM2.5 model; residential area, distance to the coast, industrial area,
   urban district, and highway intensity for NO2 model. Respectively, both
   PM2.5 and NO2 showed anti-correlation with coastal proximity (an
   indicator of clean air dilution) and correlation with highway and
   industrial intensity (source indicators). NO2 also showed significant
   correlation with local indicators of population density (residential
   intensity and urban classification), while PM2.5 showed significant
   correlation with regional dilution (longitude as a indicator of distance
   from polluted neighbors and local water features). Both adjusted R
   squared values were strong with PM2.5 (0.88) being higher than NO2
   (0.62). The LUR was then used to produce continuous concentration fields
   for NO2 and PM2.5 to illustrate the features and, potentially, for use
   by future studies. Comparison to PM2.5 studies in New York and Beijing
   show that Shanghai PM2.5 pollutant distribution was more sensitive to
   geographic location and proximity to neighboring regions. (C) 2015

Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{One of fundamental challenges in cancer studies is that varying
   molecular characteristics of different tumor types may lead to
   resistance to certain drugs. As a result, the same drug can lead to
   significantly different results in different types of cancer thus
   emphasizing the need for individualized medicine. Individual prediction
   of drug response has great potential to aid in improving the clinical
   outcome and reduce the financial costs associated with prescribing
   chemotherapy drugs to which the patient's tumor might be resistant. In
   this paper we develop a network based classifier (NBC) method for
   predicting sensitivity of cell lines to anticancer drugs from
   transcriptome data. In the literature, this strategy has been used for
   predicting cancer types. Here, we extend it to estimate sensitivity of
   cells from different tumor types to various anticancer drugs.
   Furthermore, we incorporate domain specific knowledge such as the use of
   apoptotic gene list and clinical dose information in our method to
   impart biological significance to the prediction. Our experimental
   results suggest that our network based classifier (NBC) method
   outperforms existing classifiers in estimating sensitivity of cell lines

Abstract = {{The stabilization of oil-in-water emulsions is critical for a wide
   variety of fields. Here, we explore the reaction dynamics of and
   emulsion stabilization by in situ surfactant generation through the
   saponification of esters that are commonly used in cosmetics and drug
   delivery. We combine measurements of dynamic interfacial tension and
   surface elasticity with emulsion stability to determine the dynamics of
   the interfacial reaction and its effect on interfacial properties. The
   rate of surfactant production through the in situ reaction depends on
   the surface area and thus the dynamics measured in a pendant drop may
   not reflect the dynamics in emulsification. To test this, we also
   measure the dynamics of surfactant production after emulsification.
   Further, we explore the effect of surfactant chain length and solution
   pH on the interfacial tension dynamics and the emulsion stability. The
   results show that the interfacial tension transients in a pendant drop
   correlate with the in situ reaction dynamics but that there are others
   factors to consider. The steady state interfacial tension represents a
   pseudo-steady state between rate of surfactant produced and that
   desorbing into the aqueous phase. The interfacial tension dynamics and
   emulsion stability also depend strongly on the charge. The emulsions
   retain stability after aqueous pH neutralization, suggesting that a
   portion of the adsorbed surfactant molecules remain ionized at neutral
   pH. Emulsion stability increases with increasing surfactant chain
   length, which is the expected trend because a longer chain length
   reduces aqueous solubility thereby increasing the surfactant surface
   coverage. Therefore, the approach of emulsion stabilization by in situ
   surfactant production is more useful for surfactants with very low
   aqueous solubility. Finally, the transients of surfactant concentration
   in the emulsions show a reduction in the rate of the in situ reaction
   with increasing coverage of the surface by the adsorbed anionic
   surfactant most likely due to the buildup of surface charge that reduces
   the concentration of the hydroxyl ions at the surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Multi-view non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been developed to
   learn the latent representation from multi-view non-negative data in
   recent years. To make the representation more meaningful, previous works
   mainly exploit either the consensus information or the complementary
   information from different views. However, the latent local geometric
   structure, of each view is always ignored. In this paper, we develop a
   novel multi-view NMF by patch alignment framework with view consistency.
   Different from previous works, we take the local geometric structure of
   each view into consideration, and penalize the disagreement of different
   views at the same time. More specifically, given a data in each view, we
   construct a local patch utilizing locally linear embedding to preserve
   its local geometrical structure, and obtain the global representation
   under the whole alignment strategy. Meanwhile, for different views, we
   make the representations of views to approximate the latent
   representation shared by different views via considering the view
   consistency. We adopt the correntropy-induced metric to measure the
   reconstruction error and employ the half-quadratic technique to solve
   the optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate the
   proposed method can achieve satisfactory performance compared with
   single-view methods and other existing multi-view NMF methods. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Spectrograms provide an effective way of time-frequency representation
   (TFR). Among these, short-time Fourier transform (SIFT) based
   spectrograms are widely used for various applications. However, STFT
   spectrogram and its revised versions suffer from two main issues: (1)
   there is a trade-off between time resolution and frequency resolution
   and (2) almost all the existing TFR methods, including STFT spectrogram,
   are not designed to handle arbitrary nonuniformly sampled data. To
   address these two issues, short-time iterative adaptive approach
   (ST-IAA) was recently proposed as a data-dependent adaptive spectral
   estimation method that can provide much enhanced TFR performance. In
   this paper, inspired by the ST-IAA method, we present an alternative
   approach, namely short-time sparse learning via iterative minimization
   (ST-SLIM), which can provide sparser and slightly better TFR performance
   than its ST-IAA counterpart. Moreover, in order to extend the
   applicability of ST-IAA to signals in the missing data case, we also
   propose a short-time missing-data iterative adaptive approach (ST-MIAA)
   which can retrieve the missing data effectively and outperform ST-IAA
   and ST-SLIM in the missing data case. We will demonstrate via simulation
   results the superiority of our proposed algorithms in terms of
   resolution, sidelobe suppression and applicability to signals with
   arbitrary sampling patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present an atomistic simulation study of several
   structure-property relationships of hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs)
   synthesized using styrene (STR), vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC), and
   divinylbenzene (DVB). Molecular simulation samples were prepared using a
   virtual polymerization algorithm, Polymatic, with DVB contents ranging
   from 0 to 50 mol\%. The HCP polymerization algorithm and the models were
   validated by comparison with experimental data: BET surface area, pore
   volume, H-2 and CO2 loading in 2\% DVB samples. Furthermore, the
   simulated trends in BET surface area and pore volume were in good
   agreement with the experimental data; both surface areas and pore
   volumes increased with increased VBC-DVB crosslinking. The same virtual
   polymerization approach was utilized to study the effect of DVB on the
   structure and thermodynamic properties of HCPs. Our results demonstrate
   that DVB mol\% significantly altered the structural and gas (H-2 and
   CO2) adsorption properties of the sample. Finally, though our data
   demonstrated that structural properties can be tuned at the atomistic
   level by varying the DVB mol\%, they did not exhibit a significant
   improvement in the performance of H-2/CO2 gas separation applications.

Abstract = {{Understanding the interactions between agricultural production and
   climate is necessary for sound decision-making in climate policy.
   Gridded and high-resolution crop simulation has emerged as a useful tool
   for building this understanding. Large uncertainty exists in this
   utilization, obstructing its capacity as a tool to devise adaptation
   strategies. Increasing focus has been given to sources of uncertainties
   for climate scenarios, input-data, and model, but uncertainties due to
   model parameter or calibration are still unknown. Here, we use publicly
   available geographical data sets as input to the Environmental Policy
   Integrated Climate model (EPIC) for simulating global-gridded maize
   yield. Impacts of climate change are assessed up to the year 2099 under
   a climate scenario generated by HadEM2-ES under RCP 8.5. We apply five
   strategies by shifting one specific parameter in each simulation to
   calibrate the model and understand the effects of calibration.
   Regionalizing crop phenology or harvest index appears effective to
   calibrate the model for the globe, but using various values of phenology
   generates pronounced difference in estimated climate impact. However,
   projected impacts of climate change on global maize production are
   consistently negative regardless of the parameter being adjusted.
   Different values of model parameter result in a modest uncertainty at
   global level, with difference of the global yield change less than 30\%
   by the 2080s. The uncertainty subjects to decrease if applying model
   calibration or input data quality control. Calibration has a larger
   effect at local scales, implying the possible types and locations for
   adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the linear shallow water approximation, longitudinal and
   transverse oscillations in a rectangular harbor with a parabolic bottom
   are analyzed. The longitudinal ones are combinations of the Legendre
   functions of the first and second kinds and the transverse ones are
   expressed with modified Bessel equations. Analytic results for
   longitudinal oscillations show that the augmentation of rapidity of
   variation of the water depth shifts the resonant wave frequencies to
   larger values and slightly changes the positions of the nodes for the
   resonant modes. For the transverse oscillations trapped within the
   harbor which are typically standing edge waves, the dispersion
   relationship is derived and the spatial structures of the first four
   modes are presented. The solutions illustrate that all the trapped modes
   are affected by the varying water depth parameters, especially for the
   higher modes whose profiles extend farther and the distribution of the
   energy of transverse oscillations is influenced by the rapidity of
   variation of the bottom within the harbor.}},

Title = {{Safety envelope for load tolerance of structural element design based on
   multi-stage testing}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Structural elements, such as stiffened panels and lap joints, are basic
   components of aircraft structures. For aircraft structural design,
   designers select predesigned elements satisfying the design load
   requirement based on their load-carrying capabilities. Therefore,
   estimation of safety envelope of structural elements for load tolerances
   would be a good investment for design purpose. In this article, a method
   of estimating safety envelope is presented using probabilistic
   classification, which can estimate a specific level of failure
   probability under both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. An
   important contribution of this article is that the calculation
   uncertainty is reflected in building a safety envelope using Gaussian
   process, and the effect of element test data on reducing the calculation
   uncertainty is incorporated by updating the Gaussian process model with
   the element test data. It is shown that even one element test can
   significantly reduce the calculation uncertainty due to lacking
   knowledge of actual physics, so that conservativeness in a safety
   envelope is significantly reduced. The proposed approach was
   demonstrated with a cantilever beam example, which represents a
   structural element. The example shows that calculation uncertainty
   provides about 93\% conservativeness against the uncertainty due to a
   few element tests. It is shown that even a single element test can
   increase the load tolerance modeled with the safety envelope by 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{Optical emission spectroscopy was used to characterize an electrical
   discharge plasma reactor with a liquid H2O film contacting different
   carrier gases. The plasma gas temperatures for Ar, He, and 1\% N-2 in Ar
   were 1000-1200 K and did not vary significantly with liquid flow rate.
   Increasing solution conductivity by adding KCl to deionized water in the
   Ar case lowered the temperature by 13\%, increased the discharge power
   and lowered the H2O2 formation rates. The temperature was highest in the
   case of air (2400 K), and in the case of Ar the temperature increased
   with the addition of O-2. The temperatures for this reactor are
   comparable to previous studies with discharges in humid gases, while the
   effects of liquid conductivity were similar to those reported with
   direct discharge in the liquid phase.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a bioinspired, compact, cost-effective autonomous
   underwater vehicle system is presented. Designed to operate in a
   heterogeneous, multivehicle collaboration hierarchy, the presented
   vehicle design features 3D printing technology to enable fast
   fabrication with a complex internal structure. Similar to a previous
   vehicle prototype, this system generates propulsive forces by expelling
   unsteady, pulsed jets, inspired by the locomotion of cephalopods and
   jellyfish. The novel thrusters enable the vehicle to be fully actuated
   in horizontal plane motions, without sacrificing the low-forward-drag,
   slender vehicle profile. By successively ingesting water and expelling
   finite water jets, periodic actuation forces are generated at all
   possible vehicle velocities, eliminating the need for control surfaces
   used in many conventional underwater vehicle designs. A semiactive
   buoyancy control system, inspired by the nautilus, adjusts the vehicle
   depth by passively allowing water flowing into and actively expelling
   water out of an internal bladder. A compact embedded system is developed
   to achieve the control and sensing capabilities necessary for multiagent
   interactions with the minimum required processing power and at a low
   energy cost. The new vehicle design also showcases an underwater optical
   communication system for short-range, high-speed data transmission,
   supplementing the conventional acoustic communication system.
   Experimental results show that, with the thruster motors powered at a
   60\% duty-cycle, the new vehicle is able to achieve a 1/4 zero-radius
   turn in 3.5 s and one-body-width sway translation in 2.5 s.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge bases are becoming increasingly important in structuring and
   representing information from the web. Meanwhile, webscale information
   poses significant scalability and quality challenges to knowledge base
   systems. To address these challenges, we develop a probabilistic
   knowledge base system, ARCHIMEDESONE, by scaling up the knowledge
   expansion and statistical inference algorithms. We design a web
   interface for users to query and update large knowledge bases.
   In this paper, we demonstrate the ARCHIMEDESONE system to showcase its
   efficient query and inference engines. The demonstration serves two
   purposes: 1) to provide an interface for users to interact with
   ARCHIMEDESONE through load, search, and update queries; and 2) to
   validate our approaches of knowledge expansion by applying inference
   rules in batches using relational operations and query-driven inference
   by focusing computation on the query facts. We compare ARCHIMEDESONE
   with state-of-the-art approaches using two knowledge bases: NELL-sports
   with 4.5 million facts and Reverb-Sherlock with 15 million facts.}},

Abstract = {{Studies summarizing stream restoration projects in the US are outdated
   and omit the majority of restoration projects in Florida. To address
   this gap, we compiled stream restoration data from diverse sources to
   create a Florida Stream Restoration Database (FSRD, available at )
   containing information on project type, location, completion date, and
   costs. The FSRD contains 178 projects categorized by restoration type,
   including riparian management (23\%), stream reclamation (19\%), flow
   modification (13\%), bank stabilization (12\%), channel reconfiguration
   (11\%), in-stream habitat improvements (11\%), floodplain reconnection
   (6\%), invasive species removal (4\%), and dam removal (1\%). Projects
   were spatially clustered into three geographic regions, providing
   insight on the diversity of initiatives, needs, and funding sources of
   land management agencies and private landowners that motivated
   restoration efforts. Projects in the Florida panhandle emphasized
   in-stream habitat restoration, while peninsular projects were dominated
   by flow modification, and projects in the west central region focused on
   stream reclamation to mitigate surface mining practices and water
   quality and habitat improvements in tidal streams. Results suggest that
   Florida is spending much more on stream restoration than previously
   documented. Between 1979 and 2015, the mean and median stream
   restoration project costs in Florida were \$15.4 million and \$180000,
   respectively, indicating a strongly skewed distribution because of the
   large Kissimmee River restoration project in central Florida. This work
   highlights the need for, and utility of, statewide and national
   restoration databases to improve restoration tracking. This need will
   become increasingly critical as more stringent water quality and habitat
   mitigation rules are implemented across the country. Copyright (c) 2016

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The ecological impacts of emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals
   are not well understood. The lack of experimental approaches for the
   identification of pollutant effects in realistic settings (that is, low
   doses, complex mixtures, and variable environmental conditions) supports
   the widespread perception that these effects are often unpredictable. To
   address this, we developed a novel screening method (GSA-QHTS) that
   couples the computational power of global sensitivity analysis (GSA)
   with the experimental efficiency of quantitative high-throughput
   screening (QHTS). We present a case study where GSA-QHTS allowed for the
   identification of the main pharmaceutical pollutants (and their
   interactions), driving biological effects of low-dose complex mixtures
   at the microbial population level. The QHTS experiments involved the
   integrated analysis of nearly 2700 observations from an array of 180
   unique low-dose mixtures, representing the most complex and data-rich
   experimental mixture effect assessment of main pharmaceutical pollutants
   to date. An ecological scaling-up experiment confirmed that this subset
   of pollutants also affects typical freshwater microbial community
   assemblages. Contrary to our expectations and challenging established
   scientific opinion, the bioactivity of the mixtures was not predicted by
   the null mixture models, and the main drivers that were identified by
   GSA-QHTS were overlooked by the current effect assessment scheme. Our
   results suggest that current chemical effect assessment methods overlook
   a substantial number of ecologically dangerous chemical pollutants and
   introduce a new operational framework for their systematic
   identification.}},

Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We conducted a quantitative study to identify the effectiveness of
   proton boron fusion therapy (PBFT). Four simulation scenarios were
   designed to investigate the escalation in total dose with the proton
   boron reaction using a Monte Carlo n-particle extended(MCNPX2.6.0)
   simulation. The peak integrated dose was obtained for three different
   physical conditions (i.e., boron uptake region (BUR) thickness, BUR
   location, and boron concentration) with differing proton beam energy
   (60-90 MeV). We found that the peak integrated dose was increased by up
   to 96.62\% compared to the pristine proton Bragg-peak. For the
   synergetic effect to take place with 60-70 MeV proton beam, the BUR had
   to be at least 0.3 cm thick while spanning the Bragg-peak. Similarly to
   the thickness, the BUR location needed to be within 0.3 cm from the
   Bragg-peak when the thickness was maintained at 0.9 cm. An effective
   proton boron reaction required the boron concentration to be equal to or
   greater than 14.4 mg/g. These results demonstrate the impact of various
   physical and beam conditions of the PBFT, which are critical
   environmental factors for the treatment planning. We envision that this
   study will advance our understanding of the PBFT, which can be an
   invaluable treatment method for maximizing the potential of proton
   therapy. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a compact microendoscopic OCT probe with an outer
   diameter of only 2.7 mm. The small diameter is enabled by a novel 2-axis
   scanning MEMS mirror with a preset 45 degrees tilted angle. The tilted
   MEMS mirror is directly integrated on a silicon optical bench (SiOB).
   The SiOB provides mechanical support and electrical wiring to the mirror
   plate via a set of bimorph flexure, enabling a compact probe mount
   design without the requirement of a 45 degrees slope, which is capable
   to dramatically reduce the probe size and ease the assembly process.
   Additionally, the SiOB also provides trenches with properly-designed
   opening widths for automatic alignment of the MEMS mirror, GRIN lens and
   optical fiber. The 45 degrees-tilted MEMS mirror plate is actuated by
   four electrothermal bimorph actuators. The packaged 2.7 mm-diameter
   probe offers 2-axis side-view optical scanning with a large optical scan
   range of 40 degrees at a low drive voltage of 5.5 Vdc in both axes,
   allowing a lateral scan area of 2.2 mm x 2.2 mm at a 3 mm working
   distance. High-resolution 2D and 3D OCT images of the IR card, ex vivo
   imaging of meniscus specimens and rat brain slices, in vivo imaging of
   the human finger and nail have been obtained with a TDOCT system. (C)

Title = {{Three-dimensional simulations of fracture dissolution}},

Abstract = {{Numerical studies of fracture dissolution are frequently based on
   two-dimensional models, where the fracture geometry is represented by an
   aperture field h(x,y). However, it is known that such models can break
   down when the spatial variations in aperture are rapid or large in
   amplitude; for example, in a rough fracture or when instabilities in the
   dissolution front develop into pronounced channels (or wormholes). Here
   we report a finite-volume implementation of a three-dimensional reactive
   transport model using the OpenFOAM (R) toolkit. Extensions to the
   OpenFOAM source code have been developed which displace and then relax
   the mesh in response to variations in the surface concentration; up to
   100-fold increases in fracture aperture are possible without remeshing.
   Our code has simulated field-scale fractures with physical dimensions of
   about 10m. We report simulations of smooth fractures, with small,
   well-controlled perturbations in fracture aperture introduced at the
   inlet. This allows for systematic convergence studies and for detailed
   comparisons with results from a two-dimensional model. Initially, the
   fracture aperture develops similarly in both models, but as local
   inhomogeneities develop the results start to diverge. We investigate
   numerically the onset of instabilities in the dissolution of fractures
   with small random variations in the initial aperture field. Our results
   show that elliptical cross sections, which are characteristic of karstic
   conduits, can develop very rapidly, on time scales of 10-20years in
   calcite rocks.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of proton irradiation on the dc performance of InAlN/GaN
   metal-oxide-semiconductor high electron mobility transistors ( MOSHEMTs)
   with Al2O3 as the gate oxide were investigated. The InAlN/GaN MOSHEMTs
   were irradiated with doses ranging from 1 x 10(13) to 1 x 10(15) cm(-2)
   at a fixed energy of 5MeV. There was minimal damage induced in the two
   dimensional electron gas at the lowest irradiation dose with no
   measurable increase in sheet resistance, whereas a 9.7\% increase of the
   sheet resistance was observed at the highest irradiation dose. By sharp
   contrast, all irradiation doses created more severe degradation in the
   Ohmic metal contacts, with increases of specific contact resistance from
   54\% to 114\% over the range of doses investigated. These resulted in
   source-drain current-voltage decreases ranging from 96 to 242mA/mm over
   this dose range. The trap density determined from temperature dependent
   drain current subthreshold swing measurements increased from 1.6 x
   10(13) cm(-2) V-1 for the reference MOSHEMTs to 6.7x10(13) cm(-2) V-1
   for devices irradiated with the highest dose. The carrier removal rate
   was 1287 +/- 64 cm(-1), higher than the authors previously observed in
   AlGaN/GaN MOSHEMTs for the same proton energy and consistent with the
   lower average bond energy of the InAlN. (C) 2016 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors ( HEMTs) have been grown on
   sapphire substrates, using ZrTi buffer layers to provide in-plane
   lattice-matching to hexagonal GaN. X-ray diffraction ( XRD) as well as
   cross-section transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) were used to
   assess the quality of the HEMT structure. The XRD 2h scans showed
   full-width-at-half-maximum values of 0.16 degrees, 0.07 degrees, and
   0.08 degrees for ZrTi alloy, GaN buffer layer, and the entire HEMT
   structure, respectively. TEM studies of the GaN buffer layer and the
   AlN/ZrTi/AlN stack showed the importance of growing thin AlN buffer
   layers on the ZrTi layer prior to growth of the GaN buffer layer. The
   density of threading dislocations in the GaN channel layer of the HEMT
   structure was estimated to be in the 10(8) cm(-2) range. The HEMT device
   exhibited a saturation drain current density of 820mA/mm, and the
   channel of the fabricated HEMTs could be well modulated. A cutoff
   frequency ( f(T)) of 8.9GHz and a maximum frequency of oscillation (

Abstract = {{Quantitative detection of common endogenous fluorophores is accomplished
   using differential laser-induced perturbation spectroscopy (DLIPS) with
   a 193-nm UV fluorescence probe and various UV perturbation wavelengths.
   In this study, DLIPS is explored as an alternative to traditional
   fluorescence spectroscopy alone, with a goal of exploring natural
   fluorophores pursuant to biological samples and tissue analysis. To this
   end, aromatic amino acids, namely, l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine and
   l-tryptophan are mixed with differing mass ratios and then classified
   with various DLIPS schemes. Classification with a traditional
   fluorescence probe is used as a benchmark. The results show a 20\%
   improvement in classification performance of the DLIPS method over the
   traditional fluorescence method using partial least squares (PLS)
   analysis. Additional multivariate analyses are explored, and the
   relevant photochemistry is elucidated in the context of perturbation
   wavelengths. We conclude that DLIPS is a promising biosensing approach
   with potential for in vivo analysis given the current findings with
   fluorophores relevant to biological tissues.}},

Abstract = {{A steam gasification processes is an energy conversion pathway through
   which organic materials are converted to useful energy. In spite of the
   high energy content in organic waste materials, they have been mostly
   disposed of in landfills, which causes harmful environmental issues such
   as methane emissions and ground water pollution and contaminations. In
   this sense, organic solid waste materials are regarded as alternative
   resources for conversion to useful energy in the steam gasification
   process. In this study, three types of waste materials - municipal solid
   waste (MSW), used tires and sewage sludge - were used to generate syngas
   through the gasification process in a 1000 degrees C steam atmosphere.
   The syngas generation rates and its chemical compositions were measured
   and evaluated over time to determine the characteristics and dynamics of
   the gasification process. Also, carbon conversion, and mass and energy
   balances are presented which demonstrates the feasibility of steam
   gasification as a waste conversion pathway. The results show that the
   syngas contains high concentrations of H-2, around 41-55\% by volume.
   The syngas generation rate was found to depend on the carbon content in
   the feedstock regardless of the types of input materials. Comparing to
   the hydrogen production from water splitting that requires extremely
   high temperatures at around 1500 degrees C, hydrogen production by steam
   gasification of organic materials can be regarded as equally effective
   but requires lower system temperatures. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Various inorganic nanoparticle designs have been developed and used as
   non-viral gene carriers. Magnetic gene carriers containing
   polyethyleneimine (PEI), a well-known transfection agent, have been
   shown to improve DNA transfection speed and efficiency in the presence
   of applied magnetic field gradients that promote particle-cell
   interactions. Here we report a method to prepare iron oxide
   nanoparticles conjugated with PEI that: preserves the narrow size
   distribution of the nanoparticles, conserves magnetic properties
   throughout the process, and results in efficient transfection. We
   demonstrate the ability of the particles to electrostatically bind with
   DNA and transfect human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells by the use of an
   oscillating magnet array. Their transfection efficiency is similar to
   that of Lipofectamine 2000 (TM), a commercial transfection reagent.
   PEI-coated particles were subjected to acidification, and acidification
   in the presence of salts, before DNA binding. Results show that although
   these pre-treatments did not affect the ability of particles to bind DNA
   they did significantly enhanced transfection efficiency. Finally, we
   show that these magnetofectins (PEI-MNP/DNA) complexes have no effect on
   the viability of cells at the concentrations used in the study. The
   systematic preparation of magnetic vectors with uniform physical and
   magnetic properties is critical to progressing this non-viral
   transfection technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a clustered ad hoc network with virtual antenna array is
   investigated. Considering the random distribution of the nodes in ad hoc
   networks, the nodes are modeled as a Poisson point process (PPP).
   Different from prior analyses, interference in the ad hoc network is
   taken into account. Outage probability and transmission capacity of a
   single-hop network are first derived, and the accuracy of the analytical
   results is verified by simulation results. It is found that the outage
   probability decays as Theta(lambda(-(2/alpha))(c)), where lambda(c) is
   the intensity of potential cooperative nodes, and alpha is the path-loss
   exponent. That is, the outage probability obeys an inverse-2/alpha law
   with the intensity of cooperative nodes lambda(c). Moreover, there
   exists a unique optimal packet transmission rate to maximize the
   transmission capacity, and the optimal rate is shown to be within a
   specific interval that is only related to a path-loss exponent. Finally,
   the analysis of transmission capacity is extended to a multihop network.
   The results show that multihop transmission is not beneficial to the
   transmission capacity, but it does improve the outage performance. The
   analytical results are meaningful and can provide theoretical guidance
   on the network design.}},

Abstract = {{Sliding-window applications, an important class of the digital-signal
   processing domain, are highly amenable to pipeline parallelism on
   field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Although memory bandwidth often
   restricts parallelism for many applications, sliding-window applications
   can leverage custom buffers, referred to as sliding-window generators,
   that provide massive input bandwidth that far exceeds the capabilities
   of external memory. Previous work has introduced a variety of
   sliding-window generators, but those approaches typically generate at
   most one window per cycle, which significantly restricts parallelism. In
   this article, we address this limitation with a parallel sliding-window
   generator that can generate a configurable number of windows every
   cycle. Although in practice the number of parallel windows is limited by
   memory bandwidth, we show that even with common bandwidth limitations,
   the presented generator enables near-linear speedups up to 16x faster
   than previous FPGA studies that generate a single window per cycle,
   which were already in some cases faster than graphics-processing units
   and microprocessors.}},

Abstract = {{Applications accelerated by field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) often
   require pipelined floating-point accumulators with a variety of
   different trade-offs. Although previous work has introduced numerous
   floating-point accumulation architectures, few cores are available for

   vendor-provided cores that are not portable and are often not optimized
   for the desired set of trade-offs. In this article, we combine and
   extend previous floating-point accumulator architectures into a
   configurable, open-source core, referred to as the unified accumulator
   architecture (UAA), which enables designers to choose between different
   trade-offs for different applications. UAA is portable across FPGAs and
   allows designers to specialize the underlying adder core to take
   advantage of device-specific optimizations. By providing an extensible,
   open-source implementation, we hope for the research community to extend
   the provided core with new architectures and optimizations.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{153-164}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Oscillations within a rectangular harbor of parabolic bottom induced by
   water surface disturbances are investigated numerically based on
   Boussinesq equations and results are used to reveal the characteristics
   of the oscillations generated by disturbances of this type. The
   similarities and differences compared with those generated by a movable
   seafloor are also discussed. Relatively local and small-scale water
   surface disturbances may induce obvious transverse oscillations with
   little trace of longitudinal ones. The predominant transverse components
   are those with small alongshore mode number m and no node in the
   offshore direction. The augmentation of the rapidity of depth variation
   of the parabolic bottom may shift the resonant frequencies to larger
   values. These transverse modes are sensitive to the initial position of
   water surface disturbances. The spatial structure of each mode is well
   captured by the existing analytical solution based on shallow water
   equations. Although longitudinal oscillations may not be steadily
   generated with water surface disturbances, some patterns of several
   low-mode ones occur and are also sensitive to the position of the
   disturbances. Wavelet spectra are used to analyze their evolutions and
   comparisons are made with theoretical predictions for the three
   principle longitudinal modes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The devastating disease Huanglongbing (HLB) has greatly affected citrus
   in Florida and other growing regions. Detecting dropped fruit is one
   method of estimating the presence and severity of the disease. The
   purpose of this study was to develop a machine vision system that can
   detect dropped citrus on the ground in varying illumination conditions
   and identify decaying stages of the dropped fruit. In this paper, a
   novel method for image brightness correction using a contrast limited
   adaptive histogram equalization was developed to produce constant image
   brightness levels between and within images. Objectives of this study
   were to: (1) solve the varying illumination problem and create a
   consistent brightness level between and within the images, (2) develop
   an algorithm to eliminate multiple detections of a single fruit from the
   circular Hough transform, (3) design an algorithm to evaluate decaying
   stages of the dropped citrus, and (4) demonstrate ability to create a
   fruit drop map of citrus at each decaying stage in a commercial citrus
   grove. The result shows all processed images had desired brightness
   levels (152 out of 255) with a standard deviation of 1.0. Correct
   identification of fruit and false positives were measured as 89.6\% and
   5.0\%, respectively. False classifications of decay stages of fruit were
   as low as 4.2\% and 18.5\% for recently dropped fruit and rotten fruit,
   respectively. The techniques developed in this work could be further
   developed into a commercial machine vision system for a real-time
   dropped fruit mapping system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The goal of this work was to develop an easy-to-use and engaging
   irrigation scheduling tool for cotton which operates on a smartphone
   platform. The model which drives the Cotton Smartlrrigation App (Cotton
   App) is an interactive ET-based soil water balance model. The Cotton App
   uses meteorological data from weather station networks, soil parameters,
   crop phenology, crop coefficients, and irrigation applications to
   estimate root zone soil water deficits (RZSWD) in terms of percent as
   well as of inches of water. The Cotton App sends notifications to the
   user when the RZSWD exceeds 40\%, when phenological changes occur, and
   when rain is recorded at the nearest weather station. It operates on
   both iOS and Android operating systems and was released during March
   2014. The soil water balance model was calibrated and validated during
   2012 and 2013 using data from replicated plot experiments and commercial
   fields. The Cotton App was evaluated in field trials for three years and
   performed well when compared to other irrigation scheduling tools. Its
   geographical footprint is currently limited to the states of Georgia and
   Florida, United States, because it is enabled to use meteorological data
   only from weather station networks in these states. A new version is
   currently under development which will use national gridded
   meteorological data sets and allow the Cotton App to be used in most
   cotton growing areas of the United States. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: Cave divers enter an inherently dangerous environment that
   often includes little visibility, maze-like passageways and a ceiling of
   rock that prevents a direct ascent to the surface in the event of a
   problem.
   Methods: Reports of cave diving fatality cases occurring between 01 July
   1985 and 30 June 2015 collected by Divers Alert Network were reviewed.
   Training status, safety rules violated, relevancy of the violations, and
   root causes leading to death were determined.
   Results: A total of 161 divers who died were identified, 67 trained cave
   divers and 87 untrained. While the annual number of cave diving
   fatalities has steadily fallen over the last three decades, from eight
   to less than three, the proportion of trained divers among those
   fatalities has doubled. Data regarding trained cave divers were divided
   into two equal 15-year time periods. Trained cave divers who died in the
   most recent time period were older but little else differed. The most
   common cause of death was asphyxia due to drowning, preceded by running
   out of breathing gas, usually after getting lost owing to a loss of
   visibility caused by suspended silt. An overwhelming majority of the
   fatalities occurred in the state of Florida where many flooded caves are
   located.
   Conclusion: Even with improvements in technology, the greatest hazards
   faced by cave divers remain unchanged. Efforts to develop preventative
   interventions to address these hazards should continue.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a common-path (CP) swept-source optical coherence
   tomography (SSOCT) system based on a special endoscopic probe design
   with an in-line internal reflection as the reference and a two-axis
   electrothermal microelectromechanical system mirror for image scanning.
   The rear surface of a gradient reflective index (GRIN) lens inside the
   probe is set as the reference reflection plane. The length of the GRIN
   lens is optimized to eliminate the artifacts in SSOCT images
   successfully. Doppler OCT is also demonstrated based on the CP
   endoscopic probe. The diameter of the probe is only 2.5 mm, so it can be
   easily inserted into the biopsy channel of traditional endoscopes to
   access human internal organs for in vivo diagnoses. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{We present an investigation of the Lagrangian dynamics of a hurricane
   from the perspective of using micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) or small
   unmanned aircraft systems as mobile sensors for hurricane research and
   monitoring. The low cost of MAVs allows the use of more sensors for
   volumetric in situ measurements, particularly in high-risk locations
   where larger more expensive systems cannot be used. However, the limited
   flight speed of MAVs enforces severe restrictions on potential flight
   plans. In the face of 70-m/s horizontal winds, a MAV with only 10-m/s
   flight capability has very little directional control. Fortunately,
   vertical wind speeds in the hurricane are much lower and have limited
   spatial extent. Using Lagrangian coherent structure techniques and
   simplified vehicle simulations, we develop an understanding of the
   transport dynamics of a simulated hurricane and apply this understanding
   to a high-level control scheme to enable-MAV navigation and guidance
   near the hurricane. By smartly adjusting their altitude, simulated MAVs
   are able to navigate into the hurricane eye at a very high success rate.
   Our findings suggest that the smart use of the existing background flow
   could allow the use of low-cost sensor platforms in extreme
   environments.}},

   water-continuous microemulsions give simple dispersions of vesicles
   (sometimes unilamellar), typically less than 100 nm in diameter; these
   systems can avoid separation for over 2 months. Selected samples were
   also prepared using halogenated alkanes to create additional contrast in

   Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: Thermodynamic Insight into MoS2}},
Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Unprecedented interest has been spurred recently in two-dimensional (2D)
   layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) that possess tunable
   electronic and optical properties. However, synthesis of a wafer-scale
   TMD thin film with controlled layers and homogeneity remains highly
   challenging due mainly to the lack of thermodynamic and diffusion
   knowledge, which can be used to understand and design process
   conditions, but falls far behind the rapidly growing TMD field. Here, an
   integrated density functional theory (DFT) and calculation of phase
   diagram (CALPHAD) modeling approach is employed to provide thermodynamic
   insight into lateral versus vertical growth of the prototypical 2D
   material MoS2. Various DFT energies are predicted from the
   layer-dependent MoS2, 2D flake-size related mono- and bilayer MoS2, to
   Mo and S migrations with and without graphene and sapphire substrates,
   thus shedding light on the factors that control lateral versus vertical
   growth of 2D islands. For example, the monolayer MoS2 flake in a small
   2D lateral size is thermodynamically favorable with respect to the
   bilayer counterpart, indicating the monolayer preference during the
   initial stage of nucleation; while the bilayer MoS2 flake becomes stable
   with increasing 2D lateral size. The critical 2D flake-size of phase
   stability between mono- and bilayer MoS2 is adjustable via, the choice
   of substrate. In terms of DFT energies and CALPHAD modeling, the size
   dependent pressure temperature composition (P-T-x) growth windows are
   predicted for MoS2, indicating that the formation of MoS2 flake with
   reduced size appears in the middle but close to the lower T and higher P
   ``Gas + MoS2{''} phase region. It further suggests that Mo diffusion is
   a controlling factor for MoS2 growth owing to its extremely low
   diffusivity compared to that of sulfur. Calculated MoS2 energies, Mo and
   S diffusivities, and size-dependent P-T-x growth windows are in good
   accord with available experiments, and the present data provide
   quantitative insight into the controlled growth of 2D layered MoS2.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{74-87}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There are increasing calls to audit decision-support models used for
   environmental policy to ensure that they correspond with the reality
   facing policy makers. Modelers can establish correspondence by providing
   empirical evidence of real-world behavior that their models skillfully
   simulate. Since real world behavior especially in environmental systems
   is often complex, credibly modeling underlying dynamics is essential. We
   present a pre-modeling diagnostic framework based on Nonlinear Time
   Series (NLTS) methods for reconstructing real-world environmental
   dynamics from observed data. The framework is illustrated with a case
   study of saltwater intrusion into coastal wetlands in Everglades
   National Park, Florida, USA. We propose that environmental modelers test
   for systematic dynamic behavior in observed data before resorting to
   conventional stochastic exploratory approaches unable to detect this
   valuable information. Reconstructed data dynamics can be used, along
   with other expert information, as a rigorous benchmark to guide
   specification and testing of environmental decision support models
   corresponding with real-world behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Multivariate mathematical morphology (MMM) aims to extend the
   mathematical morphology from gray scale images to images whose pixels
   are high-dimensional vectors, such as remote sensing hyperspectral
   images and functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs). Defining an
   ordering over the multidimensional image data space is a fundamental
   issue MMM, to ensure that ensuing morphological operators and filters
   are mathematically consistent. Recent approaches use the outputs of
   two-class classifiers to build such reduced orderings. This paper
   presents the applications of MMM built on reduced supervised orderings
   based on lattice autoassociative memories (LAAMs) recall error measured
   by the Chebyshev distance. Foreground supervised orderings use one set
   of training data from a foreground class, whereas background/foreground
   supervised orderings use two training data sets, one for each relevant
   class. The first case study refers to the realization of the thematic
   segmentation of the hyperspectral images using spatial-spectral
   information. Spectral classification is enhanced by a spatial processing
   consisting in the spatial correction guided by a watershed segmentation
   computed by the LAAM-based morphological operators. The approach
   improves the state-of-the-art hyperspectral spatial-spectral thematic
   map building approaches. The second case study is the analysis of
   resting state fMRI data, working on a data set of healthy controls,
   schizophrenia patients with and without auditory hallucinations. We
   perform two experiments: 1) the localization of differences in brain
   functional networks on population-dependent templates and 2) the
   classification of subjects into each possible pair of cases. In this
   data set, we find that the LAAM-based morphological features improve
   over the conventional correlation-based graph measure features often
   employed in fMRI data classification.}},

Title = {{Development of a Subject-Specific Foot-Ground Contact Model for Walking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Computational walking simulations could facilitate the development of
   improved treatments for clinical conditions affecting walking ability.
   Since an effective treatment is likely to change a patient's foot-ground
   contact pattern and timing, such simulations should ideally utilize
   deformable foot-ground contact models tailored to the patient's foot
   anatomy and footwear. However, no study has reported a deformable
   modeling approach that can reproduce all six ground reaction quantities
   (expressed as three reaction force components, two center of pressure
   (CoP) coordinates, and a free reaction moment) for an individual subject
   during walking. This study proposes such an approach for use in
   predictive optimizations of walking. To minimize complexity, we modeled
   each foot as two rigid segments-a hindfoot (HF) segment and a forefoot
   (FF) segment-connected by a pin joint representing the toes
   flexion-extension axis. Ground reaction forces (GRFs) and moments acting
   on each segment were generated by a grid of linear springs with
   nonlinear damping and Coulomb friction spread across the bottom of each
   segment. The stiffness and damping of each spring and common friction
   parameter values for all springs were calibrated for both feet
   simultaneously via a novel three-stage optimization process that used
   motion capture and ground reaction data collected from a single walking
   trial. The sequential three-stage process involved matching (1) the
   vertical force component, (2) all three force components, and finally
   (3) all six ground reaction quantities. The calibrated model was tested
   using four additional walking trials excluded from calibration. With
   only small changes in input kinematics, the calibrated model reproduced
   all six ground reaction quantities closely (root mean square (RMS)
   errors less than 13 N for all three forces, 25 mm for anterior-posterior
   (AP) CoP, 8mm for medial-lateral (ML) CoP, and 2 N.m for the free
   moment) for both feet in all walking trials. The largest errors in AP
   CoP occurred at the beginning and end of stance phase when the vertical
   ground reaction force (vGRF) was small. Subject-specific deformable
   foot-ground contact models created using this approach should enable
   changes in foot-ground contact pattern to be predicted accurately by
   gait optimization studies, which may lead to improvements in
   personalized rehabilitation medicine.}},

Title = {{Semi-Markov Models for the Deterioration of Bridge Elements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Many bridge management systems (BMSs) use a Markov chain model to
   forecast the deterioration process. The Markov property may be
   considered to be restrictive when modeling the deterioration of
   transportation assets, primarily because of the memoryless property and
   assumption of exponential distribution for sojourn times in the
   condition states. This study addresses some of the limitations that
   arise from the use of purely Markov chain deterioration models for
   transportation infrastructure by introducing alternative approaches that
   are based on the semi-Markov process. Two semi-Markov approaches for
   modeling the deterioration of certain bridge elements are developed.
   These are compared against a previously developed semi-Markov approach,
   the traditional Markov chain deterioration approach, and the change in
   the average actual condition indices of bridge elements that
   deteriorated for 8years after being constructed. The results obtained
   from this study indicated that semi-Markov models are feasible and more
   flexible than the traditional Markov chain models when forecasting the
   future deterioration of transportation infrastructure. The semi-Markov
   models that were developed produced condition indices that were closer
   to the values of the average actual condition indices of bridge elements
   when compared against the values based on the traditional Markov chain
   model.}},

Title = {{Effect of Plasma Marking on the Fatigue Properties of Grade 50W Steel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{High-strength low-alloy (HSLA) weathering steels are the conventional
   material used for nonredundant fracture-critical members in bridge
   construction. Guidelines from state departments of transportation (DOTs)
   prevent material suppliers from scribing marks which remain on the
   surface of fracture-critical members when in service due to the
   possibility of degrading mechanical properties. Currently, any automated
   scribe marking, namely mechanical milling, is either cut from the end of
   the part, or welded over, thereby effectively removing it before
   service. All other markings are either manually die-stamped, or
   spray-painted on, which can be accidentally removed during sand blasting
   or shipping. Safe automated methods of scribing fracture-critical
   members are needed such that markings will remain throughout the
   production process but will not compromise the integrity over the
   lifetime of the part. In this study, a microstructural evaluation of 50W
   (or 345W) weathering steel was conducted to characterize the effect of
   plasma markings on microstructure and mechanical properties. S-N curves
   generated through fatigue testing showed no measurable difference in
   fatigue life between marked and unmarked material.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We consider in this paper a class of composite optimization problems
   whose objective function is given by the summation of a general smooth
   and nonsmooth component, together with a relatively simple nonsmooth
   term. We present a new class of first-order methods, namely the gradient
   sliding algorithms, which can skip the computation of the gradient for
   the smooth component from time to time. As a consequence, these
   algorithms require only gradient evaluations for the smooth component in
   order to find an -solution for the composite problem, while still
   maintaining the optimal bound on the total number of subgradient
   evaluations for the nonsmooth component. We then present a stochastic
   counterpart for these algorithms and establish similar complexity bounds
   for solving an important class of stochastic composite optimization
   problems. Moreover, if the smooth component in the composite function is
   strongly convex, the developed gradient sliding algorithms can
   significantly reduce the number of graduate and subgradient evaluations
   for the smooth and nonsmooth component to and , respectively. Finally,
   we generalize these algorithms to the case when the smooth component is
   replaced by a nonsmooth one possessing a certain bi-linear saddle point
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in the
   western world. With the current development of clinical diagnostics to
   more accurately measure the extent and specifics of CVDs, a laudable
   goal is a better understanding of the structure-function relation in the
   cardiovascular system. Much of this fundamental understanding comes from
   the development and study of models that integrate biology, medicine,
   imaging, and biomechanics. Information from these models provides
   guidance for developing diagnostics, and implementation of these
   diagnostics to the clinical setting, in turn, provides data for refining
   the models. In this review, we introduce multi-scale and multi-physical
   models for understanding disease development, progression, and designing
   clinical interventions. We begin with multi-scale models of cardiac
   electrophysiology and mechanics for diagnosis, clinical decision
   support, personalized and precision medicine in cardiology with examples
   in arrhythmia and heart failure. We then introduce computational models
   of vasculature mechanics and associated mechanical forces for
   understanding vascular disease progression, designing clinical
   interventions, and elucidating mechanisms that underlie diverse vascular
   conditions. We conclude with a discussion of barriers that must be
   overcome to provide enhanced insights, predictions, and decisions in
   pre-clinical and clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Installing folded proteins into biomaterials is gaining interest for
   imparting functional properties that often cannot be provided by
   unfolded peptides or small molecules, such as catalysis, antigen
   conformation, or molecular recognition. Although covalent grafting
   provides a simple means to immobilize proteins onto pre-formed
   biomaterials, amenable chemistries can alter protein bioactivity, are
   relatively non-specific, and can be difficult to reproduce. Covalent
   fusions of bioactive molecules and synthetic peptides that can
   self-assemble into nano-scale architectures are a promising alternative
   for creating functional supramolecular biomaterials with precise and
   reproducible composition. Here we created a pair of oppositely charged
   synthetic peptides, referred to as ``CATCH{''} (Co-Assembly Tags based
   on CHarge complementarity), to install folded proteins into
   supramolecular biomaterials. CATCH peptides co-assemble into beta-sheet
   nanofibers when combined, yet cannot assemble independently due to
   electrostatic repulsion. Electrostatically controlled assembly enabled
   high yield production of soluble CATCH-green fluorescent protein
   (CATCH(-)GFP) by E. coli. Binary mixtures of CATCH-GFP and its
   charge-complementary peptide self-assembled into fluorescent
   microparticles, whereas ternary mixtures of CATCH(-)GFP and both CATCH
   peptides self-assembled into fluorescent nanofibers and macroscopic
   hydrogels. The CATCH system is therefore likely to be broadly useful for
   creating functional supramolecular biomaterials with integrated folded
   protein components for various biomedical and biotechnological
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We previously found that in utero caffeine exposure causes
   down-regulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in embryonic heart and
   results in impaired cardiac function in adulthood. To assess the role of
   DNMTs in these events, we investigated the effects of reduced DNMT
   expression on embryonic cardiomyocytes. siRNAs were used to knock down
   individual DNMT expression in primary cultures of mouse embryonic
   cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to evaluate
   cell morphology. A video-based imaging assay and multielectrode array
   were used to assess cardiomyocyte contractility and electrophysiology,
   respectively. RNA-Seq and multiplex bisulfite sequencing were performed
   to examine gene expression and promoter methylation, respectively. At 72
   h after transfection, reduced DNMT3a expression, but not DNMT1 or -3b,
   disrupted sarcomere assembly and decreased beating frequency,
   contractile movement, amplitude of field action potential, and cytosolic
   calcium signaling of cardiomyocytes. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the
   DNMT3a-deficient cells had deactivated gene networks involved in
   calcium, endothelin-1, renin-angiotensin, and cardiac -adrenergic
   receptor signaling, which were not inhibited by DNMT3b siRNA. Moreover,
   decreased methylation levels were found in the promoters of Myh7, Myh7b,
   Tnni3, and Tnnt2, consistent with the up-regulation of these genes by
   DNMT3a siRNA. These data show that DNMT3a plays an important role in
   regulating embryonic cardiomyocyte gene expression, morphology and
   function.Fang, X., Poulsen, R. R., Wang-Hu, J., Shi, O., Calvo, N. S.,

Abstract = {{The detection of ground moving targets with arbitrary linear motion from
   an airborne multichannel radar via a long coherent processing interval
   is considered. The technique maximizes the target signal energy in
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images by matching to the target's linear
   motion profile. A reparameterization of the target's linear motion is
   developed that decouples the array processing from the image formation
   process. An explicit approach to forming SAR images focused with respect
   to a particular along-track velocity is presented. The ground clutter is
   canceled via an adaptive array technique, which also yields an estimate
   of the target radial velocity. Because the algorithm generates estimates
   of the target's along-track and cross-track velocity components, a
   unique determination of the target's motion parameters is possible. The
   approach is derived and investigated via simulated point spread
   functions. Algorithm performance is demonstrated on the GOTCHA SAR
   ground moving target indication data set.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the sustainable nature and stimulus plans from government,
   renewable energy (such as wind and solar) has been increasingly used in
   power systems. However, the intermittency of renewable energy creates
   challenges for power system operators to keep the systems reliable and
   cost-effective. In addition, information about renewable energy is
   usually incomplete. Instead of knowing the true probability distribution
   of the renewable energy course, only a set of historical data samples
   can be collected from the true (while ambiguous) distribution. In this
   article, we study two risk-averse stochastic unit commitment models with
   incomplete information: the first model being a chance-constrained unit
   commitment model and the second one a two-stage stochastic unit
   commitment model with recourse. Based on historical data on renewable
   energy, we construct a confidence set for the probability distribution
   of the renewable energy and propose data-driven stochastic unit
   commitment models to hedge against the incomplete nature of the
   information. Our models also ensure that, with a high probability, a
   large portion of renewable energy is utilized. Furthermore, we develop
   solution approaches to solve the models based on deriving strong valid
   inequalities and Benders' decomposition algorithms. We show that the
   risk-averse behavior of both models decreases as more data samples are
   collected and eventually vanishes as the sample size goes to infinity.
   Finally, our case studies verify the effectiveness of our proposed
   models and solution approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report a new method using combined magnetic resonance
   (MR)-Photoacoustic (PA)Thermoacoustic (TA) imaging techniques, and
   demonstrate its unique ability for in vivo cancer detection using
   tumor-bearing mice. Circular scanning TA and PA imaging systems were
   used to recover the dielectric and optical property distributions of
   three colon carcinoma bearing mice While a 7.0-T magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) unit with a mouse body volume coil was utilized for high
   resolution structural imaging of the same mice. Three plastic tubes
   filled with soybean sauce were used as fiducial markers for the
   co-registration of MR, PA and TA images. The resulting fused images
   provided both enhanced tumor margin and contrast relative to the
   surrounding normal tissues. In particular, some finger-like protrusions
   extending into the surrounding tissues were revealed in the MR/TA
   infused images. These results show that the tissue functional optical
   and dielectric properties provided by PA and TA images along with the
   anatomical structure by MRI in one picture make accurate tumor
   identification easier. This combined MR-PA-TA-imaging strategy has the
   potential to offer a clinically useful triple-modality tool for accurate
   cancer detection and for intraoperative surgical navigation.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the equilibration kinetics of Nb-doped TiO2 single
   crystal (0.066 atom \% Nb) during oxidation and reduction within a wide
   range of temperature (1073-1298 K) and oxygen activity (10(-14)-10(5)
   Pa). The associated semiconducting properties were determined using
   simultaneous measurements of both electrical conductivity and
   thermoelectric power. It is shown that the chemical diffusion
   coefficient in the strongly reducing regime, p(O-2) < 10(-5) Pa, is 4
   orders of magnitude larger than that in the reducing and oxidizing
   regimes, 10 Pa < p(O-2) < 22 kPa. The derived theoretical model
   considers the gas/solid kinetics for the TiO2/O-2 system in terms of two
   diffusion regimes: the fast regime related to fast defects (oxygen
   vacancies and titanium interstitials) and leading, to quasi-equilibrium,
   and the slow regime associated with slow defects (titanium vacancies)
   resulting in the gas/solid equilibrium. It has been shown that
   incorporation of donor-type elements, such as niobium, and imposition of
   oxygen activity above critical value, results in a substantial reduction
   in the concentration of high mobility defects and leads to slowing down
   the equilibration kinetics. In consequence, the fast kinetic regime is
   not observed. Comparison of the kinetic data for Nb-doped TiO2 single
   crystal (this work) and polycrystalline Nb-doped TiO2 (reported before)
   indicates that the gas/solid kinetics for the polycrystalline specimen
   at higher oxygen activities is rate controlled by the transport of
   oxygen within individual grains.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses challenges of estimating operational risk
   regulatory capital when a loss sample is truncated from below at a data
   collection threshold. Recent operational risk literature reports that
   the attempts to estimate loss distributions by the maximum likelihood
   method are not always successful under the truncation approach that
   accounts for the existence of censored lossesthe likelihood surface is
   sometimes ascending with no global solution. The literature offers an
   alternative called the shifting approach, which estimates the loss
   distribution without taking into account censored losses. We present a
   necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the global
   solution to the likelihood maximization problem under the truncation
   approach when the true loss distribution is lognormal, and derive a
   practically explicit expression for the global solution. We show by a
   simulation study that, as the sample size increases, the capital bias by
   the truncation approach declines while the bias by the shifting approach
   does not.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, power quality standards such as IEC 61000-3-6, IEC
   61000-2-12, EN 50160, and CIGRE WG 36-05 are fulfilled for single-and
   three-phase medium-voltage applications using selective harmonic
   mitigation-pulsewidth modulation in a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter.
   Furthermore, the ER G5/4 power quality standard, which has the strictest
   grid codes at the medium-voltage level, will also be met in the whole
   range of the modulation indices. In order to achieve this goal, a
   symmetrical CHB with variable dc links are employed, while the converter
   has a low number of switching transitions. In other words, all of the dc
   link voltages have the same voltage, which is dependent on the
   modulation index. Finally, in order to validate the effectiveness and
   the applicability of the proposed method, it is verified by simulations
   and experiments for a seven-level CHB converter.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{344-365}},

Abstract = {{Given the rapid development of charging-while-driving technology, we
   envision that charging lanes for electric vehicles can be deployed in
   regional or even urban road networks in the future and thus attempt to
   optimize their deployment in this paper. We first develop a new user
   equilibrium model to describe the equilibrium flow distribution across a
   road network where charging lanes are deployed. Drivers of electric
   vehicles, when traveling between their origins and destinations, are
   assumed to select routes and decide battery recharging plans to minimize
   their trip times while ensuring to complete their trips without running
   out of charge. The battery recharging plan will dictate which charging
   lane to use, how long to charge and at what speed to operate an electric
   vehicle. The speed will affect the amount of energy recharged as well as
   travel time. With the established user equilibrium conditions, we
   further formulate the deployment of charging lanes as a mathematical
   program with complementarity constraints. Both the network equilibrium
   and design models are solved by effective solution algorithms and
   demonstrated with numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The value of seasonal forecasts for irrigated, supplementary irrigated,
   and rainfed wheat cropping systems in northwest Mexico}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{76-86}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Half of global wheat production occurs in irrigated cropping regions
   that face increasing water shortages. In these regions, seasonal
   forecasts could provide information about in-season climate conditions
   that could improve resource management, helping to save water and other
   inputs. However, seasonal forecasts have not been tested in irrigated
   systems. In this study, we show that seasonal forecasts have the
   potential to guide crop management decisions in fully irrigated systems
   (FIS), reduced irrigation systems (supplementary irrigation; SIS), and
   systems without irrigation (rainfed; RFS) in an arid environment. We
   found that farmers could gain an additional 2 USD ha(-1) season(-1) in
   net returns and save up to 26 USD ha(-1) season(-1) in N fertilizer
   costs with a hypothetical always-correct-season-type-forecast (ACF) in a
   fully irrigated system compared to simulated optimized N fertilizer
   applications. In supplementary irrigated systems, an ACF had value when
   deciding on sowing a crop (plus supplementary irrigation) of up to 65
   USD ha(-1) season(-1). In rainfed systems, this value was up to 123 USD
   ha(-1) when deciding whether or not to sow a crop. In supplementary
   irrigated and rainfed systems, such value depended on initial soil water
   conditions. Seasonal forecasts have the potential to assist farmers in
   irrigated, supplementary irrigated, and rainfed cropping systems to
   maximize crop profitability. However, forecasts currently available
   based on Global Circulation Models (GCM) and the El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) need higher forecast skill before such benefits can
   be fully realized. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Materials Project based open-source Python tool, MPInterfaces, has
   been developed to automate the high-throughput computational screening
   and study of interfacial systems. The framework encompasses creation and
   manipulation of interface structures for solid/solid hetero-structures,
   solid/implicit solvents systems, nanoparticle/ligands systems; and the
   creation of simple system-agnostic workflows for in depth computational
   analysis using density-functional theory or empirical energy models. The
   package leverages existing open-source high-throughput tools and extends
   their capabilities towards the understanding of interfacial systems. We
   describe the various algorithms and methods implemented in the package.
   Using several test cases, we demonstrate how the package enables
   high-throughput computational screening of advanced materials, directly
   contributing to the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), which aims to
   accelerate the discovery, development, and deployment of new materials.

Title = {{Student support and perceptions of urine source separation in a
   university community}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{146-156}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Urine source separation, i.e., the collection and treatment of human
   urine as a separate waste stream, has the potential to improve many
   aspects of water resource management and wastewater treatment. However,
   social considerations must be taken into consideration for successful
   implementation of this alternative wastewater system. This work
   evaluated the perceptions of urine source separation held by students
   living on-campus at a major university in the Southeastern region of the
   United States. Perceptions were evaluated in the context of the Theory
   of Planned Behavior. The survey population represents one group within a
   community type (universities) that is expected to be an excellent
   testbed for urine source separation. Overall, respondents reported high
   levels of support for urine source separation after watching a video on
   expected benefits and risks, e.g., 84\% indicated that they would vote
   in favor of urine source separation in residence halls. Support was less
   apparent when measured by willingness to pay, as 33\% of respondents
   were unwilling to pay for the implementation of urine source separation
   and 40\% were only willing to pay \$1 to \$10 per semester. Water
   conservation was largely identified as the most important benefit of
   urine source separation and there was little concern reported about the
   use of urine-based fertilizers. Statistical analyses showed that one's
   environmental attitude, environmental behavior, perceptions of support
   within the university community, and belief that student opinions have
   an impact on university decision makers were significantly correlated
   with one's support for urine source separation. This work helps identify
   community characteristics that lend themselves to acceptance of urine
   source separation, such as those related to environmental
   attitudes/behaviors and perceptions of behavioral control and subjective
   norm. Critical aspects of these alternative wastewater systems that
   require attention in order to foster public acceptance after
   implementation are also highlighted, such as convenient and
   aesthetically pleasing methods for waterless toilet paper disposal. (C)

Abstract = {{We present new high-speed video observations of a natural downward

   individual leader steps were recorded. The time intervals between the
   step pulses ranged from 13.9 to 23.9 mu s, with a mean value of 17.4 mu
   s. Further, for the first time, smaller pulses were observed between the
   pronounced step pulses in the magnetic field derivative records. Time
   intervals between the smaller pulses (indicative of intermittent
   processes between steps) ranged from 0.9 to 5.5 mu s, with a mean of 22
   mu s and a standard deviation of 0.82 mu s. A total of 23 luminous
   segments, commonly attributed to space stems/leaders, were captured.
   Their two-dimensional lengths varied from 1 to 13 m, with a mean of 5 m.
   The distances between the luminous segments and the existing leader
   channels ranged from 1 to 8 m, with a mean value of 4 m. Three possible
   scenarios of the evolution of space stems/leaders located beside the
   leader channel have been inferred: (A) the space stem/leader fails to
   make connection to the leader channel; (B) the space stem/leader
   connects to the existing leader channel, but may die off and be
   followed, tens of microseconds later, by a low luminosity streamer; (C)
   the space stem/leader connects to the existing channel and launches an
   upward-propagating luminosity wave. Weakly luminous filamentary
   structures, which we interpreted as corona streamers, were observed
   emanating from the leader tip. The stepped leader branches extended
   downward with speeds ranging from 4.1 x 10(5) to 14.6 x 10(5) m s(-1).

Abstract = {{Accurately predicting the fate and transport of nano-TiO2 in porous
   media is critical to assess its environmental impact. This study was
   designed to understand the effects of gain size and structural
   heterogeneity under different ionic strength (IS) on the fate and
   transport of nano-TiO2 in saturated porous media. In the columns packed
   homogenously with sand of different grain sizes (920, 550, 390, and 275
   pm), the transport of nano-TiO2 decreased when the IS increased from 0.1
   to 1 or 10 mM. for all the three IS conditions, the retention of the
   nano-TiO2 particles in the columns increased when the gain size
   decreased, and the mobility of the nano-TiO2 was the lowest in the sand
   at size of 275 pm with recovery rates of 0.30\% to 172\%. The mass
   recovery rates of TiO2 in other homogeneous columns were higher and
   ranged from 0.37\% to 59.9\%. Structural heterogeneity created two flow
   domains for the retention and transport of nano-TiO2 particles in the
   saturated porous media. The fast-flow domain dominated the flow and
   transport processes of the nano-TiO2 in the heterogeneous columns under
   the tested conditions. As a result, the transport of nano-TiO2 in the
   heterogeneous porous media was faster and higher than that in the
   homogeneous columns under similar experimental conditions. Because of
   the dominance of the fast-flow domain, the recovery rates of the
   nano-TiO2 in the heterogeneous columns were similar and ranged from
   59.8\% to 66.9\%. These results reflected the importance of preferential
   flow to the fate and transport of nano-TiO2 particle in porous media.
   Simulations from a two-domain model matched the experimental
   breakthrough curves very well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A 2-phase constructive algorithm for cumulative vehicle routing problems
   with limited duration}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{48-58}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The Clarke \& Wright (C\&W) algorithm is one of the most widely used
   classical heuristics in capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) in
   which a linear function of distance is considered as the objective
   function. The C\&W algorithm is very simple and easy to implement, and
   produces fairly good solutions very fast. In this study, the C\&W
   algorithm is adopted for the cumulative VRP with limited duration
   (CumVRP-LD) where load is also considered in the objective function as
   well as distance. The most common applications of cumulative VRPs are
   the determination of routing policies that minimize total fuel
   consumption. A 2-phase constructive heuristic approach including the
   K-means clustering algorithm is proposed to improve the computational
   performance of the modified C\&W algorithm for CumVRP-LD. The main
   contribution of this study is the definition of a new extended
   formulation that captures truckload and travel distance by considering
   the unique characteristics of the problem and to develop a fast and easy
   implemented constructive algorithm for CumVRP-LD. Such approaches are
   necessary for the development of systems that respond fast, possibly
   online, to changes in the real problem situations. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper a frequency domain formulation for nonlinear arcing fault
   location is presented. The proposed fault location formulation uses as
   input data first cycles after the fault inception voltages and currents.
   The formulation is based on circuit analysis and a parameter estimation
   method. To consider the main characteristics of nonlinear arcing faults,
   a time varying resistance embedded in a nonlinear model is proposed and
   used. The formulation is developed for the case of the most frequent
   single line-to-ground faults using phase components. The effects of
   fault inception angle, time-varying series resistance, source impedance,
   load flow, sampling frequency and others factors are investigated and
   analyzed. This new approach was successfully tested through computer
   simulation and real data obtained from a Southern Brazilian Energy
   Utility. The proposed method was developed as dedicated software and is
   currently used by CEEE-GT. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters (HEFs), which are
   composed of an active filter and a passive filter, have been proposed to
   reduce the size and weight of conventional passive EMI filters in

   stability and performance of HEFs have not been developed. To cope with
   this, this paper presents a modeling technique for a hybrid common-mode
   (CM) filter. The technique can be applied to the modeling of other HEFs.
   Critical component models were first developed for the HEF. HEF's
   overall model was further developed based on these individual component
   models. Experimental results validated that the developed model can
   successfully predict the stability and performance of active/hybrid CM
   filters.}},

Abstract = {{The family of layered M(n+1)AX(n) compounds provides a large class of
   materials with applications ranging from magnets to high-temperature
   coatings to nuclear cladding. In this work, we employ a
   density-functional-theory-based discovery approach to identify a large
   number of thermodynamically stable M(n+1)AX(n) compounds, where n = 1, M
   = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta; A = Al, Si, P, S, Ga, Ge, As, Cd,
   In, Sn, Tl, Pb; and X = C, N. We calculate the formation energy for 216
   pure M(2)AX compounds and 10 314 solid solutions, (MM')(2)(AA')(XX'),
   relative to their competing phases. We find that the 49 experimentally
   known M(2)AX phases exhibit formation energies of less than 30 meV/atom.
   Among the 10 530 compositions considered, 3140 exhibit formation
   energies below 30 meV/atom, most of which have yet to be experimentally
   synthesized. A significant subset of 301 compositions exhibits strong
   exothermic stability in excess of 100 meV/atom, indicating favorable
   synthesis conditions. We identify empirical design rules for stable
   M(2)AX compounds. Among the metastable M(2)AX compounds are two Cr-based
   compounds with ferromagnetic ordering and expected Curie temperatures
   around 75 K. These results can serve as a map for the experimental
   design and synthesis of different M(2)AX compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Recognized as one of the world's most vital natural and cultural
   resources, the Amazon faces a wide variety of threats from natural
   resource and infrastructure development. Within this context, rigorous
   scientific study of the region's complex social-ecological system is
   critical to inform and direct decision-making toward more sustainable
   environmental and social outcomes. Given the Amazon's tightly linked
   social and ecological components and the scope of potential development
   impacts, effective study of this system requires an easily accessible
   resource that provides a broad and reliable data baseline. This paper
   brings together multiple datasets from diverse disciplines (including
   human health, socio-economics, environment, hydrology, and energy) to
   provide investigators with a variety of baseline data to explore the
   multiple long-term effects of infrastructure development in the

Abstract = {{Some of the more attractive semiconducting compounds for ambient
   temperature radiation detector applications are impacted by low charge
   collection efficiency due to the presence of point and volumetric
   defects. This has been particularly true in the case of BiI3, which
   features very attractive properties (density, atomic number, band gap,
   etc.) to serve as a gamma ray detector, but has yet to demonstrate its
   full potential. We show that by applying growth techniques tailored to
   reduce defects, the spectral performance of this promising semiconductor
   can be realized. Gamma ray spectra from >100 keV source emissions are
   now obtained from high quality Sb:BiI3 bulk crystals with limited
   concentrations of defects (point and extended). The spectra acquired in
   these high quality crystals feature photopeaks with resolution of 2.2\%
   at 662 keV. Infrared microscopy is used to compare the local
   microstructure between radiation sensitive and non-responsive crystals.
   This work demonstrates that BiI3 can be prepared in melt-grown
   detector-grade samples with superior quality and can acquire the spectra
   from a variety of gamma ray sources. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the molecular adsorption of methane, ethane, propane and
   n-butane on stoichiometric and oxygen-rich RuO2(110) surfaces using
   temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and dispersion-corrected density
   functional theory (DFT-D3) calculations. We find that each alkane
   adsorbs strongly on the coordinatively-unsaturated Ru (Ru-cus) atoms of
   s-RuO2(110), with desorption from this state producing a well-defined
   TPD peak at low alkane coverage. As the coverage increases, we find that
   alkanes first form a compressed layer on the Ru-cus atoms and
   subsequently adsorb on the bridging O atoms of the surface until the
   monolayer saturates. DFT-D3 calculations predict that methane
   preferentially adsorbs on top of a Rucus atom and that the C-2 to C-4
   alkanes preferentially adopt bidentate configurations in which each
   molecule aligns parallel to the Ru-cus atom row and datively bonds to
   neighboring Ru-cus atoms. DFT-D3 predicts binding energies that agree
   quantitatively with our experimental estimates for alkane
   sigma-complexes on RuO2(110). We find that oxygen atoms adsorbed on top
   of Ru-cus atoms (O-ot atoms) stabilize the adsorbed alkane complexes
   that bind in a given configuration, while also blocking the sites needed
   for sigma-complex formation. This site blocking causes the coverage of
   the most stable, bidentate alkane complexes to decrease sharply with
   increasing O-ot coverage. Concurrently, we find that a new peak develops
   in the C-2 to C-4 alkane TPD spectra with increasing O-ot coverage, and
   that the desorption yield in this TPD feature passes through a maximum
   at O-ot coverages between similar to 50\% and 60\%. We present evidence
   that the new TPD peak arises from C-2 to C-4 alkanes that adsorb in
   upright, monodentate configurations on stranded Ru-cus sites located
   within the O-ot layer.}},

   implications for the attachment process in lightning are discussed.
   Optical images obtained with three different high-speed cameras (visible
   range with image enhancement, visible-range regular, and infrared) and
   corresponding current recordings were used. Two snapshots of the
   breakthrough phase of the leader connection, showing significant leader
   branching inside the common streamer zone, are presented for the first
   time. Positive and negative leader speeds inside the common streamer
   zone for two events were found to be similar. Higher leader speeds were
   generally associated with higher leader currents. In the case of
   head-to-head leader connection, the infrared brightness of the junction
   region (probably representing the gas temperature and, hence, the energy
   input) was typically a factor of 5 or so higher than for channel
   sections either below or above that region. In 16\% of cases, the
   downward negative leader connected to the upward positive leader below
   its tip (attached to the lateral surface of the positive leader), with

Title = {{Observational constraints on glyoxal production from isoprene oxidation
   and its contribution to organic aerosol over the Southeast United States}},

Abstract = {{We use a 0-D photochemical box model and a 3-D global chemistry-climate
   model, combined with observations from the NOAA Southeast Nexus (SENEX)
   aircraft campaign, to understand the sources and sinks of glyoxal over
   the Southeast United States. Box model simulations suggest a large
   difference in glyoxal production among three isoprene oxidation
   mechanisms (AM3ST, AM3B, and Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) v3.3.1).
   These mechanisms are then implemented into a 3-D global
   chemistry-climate model. Comparison with field observations shows that
   the average vertical profile of glyoxal is best reproduced by AM3ST with
   an effective reactive uptake coefficient.glyx of 2 x 10(-3) and AM3B
   without heterogeneous loss of glyoxal. The two mechanisms lead to 0-0.8
   mu gm(-3) secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from glyoxal in the boundary
   layer of the Southeast U.S. in summer. We consider this to be the lower
   limit for the contribution of glyoxal to SOA, as other sources of
   glyoxal other than isoprene are not included in our model. In addition,
   we find that AM3B shows better agreement on both formaldehyde and the
   correlation between glyoxal and formaldehyde (RGF = {[}GLYX]/{[}HCHO]),
   resulting from the suppression of d-isoprene peroxy radicals. We also
   find that MCM v3.3.1 may underestimate glyoxal production from isoprene
   oxidation, in part due to an underestimated yield from the reaction of
   isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX) peroxy radicals with HO2. Our work highlights
   that the gas-phase production of glyoxal represents a large uncertainty
   in quantifying its contribution to SOA.}},

Title = {{Unified slip boundary condition for fluid flows}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Determining the correct matching boundary condition is fundamental to
   our understanding of several everyday problems. Despite over a century
   of scientific work, existing velocity boundary conditions are unable to
   consistently explain and capture the complete physics associated with
   certain common but complex problems, such as moving contact lines and
   corner flows. The widely used Maxwell and Navier slip boundary
   conditions make an implicit assumption that velocity varies only in the
   wall normal direction. This makes their boundary condition inapplicable
   in the vicinity of contact lines and corner points, where velocity
   gradient exists both in the wall normal and wall tangential directions.
   In this paper, by identifying this implicit assumption we are able to
   extend Maxwell's slip model. Here, we present a generalized velocity
   boundary condition that shows that slip velocity is a function of not
   only the shear rate but also the linear strain rate. In addition, we
   present a universal relation for slip length, which shows that, for a
   general flow, slip length is a function of the principal strain rate.
   The universal relation for slip length along with the generalized
   velocity boundary condition provides a unified slip boundary condition
   to model a wide range of steady Newtonian fluid flows. We validate the
   unified slip boundary for simple Newtonian liquids by using molecular
   dynamics simulations and studying both the moving contact line and
   corner flow problems.}},

   RNA-Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Binding Events}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Pentatricopeptide repeat containing proteins (PPRs) bind to RNA
   transcripts originating from mitochondria and plastids. There are two
   classes of PPR proteins. The P class contains tandem P-type motif
   sequences, and the PLS class contains alternating P, L and S type
   sequences. In this paper, we describe a novel tool that predicts PPR-RNA
   interaction; specifically, our method, which we call aPPRove, determines
   where and how a PLS-class PPR protein will bind to RNA when given a PPR
   and one or more RNA transcripts by using a combinatorial binding code
   for site specificity proposed by Barkan et al. Our results demonstrate
   that aPPRove successfully locates how and where a PPR protein belonging
   to the PLS class can bind to RNA. For each binding event it outputs the
   binding site, the aminoacid-nucleotide interaction, and its statistical
   significance. Furthermore, we show that our method can be used to
   predict binding events for PLS-class proteins using a known edit site
   and the statistical significance of aligning the PPR protein to that
   site. In particular, we use our method to make a conjecture regarding an
   interaction between CLB19 and the second intronic region of ycf3. The

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric films have vast applications due to
   their dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties that meet
   the requirements of sensors, nonvolatile ferroelectric random access
   memory (NVFeRAM) devices, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).
   However, the small surface area of these 2D ferroelectric films has
   limited their ability to achieve higher memory storage density in
   NVFeRAM devices and more sensitive sensors and transducer. Thus,
   conformally deposited ferroelectric films have been actively studied for
   these applications in order to create three-dimensional (3D) structures,
   which lead to a larger surface area. Most of the current methods
   developed for the conformal deposition of ferroelectric films, such as
   metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and plasma-enhanced
   vapor deposition (PECVD), are limited by high temperatures and unstable
   and toxic organic precursors. In this paper, an innovative fabrication
   method for barium titanate (BaTiO3) textured films with 3D architectures
   is introduced to alleviate these issues. This fabrication method is
   based on converting conformally grown rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays into
   BaTiO3 textured films using a simple two-step hydrothermal process which
   allows for thickness-controlled growth of conformal films on patterned
   silicon wafers coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Moreover, the
   processing parameters have been optimized to achieve a high
   piezoelectric coupling coefficient of 100 pm/V. This high piezoelectric
   response along with high relative dielectric constant (epsilon(r) =
   1600) of the conformally grown textured BaTiO3 films demonstrates their
   potential application in sensors, NVFeRAM, and MEMS.}},

Title = {{Physics of Fluid Transport in Hybrid Biporous Capillary Wicking

Abstract = {{The mass transport capacity (i.e., the capillary limit,) of homogeneous
   wicks is limited by the inverse relation between the capillary pressure
   and permeability. Hybrid wicks with two or more distinct pore sizes have
   been proposed as alternative geometries to enhance the capillary limit.
   In this study, the impact of the two hybridization schemes in-plane and
   out-of-plane on the capillary transport of hybrid wicks is studied.
   Experimental data from in plane hybrid wicks in conjunction with a
   theoretical model show that local changes in the curvature of the liquid
   vapor meniscus (i.e., pore size) do not result in a higher mass flow
   rate than that of a comparable homogeneous wick. Instead, a global
   change in the curvature of the liquid vapor meniscus (as occurring in
   out-of-plane hybrid wicks) is necessary for obtaining mass flow rates
   greater than that of a homogeneous wick. Therefore, the physics of
   capillary limit and dryout in out-of-plane hybrid wicks is investigated
   using a hybrid wick consisting of a 1-mu m-thick highly porous mesh
   suspended over a homogeneous array of micropillars. A study of the
   dryout process within the structure revealed that the presence of the
   mesh strongly alters the dryout mechanism. Visualization studies showed
   that out-of-plane hybrid wicks remain operational only as long as the
   liquid is constrained within the mesh pores; recession of the meniscus
   just below the mesh results in instantaneous local dryout. To maintain
   liquid within the mesh structure, the mesh thickness was increased, and
   it was determined that the mesh thickness plays the key role in the
   performance of an out-of-plane hybrid wick.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{The high coercive field, E-c, of congruent LiNbO3 can be reduced by
   doping with Mg or Zn atoms, or by increasing the temperature above a
   threshold value. The physical origin for this reduction is not currently
   understood. Here, density functional theory calculations illustrate the
   atomic origin of the change in the switching field of the congruent
   LiNbO3. They show that the high E-c in the congruent LiNbO3 is a result
   of niobium antisite atoms on the lithium sublattice, pinning the motion
   of the domain walls. Thus, the healing of antisites by diffusion can
   significantly reduce the coercive field. In addition, this work
   demonstrates that the migration of these niobium antisites can be
   enhanced by doping or by changing the temperature. Thus, the depinning
   process of the congruent LiNbO3 is understood by the migration of the
   niobium antisite defect across the domain wall. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{Ultrafast energy and electron transfer (EnT and ET, respectively) are
   characterized in a light-harvesting assembly based on a pi-conjugated
   polymer (poly(fluorene)) functionalized with broadly absorbing pendant
   organic isoindigo (iI) chromophores using a combination of femtosecond
   transient absorption spectroscopy and large-scale computer simulation.
   Photoexcitation of the pi-conjugated polymer leads to near-unity The of
   the excitation through a combination of EnT and ET to the iI pendants.
   The excited pendants formed by EnT rapidly relax within 30 ps, whereas
   recombination of the charge-separated state formed following ET occurs
   within 1200 ps. A computer model of the excited-state, processes is
   developed by combining all-atom Molecular dynamics simulations, which
   provides a molecular-level view of the assembly structure, with a
   kinetic model that accounts for the multiple excited-state quenching
   pathways. Direct comparison of the simulations with experimental data
   reveals that the underlying structure has a dramatic effect on the
   partitioning between EnT and ET in the polymer assembly, where the
   distance and orientation of the pendants in relation to the backbone
   serve to direct the dominant quenching pathway.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a direct numerical simulation analysis of the force
   distribution within a cluster of monodisperse spherical particles. A
   direct forcing immersed boundary method is used to calculate the forces
   on individual particles for a volume fraction range of 0.11 <= phi <=
   0.44 and a Reynolds number range of 1.47 <= Re <= 636. The hydrodynamic
   streamwise force is shown to have a normal distribution with a standard
   deviation ratio to the mean drag that decreases with increasing volume
   fraction and ranges between 17\% and 26\%. The lift forces also follow a
   normal distribution that has a significant standard deviation to mean
   drag ratio of around 14.5\%, which does not vary significantly with the
   Reynolds number and volume fraction. A model is introduced that adds the
   identified normal distribution of the forces to the quasisteady force
   used in point-particle models. A nonisotropic method of defining spatial
   parameters is presented. It highlights the contribution of each
   parameter to the variation of the forces on each particle. The results
   show that the drag is influenced by the closest four to eight
   neighboring spheres. The drag force is highly dependent on the
   streamwise distances of the spheres located upstream. For low volume
   fractions and Reynolds number, the lateral distances of the spheres
   located downstream also have a significant contribution to those
   variations. The results also show that the lateral force variation is
   mostly dictated by the lateral distance of one to two spheres located
   upstream of each sphere.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial dynamics of water in contact with bare, oxidized, and

   to the findings of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The

   consistent with those determined with DFT. The COMB3 potential is then
   used to investigate the wetting behavior of water nanodroplets on.
   Cu(111) at 20, 130, and 300 K. At room temperature, the simulations
   predict that the spreading rate of,the base radius,.Ro, of a water
   droplet with a diameter of about 1.5 nm exhibits a spreading rate of Ro
   Pa and a final base radius of 3.5 nth. At 20 and 130 K, water droplets
   are predicted to retain their structure after adsorption on Cu(111) and
   to undergo minimal spreading in agreement with scanning tunneling
   microscopy data. When the same water droplet encounters a reconstructed,
   oxidized Cu(111) surface, the classical MD simulations predict wetting
   with a spreading rate of R approximate to t(0.14) and a final base
   radius of 3.0 nm our MD simulations predict a spreading rate of R
   approximate to t(0.14) and a final base radius of 2.5 nm when water
   encounters OH-covered Cu(111). These results indicate that oxidation and
   hydroxylation cause a reduction in the degree of spreading and final
   base radius that is directly associated with a decreased spreading rate

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore longitudinal changes in brain activity in patients
   with Parkinson disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and
   progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) using task-based functional MRI
   (fMRI).
   Methods: A total of 112 individuals were scanned 1 year apart while
   performing a unimanual grip force task: 46 PD, 13 MSA, 19 PSP, and 34
   healthy controls. The outcome measure was percent signal change in
   prespecified regions of interest: putamen, primary motor cortex (M1),
   supplementary motor area (SMA), and superior motor regions of the
   cerebellum (lobules V-VI).
   Results: Patients with PD showed a decline in functional activity over
   the course of 1 year in the putamen and M1 compared to controls. Changes
   after 1 year in MSA were exclusively extrastriatal, and included a
   reduction in functional activity in M1, SMA, and superior cerebellum. In
   PSP, all regions of interest were less active at 1 year compared to
   baseline. The functional activity of these regions did not change in the
   control group.
   Conclusions: We provide evidence using task-based fMRI for cortical and
   striatal functional deterioration in PD over a 1-year period of time.
   Results also describe more widespread and unique patterns of functional
   changes in MSA and PSP compared to PD, suggesting distinct rates of
   disease progression in parkinsonian disorders that may assist in future
   clinical studies testing the potential efficacy of disease-modifying
   therapies.}},

Title = {{Robust calibration model transfer}},
Journal = {{CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS}},

Pages = {{62-71}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Calibration model transfer is an important issue in infrared spectra
   analysis. For identical sample, spectra collected with master and slave
   spectrometers share same components. In the sense of mathematics, they
   share same basis. If the basis and corresponding coefficient matrices
   can be obtained, the model transfer can be efficiently realized. On the
   other hand, the performance of calibration model transfer method will
   degrade if there are outliers and noise in samples. In this paper, a
   robust calibration transfer model is proposed. Cauchy estimator are
   employed to learn same basis shared by master and slave spectra
   robustly. Transformation matrix can be calculated with the two
   corresponding coefficient matrices. Slave testing spectra are
   represented with the common basis and corresponding coefficients are
   then transferred using the transformation matrix. The slave testing
   spectra can be transferred using common basis and the corrected
   coefficients. The convergence property and bound of proposed model are
   also discussed. Extensive experiments are conducted, experimental
   results demonstrate that our robust calibration transfer model can
   generally outperform the existing methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{To overcome the limits of graphene oxide (GO) as a novel sorbent for
   heavy metal removal (e.g., low sorption selectivity and difficulty in
   solid-liquid separation), a nanocomposite (HMO@GO) with excellent
   settling ability (<2 min) was fabricated through in situ growing
   nanosized hydrated manganese oxide (HMO) (10.8 +/- 4.1 nm) on GO. As a
   graphene-based adsorbent, HMO@GO exhibited fast sorption kinetics (<20
   min). Meanwhile, the introduced HMO endowed HMO@GO with outstanding
   sorption selectivity and capacity toward Pb(II) (>500 mg g(-1)) in the
   presence of high-level competing Ca(II). Cyclic sorption batches showed
   that 1 kg HMO@GO can treat at least 22 m(3) Pb(II)-laden synthetic
   industrial drainage (5 mg L-1 Pb(II)) and 40 m(3) drinking water (0.5 mg
   L-1 Pb(II)) to their corresponding limits (0.1 mg L-1 for wastewater and
   10 mu g L-1 for drinking water) enforced in China. Additionally, the
   exhausted HMO@GO can be effectively regenerated using 0.3 M HCI for
   repeated uses. The eminent performance of HMO@GO was attributed to its
   specific structure, that is, the abundant oxygen-containing groups on GO
   mediated the growth of highly dispersed HMO that preferably sequestrated
   Pb(II) through specific interaction, and the host GO offered the
   preconcentration of Pb(II) for enhanced sequestration through the Donnan
   membrane effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study considers the effects of the financial institutions' local

   multivariate GARCH model (DCC-MVGARCH). Financial networks are
   constructed from dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) with graph

   dynamics of systemic risk contributions of financial institution. Also
   we study dynamics of financial institution's local topology structure in
   the financial network. Finally, we analyze the quantitative
   relationships between the local topology structure and systemic risk
   contribution with panel data regression analysis. We find that financial
   institutions with greater node strength, larger node betweenness
   centrality, larger node closeness centrality and larger node clustering
   coefficient tend to be associated with larger systemic risk

Abstract = {{We demonstrate how dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements (DMS)

   which the characteristic Brownian and Neel relaxation times are widely
   separated. First, we illustrate this using magnetic fluids consisting of
   mixtures of particles that relax solely by the Brownian or Neel
   mechanisms. Then, it is shown how the same approach can be applied to
   estimate the relative contributions of Brownian and Neel relaxation in a
   suspension consisting of particles obtained from a single synthesis and

Abstract = {{While the symbol map for the collection of bounded Toeplitz operators is
   well studied, there has been little work on a symbol map for densely

   the Samson sub-symbols, is introduced as a means of reproducing the
   symbol of a densely defined Toeplitz operator. This leads to a partial
   answer to a question posed by Donald Samson in 2008. In the bounded case
   the Toeplitzness of an operator can be classified in terms of its
   Sasason. sub-symbols. This justifies the investigation into the
   application of the Sarason sub-symbols on densely defined operators. It
   is shown that analytic closed densely defined Toeplitz operators are
   completely determined by their Samson sub symbols, and it is shown for a
   broader class of operators that they extend closed densely defined
   Toeplitz operators (of multiplication type). (C) 2016 Published by

Title = {{Polyvinylpyrrolidone and arsenic-induced changes in biological responses
   of model aquatic organisms exposed to iron-based nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{The efficiency of zero-valent iron particles used in the remediation of
   contaminated groundwater has, with the emergence of nanotechnology,
   stimulated interest on the use of nano-size particles to take advantage
   of high-specific surface area and reactivity characteristics of
   nanoparticles (NPs). Accordingly, engineered iron-NPs are among the most
   widely used nanomaterials for in situ remediation. However, while
   several ecotoxicity studies have been conducted to investigate the
   adverse impacts of these NPs on aquatic organisms, research on the
   implications of spent iron-based NPs is lacking. In this study, a
   comparative approach is used, in which the biological effects of three
   iron-based NPs (Fe3O4 and gamma-Fe2O3 NPs with particle sizes ranging
   from 20 to 50 nm, and Fe-0-NPs with an average particle size of 40 nm)
   on Raphidocelis subcapitata (formely known as Pseudokirchneriella
   subcapitata) and Daphnia magna were investigated using both as-prepared
   and pollutant-doped Fe-based NPs. For the latter, arsenic (As) was used
   as example sorbed pollutant. The results show that improved degree of NP
   dispersion by use of polyvinylpyrrolidone overlapped with both increased
   arsenic adsorption capacity and toxicity to the tested organisms. For R.
   subcapitata, Fe-oxide NPs were more toxic than Fe-0-NPs, due primarily
   to differences in the degree of NPs aggregation and ability to produce
   reactive oxygen species. For the invertebrate D. magna, a similar trend
   of biological responses was observed, except that sorption of As to
   Fe-0-NPs significantly increased the toxic response when compared to R.
   subcapitata. Overall, these findings point to the need for research on
   downstream implications of NP-pollutant complexes generated during water
   treatment by injection of NPs into aquatic systems.}},

   projections to general circulation models, the evapotranspiration

Abstract = {{Projecting water deficit under various possible future climate scenarios
   depends on the choice of general circulation model (GCM), reference
   evapotranspiration (ET0) estimation method, and Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) trajectory. The relative contribution of
   each of these factors must be evaluated in order to choose an
   appropriate ensemble of future scenarios for water resources planning.
   In this study variance-based global sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo
   filtering were used to evaluate the relative sensitivity of projected
   changes in precipitation (P), ET0, and water deficit (defined here as
   P-ET0) to choice of GCM, ET0 estimation method, and RCP trajectory over
   the continental United States (US) for two distinct future periods:
   2030-2060 (future period 1) and 2070-2100 (future period 2). A total of
   9 GCMs, 10 ET0 methods, and 3 RCP trajectories were used to quantify the
   range of future projections and estimate the relative sensitivity of
   future projections to each of these factors. In general, for all regions
   of the continental US, changes in future precipitation are most
   sensitive to the choice of GCM, while changes in future ET0 are most
   sensitive to the choice of ET0 estimation method. For changes in future
   water deficit, the choice of GCM is the most influential factor in the
   cool season (December-March), and the choice of ET0 estimation method is
   most important in the warm season (May-October) for all regions except
   the Southeast US, where GCMs and ET0 have approximately equal influence
   throughout most of the year. Although the choice of RCP trajectory is
   generally less important than the choice of GCM or ET0 method, the
   impact of RCP trajectory increases in future period 2 over future period
   1 for all factors. Monte Carlo filtering results indicate that
   particular GCMs and ET0 methods drive the projection of wetter or drier
   future conditions much more than RCP trajectory; however, the set of
   GCMs and ET0 methods that produce wetter or drier projections varies
   substantially by region. Results of this study indicate that, in
   addition to using an ensemble of GCMs and several RCP trajectories, a
   range of regionally relevant ET0 estimation methods should be used to
   develop a robust range of future conditions for water resources planning
   under climate change.}},

Title = {{Effects of tangential-type boundary condition discontinuities on the
   accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann method for heat and mass transfer}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{We present a systematic study on the effects of tangential-type boundary
   condition discontinuities on the accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann
   equation (LBE) method for Dirichlet and Neumann problems in heat and
   mass transfer modeling. The second-order accurate boundary condition
   treatments for continuous Dirichlet and Neumann problems are directly
   implemented for the corresponding discontinuous boundary conditions.
   Results from three numerical tests, including both straight and curved
   boundaries, are presented to show the accuracy and order of convergence
   of the LBE computations. Detailed error assessments are conducted for
   the interior temperature or concentration (denoted as a scalar phi) and
   the interior derivatives of phi for both types of boundary conditions,
   for the boundary flux in the Dirichlet problem and for the boundary phi
   values in the Neumann problem. When the discontinuity point on the
   straight boundary is placed at the center of the unit lattice in the
   Dirichlet problem, it yields only first-order accuracy for the interior
   distribution of phi, first-order accuracy for the boundary flux, and
   zeroth-order accuracy for the interior derivatives compared with the
   second-order accuracy of all quantities of interest for continuous
   boundary conditions. On the lattice scale, the LBE solution for the
   interior derivatives near the singularity is largely independent of the
   resolution and correspondingly the local distribution of the absolute
   errors is almost invariant with the changing resolution. For Neumann
   problems, when the discontinuity is placed at the lattice center,
   second-order accuracy is preserved for the interior distribution of phi;
   and a ``superlinear{''} convergence order of 1.5 for the boundary phi
   values and first-order accuracy for the interior derivatives are
   obtained. For straight boundaries with the discontinuity point
   arbitrarily placed within the lattice and curved boundaries, the
   boundary flux becomes zeroth-order accurate for Dirichlet problems; and
   all three quantities, including the interior and boundary phi values and
   the interior derivatives, are only first-order accurate for Neumann
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for sustainable energy results in the development
   of new technologies of energy generation. The key objective of hydrogen
   economy is the introduction of hydrogen as main energy carrier, along
   with electricity, on a global scale. The key goal is the development of
   hydrogen-related technologies needed for hydrogen generation, hydrogen
   storage, hydrogen transportation and hydrogen distribution as well as
   hydrogen safety systems. It is commonly believed that hydrogen is
   environmentally clean since its combustion results in the formation of
   water. However, the technology currently employed for the generation of
   hydrogen from natural gas, does in fact lead to the emission of
   greenhouse gases and climate change. Therefore, the key issues in the
   introduction of hydrogen economy involve the development of
   environmentally clean hydrogen production technology as well as storage
   and transport. The clean options available for hydrogen generation using
   nuclear energy; such as advanced nuclear fission and, ultimately,
   nuclear fusion, are discussed. The latter, which is environmentally
   clean, is expected to be the primary approach in the production of
   hydrogen fuel at the global scale. The present work considers the effect
   of hydrogen on properties of TiO2 and its solid solutions in the
   contexts of photocatalytic energy conversion and the effect of tritium
   on advanced tritium breeders. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Abstract = {{Field effect transistors (FETs) using SiO2 and Al2O3 as the gate oxides
   for the back and front sides, respectively, were fabricated on
   exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) beta-Ga2O3 nano-belts transferred to a
   SiO2/Si substrate. The mechanical exfoliation and transfer process
   produced nano-belts with smooth surface morphologies and a uniform low
   defect density interface with the SiO2/Si substrate. The depletion mode
   nanobelt transistors exhibited better channel modulation with both front
   and back gates operational compared to either front or back-gating
   alone. The maximum transconductance was similar to 4.4 mS mm(-1) with
   front and back-gating and similar to 3.7 mS mm(-1) with front-gating
   only and a maximum drain source current density of 60 mA mm(-1) was
   achieved at a drain-source voltage of 10 V. The FETs had on/off ratios
   of similar to 10(5) at 25 degrees C with gate-source current densities
   of similar to 2 x 10(-3) mA mm(-1) at a gate voltage of -30 V. The
   device characteristics were stable over more than a month for storage in

Abstract = {{Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging tomographic imaging
   technology that detects magnetic nanoparticle tracers by exploiting
   their non-linear magnetization properties. In order to predict the
   behavior of nanoparticles in an imager, it is possible to use a
   non-imaging MPI relaxometer or spectrometer to characterize the behavior
   of nanoparticles in a controlled setting. In this paper we explore the
   use of ferrohydrodynamic magnetization equations for predicting the
   response of particles in an MPI relaxometer. These include a
   magnetization equation developed by Shliomis (Sh) which has a constant
   relaxation time and a magnetization equation which uses a
   field-dependent relaxation time developed by Martsenyuk, Raikher and
   Shliomis (MRSh). We compare the predictions from these models with
   measurements and with the predictions based on the Langevin function
   that assumes instantaneous magnetization response of the nanoparticles.
   The results show good qualitative and quantitative agreement between the
   ferrohydrodynamic models and the measurements without the use of fitting
   parameters and provide further evidence of the potential of
   ferrohydrodynamic modeling in MPI.}},

Abstract = {{On high electricity demand days, when air quality is Often poor,,
   regional transmission organizations (RTOs), such as PJM Interconnection,
   ensure reliability of the grid by employing peak-use electric generating
   units (EGUs). These ``peaking units{''} are exempt from some federal and
   state air quality rules. We identify RTO assignment and peaking unit
   classification for EGUs in the Eastern U.S. and estimate air quality for
   four emission scenarios with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ)
   model during the July 2006 heat wave. Further, we population-weight
   ambient values as a surrogate for potential population exposure.
   Emissions from electricity reliability networks negatively impact air
   quality in their own region and in neighboring geographic areas.
   Monitored and controlled PJM peaking units are generally located in
   economically depressed areas and can contribute up to 87\% of hourly
   maximum PM2.5 mass locally. Potential population exposure to peaking
   unit PM2.5 mass is highest in the model domain's most populated cities.
   Average daily temperature and national gross domestic product steer
   peaking unit heat input. Air quality planning that capitalizes on a
   priori knowledge of local electricity demand and economics may provide a
   more holistic approach to protect human health within the context of
   growing energy needs in a changing world.}},

Title = {{Development of a Component-Based Modeling Framework for Agricultural
   Water-Resource Management}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Because hydrologic responses of an agricultural watershed are influenced
   by many natural and man-made factors including pond/reservoir,
   management practices, and/or irrigation/drainage, strategies of
   hydrological modeling for the watershed must be case-dependent and thus
   carefully designed to effectively reflect their roles as critical
   hydrologic components in simulation processes. In this study, we propose
   a component-based modeling framework that accommodates a flexible
   modeling approach to consider a variety of hydrologic processes and
   management practices, especially irrigation-reservoir operation and
   paddy-farming practices, in watershed-scale modeling. The objectives of
   this study are twofold: to develop a COmponent-based Modeling Framework
   for Agricultural water-Resources Management (COMFARM) using an
   object-oriented programming technique, and to evaluate its applicability
   as a modeling tool to predict the responses of an agricultural watershed
   characterized with diverse land uses in a case study. COMFARM
   facilitates quick and easy development of watershed-specific hydrologic
   models by providing multiple interchangeable simulation routines for
   each hydrologic component considered. COMFARM is developed with the JAVA
   programming language, using Eclipse software. The framework developed in
   this study is applied to simulating hydrologic processes of the Seon-Am
   irrigation-district watershed consisting primarily of
   reservoir-irrigated rice paddies in South Korea. The application study
   clearly demonstrates the applicability of the framework as a convenient
   method to build models for hydrologic simulation of an agricultural
   watershed. The newly developed modeling framework, COMFARM is expected
   to serve as a useful tool in watershed management planning by allowing
   quick development of case-oriented analysis tools and evaluation of
   management scenarios customized to a specific watershed.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the relevance of infragravity (IG) waves at
   Albufeira Lagoon Inlet, a shallow wave-dominated inlet located on the
   western coast of Portugal. A field experiment carried out in September
   2010 revealed the occurrence of low-frequency oscillations (i.e., 25-300
   s) in water levels and current velocities. While these fluctuations were
   present over the ebb-tidal delta along the whole tidal cycle, they only
   appeared between the beginning of the flood and up to 2 h after high
   tide inside the lagoon. The XBeach modeling system was applied to
   Albufeira Lagoon Inlet and reproduced the generation and propagation of
   IG waves and their blocking during the ebb. This behavior was explained
   by blocking due to opposing tidal currents reaching 2.5 m s21 in shallow
   water depths. Numerical results suggest that the breakpoint mechanism
   and the long bound wave shoaling mechanisms contributed significantly to
   the generation of IG waves in the inlet. IG waves induced fluctuations
   in flood currents inside the lagoon reaching temporarily 100\% of their
   magnitude. The fact that these fluctuations occur mostly at flood and
   not at ebb could promote flood dominance in the lagoon. This hypothesis
   will have to be verified, namely under storm wave conditions.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{461-469}},

Abstract = {{The misorientation- and temperature-dependent grain boundary thermal
   (Kapitza) resistance in CeO2 is investigated using molecular dynamics
   simulations. A few empirical potentials for molecular dynamics
   simulations are evaluated for their predicted properties such as the
   phonon dispersion curves, bulk thermal conductivity, and grain boundary
   structures. Through the comparison of these properties with experimental
   results, the most reasonable potential (Gotte2007) is selected. The
   Kapitza resistances of tilt and twist grain boundaries with
   misorientation angles ranging from 3 degrees to 87 degrees are
   calculated and a clear transition angle at about 16 degrees is observed.
   The Kapitza resistance is found to increase almost linearly with
   misorientation angle in the low-angle regime but remain nearly constant
   at the high-angle regime, a behavior very similar to the grain boundary
   energy. A nearly linear correlation between Kapitza resistance and grain
   boundary energy is thus obtained. Similar to the grain boundary energy,
   the Read-Shockley model can well describe the misorientation-dependent
   Kapitza resistance at low-angle regime. The Kapitza conductance (the
   inverse of Kapitza resistance) is found to increase almost linearly with
   temperature in our simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background. Two thirds of stroke survivors experience motor impairment
   resulting in long-term disability. The anatomical substrate is often the
   disruption of cortico-subcortical pathways. It has been proposed that
   reestablishment of cortico-subcortical communication relates to
   functional recovery. Objective. In this study, we applied a novel
   training protocol to augment ipsilesional cortico-subcortical
   connectivity after stroke. Chronic stroke patients with severe motor
   impairment were provided online feedback of blood-oxygenation level
   dependent signal connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions
   critical for motor function using real-time functional magnetic
   resonance imaging neurofeedback. Results. In this proof of principle
   study, 3 out of 4 patients learned to voluntarily modulate
   cortico-subcortical connectivity as intended. Conclusions. Our results
   document for the first time the feasibility and safety for patients with
   chronic stroke and severe motor impairment to self-regulate and augment
   ipsilesional cortico-subcortical connectivity through neurofeedback
   using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to evaluate the field performance of gas engine
   driven heat pumps (GEHP) used in a commercial building. Four, 8 TR
   (cooling capacity) GEHP units were employed to provide air-conditioning
   to seven thermal zones in a commercial building. The performance of
   these GEHPs was assessed over a period of 10 months and compared with
   prior results reported in the literature. Additionally, this study
   provides a comparative economic analysis of GEHPs and conventional
   electrical heat pumps. During normal operation, the cooling capacity
   ranged between 12.3 kW and 19.3 kW. The average COPunit of these systems
   varied from 0.15 to 0.85 during field operation. The gas engines were
   found to operate at significantly lower loads than their design
   capacity, and therefore, produced overall lower efficiencies. Oversized
   GEHP systems were deployed to meet the low cooling/heating demands
   attributed to the lower overall field performance. This study
   demonstrates the importance of sizing the GEHP/HVAC system similar to
   the load in buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights

Abstract = {{Ultrathin metal oxides exhibit unique chemical properties and show
   promise for applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Monolayer FeO films
   supported on metal surfaces show large differences in reactivity
   depending on the metal substrate, potentially enabling tuning of the
   catalytic properties of these materials. Nitric oxide (NO) adsorption is
   facile on silver-supported FeO, whereas a similar film grown on platinum
   is inert to NO under similar conditions. Ab initio calculations link
   this substrate-dependent behavior to steric hindrance caused by
   substrate-induced rumpling of the FeO surface, which is stronger for the
   platinum-supported film. Calculations show that the size of the
   activation barrier to adsorption caused by the rumpling is dictated by
   the strength of the metal-oxide interaction, offering a straightforward
   method for tailoring the adsorption properties of ultrathin films.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma modulator using a
   Gm-C based noise-shaped integrating quantizer (NSIQ) with a digital
   back-end integrator. By incorporating the digital back-end integrator,
   the tradeoff between resolution and speed for a conventional time-based
   NSIQ is alleviated. Using only three clock edges and a low-power Gm-C,
   effective 4-bit quantization with an additional first order
   noise-shaping is achieved. Also, the linearity requirement of the
   quantizer is relaxed by employing the digital back-end integrator. The
   proposed modulator was fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process with an
   active area of 0.08 mm(2). It operates at 640 MHz and achieves a peak
   SNDR of 75.3 dB and a peak SFDR of 94.1 dB in a 10 MHz bandwidth while
   consuming 7.2 mW from a 1.2 V power supply.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel machine learning algorithm is presented for
   disaggregation of satellite soil moisture (SM) based on self-regularized
   regressive models (SRRMs) using high-resolution correlated information
   from auxiliary sources. It includes regularized clustering that assigns
   soft memberships to each pixel at a fine scale followed by a kernel
   regression that computes the value of the desired variable at all
   pixels. Coarse-scale remotely sensed SM was disaggregated from 10 to 1
   km using land cover (LC), precipitation, land surface temperature, leaf
   area index, and in situ observations of SM. This algorithm was evaluated
   using multiscale synthetic observations in NC Florida for heterogeneous
   agricultural LCs. It was found that the rmse for 96\% of the pixels was
   less than 0.02 m3/ m3. The clusters generated represented the data well
   and reduced the rmse by up to 40\% during periods of high heterogeneity
   in LC and meteorological conditions. The Kullback-Leibler divergence
   (KLD) between the true SMand the disaggregated estimates is close to
   zero, for both vegetated and bare-soil LCs. The disaggregated estimates
   were compared with those generated by the principle of relevant
   information (PRI) method. The rmse for the PRI disaggregated estimates
   is higher than the rmse for the SRRMon each day of the season. The KLD
   of the disaggregated estimates generated by the SRRMis at least four
   orders of magnitude lower than those for the PRI disaggregated
   estimates, whereas the computational time needed was reduced by three
   times. The results indicate that the SRRM can be used for disaggregating
   SM with complex nonlinear correlations on a grid with high accuracy.}},

Title = {{Hyperspectral Unmixing With Endmember Variability via Alternating Angle

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{In hyperspectral unmixing applications, one typically assumes that a
   single spectrum exists for every endmember. In many scenarios, this is
   not the case, and one requires a set or a distribution of spectra to
   represent an endmember or class. This inherent spectral variability can
   pose severe difficulties in classical unmixing approaches. In this
   paper, we present a new algorithm for dealing with endmember variability
   in spectral unmixing, based on the geometrical interpretation of the
   resulting unmixing problem, and an alternating optimization approach.
   This alternating-angle-minimization algorithm uses sets of spectra to
   represent the variability present in each class and attempts to identify
   the subset of endmembers which produce the smallest reconstruction
   error. The algorithm is analogous to the popular multiple endmember
   spectral mixture analysis technique but has a much more favorable
   computational complexity while producing similar results. We illustrate
   the algorithm on several artificial and real data sets and compare with
   several other recent techniques for dealing with endmember variability.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we define a new combinatorial function on the edges of
   complete weighted graphs. This function assigns to each edge of the
   graph the sum of the weights of all Hamiltonian cycles that contain the
   edge. Since this function involves the factorial function, whose exact
   calculation is intractable due to its superexponential asymptotic rate
   of increase, we also introduce a normalized version of the function that
   is efficiently computable. From this version, we derive an upper bound
   to the weight of the minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle of the graph based
   on the weights of the graph edges. Then we investigate the possible
   algorithmic applications of this normalized function using the Nearest
   Neighbor Heuristic and a smallest edge first heuristic. As evidence for
   its applicability, we show that the use of this function as a criterion
   for the selection of the next edge, improves the performance of both
   heuristics for approximating the minimum weight Hamiltonian cycles in
   Euclidean plane graphs. Moreover, our experimental results show that the
   use of the function is more suitable with the structure of the smallest
   edge first heuristic since it provides a solution closer to the best
   known solution of known hard TSP instances but in O(n(3)) time.}},

Abstract = {{Rasagiline is a monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor that possesses no
   amphetamine-like properties, and provides symptomatic relief in early
   and late stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Data in animal models of PD
   suggest that chronic administration of rasagiline is associated with
   structural changes in the substantia nigra, and raise the question
   whether the structure and function of the basal ganglia could be
   different in PD patients treated chronically with rasagiline as compared
   with PD patients not treated with rasagiline. Here, we performed a
   retrospective cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study at
   3 T that investigated nigrostriatal function and structure in PD
   patients who had taken rasagiline before testing (similar to 8 months),
   PD who had not taken rasagiline before testing, and age-matched
   controls. The two PD groups were selected a priori to not differ
   significantly in age, sex, disease duration, severity of symptoms,
   cognitive status, and total levodopa equivalent daily dose of
   medication. We evaluated percent signal change in the posterior putamen
   during force production using functional MRI, free-water in the
   posterior substantia nigra using diffusion MRI, and performance on a
   bimanual coordination task using a pegboard test. All patients were
   tested after overnight withdrawal from antiparkinsonian medication. The
   rasagiline group had greater percent signal change in the posterior
   putamen, less free-water in the posterior substantia nigra, and better
   performance on the coordination task than the group not taking
   rasagiline. These findings point to a possible chronic effect of
   rasagiline on the structure and function of the basal ganglia in PD. (C)

Abstract = {{To deal with the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the user

   dissemination-based services, such as video streaming,
   information-centric networking has emerged as a promising architecture
   and has been increasingly used for wireless and mobile networks. In this
   paper, we focus on video dissemination in information-centric cognitive
   radio networks (IC-CRNs) and investigate the use of harvested bands for
   proactively caching video contents at the locations close to the
   interested users to improve the performance of video distribution. With
   consideration of the dynamic and unobservable nature of some parameters,
   we formulate the allocation of harvested bands as a Markov decision
   process with hidden and dynamic parameters and transform it into a
   partially observable Markov decision process and a multi-armed bandit
   formulation. Based on them, we develop a new spectrum management
   mechanism, which maximizes the benefit of proactive video caching as
   well as the efficiency of spectrum utilization in the IC-CRNs. Extensive
   simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement

Abstract = {{With huge unlicensed bandwidth available in most parts of the world,
   millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications in the 60-GHz band has been
   considered as one of the most promising candidates to support
   multigigabit wireless services. Due to high propagation loss of mmWave
   channels, beamforming is likely to be adopted as an essential technique.
   Consequently, transmission in the 60-GHz band is inherently directional.
   Directivity enables concurrent transmissions (spatial reuse), which can
   be fully exploited to improve network capacity. In this paper, we
   propose a multipath multihop scheduling scheme, which is known as
   multipath multihop (MPMH), for mmWave wireless personal area networks
   (WPANs), where the traffic across links of low channel quality is
   transmitted through multiple paths of multiple hops to unleash the
   potential of spatial reuse. We formulate the problem of MPMH as a
   mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which is generally NP-hard. To
   enable the implementation of the multipath multihop transmission in
   practice, we propose a heuristic scheme including path selection,
   traffic distribution, and MPMH to efficiently solve the formulated
   problem. Finally, through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that
   MPMH achieves near-optimal network performance in terms of transmission
   delay and throughput and enhances network performance significantly,
   compared with existing protocols.}},

   Knee Contact Forces for Walking}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Though walking impairments are prevalent in society, clinical treatments
   are often ineffective at restoring lost function. For this reason,
   researchers have begun to explore the use of patient-specific
   computational walking models to develop more effective treatments.
   However, the accuracy with which models can predict internal body forces
   in muscles and across joints depends on how well relevant model
   parameter values can be calibrated for the patient. This study
   investigated how knowledge of internal knee contact forces affects
   calibration of neuromusculoskeletal model parameter values and
   subsequent prediction of internal knee contact and leg muscle forces
   during walking. Model calibration was performed using a novel two-level
   optimization procedure applied to six normal walking trials from the
   Fourth Grand Challenge Competition to Predict In Vivo Knee Loads. The
   outer-level optimization adjusted time-invariant model parameter values
   to minimize passive muscle forces, reserve actuator moments, and model
   parameter value changes with (Approach A) and without (Approach B)
   tracking of experimental knee contact forces. Using the current guess
   for model parameter values but no knee contact force information, the
   inner-level optimization predicted time-varying muscle activations that
   were close to experimental muscle synergy patterns and consistent with
   the experimental inverse dynamic loads (both approaches). For all the
   six gait trials, Approach A predicted knee contact forces with high
   accuracy for both compartments (average correlation coefficient r = 0.99
   and root mean square error (RMSE) = 52.6 N medial; average r = 0.95 and
   RMSE = 56.6 N lateral). In contrast, Approach B overpredicted contact
   force magnitude for both compartments (average RMSE = 323 N medial and
   348 N lateral) and poorly matched contact force shape for the lateral
   compartment (average r = 0.90 medial and = 0.10 lateral). Approach B had
   statistically higher lateral muscle forces and lateral optimal muscle
   fiber lengths but lower medial, central, and lateral normalized muscle
   fiber lengths compared to Approach A. These findings suggest that poorly
   calibrated model parameter values may be a major factor limiting the
   ability of neuromusculoskeletal models to predict knee contact and leg
   muscle forces accurately for walking.}},

Abstract = {{At low Earth orbits, differentials in the drag forces between spacecraft
   can be used for controlling their relative motion in the orbital plane.
   Current methods for determining the drag force may result in errors due
   to inaccuracies in the density models and drag coefficients. In this
   work, a methodology for relative maneuvering of spacecraft based on
   differential drag, accounting for uncertainties in the drag model, is
   proposed. A dynamical model composed of the mean semimajor axis and the
   argument of latitude is used for describing long-range maneuvers. For
   this model, a linear quadratic regulator is implemented, accounting for
   the uncertainties in the drag force. The actuation is the pitch angle of
   the satellites, considering saturation. The control scheme guarantees
   asymptotic stability of the system up to a certain magnitude of the
   state vector, which is determined by the uncertainties. Numerical
   simulations show that the method exhibits consistent robustness to
   accomplish the maneuvers, even in the presence of realistic modeling of
   density fields, drag coefficients, the corotation of the atmosphere, and
   zonal harmonics up to J(8).}},

Abstract = {{A microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror with large vertical
   displacement has been developed for Fourier transform
   microspectrometers, but there exists a large tilting during the
   large-stroke scanning of the MEMS mirror, which greatly compromises the
   usable range. In this paper, a closed-loop control method has been
   established to minimize the tilting of the MEMS mirror. According to
   experimental results, the tilting motion of the mirror plate can be
   modeled as a fourth-order system. A feedback controller consisting of a
   phase-lag compensator, a low-pass filter and a notch filter utilized to
   stabilize the closed-loop tilt system. A gain scheduling approach is
   also used to compensate the bias-dependent loop gain and thereby provide
   more consistent tilting rejection over a wide scan range. Compared with
   the open-loop drive approach, the closed-loop system offers a stable
   scan operation with much faster dynamic response and improved overall
   robustness. The experiments show that the residual tilting is reduced to
   below +/- 0.0015 degrees during the full range scan of the MEMS mirror.
   With this control method, the MEMS mirror achieved a stable scan range
   up to 356.4 mu m, so the measured spectral resolution reached 28 nm at
   532 nm in a microspectrometer. The mirror tilting can be reduced
   dramatically by the proposed active control scheme, and thereby, the
   usable vertical scan range is increased significantly. {[}2016-0061]}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the integration of vanadium dioxide (VO2) thin films
   in a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror device, where the
   actuation is mainly due to the solid-solid phase transition of VO2. The
   fabrication process described in this paper provides the details that
   will enable the integration of VO2 thin films at any step during the
   fabrication of rather complex MEMS devices. The present VO2-based MEMS
   mirror device is operated electro-thermally through integrated resistive
   heaters, and its behavior is characterized across the phase transition
   of VO2, which occurs at a temperature of similar to 68 degrees C and
   spans about 10 degrees C. The maximum vertical displacement of the
   mirror platform is 75 mu m and it occurs for an input voltage of 1.1 V.
   This translates to an average power consumption of 6.5 mW per mirror
   actuator and a total power consumption of 26.1 mW for the entire device.
   The studies included in this paper are key for future device
   improvements and further development of MEMS mirror actuation
   technology, which could include the use of the hysteresis of VO2 for
   programming tilting angles in MEMS mirrors. {[}2016-0016]}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a two-axis electrothermal single-crystal-silicon
   micromirror that is tilted 45 degrees out of plane on a silicon optical
   bench (SiOB). The SiOB provides mechanical support and electrical wiring
   to the tilted two-axis scanning mirror, as well as aligned trenches for
   assembling other optical components, such as optical fibers and GRIN
   lens. The preset tilting of the mirror plate is achieved via the bending
   of a set of stressed bimorph cantilevers. A stopper connected on the
   bending bimorphs reaches and is stopped by the adjacent silicon
   sidewall. The tilt angle can be precisely controlled by properly
   choosing the distance from the stopper to the silicon sidewall and the
   flexure bimorph length. The fabricated mirror plate is 0.72 mm x 0.72 mm
   and the footprint of the entire MEMS device is 2.22 mm x 1.25 mm. The
   measured maximum total optical scan angle of the mirror is approximately
   40 degrees in both x-axis and y-axis at only 5.5 Vdc. This technology
   will enable a new class of more compact microendoscopic optical imaging
   probes for in vivo early cancer detection. {[}2015-0315]}},

Title = {{Investigating a wind tunnel method for determining wind-induced loads on
   roofing tiles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{47-59}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Current design loads for roofing tile systems in the U.S. are determined
   based on a standardized wind tunnel testing method developed in the
   1990s to examine wind-induced pressures on the upper and lower surfaces
   of the tile. The method neglects several key parameters that are well
   known to affect wind loading (e.g. wind angle, specimen shape, etc.).
   The research objective of this study is to investigate this method by
   {[}1] characterizing wind-induced surface pressure distributions on
   field tiles for varying wind angles of attack and {[}2] measuring load
   path intensity through mechanically fastened tile attachments. Surface
   pressure distributions were measured on three full-size, rapid
   prototyped roofing tile models with 256 pressure taps immersed in wind
   flows. The models are geometrically identical to low-, medium- and
   high-profile concrete roofing tiles that are widely used in high wind
   areas. Additionally, their real counterparts were instrumented with load
   cells to measure reaction forces at mechanical fasteners. The results
   highlight areas of the method that are lacking in specificity and shows
   that low-resolution pressure measurement may yield conservative
   parameters for low- and medium-profile tiles but is potentially not
   conservative for asymmetric (s-shaped) high-profile tiles. (C) 2016

Title = {{Damage estimation of roof panels considering wind loading correlation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{141-148}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Roof panels on light wood-frame building roofs are very vulnerable to
   high winds. Once the roof is breached, a series of consequences will
   occur, including the rainwater penetration and dangerous projectiles
   originating from blown panels. Damage mitigation and risk management
   require a better estimation of wind-induced damage on roof panels. In
   this study, a data-based wind damage estimation method considering wind
   loading correlation is developed for roof panels. This method is
   composed of three steps. Firstly, the peak uplift force on roof panels
   is estimated by Hermite polynomial model-based translation process
   method. Then the correlation of peak uplift forces is incorporated by
   Nataf transformation. Finally, the failure probability of a single panel
   and the damage ratio of panels on the whole roof are estimated by either
   the numerical method or Monte Carlo simulation. A numerical example
   demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The importance of
   the correlation of wind loading on the wind damage estimation for roof
   panels is highlighted. Note that the proposed method can be extended to
   damage estimation for other roof components such as shingles when the
   wind loading correlation is included. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A lateralized anterior flange improves femoral component bone coverage

Journal = {{KNEE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{719-724}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Poor femoral implant fit to resected bone surfaces recently
   has been the motivation for several new total knee arthroplasty implant
   designs. Implant overhang risks adverse soft-tissue interaction while
   uncovered cut bone surfaces (underhang) risks increased postoperative
   bleeding or development of heterotopic bone.
   Methods: Femoral implant fit was studied systematically, and without the
   influence of surgical variation, by virtually implanting standard and
   narrow width femoral components (Bi-Surface 5) using preoperative
   computed tomography data for 150 varus osteoarthritic knees in Japanese
   patients. Overhang and underhang rates and bone widths were determined
   by gender.
   Results: Narrow femoral components helped avoid or minimize overhang in
   most female and some male knees. Although anterior width in the narrow
   components closely matched female bone width, the femoral component was
   necessarily displaced laterally to avoid overhang in the anteromedial
   portion. Consequently, there was significant medial underhang in the
   distal and posterior zones.
   Conclusions: Ideally, the anterior femoral flange should be shifted 2 to
   2.5 mm laterally relative to the distal and posterior aspects to provide
   optimal femoral bone coverage in this prosthesis. The current study also
   confirmed that this modification can be generalized to the other two
   currently available ``narrow type{''} prostheses. This geometric
   modification might allow surgeons to select a femoral component with
   slightly wider mediolateral dimensions in the distal and posterior
   aspects to minimize underhang, while eliminating anterior overhang. (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction: Personalized, scheduled deep brain stimulation in Tourette
   syndrome (TS) may permit clinically meaningful tic reduction while
   reducing side effects and increasing battery life. Here, we evaluate
   scheduled DBS applied to TS at two-year follow-up.
   Methods: Five patients underwent bilateral centromedian thalamic (CM)
   region DBS. A cranially contained constant-current device delivering
   stimulation on a scheduled duty cycle, as opposed to the standard
   continuous DBS paradigm was utilized. Baseline vs. 24-month outcomes
   were collected and analyzed, and a responder analysis was performed. A
   40\% improvement in the Modified Rush Tic Rating Scale (MRTRS) total
   score or Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) total score defined a
   full responder.
   Results: Three of the 4 patients followed to 24 months reached full
   responder criteria and had a mean stimulation time of 1.85 h per day.
   One patient lost to follow-up evaluated at the last time point (month
   18) was a non-responder. Patients exhibited improvements in MRTRS score
   beyond the improvements previously reported for the 6 month endpoint; on
   average, MRTRS total score was 15.6\% better at 24 months than at 6
   months and YGTSS total score was 14.8\% better. Combining the patients
   into a single cohort revealed significant improvements in the MRTRS
   total score (-7.6 {[}5.64]; p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: Electrical stimulation of the centromedian thalamic region
   in a scheduled paradigm was effective in suppressing tics, particularly
   phonic tics. Full responders were able to achieve the positive DBS
   effect with a mean of 2.3 +/- 0.9 (SEM) hours of DBS per day. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A standalone microwave photonics system for Doppler frequency
   measurement purposes is conceived and demonstrated practically. The
   system exhibits a maximum of 1.61\% relative error in Doppler frequency
   estimation at the worst case. Utilization of all optical mixing has
   enabled RF frequency independent operation. The system is thus capable
   of operating at any radar carrier frequency up to 40 GHz. This makes it
   a perfect candidate for various types of photonic-based radars and
   frequency agility systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Methods for inferring signaling networks using single gene
   knockdown RNAi experiments and reference networks have been proposed in
   recent years. These methods assume that RNAi information is available
   for all the genes in the signal transduction pathway, i.e., complete.
   This assumption does not always hold up since RNAi experiments are often
   incomplete and information for some genes is missing.
   Results: In this article, we develop two methods to construct signaling
   networks from incomplete RNAi data with the help of a reference network.
   These methods infer the RNAi constraints for the missing genes such that
   the inferred network is closest to the reference network. We perform
   extensive experiments with both real and synthetic networks and
   demonstrate that these methods produce accurate results efficiently.
   Conclusions: Application of our methods to Wnt signal transduction
   pathway has shown that our methods can be used to construct highly
   accurate signaling networks from experimental data in less than 100 ms.
   The two methods that produce accurate results efficiently show great
   promise of constructing real signaling networks.}},

Title = {{A Low-Latency Collaborative HARQ Scheme for Control/User-Plane Decoupled
   Railway Wireless Networks}},

Abstract = {{The control/user (C/U) plane decoupled railway wireless network is an
   innovative architecture recently proposed to meet the communication
   demands of both train control systems and onboard passengers. The core
   idea is to completely separate the C-plane and the U-plane into
   different network nodes operating at different frequency bands. Although
   the system capacity of this network architecture can be highly
   increased, the forwarding latency of X3 interfaces to link the C-plane
   and the U-plane becomes a serious problem, particularly for hybrid
   automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocols that demand frequent
   interactions between the C-plane and the U-plane. To address this
   challenging problem, we propose a low-latency collaborative HARQ scheme
   in this paper. Specifically, we develop a new collaborative transmission
   framework where the possible spare resources on lower frequency bands of
   macrocells excluding those used by C-plane transmissions can be utilized
   to help small cells relay erroneously received data. Compared with the
   conventional HARQ scheme, the proposed scheme requires fewer
   retransmissions to reach the same transmission reliability, thereby
   mitigating the latency problem caused by HARQ retransmissions.
   Furthermore, channel mapping is also redesigned to conform to the
   proposed collaborative transmission framework. Through theoretical
   analysis, we derive the expression of the average number of
   retransmissions related to the sum of independent Gamma variables.
   Finally, the results of simulation experiments show that the proposed
   scheme can largely decrease the retransmission latency for railway
   wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the dynamics of circular finite-release Boussinesq gravity
   currents on a uniform slope. The study comprises a series of highly
   resolved direct numerical simulations for a range of slope angles
   between 5 degrees and 20 degrees. The simulations were fixed at Reynolds
   number Re = 5000 for all slopes considered. The temporal evolution of
   the front is compared to available experimental data. One of the
   interesting aspects of this study is the detection of a converging flow
   towards the centre of the gravity current. This converging flow is a
   result of the finite volume of the release coupled with the presence of
   a sloping boundary, which results in a second acceleration phase in the
   front velocity of the current. The details of the dynamics of this
   second acceleration and the redistribution of material in the current
   leading to its development will be discussed. These finite-release
   currents are invariably dominated by the head where most of the mixing
   and ambient entrainment occurs. We propose a simple method for defining
   the head of the current from which we extract various properties
   including the front Froude number and entrainment coefficient. The
   Froude number is seen to increase with steeper slopes, whereas the
   entrainment coefficient is observed to be weakly dependent on the bottom
   slope.}},

Title = {{On the mechanism of trailing vortex wandering}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{801}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism of trailing vortex wandering has long been debated and is
   often attributed to either wind-tunnel effects or an instability. Using
   particle image velocimetry data obtained in the wake of a NACA0012
   airfoil, we remove the effect of wandering from the measured velocity
   field and, through a triple decomposition, recover the coherent
   wandering motion. Based on this wandering motion, the most energetic
   structures are computed using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
   and exhibit a helical mode with an azimuthal wavenumber of vertical bar
   m vertical bar = 1 whose kinetic energy grows monotonically in the
   downstream direction. To investigate the nature of the vortex wandering,
   we perform a spatial stability analysis of a matched Batchelor vortex.
   The primary stability mode is found to be marginally stable and nearly
   identical in both size and structure to the leading POD mode. The
   strikingly similar structure, coupled with the measured energy growth,
   supports the proposition that the vortex wandering is the result of an
   instability. We conclude that the cause of the wandering is the non-zero
   radial velocity of the vertical bar m vertical bar = 1 mode on the
   vortex centreline, which acts to transversely displace the trailing
   vortex, as observed in experiments. However, the marginal nature of the
   stability mode prevents a definitive conclusion regarding the specific
   type of instability.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A powerful texture feature extraction algorithm based on transform-based
   analysis of two-dimensional (2D) gray-scale images was employed in the
   aggregate image measurement system (AIMS) to quantitatively describe
   aggregate surface microtexture by way of a parameter called texture
   index (TI). TI has been used successfully to distinguish between
   unpolished and polished aggregates. The main goal of this research was
   to further evaluate this system using a broader range of aggregates in
   terms of mineral composition including highly uniform limestone sources
   and highly variable granitic sources. Results confirmed that TI
   successfully distinguished polished from unpolished aggregates for all
   mineral compositions. However, an excessively broad range of TI values
   was observed. Specifically, TI values of aggregates with highly variable
   mineral composition were far greater than any value previously reported
   in the literature. Interestingly, unusually high TI values were also
   observed for limestone aggregate particles obtained from field cores. It
   was hypothesized that non-roughness-related features such as surface
   color pattern resulting from mineral variation and absorbed asphalt
   resulted in artificially high TI. Independent experimental roughness
   evaluation using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surfaces
   prepared to the same roughness level confirmed this hypothesis. The
   results clearly indicated the need for a change in image acquisition
   and/or analysis algorithm to exclude the effect of surface color pattern
   in texture analysis of aggregate surface images.}},

   Planning Problem}},

Abstract = {{The monthly coal train reservations planning problem arises in the unit
   train business of North American railroads. It involves a variety of
   operational and tactical decisions such as train formation, routing, and
   scheduling. As a result of the extensive scope of coal transportation in
   the United States, models for this problem grow quickly to a size
   unmanageable by state-of-the-art optimization software. Therefore, we
   propose a two-model heuristic solution methodology that is
   time-efficient and produces good quality solutions. The first model is
   developed under simplifying assumptions and yields an upper bound on the
   number of reservations to be accepted during the month. It also assigns
   car consists to reservations based on aggregate supply and demand of
   resources. This model also provides a tentative schedule for trains, and
   sets precedence relations between reservations. These being given, a
   second procedure is used to construct a detailed monthly schedule
   through the solution of network flow models and through the solution of
   a job-shop scheduling problem. The resulting solution is then improved
   through a large-scale neighborhood search. We evaluate our approach
   computationally, both on randomly generated and practical instances. We
   show numerically that our approach outperforms current practice.}},

   ecosystem resistance to and recovery from drought. Surveys spanning 250
   km of southeastern US coastline reveal spatially dispersed mussel mounds
   increased cordgrass survival during severe drought by 5- to 25-times.
   Surveys and mussel addition experiments indicate this positive effect of
   mussels on cordgrass was due to mounds enhancing water storage and
   reducing soil salinity stress. Observations and models then demonstrate
   that surviving cordgrass patches associated with mussels function as
   nuclei for vegetative re-growth and, despite covering only 0.1-12\% of
   die-offs, markedly shorten marsh recovery periods. These results
   indicate that mutualisms, in supporting stress-resistant patches, can
   play a disproportionately large, keystone role in enhancing ecosystem
   resilience to climatic extremes.}},

   conclude that virtual patient simulations are consistently associated
   with higher learning outcomes compared to other educational methods.
   However, we cannot assume that students will learn from simply exposing
   students to the simulations. The instructional features that are
   integrated before, during and after the simulations may affect learning
   and performance as much as or more than the simulation and how those
   features are used. Here, we examine the design and development of NERVE:
   A virtual patient simulation created to give medical students
   standardized experiences in interviewing, examining, and diagnosing
   virtual patients with cranial nerve disorders. We depict key design
   features of the simulation and discuss how two sets of design research

Abstract = {{Classic brain-machine interface (BMI) approaches decode neural signals
   from the brain responsible for achieving specific motor movements, which
   subsequently command prosthetic devices. Brain activities adaptively
   change during the control of the neuroprosthesis in BMIs, where the
   alteration of the preferred direction and the modulation of the gain
   depth are observed. The static neural tuning models have been limited by
   fixed codes, resulting in a decay of decoding performance over the
   course of the movement and subsequent instability in motor performance.
   To achieve stable performance, we propose a dual sequential Monte Carlo
   adaptive point process method, which models and decodes the gradually
   changing modulation depth of individual neuron over the course of a
   movement. We use multichannel neural spike trains from the primary motor
   cortex of a monkey trained to perform a target pursuit task using a
   joystick. Our results show that our computational approach successfully
   tracks the neural modulation depth over time with better goodness-of-fit
   than classic static neural tuning models, resulting in smaller errors
   between the true kinematics and the estimations in both simulated and
   real data. Our novel decoding approach suggests that the brain may
   employ such strategies to achieve stable motor output, i.e., plastic
   neural tuning is a feature of neural systems. BMI users may benefit from
   this adaptive algorithm to achieve more complex and controlled movement
   outcomes.}},

Title = {{Estimating and mapping the incidence of giardiasis in Colombia,

Abstract = {{Background: Giardiasis is one of the most common intestinal infections
   in the world. There have been no national studies on the morbidity of
   giardiasis in Colombia. In this study, incidence rates of giardiasis
   were estimated for the years 2009-2013.
   Methods: An observational, retrospective study of the giardiasis
   incidence in Colombia, 2009-2013, was performed using data extracted
   from the personal health records system (Registro Individual de
   Prestacion de Servicios, RIPS). Official population estimates from the
   National Department of Statistics (DANE) were used for the estimation of
   crude and adjusted incidence rates (cases/100 000 population).
   Results: During the period studied, 15 851 cases were reported (median
   3233/year; 5-year cumulated crude national rate of 33.97 cases/100 000
   population). Of these, 50.3\% were female; 58.4\% were <10 years old and
   14.8\% were 10-19 years old. By region, 17.7\% were from Bogota (10.07
   cases/100 000 population, 2009), 10.9\% from Antioquia (9.42, 2009),
   8.6\% from Atlantico (15.67, 2009), and 6.5\% from Risaralda (33.38,
   2009). Cases were reported in all departments (even insular areas).
   Conclusions: As giardiasis is neglected in many countries, surveillance
   is not regularly undertaken. Despite its limitations, this study is the
   first attempt to provide estimates of national giardiasis incidence with
   consistent findings regarding affected age groups and geographical
   distribution. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {{An investigation of the temperature-dependent friction behavior of PTFE,
   MoS2, and PTFE-on-MoS2 is presented. Friction behavior was measured
   while continuously varying contact temperature in the range -150 to 175
   degrees C while sliding in dry nitrogen, as well as for self-mated PTFE
   immersed in liquid nitrogen. These results contrast with previous
   reports of high-friction transitions and plateaus for pure and composite
   MoS2 at temperatures below about -20 degrees C; instead, we have found
   persistently weak thermal behavior between 0 and -196 degrees C,
   providing new insight about the molecular mechanisms of macroscale
   friction. The temperature-dependent friction behavior characteristic of
   self-mated PTFE was found also for PTFE-on-MoS2 sliding contacts,
   suggesting that PTFE friction was defined by subsurface deformation
   mechanisms and internal friction even when sliding against a lamellar
   lubricant with extremely low friction coefficient (mu similar to 0.02).
   The various relaxation temperatures of PTFE were found in the
   temperature-dependent friction behavior, showing excellent agreement
   with reported values acquired using rheological techniques measuring
   energy dissipation through internal friction. Additionally, hysteresis
   in friction behavior suggests an increase in near-surface crystallinity
   upon exceeding the high-temperature relaxation, T-alpha similar to 116
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a facile route, which combines mild maceration of
   waste pulp sludge and a mechanical shearing process, to prepare
   microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) with a high storage modulus. In the
   maceration, the mixture of glacial acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide was
   used to extract cellulose from never-dried waste pulp sludge. Then, two
   different mechanical processes including disc refining (DR) and
   ultrasonication plus homogenization (UH) were applied to the cellulose
   after maceration and resulted in MFC with a highly tangled fibril
   network. All of the resultant cellulosic suspensions (2 \% w/w)
   exhibited a gel-like and shear-thinning behavior with storage moduli
   (G') ranging from 200 to 4000 Pa. Among them, the 30-min DR-treated MFC
   gels had the maximum G', which was much higher than for previously
   reported MFC gels at the same concentration. Additionally, after
   mechanical processing, specific surface areas and water retention values
   of MFC were accordingly increased with the enhancement of shear force,
   while the storage moduli (G') were not consistently increased. Finally,
   a strong MFC gel was successfully prepared from never-dried waste pulp
   sludge via a one-step disc refining process and using cost-effective
   chemicals. The obtained hydrogels will have potential as low-density
   reinforcing fillers or as a template for further surface modification.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveSunscreens are commonly used to protect the body from damage
   caused by UV light. Some components of organic sunscreens have been
   shown to pass through the skin during wear which could raise toxicity
   concerns for these compounds. This study explores the potential for oils
   and fruit and vegetable juices to be substitutes for these compounds.
   MethodsThe absorptivity of various oils (canola oil, citronella oil,
   coconut oil, olive oil, soya bean oil, vitamin E, as well as aloe vera)
   and fruit and vegetable juices (acerola, beet, grape, orange carrot,
   purple carrot and raspberry) was measured in vitro. The mean
   absorptivity was compared with FDA-approved UV absorbers to gauge the
   potential of the natural products. The most promising candidates were
   incorporated into formulations, and the UV transmittance of a 20-m-thick
   film of the formulation was measured. The formulations were also imaged
   by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.
   ResultsThe absorptivity of oils was at least two orders of magnitude
   lower compared to the commercial UV blockers. The fruit juice powders
   were more effective at UV blocking but still showed an order of
   magnitude lower absorptivity compared to commercial UV blockers.
   ConclusionThe UV blocking from most natural oils is insufficient to
   obtain a significant UV protection. Formulations containing 50wt\%
   purple carrot showed good UV-blocking capabilities and represent a
   promising ingredient for sunscreen and cosmetic applications.

   ObjectifLes ecrans solaires sont couramment utilises pour proteger le
   corps contre les dommages causes par la lumiere UV. Il a ete demontre
   que certains composants de filtres solaires organiques peuvent passer a
   travers la peau lors de l'application ce qui pourrait soulever des
   problemes de toxicite de ces composes. Cette etude explore le potentiel
   pour les huiles et les fruits et jus de legumes comme des substituts
   pour ces composes.
   MethodesLa capacite d'absorption de differentes huiles (huile de canola,
   l'huile de citronnelle, huile de coco, huile d'olive, huile de soja, la
   vitamine E, ainsi que l'aloe vera) et les fruits et jus de legumes
   (acerola, betterave, raisin, orange carotte, carotte pourpre, et
   framboise) a ete mesuree in vitro. La capacite d'absorption moyenne a
   ete comparee a des absorbeurs UV approuves par la FDA pour evaluer le
   potentiel des produits naturels. Les candidats les plus prometteurs ont
   ete incorpores dans les formulations et le facteur de transmission UV du
   film de 20 m d'epaisseur de la formulation a ete mesure. Les
   formulations ont egalement ete observees par microscopie optique et
   microscopie electronique a balayage.
   ResultatsLa capacite d'absorption des huiles etait au moins deux ordres
   de grandeur plus faible par rapport aux bloqueurs d'UV commerciaux. Les
   poudres de jus de fruits etaient plus efficaces pour le blocage des UV,
   mais encore ont montre une capacite d'absorption un ordre de grandeur
   plus faible par rapport a bloqueurs d'UV commerciaux.
   ConclusionLe blocage UV de la plupart des huiles naturelles est
   insuffisante pour obtenir une protection significative UV. Les
   formulations contenant 50\% en poids de carotte violette ont montre une
   bonne capacite de blocage UV et representent un ingredient prometteur
   pour la creme solaire et des applications cosmetiques.}},

Title = {{Analysis of tropical storm damage using buffered probability of

Volume = {{83}},

Abstract = {{This paper explains the new concept of buffered probability of
   exceedance (bPOE). Through averaging of data in the tail, bPOE compactly
   presents probability as well as loss value of the tail and has the
   capability to revolutionize the concept of risk-averse engineering. bPOE
   is demonstrated using tropical storm damage along the Atlantic and Gulf
   of Mexico coasts of the USA from 1900 to 2013 (average yearly damage
   \$14.776 billion). It can be shown, under general assumptions, that bPOE
   is more than double the probability of exceedance (POE). For instance,
   with a \$50 billion threshold of damages per year, POE is 10.6 \%, while
   the bPOE is 26.1 \%. We also considered expected excess (EE) over some
   threshold (deductible), which is a minimum premium that insurer should
   charge per year. We demonstrate that EE equals the difference between
   the damage associated with POE and bPOE multiplied by bPOE. For
   instance, for a 25 \% tail probability, the value at risk (quantile)
   determined using POE is \$11.181 billion, while the conditional value at
   risk (average damage in excess of the quantile) determined by the bPOE
   is \$51.753 billion. This \$40.572 difference leads to EE of 0.25 {*}
   \$40.572 = \$10.143 billion over the threshold \$11.181 billion.
   Furthermore, subdividing the data by landfall state, at the 50 \%
   probability level, Florida, the state most often hit by tropical storms
   also has the highest value for EE at \$8.111 billion; thus, quantifying
   the need for insurers to charge Floridians high insurance premiums.}},

Abstract = {{Background.. The association between preoperative patient
   characteristics and the number of major postoperative complications
   after a major operation is not well defined.
   Methods. In a retrospective, single-center cohort of 50,314 adult
   surgical patients, we used readily available preoperative clinical data
   to model the number of major postoperative complications from none to >=
   3. We included acute kidney injury; prolonged stay (>48 hours) in an
   intensive care unit; need for prolonged (>48 hours) mechanical
   ventilation; severe sepsis; and cardiovascular, wound, and neurologic
   complications. Risk probability scores generated from the multinomial
   logistic models were used to develop an online calculator. We stratified
   patients based on their risk of having >= 3 postoperative complications.
   Results. Patients older than 65 years (odds ratio 1.5, 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.4-1.6), males (odds ratio 1.2, 95\% confidence interval,
   1.2-1.3), patients with a greater Charlson comorbidity index (odds ratio
   3.9, 95\% confidence interval, 3.6-4.2), patients requiring emergency
   operation (odds ratio 3.5, 95\% confidence interval, 3.3.-3.7), and
   patients admitted on a weekend (odds ratio 1.4, 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.3-1.5) were more likely to have >= 3 postoperative
   complications than they were to have none. Patients in the medium- and
   high-risk categories were 3.7 and 6.3 times more likely to have >= 3
   postoperative complications, respectively. High-risk patients were 5.8
   and 4.4 times more likely to die within 30 and 90 days of admission,
   respectively.
   Conclusion. Readily available, preoperative clinical and
   sociodemographic factors are associated with a greater number of
   postoperative complications and adverse surgical outcomes. We developed
   an online calculator that predicts probability of developing each number
   of complications after a major operation.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating nanostructured functional constituents within polymers has
   become extensive in processes and products for manufacturing composites.
   The conception of carbon nanotubes (CNT5) and their heralded attributes
   that yield property enhancements to the carrier system is leading many
   industries and research endeavors. Reported Displaced Foam Dispersion
   (DFD) methodology is a novel and effective approach to facilitating the
   incorporation of CNTs within fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPC).
   The methodology consists of six separate solubility phases that lead to
   the manufacture of CNT-FRPCs. This study was primarily initiated to
   characterize the interaction parameters of nanomaterials (multi walled
   carbon nanotubes), polymers (polystyrene), and solvents (dimethyl
   formamide (DMF) and acetone) in the current paradigm of the DFD
   materials manufacture. Secondly we sought to illustrate the theoretical
   potential for the methodology to be used in conjunction with other
   nanomaterial-polymersolvent systems. Herein, the theory of Hansen's
   solubility parameters (HSP) is employed to explain the effectiveness of
   the DFD materials manufacture ratios and aid in the explanation of the
   experimental results. The results illustrate quantitative values for the
   relative energy differences between each polymer-solvent system.
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the
   multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in each of the solubility stages
   and culminates with an indication of good dispersion. Additionally, the
   rate of acetone evaporation over 25 min is reported for the sorbed
   CNTaffy nanocomposites from 0 to approximately 60 wt percent loadings.

   routing restrictions, sensor placement cannot all be perfect, and
   therefore not all sensor data are guaranteed to be beneficial for IC
   delay classification. Therefore, in this paper we proposed an
   optimization based on genetic algorithm in order to select the most
   suitable speed-sensors for speed binning. Based on SPICE simulation as
   well as silicon data collected from on-chip delay sensors in a
   commercial design using a sub-65 nm process, we showed that optimizing
   sensor selection can improve speed-binning accuracy. In both
   experiments, the proposed optimization algorithm demonstrated
   improvement over using all sensor data. Result showed the proposed
   method is capable of improving accuracy beyond 94 and , respectively.}},

Title = {{Management Options During the 2011-2012 Drought on the Apalachicola
   River: A Systems Dynamic Model Evaluation}},

Abstract = {{The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River basin (ACF) is a large
   watershed in the southeastern United States. In 2012, the basin
   experienced the second year of a severe drought and the third multi-year
   drought in the last 15 years. During severe droughts, low reservoir and
   river levels can cause economic and ecological impacts to the reservoir,
   river, and estuarine ecosystems. During drought, augmenting Apalachicola
   River discharge through upstream reservoir releases and demand
   management are intuitive and often-suggested solutions to minimizing
   downstream effects. We assessed whether the existing reservoir system
   could be operated to minimize drought impacts on downstream water users
   and ecosystems through flow augmentation. Our analysis finds that in
   extreme drought such as observed during 2012, increases in water
   releases from reservoir storage are insufficient to even increase
   Apalachicola River discharge to levels observed in the 2007 drought.
   This suggests that there is simply not enough water available in managed
   storage to offset extreme drought events. Because drought frequency and
   intensity is predicted to increase under a variety of climate forecasts,
   our results demonstrate the need for a critical assessment of how water
   managers will meet increasing water demands in the ACF. Key
   uncertainties that should be addressed include (1) identifying the
   factors that led to extremely low Flint River discharge in 2012, and (2)
   determining how water ``saved{''} via demand management is allocated to
   storage or passed to downstream ecosystem needs as part of the ongoing
   revisions to the ACF Water Control Manual by the US Army Corps of
   Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Electrothermal (ET) plasma discharges are emerging as valuable
   mechanisms for pellet injection in magnetic confinement fusion reactors.
   They have been shown to be capable of achieving the required pellet
   velocities and pellet launch frequencies required for edge localized
   mode control. Another advantage of ET plasma discharges is their ability
   to simulate fusion disruption events by depositing large heat fluxes on
   exposed materials. A deeper understanding of the heat transfer processes
   occurring in ET plasma discharges will aid in this particular
   application. ET plasma discharges involve the passage of high currents
   (order of tens of kA) along the axis of a narrow, cylindrical channel.
   As the current passes through the channel, radiant heat is transferred
   from the plasma core to the capillary wall. Ablated particles eventually
   fill the plasma channel and the partially ionized plasma is ejected. It
   is well known that the ablated material separating the plasma core from
   the ablating surface can act as a vapor shield and limit the radiation
   heat flux reaching the ablating surface. In this work, the results from
   a two-dimensional simulation model for ET plasma discharges are
   presented. The simulation of the plasma in a two-dimensional domain
   combined with the diffusion approximation for radiation heat transfer is
   shown to successfully simulate the effects of the vapor shield layer
   that develops inside these devices.}},

Abstract = {{Continued effort has been placed on maximizing activation while
   controlling the diffusion of silicon doping in InGaAs for present and
   future complementary metal-oxide semiconductor devices. In order to
   explore the diffusion and activation behavior, Si marker layers were
   grown in InGaAs on InP by molecular beam epitaxy. The nature of Si
   diffusion was explored using a series of isoelectronic implants to
   introduce excess point defects near the layer. It was observed that
   excess interstitials reduce the Si diffusion consistent with a
   vacancy-driven diffusion mechanism. A diffusion and activation model
   implemented in the Florida object oriented process simulator has been
   developed to predict silicon diffusion behavior over a variety of
   temperatures and times. Using current and previous experimental data and
   complimentary density functional theory results, the diffusion model
   employs the Si-III-V-III pair as the primary mechanism for silicon
   diffusion in InGaAs.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to evaluate the structural performance of
   a typical wind turbine tower subjected to strong ground motions. A
   detailed finite element model of an 80 m wind turbine tower was
   developed and subjected to strong ground motions. Two sets of input
   ground motions were used: one with pulse-type near-fault motions and the
   other one with far-fault motions. The structural performance of the wind
   turbine tower was investigated through seismic fragility analysis. The
   potential limit states were defined as global buckling of the tower,
   first occurrence of yielding, overturning of the foundation and
   permanent deformation of the tower. It was found that the wind turbine
   tower investigated in this study is most vulnerable to the overturning
   in the event of an earthquake. Yielding of the tower is the second most
   probable failure mechanism, which is followed by development of
   permanent deformation and global buckling of the tower. Similar trends
   in the failure mechanism were observed for both near-fault and far-fault
   ground motions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study of single bubble growth in turbulent subcooled flow

   based on Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) interface tracking method coupled with
   adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was used to
   model the turbulence characteristics. The numerical model was validated
   with multiple experimental data from the open literature. This study
   includes parametric variations that cover the operating conditions of

Abstract = {{We investigated the influence of adsorbed H2O on the oxidation of CO on
   PdO(101) using temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS),
   reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations. We find that water inhibits CO
   adsorption on PdO(101) by site blocking, but also provides a more facile
   pathway for CO oxidation compared with the bare oxide surface. In the
   presence of adsorbed H2O, the oxidation of CO on PdO(101) produces a CO2
   TPRS peak that is centered at a temperature similar to 50 K lower than
   the main CO2 TPRS peak arising from CO oxidation on clean PdO(101)
   (similar to 330 vs. 380 K). RAIRS shows that CO continues to adsorb on
   atop-Pd sites of PdO(101) when H2O is co-adsorbed, and provides no
   evidence of other reactive intermediates. DFT calculations predict that
   the CO oxidation mechanism follows the same steps for CO adsorbed on
   PdO(101) with and without co-adsorbed H2O, wherein an atop-CO species
   recombines with an oxygen atom from the oxide surface lattice. According
   to DFT, hydrogen bonding interactions with adsorbed H2O species
   stabilize the carboxyl-like transition structure and intermediate that
   result from the initial recombination of CO and O on the PdO(101)
   surface. This stabilization lowers the energy barrier for CO oxidation
   on PdO(101) by similar to 10 kJ/mol, in good agreement with our
   experimental estimate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Promotional effects of chemisorbed oxygen and hydroxide in the
   activation of C-H and O-H bonds over transition metal surfaces}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{650}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{210-220}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Electronegative coadsorbates such as atomic oxygen (O{*}) and hydroxide
   (OH{*}) can act as Bronsted bases when bound to Group 11 as well as
   particular Group 8-10 metal surfaces and aid in the activation of X-H
   bonds. First principle density functional theory calculations were
   carried out to systematically explore the reactivity of the C-H bonds of
   methane and surface methyl intermediates as well as the O-H bond of
   methanol directly and with the assistance of coadsorbed O{*} and OH{*}
   intermediates over Group 11 (Cu, Ag, and Au) and Group 8-10 transition
   metal (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt) surfaces. C-H as well as O-H bond
   activation over the metal proceeds via a classic oxidative addition type
   mechanism involving the insertion of the metal center into the C-H or
   O-H bond. O{*} and OH{*} assist C-H and O-H activation over particular
   Group 11 and Group 8-10 metal surfaces via a 6-bond metathesis type
   mechanism involving the oxidative addition of the C-H or O-H bond to the
   metal along with a reductive deprotonation of the acidic C-H and O-H
   bond over the M-O{*} or M-OH{*} site pair. The O{*}- and OH{*}-assisted
   C-H activation paths are energetically preferred over the direct metal
   catalyzed C-H scission for all Group 11 metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) with
   barriers that are 0.4-1.5 eV lower than those for the unassisted routes.
   The barriers for O{*}- and OH{*}-assisted C-H activation of CH4 on the
   Group 8-10 transition metals, however, are higher than those over the
   bare transition metal surfaces by as much as 1.4 eV. The C-H activation
   of adsorbed methyl species show very similar trends to those for CH4
   despite the differences in structure between the weakly bound methane
   and the covalently adsorbed methyl intermediates. The activation of the
   O-H bond of methanol is significantly promoted by O{*} as well as OH{*}
   intermediates over both the Group 11 metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) as well as
   on all Group 8-10 metals studied (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt). The O{*}-
   and OH{*}-assisted CH3O-H barriers are 0.6 to 2.0 eV lower than
   unassisted barriers, with the largest differences occurring on Group 11
   metals. The higher degree of O{*}- and OH{*}-promotion in activating
   methanol over that in methane and methyl is due to the stronger
   interaction between the basic O{*} and OH{*} sites and the acidic proton
   in the O-H bond of methanol versus the non-acidic H in the C-H bond of
   methane. A detailed analysis of the binding energies and the charges for
   O{*} and OH{*} on different metal surfaces indicates that the marked
   differences in the properties and reactivity of O{*} and OH{*} between
   the Group 11 and Group 8-10 metals is due to the increased negative
   charge on the O-atoms (in O{*} as well as OH{*}) bound to Group 11
   metals. The promotional effects of O{*} and OH{*} are consistent with a
   proton-coupled electron transfer and the cooperative role of the
   metal-O{*} or metal-OH{*} pair in carrying out the oxidative addition
   and reductive deprotonation of the acidic C-H and O-H bonds. Ultimately,
   the ability of O{*} or OH{*} to act as a Brensted base depends upon its
   charge, its binding energy on the metal surface (due to shifts in its
   position during X-H activation), and the acidity of the H-atom being
   abstracted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coatings formulated with either SrCrO4 or a mixture of Cr(VI)-free

   coatings in the dry state, both before exposure to the electrolyte (0.5
   M NaCl solution) and after a 1-month exposure followed by a 12-month
   drying. The results were analysed with reference to models that assumed
   resistivity variations along the coating thickness. The
   resistivity-position dependence was close to a power law for dry
   coatings and close to exponential for wet coatings. In the latter, and
   for short immersion times, the exponential variation was located in the
   outer coating region, at shorter distances from the coating/solution
   interface, and then, for longer immersion times (>1 week), extended to
   the whole coating thickness. The effect of SrCrO4 leaching on the
   properties of the coating is discussed. For both coatings, the barrier
   effect remained high for a 1-month exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Condensation heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics for R410A

   {[}aspect ratio (AR) = 3.07, 4.23, and 5.39] at saturation temperature
   T-sat = 320 K were investigated numerically. Liquid-vapor interfaces and
   stream traces are also presented to give a better understanding of the
   condensation process inside these tubes. The results indicate that local
   heat transfer coefficients and pressure gradients increase with
   increasing mass flux, vapor quality, and aspect ratio. The enhancement
   of the flattened tube is more pronounced at higher mass flux and vapor
   quality. The liquid film thickness decreases with increasing aspect
   ratio, mass flux, and vapor quality. The average liquid film thickness
   of R134a is about 40\% thinner than R410A. For round tubes, a vortex
   with its core lying at the bottom of the tube is observed in the vapor
   phase region, while this vortex is only noticeable at lower mass flux in
   flattened tubes. The transportation of vapor phase from the core region
   to the wall region, like the flow pattern of longitudinal vortex, will
   also enhance heat transfer. The numerically-computed heat transfer
   coefficients and frictional pressure gradients for flattened tubes are
   compared with their counterparts from empirical correlations. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In a decentralized two-stage supply chain where a supplier serves a
   retailer who, in turn, serves end customers, operations decisions based
   on local incentives often lead to suboptimal system performance.
   Operating decisions based on local incentives may in such cases lead to
   a lack of system coordination, wherein one party's decisions put the
   other party and/or the system at a disadvantage. While models and
   mechanisms for such problem classes have been considered in the
   literature, little work to date has considered such problems under
   nonstationary demands and fixed replenishment order costs. This paper
   models such two-stage problems as a class of Stackelberg games where the
   supplier announces a set of time-phased ordering costs to the retailer
   over a discrete time horizon of finite length, and the retailer then
   creates an order plan, which then serves as the supplier's demand. We
   provide metrics for characterizing the degree of efficiency (and
   coordination) associated with a solution, and provide a set of easily
   understood and implemented mechanisms that can increase this efficiency
   and reduce the negative impacts of uncoordinated decisions. (C) 2016

Title = {{A statistical based framework for predicting field cracking performance

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{226-234}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Most existing cracking performance models of asphalt pavements, such as
   top-down cracking models, are mechanistic or mechanistic-empirical
   based. These models usually focus on a specific type of cracking
   mechanism. The prediction quality of these models can also vary when
   field cracking conditions are complicated and clear identification of
   the distress type is difficult. Literature suggests that a statistical
   based method can account for variability and a large number of
   influencing factors, and could be a promising alternative. This paper
   aims to introduce a statistical based framework for performance
   prediction using top-down cracking as an example. Such a framework can
   be modified and implemented by local agencies for a variety of cracking
   distresses based on specific needs and requirements. Detailed steps of
   the statistical framework are presented through the development of
   top-down cracking models. Results indicate that the framework works
   effectively by integrating pavement performance concepts with several
   statistical methods including Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression,
   Binary Logistic Regression, and Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV).
   Using the developed statistical based framework, critical factors that
   may affect the initiation and propagation of top-down cracking are
   identified, and their sensitivities to the field top-down cracking are
   further discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A molecular dynamics study of dislocation density generation and plastic
   relaxation during shock of single crystal Cu}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{The molecular dynamics simulation method is used to investigate the
   dependence of crystal orientation and shock wave strength on dislocation
   density evolution in single crystal Cu. Four different shock directions
   < 100 >, < 110 >, < 111 >, and < 321 > are selected to study the role of
   crystal orientation on dislocation generation immediately behind the
   shock front and plastic relaxation as the system reaches the hydrostatic
   state. Dislocation density evolution is analyzed for particle velocities
   between the Hugoniot elastic limit (upHEL) for each orientation up to a
   maximum of 1.5 km/s. Generally, dislocation density increases with
   increasing particle velocity for all shock orientations. Plastic
   relaxation for shock in the < 110 >, < 111 >, and < 321 > directions is
   primarily due to a reduction in the Shockley partial dislocation
   density. In addition, plastic anisotropy between these orientations is
   less apparent at particle velocities above 1.1 km/s. In contrast,
   plastic relaxation is limited for shock in the < 100 > orientation. This
   is partially due to the emergence of sessile stair-rod dislocations with
   Burgers vectors of 1/3 < 100 > and 1/6 < 110 >. The nucleation of 1/6 <
   110 > dislocations at lower particle velocities is mainly due to the
   reaction between Shockley partial dislocations and twin boundaries. On
   the other hand, for the particle velocities above 1.1 km/s, the
   nucleation of 1/3 < 100 > dislocations is predominantly due to reaction
   between Shockley partial dislocations at stacking fault intersections.
   Both mechanisms promote greater dislocation densities after relaxation
   for shock pressures above 34 GPa compared to the other three shock
   orientations. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Electric field-induced changes in the domain wall motion of
   (1-x)Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O-3-xPbTiO(3) (BMT-xPT) near the morphotropic phase
   boundary (MPB) where x = 0.37 (BMT-37PT) and x = 0.38 (BMT-38PT), are
   studied by means of synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Through Rietveld
   analysis and profile fitting, a mixture of coexisting monoclinic (Cm)
   and tetragonal (P4mm) phases is identified at room temperature.
   Extrinsic contributions to the property coefficients are evident from
   electric-field-induced domain wall motion in both the tetragonal and
   monoclinic phases, as well as through the interphase boundary motion
   between the two phases. Domain wall motion in the tetragonal and
   monoclinic phases for BMT-37PT is larger than that of BMT-38PT, possibly
   due to this composition's closer proximity to the MPB. Increased
   interphase boundary motion was also observed in BMT-37PT. Lattice
   strain, which is a function of both intrinsic piezoelectric strain and
   elastic interactions of the grains (the latter originating from domain
   wall and interphase boundary motion), is similar for the respective

Abstract = {{Obtaining meaningful drug release profiles for drug formulations is
   essential prior to in vivo testing and for ensuring consistent quality.
   The release kinetics of hydrophobic drugs from nanocarriers (NCs) are
   not well understood because the standard protocols for maintaining sink
   conditions and sampling are not valid owing to mass transfer and
   solubility limitations. In this work, a new in vitro assay protocol
   based on `lipid sinks' and magnetic separation produces release
   conditions that mimic the concentrations of lipid membranes and
   lipoproteins in vivo, facilitates separation, and thus allows
   determination of intrinsic release rates of drugs from NCs. The assay
   protocol is validated by (i) determining the magnetic separation
   efficiency, (ii) demonstrating that sink condition requirements are met,
   and (iii) accounting for drug by completing a mass balance. NCs of
   itraconazole and cyclosporine A (CsA) were prepared and the drug release
   profiles were determined. This release protocol has been used to compare
   the drug release from a polymer stabilized NC of CsA to a solid drug NP
   of CsA alone. These data have led to the finding that stabilizing block
   copolymer layers have a retarding effect on drug release from NCs,
   reducing the rate of CsA release fourfold compared with the nanoparticle
   without a polymer coating.

Title = {{Amplitude of Sensorimotor Mu Rhythm Is Correlated with BOLD from
   Multiple Brain Regions: A Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{The mu rhythm is a field oscillation in the similar to 10Hz range over
   the sensorimotor cortex. For decades, the suppression of mu
   (event-related desynchronization) has been used to index movement
   planning, execution, and imagery. Recent work reports that non-motor
   processes, such as spatial attention and movement observation, also
   desynchronize mu, raising the possibility that the mu rhythm is
   associated with the activity of multiple brain regions and systems. In
   this study, we tested this hypothesis by recording simultaneous
   resting-state EEG-fMRI from healthy subjects. Independent component
   analysis (ICA) was applied to extract the mu components. The amplitude
   (power) fluctuations of mu were estimated as a time series using a
   moving-window approach, which, after convolving with a canonical
   hemodynamic response function (HRF), was correlated with
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from the entire brain. Two
   main results were found. First, mu power was negatively correlated with
   BOLD from areas of the sensorimotor network, the attention control
   network, the putative mirror neuron system, and the network thought to
   support theory of mind. Second, mu power was positively correlated with
   BOLD from areas of the salience network, including anterior cingulate
   cortex and anterior insula. These results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that sensorimotor mu rhythm is associated with multiple brain
   regions and systems. They also suggest that caution should be exercised
   when attempting to interpret mu modulation in terms of a single brain
   network.}},

Abstract = {{We report a systematic study that explores how the triplet excited state
   is influenced by conjugation length in a series of benzothiadiazole
   units containing donor-acceptor-donor (DAD)-type platinum acetylide

   series were characterized by an array of photophysical methods including
   steady-state luminescence spectroscopy and femtosecond-nanosecond
   transient absorption spectroscopy. In addition to the experimental work,
   a computational study using density functional theory was conducted to
   gain more information about the structure, composition, and energies of
   the frontier molecular orbitals. It is observed that both the singlet
   and triplet excited states are mainly localized on a single
   donor-acceptor-donor unit in the oligomers. Interestingly, it is
   discovered that the intersystem crossing efficiency increases
   dramatically in the longer oligomers. The effect is attributed to an
   enhanced contribution of the heavy metal platinum in the frontier
   orbitals (HOMO and LUMO), an effect that leads to enhanced spin-orbit
   coupling.}},

Abstract = {{A novel polymer-coated nitrogen (N) fertilizer was developed using
   bio-based polyurethane (PU) derived from liquefied locust sawdust as the
   coating material. The bio-based PU was successfully coated on the
   surface of the urea fertilizer prills to form polymer-coated urea (PCU)
   fertilizer for controlled N release. Epoxy resin (EP) was also used to
   further modify the bio-based PU to synthesize the interpenetrating
   network (IPN), enhancing the slow-release properties of the PCU. The N
   release characteristics of the EP-modified PCU (EMPCU) in water were
   determine at 25 degrees C and compared to that of PCU and EP-coated urea
   (ECU). The results showed that the EP modification reduced the N release
   rate and increased the longevity of the fertilizer coated with bio-based
   PU. A corn growth study was conducted to further evaluate the filed
   application of the EMPCU. In comparison to commercial PCU and
   conventional urea fertilizer, EMPCU was more effective and increased the
   yield and total dry matter accumulation of the corn. Findings from this
   work indicated that bio-based PU derived from sawdust can be used as
   coating materials for PCU, particularly after EP modification. The
   resulting EMPCU was more environmentally friendly and cost-effective
   than conventional urea fertilizers coated by EP.}},

Abstract = {{The microtiter plate has been an essential tool for diagnostics,
   high-throughput screening, and biological assays. We present an
   alternative platform to perform bioassays in a microplate format that
   exploits evaporation to drive assay reactions. Our method consists of
   droplets suspended on plastic pillars; reactions occur in these droplets
   instead of the wells. The pillars are fabricated by milling, and the
   rough surface created by this fabrication method pins the droplet to a
   constant contact line during the assay and also acts as a hydrophobic
   surface. Upon evaporation, natural convection arising from Marangoni
   currents mixes solutions in the droplet, which speeds up assay
   reactions, decreases assay times, and increases limits of detection. As
   a proof of concept we implemented two colorimetric assays to detect
   glucose and proteins in only 1.5 mu L, without any external devices for
   mixing and with a digital microscope as a readout mechanism. Our
   platform is an ideal alternative to the microtiter plate, works with
   different volumes, is compatible with commercially available reagent
   dispensers and plate-readers, and could have broad applications in
   diagnostics and high-throughput screening.}},

Abstract = {{The persistent increase in atmospheric CO2 from anthropogenic sources
   makes research directed toward carbon capture and storage imperative.
   Current liquid amine absorption technology has several drawbacks
   including hazardous byproducts and a high-energy requirement for
   regeneration; therefore, research is ongoing to develop more practical
   methods for capturing CO2 in postcombustion scenarios. The unique
   properties of carbon-based materials make them specifically promising
   for CO2 adsorption at low temperature and moderate to high partial
   pressure. This critical review aims to highlight the development of
   carbon-based solid sorbents for postcombustion CO2 capture.
   Specifically, it provides an overview of postcombustion CO2 capture
   processes with solid adsorbents and discusses a variety of carbon-based
   materials that could be used. This review focuses on low-cost pyrogenic
   carbon, activated carbon (AC), and metal-carbon composites for CO2
   capture. Further, it touches upon the recent progress made to develop
   metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and carbon nanomaterials and their
   general CO2 sorption potential.}},

Abstract = {{A biphasic one-pot polymerization method enables the preparation of
   block copolymers from monomers with similar and competitive reactivities
   without the addition of external materials. AB diblock copolymers were
   prepared by encapsulating a frozen solution of monomer B on the bottom
   of a reaction vessel, while the solution polymerization of monomer A was
   conducted in a liquid layer above. Physical separation between the solid
   and liquid phases permitted only homopolymerization of monomer A until
   heating above the melting point of the lower phase, which released
   monomer B, allowing the addition of the second block to occur. The
   triggered release of monomer B allowed for chain extension without
   additional deoxygenation steps or exogenous monomer addition. A method
   for the closed (i.e., without addition of external reagents) one-pot
   synthesis of block copolymers with conventional glassware using
   straightforward experimental techniques has thus been developed.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate determination of the preferred Si12C12 isomer is important
   to guide experimental efforts directed towards synthesizing SiC
   nano-wires and related polymer structures which are anticipated to be
   highly efficient exciton materials for the opto-electronic devices. In
   order to definitively identify preferred isomeric structures for silicon
   carbon nano-clusters, highly accurate geometries, energies, and harmonic
   zero point energies have been computed using coupled-cluster theory with
   systematic extrapolation to the complete basis limit for set of silicon
   carbon clusters ranging in size from SiC3 to Si12C12. It is found that
   post-MBPT( 2) correlation energy plays a significant role in obtaining
   converged relative isomer energies, suggesting that predictions using
   low rung density functional methods will not have adequate accuracy.
   Utilizing the best composite coupled-cluster energy that is still
   computationally feasible, entailing a 3-4 SCF and coupled-cluster theory
   with singles and doubles extrapolation with triple-zeta ( T)
   correlation, the closo Si12C12 isomer is identified to be the preferred
   isomer in the support of previous calculations {[} X. F. Duan and L. W.
   Burggraf, J. Chem. Phys. 142, 034303 ( 2015)]. Additionally we have
   investigated more pragmatic approaches to obtaining accurate silicon
   carbide isomer energies, including the use of frozen natural orbital
   coupled-cluster theory and several rungs of standard and double-hybrid
   density functional theory. Frozen natural orbitals as a way to compute
   post-MBPT( 2) correlation energy are found to be an excellent balance
   between efficiency and accuracy. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a systematic study that shows how the numerous

   laser annealing (PLA) can be manipulated to control the quantity and
   quality of graphene (G), few-layer graphene (FLG), and other carbon
   nanostructures selectively synthesized in crystalline SiC (c-SiC).
   Controlled implantations of Si- plus C- and Au+ ions in c-SiC showed
   that both the thickness of the amorphous layer formed by ion damage and
   the doping effect of the implanted Au enhance the formation of G and FLG
   during PLA. The relative contributions of the amorphous and doping
   effects were studied separately, and thermal simulation calculations
   were used to estimate surface temperatures and to help understand the
   phase changes occurring during PLA. In addition to the amorphous layer
   thickness and catalytic doping effects, other enhancement effects were
   found to depend on other ion species, the annealing environment, PLA
   fluence and number of pulses, and even laser frequency. Optimum II and
   PLA conditions are identified and possible mechanisms for selective
   synthesis of G, FLG, and carbon nanostructures are discussed. Published

Abstract = {{Using air to displace a viscous fluid contained in a Hele-Shaw cell can
   create a fingering pattern at the interface between the fluids if the
   capillary number exceeds a critical value. This Saffman-Taylor
   instability is revisited for the inverse case of a viscous fluid
   displacing air when partially wettable hydrophilic particles are lying
   on the walls. Though the inverse case is otherwise stable, the presence
   of the particles results in a fingering instability at low capillary
   number. This capillary-driven instability is driven by the integration
   of particles into the interface which results from the minimization of
   the interfacial energy. Both axisymmetric and rectangular geometries are
   considered in order to quantify this phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{The pairwise selectivity of hydrogenation is a fundamental quantity in
   hydrogenation catalysis that underpins the NMR signal enhancement
   achievable by parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP). Herein, we show
   how the crystal facet dependence of the pairwise selectivity of the
   semihydrogenation of propyne, when interpreted in the context of recent
   DFT calculations, can reveal new details about the hydrogenation
   mechanism. The pairwise selectivity of propyne hydrogenation is strongly
   shape dependent, which reflects the surface atom arrangements exposed on
   the different facets of CeO2 nanocrystals. In this first demonstration
   of a catalyst shape dependence of PHIP, an unprecedented pairwise
   selectivity of 8.1\% is observed over oxygen-deficient facets of rods,
   whereas oxygen-rich octahedra facets deliver only 1.6\% selectivity. The
   PHIP data are consistent with a concerted addition pathway through a
   six-membered-ring transition state, as predicted in the DFT study.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is a critical, geographically concentrated, nonrenewable
   resource necessary to support global food production. In excess (e.g.,
   due to runoff or wastewater discharges), P is also a primary cause of
   eutrophication. To reconcile the simultaneous shortage and overabundance
   of P, lost P flows must be recovered and reused, alongside improvements
   in P-use efficiency. While this motivation is increasingly being
   recognized, little P recovery is practiced today, as recovered P
   generally cannot compete with the relatively low cost of mined P.
   Therefore, P is often captured to prevent its release into the
   environment without beneficial recovery and reuse. However, additional
   incentives for P recovery emerge when accounting for the total value of
   P recovery. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the range
   of benefits of recovering P from waste streams, i.e., the total value of
   recovering P. This approach accounts for P products, as well as other
   assets that are associated with P and can be recovered in parallel, such
   as energy, nitrogen, metals and minerals, and water. Additionally, P
   recovery provides valuable services to society and the environment by
   protecting and improving environmental quality, enhancing efficiency of
   waste treatment facilities, and improving food security and social
   equity. The needs to make P recovery a reality are also discussed,
   including business models, bottlenecks, and policy and education
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have emerged as a promising
   security primitive for low-cost authentication and cryptographic key
   generation. However, PUF stability with respect to temporal variations
   still limits its utility and widespread acceptance. Previous techniques
   in the literature have focused on improving PUF robustness against
   voltage and temperature variations, but the issues associated with aging
   have been largely neglected. In this paper, we address aging in the
   popular ring oscillator (RO)-PUF. We propose a new aging-resistant
   design that reduces sensitivity to negative-bias temperature instability
   and hot-carrier injection stresses. Simulation results demonstrate that
   our aging-resistant RO-PUF (ARO-PUF) can produce unique, random, and
   more reliable keys. On an average, only 3.8\% bits of an ARO-PUF flip
   over a ten-year operational period because of aging, compared with a
   12.8\% bit flip for a conventional RO-PUF. The proposed ARO-PUF allows
   us to eliminate the need for error correction by adding extra ROs. The
   result shows that an ARO-PUF saves similar to 32x area overhead compared
   with a conventional RO-PUF with required error correction schemes for a
   reliable key.}},

Title = {{A new device for characterizing fracture networks and measuring

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the fundamental theory and laboratory test results
   on a new device that is deployed in boreholes in fractured rock aquifers
   to characterize vertical distributions of water and contaminant fluxes,
   aquifer hydraulic properties, and fracture network properties (e.g.,
   active fracture density and orientation). The device, a fractured rock
   passive flux meter (FRPFM), consists of an inflatable core assembled
   with upper and lower packers that isolate the zone of interest from
   vertical gradients within the borehole. The outer layer of the core
   consists of an elastic fabric mesh equilibrated with a visible dye which
   is used to provide visual indications of active fractures and measures
   of fracture location, orientation, groundwater flux, and the direction
   of that flux. Beneath the outer layer is a permeable sorbent that is
   preloaded with known amounts of water soluble tracers which are eluted
   at rates proportional to groundwater flow. This sorbent also captures
   target contaminants present in intercepted groundwater. The mass of
   contaminant sorbed is used to quantify cumulative contaminant flux;
   whereas, the mass fractions of resident tracers lost are used to provide
   measures of water flux. In this paper, the FRPFM is bench tested over a
   range of fracture velocities (2-20 m/day) using a single fracture flow
   apparatus (fracture aperture = 0.5 mm). Test results show a
   discoloration in visible dye corresponding to the location of the active
   fracture. The geometry of the discoloration can be used to discern
   fracture orientation as well as direction and magnitude of flow in the
   fracture. Average contaminant fluxes were measured within 16\% and water
   fluxes within 25\% of known imposed fluxes.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Submarine groundwater discharge provides freshwater and nutrients to
   coastal environments. In some places throughout the world, this direct
   connection between aquifers and oceans may also allow saltwater
   intrusion. Saltwater intrusion was studied at a submarine spring within
   a fringing reef lagoon on the eastern Yucatan Peninsula by observing its
   intratidal and synoptic-scale variations during wet and dry periods.
   Saltwater intrusion was linked to wave-driven setup, no rain, high
   tides, and sea-level rise caused by remote forcing from Yucatan Current
   variability. Jet discharge velocities were inversely related to tidal
   oscillations, with maximum velocities at low tides. The wet period
   produced saltwater intrusion at high tides associated with three
   different conditions: syzygy tides, wave setup, and Yucatan Current
   weakening. During the dry period, saltwater intrusion occurred
   throughout most high tides and was aided by Yucatan Current weakening
   and wind-driven setup within the lagoon. These results suggested that
   seasonal precipitation was most important in modulating spring
   discharge, followed by syzygy tides, Yucatan Current variability, and
   wave events. The spring discharge was modeled with a modified Bernoulli
   energy equation that included a friction term. Aquifer elevation and a
   friction factor were used as free parameters. The dry period produced
   the best model results because of infrequent rainfall that yielded a
   relatively steady aquifer level. Precipitation during the wet period
   most likely led to a more variable aquifer level, reducing the variance
   explained by the model that assumes a constant aquifer elevation.
   Nevertheless, the model predicted saltwater intrusion events reasonably
   well using simplified physics.}},

Abstract = {{The Capibaribe Estuary is a water body that crosses the Recife
   Metropolitan Area (RMA), one of the largest population centers in
   Brazil, and causes large pollutant loads and poor water quality. The
   fresh water inflow of wastewater from the RMA can account for three
   times the volume of the river discharge during the low discharge period.
   This article assesses the hydrodynamics and potential transport of
   particulate and dissolved scalars in this estuary. A field experiment
   was conducted to record the water level, current velocity, salinity,
   temperature and suspended particulate matter (SPM) contents during a
   full semi-diurnal tidal cycle. This experiment was performed during low
   river discharge and spring tide conditions. The estuary showed a
   partially mixed circulation pattern. The residual transport of water and
   salt were up estuary, while the SPM residual transport was down estuary.
   The former were understood as the effect of the residual circulation
   around the islands, while the latter was interpreted as a morphological
   factor inducing greater resuspension during the ebb, despite the
   symmetrical ebb and flood currents. This mechanism may transport SPM to
   the inner shelf, even under tide-dominated conditions when the opposite
   would be expected.}},

Abstract = {{The baseline active and passive (AP) algorithm of the NASA Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) mission disaggregates the brightness temperature
   (T-B) from a spatial resolution of 36 km to 9 km for the soil moisture
   (SM) using the radar backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) at 3 km. This
   algorithm was derived based upon an assumption of a linear relationship
   between T-B and sigma(0). In this study, we investigated the robustness
   of this assumption with plot-scale AP measurements obtained under
   different conditions of surface roughness and stages of growing sweet
   corn. The uncertainties in the estimated T-B at 9 km and, hence, the
   retrieved SM, due to uncertainties in the algorithm parameters, beta and
   Gamma, were assessed under different landcover heterogeneities. Overall,
   the linear regression was robust, with r(2) > 0.75 under bare soil
   conditions when surface scattering is dominant and > 0.52 during the
   growing season. The uncertainties in beta and Gamma due to AP
   observations result in uncertainties in retrieved SM < 0.04 m(3)/m(3)
   for most conditions of heterogeneity. The differences in T-B at 9 km,
   obtained when using beta derived from vegetation water content (VWC) and
   using those from radar vegetation index, were also assessed. The errors
   in retrieved SM could reach as high as 0.5 m(3)/m(3) for the worst-case
   scenario, when an intermediate scale contains high VWC, but the coarse
   scale region has low averaged VWC. These results suggest that
   determination of growth stages using a biophysical parameter is
   essential for beta estimations, particularly for highly heterogeneous
   landcovers.}},

Abstract = {{The Grand LAgrangian Deployment (GLAD) used multiscale sampling and GPS
   technology to observe time series of drifter positions with initial
   drifter separation of O(100 m) to O(10 km), and nominal 5 min sampling,
   during the summer and fall of 2012 in the northern Gulf of Mexico.
   Histograms of the velocity field and its statistical parameters are
   non-Gaussian; most are multimodal. The dominant periods for the surface
   velocity field are 1-2 days due to inertial oscillations, tides, and the
   sea breeze; 5-6 days due to wind forcing and submesoscale eddies; 9-10
   days and two weeks or longer periods due to wind forcing and mesoscale
   variability, including the period of eddy rotation. The temporal
   e-folding scales of a fitted drifter velocity autocorrelation function
   are bimodal with time scales, 0.25-0.50 days and 0.9-1.4 days, and are
   the same order as the temporal e-folding scales of observed winds from
   nearby moored National Data Buoy Center stations. The Lagrangian
   integral time scales increase from coastal values of 8 h to offshore
   values of approximately 2 days with peak values of 3-4 days. The
   velocity variance is large, O(1)m2/s2, the surface velocity statistics
   are more anisotropic, and increased dispersion is observed at flow
   bifurcations. Horizontal diffusivity estimates are O(103)m2/s in coastal
   regions with weaker flow to O(105)m2/s in flow bifurcations, a strong
   jet, and during the passage of Hurricane Isaac. The Gulf of Mexico
   surface velocity statistics sampled by the GLAD drifters are a strong
   function of the feature sampled, topography, and wind forcing.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer and separation of species in a tube using oscillatory
   flows are strongly affected by the fluid flow profiles in the tube. It
   has been well established that oscillatory motion in a one-dimensional
   flow configuration leads to a single tuning dimensionless frequency,
   where optimum separation may be effected. In this work, the effect on
   species separation by two-dimensional laminar flow arising in a
   rectangular cross section is studied and a surprising result is that a
   second tuning frequency may occur at lower dimensionless oscillation
   frequencies. The physics reveals that this new optimum disappears when
   the aspect ratio is either very large or close to unity. These
   observations are related to the flow profiles at different aspect
   ratios. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Planar thin film beta-Ga2O3 photodetectors were irradiated with 5 MeV
   protons at doses from 10(13) to 10(15) cm(-2), and the resulting effects
   on photocurrent, responsivity, quantum efficiency, and photo-to-dark
   current ratio at 254 nm wavelength were measured at both 25 and 150
   degrees C. The photocurrent increased with dose due to the introduction
   of damage from nonionizing energy loss by the protons. The total
   calculated vacancy concentration increased from 5 x 10(15) to 5 x 10(17)
   cm(-3) over the dose range investigated. The dark current increased in
   proportion with the implant dose, leading to a decrease in the ratio of
   photocurrent to dark current. The photocurrent induced by 254 nm
   illumination increased with dose, from similar to 0.3 x 10(-7) A at 25
   degrees C for a dose of 10(13) cm(-2) to similar to 10(-6) A at a dose
   of 10(15) cm(-2) at a fixed light intensity of 760 mu W/cm(2). The
   phototo- dark current ratio decreased from similar to 60 in the control

   corresponding external quantum efficiencies of similar to 10(3) \% in
   control samples, similar to 2 x 10(3) \% for a dose of 10(13) cm(-2),
   and 10 4 \% for a dose of 10(15) cm(-2). The mechanism for the increase
   in photocurrent is the introduction of gap states, since the dark
   current of the photodetectors was increased by illuminating with
   sub-bandgap (red or green laser light) for the proton irradiated
   samples. (C) 2016 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature dependent photoresponse of planar photodetectors
   fabricated on beta-Ga2O3 films grown on Al2O3 by metalorganic chemical
   vapor deposition to 254 nm wavelength, and blindness to 365 nm light,
   are reported over the range of 25-350 degrees C. Ohmic contacts were
   formed by Siimplantation and annealing at 900 degrees C, followed by
   deposition of Ti/Au metallization. The photocurrent induced by 254 nm
   illumination increased monotonically with temperature, from similar to
   2.5 x 10(-7) A at 25 degrees C to similar to 2.2 x 10(-6) A at 350
   degrees C at a fixed 254 nm light intensity of 760 lW/cm(2). The
   photosensitivity decreases at high temperatures in many photoconductors
   (thermal quenching), in sharp contrast to the photosensitivity increase
   with high temperatures in this study. This is ascribed to the presence
   of states in the gap of Ga2O3, whose presence was proven by exposure to
   below band-gap energy. In this case, the current still increased due to
   the presence of defect levels in the band gap and the generation of
   photocurrent is due to a transition between the valence or conduction
   band and impurity or defect levels within the band gap. The temperature
   dependent photo-to-dark current ratio for this wavelength was 328 at
   room temperature and decreased to similar to 9 at 350 degrees C. The
   responsivity increased from 5 to 36 A/W over this temperature range,
   with corresponding external quantum efficiencies of 2.5 x 10(3) \% at 25
   degrees C and 1.75 x 10(4) \% at 350 degrees C. Similarly large numbers
   reported for Ga2O3 photodetectors have previously been ascribed to
   carrier multiplication effects. (C) 2016 American Vacuum Society.}},

   expected, in all three types of HEMTs, more degradation of the device dc
   characteristics was observed for higher doses due to the larger

   HEMTs. The electrically stressed HEMTs after proton irradiation showed
   more degradation compared with reference and stressed/annealed HEMTs.
   After proton irradiation at a dose of 10 15 cm(-2), the drain saturation
   current and maximum transconductance of stressed HEMTs were decreased by
   28.5\% and 15\%, respectively, compared to 24\% and 11.5\%-12\%,
   respectively, for reference and stressed/annealed devices. The dc
   characteristics of stressed/annealed HEMTs after proton irradiation
   showed similar degradation trends compared with those of reference
   HEMTs, confirming that annealing is effective in removing defects
   created by the off-state stressing. In some cases, the authors also
   annealed stressed/irradiated HEMTs after the proton irradiation step.
   The drain current and transconductance of stressed/irradiated HEMTs were
   slightly increased after subsequent thermal annealing at 450 degrees C
   for 10 min, while reverse gate leakage current after annealing was
   decreased more than an order of magnitude. The interface trap density of
   stressed HEMTs after proton irradiation at a dose of 10 15 cm(-2)
   increased from 3.05 x 10(12) to 1.37 x 10(13)/cm(2) V and were reduced
   to 6.01 x 10(12)/cm(2) V following thermal annealing. Our results are
   consistent with the notion that off-state stressing creates defects that
   have a common origin with those created by proton irradiation, and thus,
   irradiation of off-state stressed devices leads to more defects than in
   unstressed devices that are subsequently irradiated. Annealing the
   stressed devices prior to irradiation makes them behave the same as
   unstressed HEMTs when both are irradiated with protons. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Silicon has been extensively used in manufacturing refractive infrared
   optics due to its high refractive index and excellent transmission over
   a very broad range of infrared wavebands. However, the high refractive
   index of silicon leads to large reflection loss which greatly limits the
   performance of the final optoelectronic devices. Here, the authors
   report a simple and scalable templating nanofabrication technology for
   making subwavelength-structured, broadband antireflection coatings on
   crystalline silicon wafers, targeting the midwavelength infrared (MWIR)
   waveband (3-8 mu m), which has important implications for various
   civilian and military purposes. Periodic arrays of silicon nanopillars
   with tapered shapes, which mimic the microstructured cornea of nocturnal
   moths, can be patterned on both surfaces of silicon wafers using
   self-assembled monolayer silica colloidal crystals as structural
   templates. The resultant moth-eye gratings can greatly enhance optical
   transmission for the entire MWIR region. Finite-difference time-domain
   simulations have also been performed and the theoretical predictions
   agree reasonably well with the experimental optical measurements. (C)

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned InGaN/GaN nanorod (NR)-based phosphor-free light
   emitting diodes (LEDs) using SiO2 nanohole patterns are demonstrated.
   The highly ordered SiO2 nanoholes were realized on a 2 mu m-thick
   n(+)GaN template by a two-step dry etching process. The use of
   C4F8/O-2/Ar plasma chemistries under the low pressure is found to
   greatly enlarge the bottom diameter of each hole, exhibiting high aspect
   ratio (AR similar to 9) and vertical etch profile (similar to 89
   degrees). SAG technique was used to define the height of the GaN NRs
   while the width is determined by the trimethylgallium flow rate and
   growth temperature. An LED structure consisted of three-pairs of
   InGaN/GaN quantum well and AlGaN electron blocking layer on the sidewall
   of the nanorod in a core-shell structure. The wavelengths were
   successfully tuned by controlling pitches of the rods, which was caused
   by the different growth rate and indium incorporation of conformally
   overgrown InGaN multiquantum wells. At the operating current density of
   1.5 A/cm(2) (65 mA), NR-based single-chip phosphor-free white LEDs with
   the dimension of 630 x 970 mu m(2) show highly stable white emission
   characteristics which are attractive for future solid-state lighting and
   full-color display applications. (C) 2016 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Deep traps were studied in multiple-finger AlGaN/GaN transistors with
   broad periphery by means of current-voltage and capacitance-voltage
   characteristics, reverse deep level transient spectroscopy, deep level
   transient spectroscopy with electrical (DLTS) and optical DLTS
   injection, and current DLTS (CDLTS) with gate voltage and drain voltage
   pulsing. Deep electron traps with activation energies of 0.25, 0.36,
   0.56, and 0.8-0.9 eV are found to be responsible for variations in
   threshold current with applied gate bias. These traps also give rise to
   current transients observed at different temperatures in CDLTS. The 0.25
   and 0.56 eV centers are most likely located at the AlGaN/GaN interface.
   The 0.25 eV state is believed to be nitrogen vacancy-related, the 0.36
   eV level is of unknown origin, the 0.56 eV level is likely due to point
   defects enhanced in the presence of dislocations, and responsible for
   low luminescence efficiency of nonpolar n-GaN and for degradation of GaN
   transistors and light-emitting diodes and light-emitting diodes, while
   the 0.8 eV-level has been attributed to either interstitial Ga or N.
   Hole-trap-like relaxations in CDLTS were observed at temperatures higher
   than similar to 300K and attributed to hole traps near E-v+0.9 eV
   located in the buffer layer. These have previously been assigned to
   either gallium vacancy-oxygen acceptor complexes (V-Ga-O)(2-) or carbon
   on nitrogen site acceptor (C-N(-)) complexes. These results show that
   the stability of GaN-based high electron mobility transistors on Si is
   still dominated by the high concentration of point defects present in

Abstract = {{Lightning electromagnetic fields in the presence of conducting

   the conducting structure on the two orthogonal components of magnetic
   field is analyzed, and resultant errors in the estimated lightning
   azimuth are evaluated. Influences of ground conductivity and lightning
   current waveshape parameters are also examined. When the azimuth vector
   passes through the center of conducting structure diagonally (e.g.,
   azimuth angle is 45 degrees) or parallel to its walls (e.g., azimuth
   angle is 0 degrees), the presence of conducting structure equally
   influences H-x and H-y, so that H-x/H-y is the same as in the absence of
   structure. Therefore, no azimuth error occurs in those configurations.
   When the conducting structure is not located on the azimuth vector, the
   structure influences H-x and H-y differently, with the resultant
   direction finding error being greater when the structure is located
   closer to the observation point.}},

Abstract = {{The rapidly growing incidences of counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs)
   pose a significant threat to the semiconductor industry. These ICs may
   suffer from functional, performance, or reliability issues and can
   affect chip manufacturers, system designers as well as end users. The
   standard chip/package level structural and functional tests are often
   inadequate in detecting various forms of counterfeit ICs. Moreover,
   existing design for security approaches are usually not attractive due
   to additional design modifications, hardware overhead, test cost, and
   inadequate robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel, low-overhead
   package-level IC integrity validation approach, referred to as P-Val,
   for unified protection against two primary forms of counterfeiting
   attacks: 1) recycling and 2) cloning. Protection against
   recycled/remarked chips is achieved through a unique active defense that
   inserts antifuses (AFs) (one-time programmable) to few select pins
   inside the package. It effectively disables the functionality or
   ``locks{''} these pins, which need to be programmed before first-time
   use to make a chip functional in a system. To protect against cloned
   ICs, intrinsic random variations in programmed resistances of AFs
   connected to some of the remaining IC pins are exploited to create
   unique chip-specific signatures for authentication. P-Val requires no
   die-level design modifications and remains effective for legacy designs.
   Moreover, we show that it is effective for small chips with just few
   pins including analog ICs, where common authentication approaches fail
   to work. We discuss optimal choice of AF structure and program
   parameters; their integration in IC packages; and the signature
   generation/verification process. Through mathematical analysis and
   simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism provides
   high level of protection against counterfeiting attacks at ultralow
   overhead (< 0.05\% package area).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we discussed the application of spectral and textural
   features in identifying early stage of the citrus greening disease
   (Huanglongbing or HLB). A total of 176 hyperspectral images of citrus
   leaves (60 for healthy, 60 for HLB-infected and 56 for zinc-deficient)
   were captured by using a near-ground hyper spectral imaging system.
   Regions of interest (ROI) were extracted manually from the part of
   pathological changes in the images to calculate the average reflectance
   spectra of each sample as the sample spectra, ranging from 396 to 1 010
   nm. The dimensions of the sample spectra were reduced with the
   algorithms of principal component analysis (PCA) and successive
   projection analysis (SPA). Classification models were built with the
   original spectra and candidate variables, the first four PCs selected by
   PCA and a set of wavelengths (630.5, 679.4, 749.4 and 899.9 nm) selected
   by SPA. The results based on a classifier of least square-support vector
   machine (LS-SVM) showed that the classification models built with the
   candidate variables selected by PCA and SPA had a better performance,
   achieving 89.7\% and 87.4\% in terms of average accuracy. In addition,
   two groups of textural features, extracted from gray images of the four
   selected wavelengths based on gray-level histogram and gray-level
   co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), were also used for the classifier. The
   first ten features ranked by SPA promoted the average accuracy of
   classifier significantly, achieving 100\%, 93.3\% and 92.9\% for the
   three class samples respectively. The results of this study indicated
   that it would be feasible to identify HLB using the image textural
   features based on selected wavelengths, and it provided a basis for
   developing a portable HLB detection system with multispectral imaging
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{With the greater availability of imaging spectrometer data, vegetation
   species classification in the presence of outlier and ambiguous spectra
   is an increasingly important and poorly addressed problem. At large
   scales, assuming that all test spectra are from one of the training
   classes is unrealistic. An attractive resolution of these problems is
   the possibility theory, which is an axiomatic system, like probability
   theory, that represents uncertain labels of outliers and ambiguities
   more flexibly. In this letter, two popular probabilistic classification
   algorithms, namely, the support vector machine (SVM) with Platt scaling
   (SVM-Platt) and the Gaussian process (GP) classifier (GPC), are
   evaluated and compared to a novel one-class GP (OCGP) possibilistic
   classifier. OCGP, unlike one-class classification with GP, another
   GP-based one-class classifier, finds the hyperparameters automatically.
   Experiments were conducted with two data sets. The OCGP outperformed
   SVM-Platt and GPC when tested with outlier spectra.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between low-Reynolds-number fluid flow and an
   electroactive membrane wing is characterized to illustrate changes in
   harmonic and transient behavior from electric field excitation of the
   membrane wing. The wing is constructed of a dielectric elastomer
   material that changes its tension as a function of the applied field.
   The field excitation leads to changes in the shape of the wing under
   aerodynamic loads and subsequently, increased lift and delay of stall.
   Prior work in time-averaged lift and drag characterization is extended
   to better understand dynamic characteristics. Benchtop membrane
   structural dynamics are compared with visual image correlation, hotwire
   measurements, and particle image velocimetry within a
   low-Reynolds-number wind tunnel. An applied electric field leads to a
   13.7\% reduction in structural resonance of the membrane under ambient
   conditions while wind tunnel measurements illustrate a 5.1\% reduction
   in resonance under the same applied field. Despite these differences,
   the structural and fluid dynamic harmonics are closely correlated for
   low-Reynolds-number flow at 10m/s.}},

Title = {{Mechanistic modeling of ophthalmic drug delivery to the anterior chamber
   by eye drops and contact lenses}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Ophthalmic drug for the anterior chamber diseases are delivered into
   tears by either eye drops or by extended release devices placed in the
   eyes. The instilled drug exits the eye through various routes including
   tear drainage into the nose through the canaliculi and transport across
   various ocular membranes. Understanding the mechanisms relevant to each
   route can be useful in predicting the dependency of ocular
   bioavailability on various formulation parameters, such as drug
   concentration, salinity, viscosity, etc. Mathematical modeling has been
   developed for each of the routes and validated by comparison with
   experiments. The individual models can be combined into a system model
   to predict the fraction of the instilled drug that reaches the target.
   This review summarizes the individual models for the transport of drugs
   across the cornea and conjunctiva and the canaliculi tear drainage. It
   also summarizes the combined tear dynamics model that can predict the
   ocular bioavailability of drugs instilled as eye drops. The predictions
   from the individual models and the combined model are in good agreement
   with experimental data. Both experiments and models predict that the
   corneal bioavailability for drugs delivered through eye drops is less
   than 5\% due to the small area of the cornea in comparison to the
   conjunctiva, and the rapid clearance of the instilled solution by tear
   drainage. A contact lens is a natural choice for delivering drugs to the
   cornea due to the placement of the contact in the immediate vicinity of
   the cornea. The drug released by the contact towards the cornea surface
   is trapped in the post lens tear film for extended duration of at least
   30 min allowing transport of a large portion into the cornea. The model
   predictions backed by in vivo animal and clinical data show that the
   bioavailability increases to about 50\% with contact lenses. This
   realization has encouraged considerable research towards delivering
   ocular drugs by contact lenses. Commercial contacts are, however, not
   ideal for drug delivery due to the short release durations which may
   necessitate wearing multiple lenses each day, reducing the viability of
   this approach. Recent research has focused on designing contacts that
   retain, all critical properties while increasing the release durations
   to a few hours or a few days. Beagle dog studies with contact lenses
   containing vitamin E nanobarriers to attenuate drug transport have shown
   promising results. Human studies using contacts for drug delivery have
   also been conducted for allergy therapy but drug eluting contacts are
   not available in the market for any therapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An upper motor neuron lesion (UMNL) can be caused by various
   neurological disorders or trauma and leads to disabilities.
   Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a technique that is
   widely used for rehabilitation and restoration of motor function for
   people suffering from UMNL. Typically, stability analysis for
   closed-loop NMES ignores the modulated implementation of NMES. However,
   electrical stimulation must be applied to muscle as a modulated series
   of pulses. In this paper, a muscle activation model with an amplitude
   modulated control input is developed to capture the discontinuous nature
   of muscle activation, and an identification-based closed-loop NMES
   controller is designed and analyzed for the uncertain amplitude
   modulated muscle activation model. Semi-global uniformly ultimately
   bounded tracking is guaranteed. The stability of the closed-loop system
   is analyzed with Lyapunov-based methods, and a pulse frequency related
   gain condition is obtained. Experiments are performed with five
   able-bodied subjects to demonstrate the interplay between the control
   gains and the pulse frequency, and results are provided which indicate
   that control gains should be increased to maintain stability if the
   stimulation pulse frequency is decreased to mitigate muscle fatigue. For
   the first time, this paper brings together an analysis of the controller
   and modulation scheme.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have shown that when a dense layer of solid particles
   surrounding a high-energy reactive material is explosively dispersed,
   the particles cluster locally leading to jetlike patterns. The formation
   of these coherent structures has yet to be fully understood and is
   believed to have its origin in the early moments of the explosive
   dispersal. This paper focuses on the early moments of an explosive
   dispersal of particles. In particular, the effect of initial
   perturbations on both the gas and particulate phase is investigated,
   considering heavy particles with a low initial particle volume fraction.
   Two-dimensional simulations are carried out, and results suggest that a
   distinctive heterogeneity in the form of a single wavelength
   perturbation in the rapidly expanding detonation products does not have
   a significant impact on the early evolution of neither the gas phase nor
   the cloud of particles. In contrast, the equivalent distinctive
   heterogeneity in the initial particle volume fraction distribution
   lingers for the duration of our simulations. Developing instabilities in
   the gas phase and at the inner-and outer-most front of the particle bed
   display a dominant wavelength equal to the wavelength of the initial
   perturbation in the particle volume fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging byte-addressable non-volatile memory technologies, such as
   phase change memory (PCM) and spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM), offer
   both the byte-addressability of memory and the durability of storage,
   thus making it feasible to build single-level store systems. To ensure
   the consistency of persistent data structures in the presence of power
   failures or system crashes, it requires flushing cache lines to
   persistent memory frequently, thus incurring non-trivial synchronization
   overhead. To mitigate this issue, we propose two techniques. First, we
   use non-volatile STT-RAM as scratchpad memory on chip to store recovery
   information, thereby eliminating synchronization cost in the logging
   phase due to the avoidance of off-chip logging operations. Second, we
   present an adaptive synchronization policy based on caching modes in
   terms of data access patterns, thereby eliminating unnecessary
   synchronization cost in the checkpoint phase. Evaluation results
   indicate that the two techniques improve the overall performance from
   2.15x to 2.39x compared with conventional transactional persistent
   memory.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop novel methods for
   photoacoustically determining the optical absorption coefficient of
   biological tissues using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.
   Methods: In this study, the authors propose two quantitative
   photoacoustic tomography (PAT) methods for mapping the optical
   absorption coefficient. The reconstruction methods combine conventional
   PAT with MC simulation in a novel way to determine the optical
   absorption coefficient of biological tissues or organs. Specifically,
   the authors' two schemes were theoretically and experimentally examined
   using simulations, tissue-mimicking phantoms, ex vivo, and in vivo
   tests. In particular, the authors explored these methods using several
   objects with different absorption contrasts embedded in turbid media and
   by using high-absorption media when the diffusion approximation was not
   effective at describing the photon transport.
   Results: The simulations and experimental tests showed that the
   reconstructions were quantitatively accurate in terms of the locations,
   sizes, and optical properties of the targets. The positions of the
   recovered targets were accessed by the property profiles, where the
   authors discovered that the off center error was less than 0.1 mm for
   the circular target. Meanwhile, the sizes and quantitative optical
   properties of the targets were quantified by estimating the full width
   half maximum of the optical absorption property. Interestingly, for the
   reconstructed sizes, the authors discovered that the errors ranged from
   0 for relatively small-size targets to 26\% for relatively large-size
   targets whereas for the recovered optical properties, the errors ranged
   from 0\% to 12.5\% for different cases.
   Conclusions: The authors found that their methods can quantitatively
   reconstruct absorbing objects of different sizes and optical contrasts
   even when the diffusion approximation is unable to accurately describe
   the photon propagation in biological tissues. In particular, their
   methods are able to resolve the intrinsic difficulties that occur when
   quantitative PAT is conducted by combining conventional PAT with the
   diffusion approximation or with radiation transport modeling. (C) 2016

Title = {{Janus Blocks: A Binary System Wear Instability}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this manuscript, a simple binary model is devised that describes the
   wear behavior of two blocks coupled under a constant, dynamically
   partitioned normal load. In this simple system, the frictional force is
   reacted by two independent springs and the blocks are allowed to move
   and wear independently based on system dynamics and kinematics. The only
   coupling between the blocks occurs through the partitioning of the
   applied normal load, which uses a pair of springs in parallel to model
   elasticity. This system is found to preferentially wear one of the
   blocks until two disparately unique conditions of steady wear are
   reached in the system: (1) a condition in which the partitioning of the
   load between the blocks yields equal wear and thus steady partitioning
   of the load and (2) a condition in which the pair of blocks go to zero
   wear by having one block not sliding but carrying all of the load and
   the other block completely slipping but carrying none of the load. These
   ``Janus blocks,'' the simplest of binary spring-block systems, begin
   life in a nominally identical state and then their behavior bifurcates,
   producing runaway or irregular wear. The onset of this instability can
   initiate from any differences in load partitioning, spring constants,
   friction coefficient, or wear rates (no matter how small).}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural contributions of nitrogen are a serious concern for many
   water resources and have spurred the implementation of riparian buffer
   zones to reduce groundwater nitrate (NO3). The optimum design for
   buffers is subject to debate, and there are few long-term studies. The
   objective of this project was to determine the effectiveness over time
   (12 yr) of buffer types (trees, switchgrass, fescue, native, and a
   control) and buffer widths (8 and 15 m) by measuring groundwater NO3-N
   and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) trends. At the intermediate
   groundwater depth (1.5-2.1 m), NO3-N reduction effectiveness was 2.5
   times greater (46 vs. 16\%) for the wider buffer, and, regardless of
   width, buffer effectiveness increased 0.62\% yr(-1). Buffer vegetative
   type was never statistically significant. In the deep-groundwater depth
   (2.1-3.5 m), there was no change in NO3-N removal over time, although
   the statistical interaction of width and vegetative type indicated a
   wide range of removal rates (19-82\%). The DOC concentrations were
   analyzed at the field/buffer and buffer/stream sampling locations.
   Depending on location position and groundwater sampling depth, DOC
   concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 mg L-1 at Year 0 and increased at
   a rate of 0.13 to 0.18 mg L-1 yr(-1) but always remained low (<= 5.0 mg
   L-1). Greater DOC concentrations in the intermediate-depth groundwater
   did not increase NO3-N removal; redox measurements indicated
   intermittent reduced soil conditions may have been limiting. This study
   suggests that riparian buffer width, not vegetation, is more important
   for NO3-N removal in the middle coastal plain of North Carolina for a
   newly established buffer.}},

Title = {{Discrimination performance in aging is vulnerable to interference and
   dissociable from spatial memory}},
Journal = {{LEARNING \& MEMORY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{339-348}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Hippocampal-dependent episodic memory and stimulus discrimination
   abilities are both compromised in the elderly. The reduced capacity to
   discriminate between similar stimuli likely contributes to multiple
   aspects of age-related cognitive impairment; however, the association of
   these behaviors within individuals has never been examined in an animal
   model. In the present study, young and aged F344xBN F1 hybrid rats were
   cross-characterized on the Morris water maze test of spatial memory and
   a dentate gyrus-dependent match-to-position test of spatial
   discrimination ability. Aged rats showed overall impairments relative to
   young in spatial learning and memory on the water maze task. Although
   young and aged learned to apply a match-to-position response strategy in
   performing easy spatial discriminations within a similar number of
   trials, a majority of aged rats were impaired relative to young in
   performing difficult spatial discriminations on subsequent tests.
   Moreover, all aged rats were susceptible to cumulative interference
   during spatial discrimination tests, such that error rate increased on
   later trials of test sessions. These data suggest that when faced with
   difficult discriminations, the aged rats were less able to distinguish
   current goal locations from those of previous trials. Increasing
   acetylcholine levels with donepezil did not improve aged rats' abilities
   to accurately perform difficult spatial discriminations or reduce their
   susceptibility to interference. Interestingly, better spatial memory
   abilities were not significantly associated with higher performance on
   difficult spatial discriminations. This observation, along with the
   finding that aged rats made more errors under conditions in which
   interference was high, suggests that match-to-position spatial
   discrimination performance may rely on extra-hippocampal structures such
   as the prefrontal cortex, in addition to the dentate gyrus.}},

   monolayers}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{71-80}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Functional groups in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) provide a way to
   tailor the structural, thermal and electrical properties of interfaces,
   as the interaction between SAMs and target surfaces can range from
   weakly bonded to strong bonding. The present study focuses on evaluating
   the interfacial mechanical properties of SAMs with different affinities
   to a gold film. We use molecular dynamics (MD) with the ReaxFF potential
   to evaluate the spallation response of the SAM-gold interface
   characteristics for two SAMs, namely dodecyltriethoxysilane (DTES) and
   11-mercapto-undecyltrimethoxysilane (MUTMS), which respectively have
   weak and strong bonding with gold. MD simulations predict the MUTMS-gold
   interface to be four times stronger than the DTES-gold interface. Laser
   spallation experiments performed to evaluate the cohesive strength of
   the two SAMs show a similar ratio of cohesive strength; however MD
   results are about 50 times higher than experimental observations. AFM
   surface analyses of interacting interfaces demonstrate that surface
   roughness values are of the same order as atomistic interactions. The
   role played by surface roughness is then incorporated in a simple
   continuum model. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Calcium carbonate-based permeable reactive barriers for iron and
   manganese groundwater remediation at landfills}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{128-135}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{High concentrations of iron (Fe(II)) and manganese (Mn(II)) reductively
   dissolved from soil minerals have been detected in groundwater
   monitoring wells near many municipal solid waste landfills. Two in situ
   permeable reactive barriers (PRBs), comprised of limestone and crushed
   concrete, were installed down gradient of a closed, unlined landfill in
   Florida, USA, to remediate groundwater containing high concentrations of
   these metals. Influent groundwater to the PRBs contained mean Fe and Mn
   concentrations of approximately 30 mg/L and 1.62 mg/L, respectively.
   PRBs were constructed in the shallow aquifer (maximum depth 4.6 m below
   land surface) and groundwater was sampled from a network of nearby
   monitoring wells to evaluate barrier performance in removing these
   metals. PRBs significantly (p < 0.05) removed dissolved Fe and Mn from
   influent groundwater; Fe was removed from influent water at average
   rates of 91\% and 95\% (by mass) for the limestone and crushed concrete
   PRBs, respectively, during the first year of the study. The performance
   of the PRBs declined after 3 years of operation, with Fe removal
   efficiency decreasing to 64\% and 61\% for limestone and concrete PRBs,
   respectively. A comparison of water quality in shallow and deep
   monitoring wells showed a more dramatic performance reduction in the
   deeper section of the concrete PRB, which was attributed to an influx of
   sediment into the barrier and settling of particulates from the upper
   portions of the PRBs. Although removal of Fe and Mn from redox impacts
   was achieved with the PRBs, the short time frame of effectiveness
   relative to the duration of a full-scale remediation effort may limit
   the applicability of these systems at some landfills because of the
   construction costs required. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An attitude tracking controller is developed for control moment
   gyroscope (CMG)-actuated satellites, which is shown to achieve accurate

   development of a Lyapunov-based design/analysis that indicates
   exponential convergence to an arbitrarily small domain. The result is
   obtained despite the characteristics of the uncertainty; the
   nonvanishing disturbance terms; and the fact that the control input is
   premultiplied by a non-square, time-varying, nonlinear, uncertain
   matrix. In addition to the Lyapunov-based analysis, experimental results

Abstract = {{We propose a method of estimating the motion of a monocular camera
   looking at moving objects and their range. Unlike the previous studies
   where the camera and object motion should be constrained in estimating
   structure and motion (SaM) of moving objects, the proposed method do not
   require those constraints even though only a monocular camera is used.
   By first arranging the SaM dynamics in terms of the measurable states,
   we design robust nonlinear observers in a sequential way for both static
   (stationary) and dynamic (moving) objects. Through the combination of
   these estimates obtained by nonlinear observers, the reconstruction of
   the 3-D structure of the dynamic objects can be achieved using just 2-D
   images of a monocular camera. Simulations are performed in the case of
   changing camera and object velocities, such that the advantages of the
   proposed method can be clearly demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Evapotranspiration from drained wetlands with different hydrologic
   regimes: Drivers, modeling, and storage functions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{538}},
Pages = {{416-428}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We tested whether the current understanding of insignificant effect of
   drainage on evapotranspiration (ET) in the temperate region wetlands
   applies to those in the subtropics. Hydro-climatic drivers causing the
   changes in drained wetlands were identified and used to develop a
   generic model to predict wetland ET. Eddy covariance (EC)-based ET
   measurements were made for two years at two differently drained but
   close by wetlands, a heavily drained wetland (SW) (97\% reduced surface
   storage) and a more functional wetland (DW) (42\% reduced storage).
   Annual ET for more intensively drained SW was 836 mm, 34\% less than DW
   (1271 mm) and the difference was significant (p = 0.001). This
   difference was mainly due to drainage driven differences in inundation
   and associated effects on net radiation (R-n) and local relative
   humidity. Two generic daily ET models, a regression model (MSE = 0.44
   mm(2), R-2 = 0.80) and a machine learning -based Relevance Vector
   Machine (RVM) model (MSE = 0.36 mm(2), R-2 = 0.84), were developed with
   the latter being more robust. The RVM model can predict changes in ET
   for different restoration scenarios; a 1.1 m rise in drainage level
   showed 7\% increase ET (18 mm) at SW while the increase at DW was
   negligible. The additional ET, 28\% of surface flow, can enhance water
   storage, flood protection, and climate mitigation services at SW
   compared to DW. More intensely drained wetlands at higher elevation
   should be targeted for restoration for enhanced storage through
   increased ET. The models developed can predict changes in ET for
   improved evaluation of basin-scale effects of restoration programs and
   climate change scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Alpha power indexes task-related networks on large and small scales: A
   multimodal ECoG study in humans and a non-human primate}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{122-131}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Performing different tasks, such as generating motor movements or
   processing sensory input, requires the recruitment of specific networks
   of neuronal populations. Previous studies suggested that power
   variations in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) may implement such recruitment of
   task-specific populations by increasing cortical excitability in
   task-related areas while inhibiting population-level cortical activity
   in task-unrelated areas (Klimesch et al., 2007; Jensen and Mazaheri,
   2010). However, the precise temporal and spatial relationships between
   the modulatory function implemented by alpha oscillations and
   population-level cortical activity remained undefined. Furthermore,
   while several studies suggested that alpha power indexes task-related
   populations across large and spatially separated cortical areas, it was
   largely unclear whether alpha power also differentially indexes smaller
   networks of task-related neuronal populations. Here we addressed these
   questions by investigating the temporal and spatial relationships of
   electrocorticographic (ECoG) power modulations in the alpha band and in
   the broadband gamma range (70-170 Hz, indexing population-level
   activity) during auditory and motor tasks in five human subjects and one
   macaque monkey. In line with previous research, our results confirm that
   broadband gamma power accurately tracks task-related behavior and that
   alpha power decreases in task-related areas. More importantly, they
   demonstrate that alpha power suppression lags population-level activity
   in auditory areas during the auditory task, but precedes it in motor
   areas during the motor task. This suppression of alpha power in
   task-related areas was accompanied by an increase in areas not related
   to the task. In addition, we show for the first time that these
   differential modulations of alpha power could be observed not only
   across widely distributed systems (e.g., motor vs. auditory system), but
   also within the auditory system. Specifically, alpha power was
   suppressed in the locations within the auditory system that most
   robustly responded to particular sound stimuli. Altogether, our results
   provide experimental evidence for a mechanism that preferentially
   recruits task-related neuronal populations by increasing cortical
   excitability in task-related cortical areas and decreasing cortical
   excitability in task-unrelated areas. This mechanism is implemented by
   variations in alpha power and is common to humans and the non-human
   primate under study. These results contribute to an increasingly refined
   understanding of the mechanisms underlying the selection of the specific
   neuronal populations required for task execution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{86-101}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We compare 27 wheat models' yield responses to interannual climate
   variability, analyzed at locations in Argentina, Australia, India, and
   The Netherlands as part of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and
   Improvement Project (AgMIP) Wheat Pilot. Each model simulated 1981-2010
   grain yield, and we evaluate results against the interannual variability
   of growing season temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The
   amount of information used for calibration has only a minor effect on
   most models' climate response, and even small multi-model ensembles
   prove beneficial. Wheat model clusters reveal common characteristics of
   yield response to climate; however models rarely share the same cluster
   at all four sites indicating substantial independence. Only a weak
   relationship (R-2 <= 0.24) was found between the models' sensitivities
   to interannual temperature variability and their response to long-term
   warming, suggesting that additional processes differentiate climate
   change impacts from observed climate variability analogs and motivating
   continuing analysis and model development efforts. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was the largest marine oil spill in US
   waters to date and one of the largest worldwide. Impacts of this spill
   on salt marsh vegetation have been well documented, although impacts on
   marsh macroinvertebrates have received less attention. To examine
   impacts of the oil spill on an important marsh invertebrate and
   ecosystem engineer, we conducted a meta-analysis on fiddler crabs (Uca
   spp.) using published sources and newly available Natural Resources
   Damage Assessment (NRDA) and Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI)
   data. Fiddler crabs influence marsh ecosystem structure and function
   through their burrowing and feeding activities and are key prey for a
   number of marsh and estuarine predators. We tested the hypothesis that
   the spill affected fiddler crab burrow density (crab abundance), burrow
   diameter (crab size), and crab species composition. Averaged across
   multiple studies, sites, and years, our synthesis revealed a negative
   effect of oiling on all three metrics. Burrow densities were reduced by
   39 \% in oiled sites, with impacts and incomplete recovery observed over
   2010-2014. Burrow diameters were reduced from 2010 to 2011, but appeared
   to have recovered by 2012. Fiddler crab species composition was altered
   through at least 2013 and only returned to reference conditions where
   marsh vegetation recovered, via restoration planting in one case. Given
   the spatial and temporal extent of data analyzed, this synthesis
   provides compelling evidence that the Deepwater Horizon spill suppressed
   populations of fiddler crabs in oiled marshes, likely affecting other
   ecosystem attributes, including marsh productivity, marsh soil
   characteristics, and associated predators.}},

Title = {{Efficient Resource Constrained Scheduling Using Parallel Structure-Aware
   Pruning Techniques}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2059-2073}},

Abstract = {{Branch-and-bound approaches are promising in pruning fruitless search
   space during the resource constrained scheduling. However, such
   approaches only compare the estimated upper and lower bounds of an
   incomplete schedule to the length of the best feasible schedule at that
   iteration, which does not fully exploit the potential of the pruning
   during the search. Aiming to improve the performance of resource
   constrained scheduling, this paper proposes a parallel structure-aware
   pruning approach that can traverse the search space significantly faster
   than state-of-the-art branch-and-bound techniques. This paper makes
   three major contributions: i) it proposes an efficient pruning technique
   using the structural scheduling information of the obtained best
   feasible schedules; ii) it investigates how to perform parallel search
   to enable efficient multi-directional search and generation of effective
   fences by tuning the operation enumeration order; and iii) it presents a
   framework that supports the sharing of minimum upper-bound and fence
   information among different search tasks to enable efficient parallel
   structure-aware pruning. The experimental results demonstrate that our
   parallel pruning approach can drastically reduce the overall resource
   constrained scheduling time under a wide variety of resource
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study data-driven chance constrained stochastic
   programs, or more specifically, stochastic programs with
   distributionally robust chance constraints (DCCs) in a data-driven
   setting to provide robust solutions for the classical chance constrained
   stochastic program facing ambiguous probability distributions of random
   parameters. We consider a family of density-based confidence sets based
   on a general -divergence measure, and formulate DCC from the perspective
   of robust feasibility by allowing the ambiguous distribution to run
   adversely within its confidence set. We derive an equivalent
   reformulation for DCC and show that it is equivalent to a classical
   chance constraint with a perturbed risk level. We also show how to
   evaluate the perturbed risk level by using a bisection line search
   algorithm for general -divergence measures. In several special cases,
   our results can be strengthened such that we can derive closed-form
   expressions for the perturbed risk levels. In addition, we show that the
   conservatism of DCC vanishes as the size of historical data goes to
   infinity. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between the
   conservatism of DCC and the size of historical data, which can help
   indicate the value of data. Finally, we conduct extensive computational
   experiments to test the performance of the proposed DCC model and
   compare various -divergence measures based on a capacitated lot-sizing
   problem with a quality-of-service requirement.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-Raman spectroscopy (MRS) was utilized to investigate the
   graphitization of diamond particles within a UO2-diamond composite
   processed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). While pure diamond gives a
   sharp Raman peak at 1331.6 cm(-1), the graphitized diamond shows broad
   peaks either at 1350 cm(-1) (G-peak) or 1580 cm(-1) (D-peak). The degree
   of graphitization was quantified by calculating the area beneath the
   diamond and graphite peaks. It was found that more than 20\% of diamond
   was graphitized on the surface of the UO2-diamond pellet and only around
   10\% diamond was graphitized in the interior regions of the pellet. This
   current study highlights the necessity to review the implications of
   these results carefully while implementing UO2-diamond composite nuclear
   fuel. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A re-formulated and re-parameterized interatomic potential for uranium
   metal in the Charge-Optimized Many-Body (COMB) formalism is presented.
   Most physical properties of the orthorhombic alpha and bcc gamma phases
   are accurately reproduced. In particular, this potential can reproduce
   the negative thermal expansion of the b axis in alpha-U while keeping
   this phase as the most stable phase at low temperatures, in accord with
   experiment. Most of the volume expansion in alpha-U by intrinsic defects
   is shown to come from the b axis, due to the formation of prismatic
   loops normal to this direction. Glide dislocation loops forming stacking
   faults are also observed. Structures of both loop types are analyzed. An
   expansion simulation is conducted and the results are verified by using
   the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens model. Rather than forming extended defect
   structures as in alpha-U, the gamma phase forms only isolated defects
   and thus results in a much smaller and isotropic expansion. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Zirconium carbide and zirconium nitride are candidate materials for new

   ZrC and ZrN samples were irradiated at the Advanced Test Reactor

   using high resolution transmission electron microscopy, and the findings
   compared with a previous study of ZrC irradiated with protons at 800

   (XAFS) to characterize the radiation damage was also explored including
   a model based on spherical crystallites that can be used to relate EXAFS

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represent a promising technology in
   the renewable energy portfolio. In this study, tin-doped indium oxide
   (ITO) nanowires are used to prepare DSSC photoanodes that overcome
   charge transport limitations associated with conventional
   nanoparticle-based photoanodes. Vertically-aligned ITO nanowires are
   grown by a thermal evaporation method and a porous TiO2 shell layer is
   uniformly coated on the nanowire surfaces to ensure high dye-loading. It
   is found that cell efficiency increased to 4.85\% from 2.81\% when a
   dense HfO2 blocking layer is inserted between ITO nanowire surfaces and
   the porous TiO2 shell. While more photoactive surface area associated
   with longer nanowires improves device performance, nanowires longer than
   20 mu m show reduced efficiency from an increase in electron
   recombination. Therefore, 20-mu m-long nanowires show the best
   efficiency, which is attributed to the balance of surface area and
   electron recombination in the photoanode. Although decreasing TiO2
   annealing temperatures from 600 to 400 degrees C increases electron
   recombination, the smaller TiO2 nanoparticles at 400 degrees C lead to
   much higher dye-loading and, ultimately, the highest device efficiency
   of 5.59\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surrogate assisted global optimization is gaining popularity. Similarly,
   modern advances in computing power increasingly rely on parallelization
   rather than faster processors. This paper examines some of the methods
   used to take advantage of parallelization in surrogate based global
   optimization. A key issue focused on in this review is how different
   algorithms balance exploration and exploitation. Most of the papers
   surveyed are adaptive samplers that employ Gaussian Process or Kriging
   surrogates. These allow sophisticated approaches for balancing
   exploration and exploitation and even allow to develop algorithms with
   calculable rate of convergence as function of the number of parallel
   processors. In addition to optimization based on adaptive sampling,
   surrogate assisted parallel evolutionary algorithms are also surveyed.
   Beyond a review of the present state of the art, the paper also argues
   that methods that provide easy parallelization, like multiple parallel
   runs, or methods that rely on population of designs for diversity
   deserve more attention.}},

Title = {{Experimental determination of nonequilibrium transport parameters
   reflecting the competitive sorption between Cu and Pb in slag-sand
   column}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{335-342}},

Abstract = {{Competitive sorption and resulting nonequilibrium transport of Cu and Pb
   were investigated using slag as a primary sorbent. A series of
   estimation models were applied based on the equilibrium, and
   nonequilibrium sorption respectively, and finally calibrated by
   incorporating the experimentally determined batch kinetic data. When
   applied individually, the behavior of metals in slag-sand column were
   well predicted by both equilibrium and nonequilibrium models in CXTFIT
   code. However, coexisting Cu and Pb exhibited competition for sorption
   sites, generating an irregular breakthrough curves such as overshoot
   (higher concentration in effluent than the feed concentration) of Cu and
   corresponding earlier peak of Pb followed by gradual re-rising. Although
   two-site nonequilibrium model further considers coupled hydrochemical
   process, desorption of the Cu from competition made the model prediction
   inaccurate. However, the parameter estimation could be improved by
   incorporating the experimentally determined mass transfer rate,
   omega(exp) from batch kinetics. Based on the calibrated model, the
   fraction of instantaneous retardation, beta(exp) of Pb decreased from
   0.41 in the single system to 030 in the binary system, indicating the
   shift from equilibrium to nonequilibrium state, where which of Cu
   increased from 0.39 to 0.94, representing the shift towards equilibrium.
   The modified results were also compared with five-step sequential
   extraction data, confirming that the shift of particular metal fractions
   from the competition triggered the nonequilibrium transport. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A state-defect constraint pairing graph coarsening method is described
   for improving computational efficiency during the numerical
   factorization of large sparse Karush-Kuhn-Tucker matrices that arise
   from the discretization of optimal control problems via an
   Legendre-Gauss-Radau orthogonal collocation method. The method takes
   advantage of the particular sparse structure of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
   matrix that arises from the orthogonal collocation method. The
   state-defect constraint pairing graph coarsening method pairs each
   component of the state with its corresponding defect constraint and
   forces paired rows to be adjacent in the reordered Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
   matrix. Aggregate state-defect constraint pairing results are presented
   using a wide variety of benchmark optimal control problems where it is
   found that the proposed state-defect constraint pairing graph coarsening
   method significantly reduces both the number of delayed pivots and the
   number of floating point operations and increases the computational
   efficiency by performing more floating point operations per unit time.
   It is then shown that the state-defect constraint pairing graph
   coarsening method is less effective on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker matrices
   arising from Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation when the optimal control
   problem contains state and control equality path constraints because
   such matrices may have delayed pivots that correspond to both defect and
   path constraints. An alternate graph coarsening method that employs
   maximal matching is then used to attempt to further reduce the number of
   delayed pivots. It is found, however, that this alternate graph
   coarsening method provides no further advantage over the state-defect
   constraint pairing graph coarsening method.}},

Abstract = {{As a robust nonlinear similarity measure in kernel space, correntropy
   has received increasing attention in domains of machine learning and
   signal processing. In particular, the maximum correntropy criterion
   (MCC) has recently been successfully applied in robust regression and
   filtering. The default kernel function in correntropy is the Gaussian
   kernel, which is, of course, not always the best choice. In this paper,
   we propose a generalized correntropy that adopts the generalized
   Gaussian density (GGD) function as the kernel, and present some
   important properties. We further propose the generalized maximum
   correntropy criterion (GMCC) and apply it to adaptive filtering. An
   adaptive algorithm, called the GMCC algorithm, is derived, and the
   stability problem and steady-state performance are studied. We show that
   the proposed algorithm is very stable and can achieve zero probability
   of divergence (POD). Simulation results confirm the theoretical
   expectations and demonstrate the desirable performance of the new
   algorithm.}},

Title = {{Drainage ditches have sufficient adsorption capacity but inadequate
   residence time for phosphorus retention in the Everglades}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{218-228}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Although considered a sink of nutrients, limited information exists to
   verify phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) retention in drainage networks
   such as ditches and canals. Nutrient retention within two ditches on a
   cattle ranch in the greater Everglades region was measured using in-situ
   mesocosms. Phosphorus and N concentrations of water inside the mesocosms
   were increased or decreased to evaluate the effect of P and N
   concentration on P and N flux across the sediment-water interface. Ditch
   sediments possess high P retention capacity which was related to
   aluminum and iron contents. Soluble reactive P (SRP) retention over
   seven days varied between 13 and 55\% of the starting water column
   concentration, though retention was significant after one day (p=0.035).
   Significant P release, although observed only at one site, does indicate
   the potential for the ditch to be a source of P to downstream locations.
   The P uptake and release were greater and more rapid in a ditch with
   organic sediment and emergent macrophytes compared to a ditch with a
   mineral substrate. P retention over time was rate-limited by diffusion
   and sediment pore-water exchange. Nitrogen transformation processes were
   unsubstantial, possibly because in warm sub-tropical Florida most
   nitrate is denitrified in the presence of an energy source. Several
   empirical P models predicted (r(2) > 0.90) P retention based on the
   known water column SRP concentrations and hydraulic residence time. The
   residence time of the site (0.46 and 0.11 days for the two ditches) is
   not long enough to significantly reduce P loads passing through the
   ditches under the current drainage regime. Delaying the drainage by
   increased water retention as a voluntary Best Management Practice (BMP)
   or Payment for Environmental Services (PES) program can help increase
   the residence time to reduce P leaving the ranch. Although these results
   are derived from a cattle ranch, similar benefits can be expected for
   drainage ditches in other agricultural systems such as agronomic (e.g.
   sugarcane) or horticultural (e.g. citrus, vegetable) crops, and the
   models presented in this paper may be useful for basin-scale water
   quality management. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Considering recent development of deregulated energy markets and the
   intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, it is important for
   power system operators to ensure cost effectiveness while maintaining
   the system reliability. To achieve this goal, significant research
   progress has recently been made to develop stochastic optimization
   models and solution methods to improve reliability unit commitment run
   practice, which is used in the day-ahead market for ISOs/RTOs to ensure
   sufficient generation capacity available in real time to accommodate
   uncertainties. Most stochastic optimization approaches assume the
   renewable energy generation amounts follow certain distributions.
   However, in practice, the distributions are unknown and instead, a
   certain amount of historical data are available. In this research, we
   propose a data-driven risk-averse stochastic unit commitment model,
   where risk aversion stems from the worst-case probability distribution
   of the renewable energy generation amount, and develop the corresponding
   solution methods to solve the problem. Given a set of historical data,
   our proposed approach first constructs a confidence set for the
   distributions of the uncertain parameters using statistical inference
   and solves the corresponding risk-averse stochastic unit commitment
   problem. Then, we show that the conservativeness of the proposed
   stochastic program vanishes as the number of historical data increases
   to infinity. Finally, the computational results numerically show how the
   risk-averse stochastic unit commitment problem converges to the
   risk-neutral one, which indicates the value of data.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Clique relaxations are used in classical models of cohesive subgroups in
   social network analysis. Clustering coefficient was introduced more
   recently as a structural feature characterizing small-world networks.
   Noting that cohesive subgroups tend to have high clustering
   coefficients, this paper introduces a new clique relaxation,
   alpha-cluster, defined by enforcing a lower bound a on the clustering
   coefficient in the corresponding induced subgraph. Two variations of the
   clustering coefficient are considered, namely, the local and global
   clustering coefficient. Certain structural properties of a-clusters are
   analyzed and mathematical optimization models for determining
   alpha-clusters of the largest size in a network are developed and
   validated using several real-life social networks. In addition, a
   network clustering algorithm based on local alpha-clusters is proposed
   and successfully tested. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adding potassium to Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 absorbers has been shown to enhance
   photovoltaic power conversion efficiency. To illuminate possible
   mechanisms for this enhancement and limits to beneficial K
   incorporation, the properties of Cu1-x K (x) InSe2 (CKIS) thin-film
   alloys have been studied. Films with K/(K + Cu), or x, from 0 to 1 were
   grown by co-evaporation, and probed by XRF, EPMA, SEM, XRD, UV-Visible
   spectroscopy, current-voltage, and TRPL measurements. Composition from
   in situ quartz crystal and EIES monitoring was well correlated with
   final film composition. Crystal lattice parameters showed linear
   dependence on x, indicating complete K incorporation and coherent
   structural character at all compositions in the < 100 > and < 010 >
   lattice directions, despite the different symmetries of CuInSe2 and
   KInSe2. The band gap energy showed pronounced bowing with x composition,
   in excellent agreement with experimental reports and semiconductor
   theory. Films of Mo/CKIS/Ni were non-ohmic, and increasing x from 0 to
   0.58 decreased the apparent CKIS resistivity. Further evidence of
   decreased CKIS resistivity was observed with photoluminescence response,
   which increased by about half a decade for x > 0, and indicates
   increased majority carrier concentration. Minority carrier lifetimes
   increased by about an order of magnitude for films grown at x = 0.07 and
   0.14, relative to CuInSe2 and x a parts per thousand yen 0.30. This is
   the first report of a Cu-K-In-Se film with > 1 at.\% K, and the observed
   property changes at increased x (wider band gap; lower resistivity;
   increased lifetime) comprise valuable photovoltaic
   performance-enhancement strategies, suggesting that CKIS alloys have a
   role to play in future engineering advances.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{339-343}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Silicon is one of many materials whose surface will oxidize in ambient
   conditions. However it is one of few materials whose native oxide will
   self-limit its growth in a matter of hours at a thickness of similar to
   2 nm. In this work, we show through the theory of repulsive van der
   Waals forces that this self-limitation is due, at least in part, to the
   interaction between the inherent material properties of a native silicon
   oxide film on silicon and oxidizing molecules. These molecules are not
   just hindered from even entering the system at all, but those that do
   enter the native oxide film are repelled away from the silicon - silicon
   oxide interface, preventing additional growth by oxidation. We also show
   how this repulsion is overcome by increasing ambient temperatures to
   subsequently increase the kinetic energy of the oxidizing molecules,
   calculated by the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution, and allow oxidation to
   continue.}},

   and land cover}},
Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{101-109}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the field-scale spatial variability of soil organic carbon
   (SOC) is critical to assess its spatial distribution at very fine scale
   (several meters) which is valuable for precision agriculture and natural
   resource management. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   field-scale spatial variability of SOC under five prevalent land use and
   land cover (LULC) types in Florida, U.S. with a uniform sampling scheme.
   Five scales, 2, 7, 22, 67 and > 200 m, were targeted and 108 soil
   samples at 0-20 cm depth were collected and analyzed for SOC and bulk
   densities within each LULC type in 2012. Results indicate that SOC
   variability was scale dependent. Hardwood Hammock and Forest and
   Improved Pasture demonstrated large variation at both coarse scale (67
   and > 200 m) and very fine scale (2 m). Sandhill, Pineland and Dry
   Prairie were dominated by variation at very fine scales (2 and 7 m). All
   five sites showed large variability at very fine scales, indicating the
   close coupling of SOC stock variation to structure and composition of
   vegetation. This study also identified that log-transformed SOC showed
   variance invariant behavior, which had an approximately constant overall
   variance (sill) of 0.067 +/- 0.012 (log (kg m(-2)))(2) at field scale
   (similar to 500 m) irrespective of LULC. These findings serve to explain
   field-scale variability of SOC relevant for precision agriculture and
   land management, but also facilitate better understanding of the
   scale-dependent fine-scale variability of SOC across larger soilscapes.

Abstract = {{Dynamic texture (DT) widely exists in various social video media.
   Therefore, DT modeling and synthesis plays an important role in social
   media analyzing and processing. In this paper, we propose a
   Bayesian-based nonlinear dynamic texture modeling method for dynamic
   texture synthesis. To capture the non-stationary distribution of DT, we
   utilize the Gaussian process latent variable model for dimensional
   reduction. Furthermore, we design a multi-kernel dynamic system for the
   latent dynamic behavior modeling. In our model, we do not make strong
   assumption on the nonlinear function. Instead, our model automatically
   constructs a suitable nonlinear kernel for dynamic modeling and
   therefore is capable of fitting various types of dynamics. We evaluate
   the effectiveness our methods on the DynTex database and compared with
   representative DT synthesis method. Experimental results show that our
   method can achieve synthesis results with higher visual quality. (C)

Abstract = {{Hopping motions in cobalt manganese spinel oxides with high cobalt
   concentration (CoxMn3-xO4, 2.3 <= x <= 2.7) are investigated in order to
   clarify the origin of unusual electrical behaviors as negative
   temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors. Based on the resistance
   versus temperature (R-T) characteristics, hopping conduction mechanisms
   in MCO compounds (x = 2.3 and 2.5) are attributed to variable range
   hopping (VRH) motion with a parabolic distribution of the density of
   states (DOS) near the Fermi level. However, when Co content increases up
   to 2.7, transition in the hopping motion occurs from VRH to the nearest
   neighboring hopping (NNH) motion, which can be responsible for a huge
   increase of the resistance accompanied by decrease of the factor of
   thermal sensitivity (B value) in MCO compounds (x = 2.7). Also, hopping
   distance and activation energies for MCO (x = 2.3 and 2.5) compounds
   following VRH conduction are calculated as a function of temperature,
   indicating that higher B value observed in MCO (x = 2.5) compound is due
   to the larger hopping distance compared to that of MCO (x = 2.3)
   compound.}},

Abstract = {{A corrugated organic light emitting diode (OLED) with enhanced light
   extraction is realized by incorporating a corrugated composite electron
   transport layer (ETL) consisting of two ETLs with different glass
   transition temperatures. The morphology of the corrugated structure is
   characterized with atomic force microscopy. The results show that the
   corrugation can be controlled by the layer thicknesses and annealing
   temperature. Compared with the control planar device, the corrugated
   OLED shows a more than 35\% enhancement in current efficiency from 31
   cd/A to 43 cd/A and a 20\% enhancement in external quantum efficiency
   from 10\% to 12\% at 100 cd/m(2). In addition, the corrugated OLED also
   has a greatly improved operational stability. The LT90 lifetime of a
   device operated at 1000 cd/m(2) is improved greater than 100-fold in the
   corrugated OLED.}},

Abstract = {{The thermochemical reduction of metal oxides is important for fuel
   production using chemical looping processes as well as metal extraction
   from ore. In this study, reaction kinetics for the reduction of iron
   oxide using hydrogen as a reducing agent is studied. Experiments are
   conducted with the iron-silica Magnetically Stabilized Porous Structure
   (MSPS) for different reaction conditions, including reaction
   temperature, hydrogen inlet molar concentration, and hydrogen inlet flow
   rate. The reduction reaction is characterized by step-wise conversion of
   magnetite to elemental iron via wustite. Thus the reaction kinetics is
   governed by the coexistence of two reactions, magnetite to wustite and
   wustite to iron conversions. A one-dimensional plug flow isothermal
   kinetic model is proposed, and a numerical scheme is developed to solve
   the species transport and substrate conservation equations. The
   numerical scheme is used as a tool to calibrate the kinetic model, and
   the critical kinetic parameters, including activation energy,
   pre-exponent, and order of reaction, are determined for both reactions.
   The reaction mechanism for both reactions is identified, and a
   transition in the reaction mechanism is captured with different models.
   The kinetic model shows good agreement with the experimental data for
   different operating conditions. This study provides a basis for scaling
   bench scale hydrogen reduction reactors to an industrial scale. (C) 2016

Title = {{Repeating Spatial-Temporal Motifs of CA3 Activity Dependent on
   Engineered Inputs from Dentate Gyrus Neurons in Live Hippocampal
   Networks}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Anatomical and behavioral studies, and in vivo and slice
   electrophysiology of the hippocampus suggest specific functions of the
   dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA3 subregions, but the underlying activity
   dynamics and repeatability of information processing remains poorly
   understood. To approach this problem, we engineered separate living
   networks of the DG and CA3 neurons that develop connections through 51
   tunnels for axonal communication. Growing these networks on top of an
   electrode array enabled us to determine whether the subregion dynamics
   were separable and repeatable. We found spontaneous development of
   polarized propagation of 80\% of the activity in the native direction
   from DG to CA3 and different spike and burst dynamics for these
   subregions. Spatial temporal differences emerged when the relationships
   of target CA3 activity were categorized with to the number and timing of
   inputs from the apposing network. Compared to times of CA3 activity when
   there was no recorded tunnel input, DG input led to CA3 activity bursts
   that were 7x more frequent, increased in amplitude and extended in
   temporal envelope. Logistic regression indicated that a high number of
   tunnel inputs predict CA3 activity with 90\% sensitivity and 70\%
   specificity. Compared to no tunnel input, patterns of >80\% tunnel
   inputs from DG specified different patterns of first-to-fire neurons in
   the CA3 target well. Clustering dendrograms revealed repeating motifs of
   three or more patterns at up to 17 sites in CA3 that were importantly
   associated with specific spatial-temporal patterns of tunnel activity.
   The number of these motifs recorded in 3 min was significantly higher
   than shuffled spike activity and not seen above chance in control
   networks in which CA3 was apposed to CA3 or DG to DG. Together, these
   results demonstrate spontaneous input-dependent repeatable coding of
   distributed activity in CA3 networks driven by engineered inputs from DG
   networks. These functional configurations at measured times of
   activation (motifs) emerge from anatomically accurate feed forward
   connections from DG through tunnels to CA3.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study focused on pulses superimposed on the initial
   continuous current of upward negative discharges. The study is based on
   experimental data consisting of correlated lightning current waveforms
   recorded at the instrumented Santis Tower in Switzerland and electric
   fields recorded at a distance of 14.7 km from the tower. Two different
   types of pulses superimposed on the initial continuous current were
   identified: (1) M-component-type pulses, for which the microsecond-scale
   electric field pulse occurs significantly earlier than the onset of the
   current pulse, and (2) fast pulses, for which the onset of the field
   matches that of the current pulse. We analyze the currents and fields
   associated with these fast pulses (return-stroke type (RS-type) initial
   continuous current (ICC) pulses) and compare their characteristics with
   those of return strokes. A total of nine flashes containing 44 RS-type
   ICC pulses and 24 return strokes were analyzed. The median current peaks
   associated with RS-type ICC pulses and return strokes are, respectively,
   3.4 kA and 8 kA. The associated median E-field peaks normalized to 100
   km are 1.5 V/m and 4.4 V/m, respectively. On the other hand, the
   electric field peaks versus current peaks for the two data sets (RS-type
   ICC pulses and return strokes) are characterized by very similar linear
   regression slopes, namely, 3.67 V/(mkA) for the ICC pulses and 3.77
   V/(mkA) for the return strokes. Assuming the field-current relation
   based on the transmission line model, we estimated the apparent speed of
   both the RS-type ICC pulses and return strokes to be about 1.4 x 10(8)
   m/s. A strong linear correlation is observed between the E-field
   risetime and the current risetime for the ICC pulses, similar to the
   relation observed between the E-field risetime and current risetime for
   return strokes. The similarity of the RS-type ICC pulses with return
   strokes suggests that these pulses are associated with the mixed mode of
   charge transfer to ground.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a terrestrial gamma ray flash (TGF) that occurred on 15
   August 2014 coincident with an altitude-triggered lightning at the
   International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) in North
   Central Florida. The TGF was observed by a ground-level network of gamma
   ray, close electric field, distant magnetic field, Lightning Mapping
   Array (LMA), optical, and radar measurements. Simultaneous gamma ray and
   LMA data indicate that the upward positive leader of the triggered
   lightning flash induced relativistic runaway electron avalanches when
   the leader tip was at about 3.5 km altitude, resulting in the observed
   TGF. Channel luminosity and electric field data show that there was an
   initial continuous current (ICC) pulse in the lightning channel to
   ground during the time of the TGF. Modeling of the observed ICC pulse
   electric fields measured at close range (100-200 m) indicates that the
   ICC pulse current had both a slow and fast component (full widths at
   half maximum of 235 mu s and 59 mu s) and that the fast component was
   more or less coincident with the TGF, suggesting a physical association
   between the relativistic runaway electron avalanches and the ICC pulse
   observed at ground. Our ICC pulse model reproduces moderately well the
   measured close electric fields at the ICLRT as well as three independent
   magnetic field measurements made about 250 km away. Radar and LMA data
   suggest that there was negative charge near the region in which the TGF
   was initiated.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium carbide is used as a primary component in coating materials,
   thin films for electronic devices, and composites. Here, the structure
   of coherent and semicoherent interfaces formed between close-packed. TiC
   (111) and Ti (0001) is investigated in classical molecular dynamics
   simulations. The forces on the atoms in the simulations are determined
   using a newly developed TiC potential under the framework of the
   third-generation charge optimized many-body (COMB3) suite of potentials.
   The work of adhesion energies for the coherent interfaces is calculated
   and compared with the predictions of density functional theory
   calculations. In the case of relaxed semicoherent interfaces, a
   two-dimensional (2D) misfit dislocation network is predicted to form
   that separates the interface into different regions in which the
   positions of the atoms are similar to the positions at the corresponding
   coherent interfaces. After the interface is annealed at an elevated
   temperature, the climb of edge dislocations is activated which modifies
   the 2D misfit dislocation network and increases the work of adhesion.
   These findings can be used as inputs for sequential larger simulation
   models to understand and predict the macroscopic properties of TiC/Ti
   interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We report on imaging subsurface grain microstructure using picosecond
   ultrasonics. This approach relies on elastic anisotropy of crystalline
   materials where ultrasonic velocity depends on propagation direction
   relative to the crystal axes. Picosecond duration ultrasonic pulses are
   generated and detected using ultrashort light pulses. In materials that
   are transparent or semitransparent to the probe wavelength, the probe
   monitors gigahertz frequency Brillouin oscillations. The frequency of
   these oscillations is related to the ultrasonic velocity and the optical
   index of refraction. Ultrasonic waves propagating across a grain
   boundary experience a change in velocity due to a change in
   crystallographic orientation relative to the ultrasonic propagation
   direction. This change in velocity is manifested as a change in the
   Brillouin oscillation frequency. Using the ultrasonic propagation
   velocity, the depth of the interface can be determined from the location
   in time of the transition in oscillation frequency. A subsurface image
   of the grain boundary is obtained by scanning the beam along the
   surface. We demonstrate this subsurface imaging capability using a
   polycrystalline UO2 sample. Cross section liftout analysis of the grain
   boundary using electron microscopy was used to verify our imaging
   results. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Tidal inlets interrupt longshore sediment transport, thereby exerting an
   influence on adjacent beach morphology. To investigate the details and
   spatial extent of an inlet's influence, we examine beach topographic
   change along a 1.5 km coastal reach adjacent to Matanzas Inlet, on the
   Florida Atlantic coast. Analyses of beach morphology reveal a behavioral
   change between 0.64 and 0.86 km from the inlet channel centerline,
   interpreted to represent the spatial extent of inlet influence. Beyond
   this boundary, the beach is narrow, exhibits a statistically significant
   inverse correlation of shoreline position with offshore wave conditions,
   and has a uniform alongshore pattern in temporal behavior, as determined
   from empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. On the inlet side of
   the boundary, the beach experiences monotonic widening (with proximity
   to the inlet), lacks spatial consistency in correlation between
   shoreline position and wave conditions, and exhibits an irregular
   pattern in spatial EOF modes. We augment the field observations with
   numerical modeling that provides calculations of wave setup and
   nearshore current patterns near the inlet, highlighting the effects of
   the ebb-tidal delta on the assailing waves. The modeling results are
   verified by a natural experiment that occurred during May 2009, when a
   storm-produced sedimentary mass accreted to the lower beach, then
   subsequently split into two oppositely directed waves of sediment that
   migrated away from the initial accretion site in the subsequent months.
   Our results suggest that the ebb-tidal delta produces a pattern of wave
   setup that creates a pressure gradient driving an alongshore flow that
   opposes the longshore currents derived from breaking of obliquely
   oriented incident waves. The resulting recirculation pattern on the
   margin of the ebb-tidal delta provides a mechanism through which the
   inlet influences adjacent barrier island beach morphology. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticles can be made to dissipate heat to their immediate
   surroundings in response to an applied alternating magnetic field. This
   property, combined with the biocompatibility of iron oxide nanoparticles
   and the ability of magnetic fields to penetrate deep in the body, makes
   magnetic nanoparticles attractive in a range of biomedical applications
   where thermal energy is used either directly to achieve a therapeutic
   effect or indirectly to actuate the release of a therapeutic agent.
   Although the concept of bulk heating of fluids and tissues using energy
   dissipated by magnetic nanoparticles has been well accepted and applied
   for several decades, many new and exciting biomedical applications of
   magnetic nanoparticles take advantage of heat effects that are confined
   to the immediate nanoscale vicinity of the nanoparticles. Until recently
   the existence of these nanoscale thermal phenomena had remained
   controversial. In this short review we summarize some of the recent
   developments in this field and emerging applications for nanoscale
   thermal phenomena in the vicinity of magnetic nanoparticles in
   alternating magnetic fields.}},

Abstract = {{Since being introduced to the open literature in 2010, the isoindigo
   heterocycle has been extensively studied as a novel electron-deficient
   building block for organic electronic materials in conjugated polymers,
   discrete length oligomers, and molecular systems, particularly targeting
   high charge mobility values and ambipolar transport in organic field
   effect transistors, along with high power conversion efficiencies in
   organic photovoltaic devices. This article introduces results obtained
   on copolymers of isoindigo with thiophene and alkylated terthiophenes to
   highlight fundamental characteristics in isoindigo-based polymers and
   the resulting organic field-effect transistors and photovoltaic devices.
   By comparing and contrasting the optoelectronic properties, thin film
   morphology, organic field-effect transistor (OFET) mobilities, and
   organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance to previously reported polymers,
   structure processing-property relationships were uncovered. In
   particular, isoindigo-containing polymers with more rigid backbones and
   higher coherence lengths in thin films lead to increased charge mobility
   in OFET devices. In OPV devices, efficiencies over 6\% can be obtained
   by balancing high ionization potentials typically dictating the
   open-circuit voltage and the charge transfer energy, and blend
   morphology impacting short-circuit currents. Furthermore, the impact of
   polymer structure on solubility and on phase separation in blends with
   PC71M is discussed, with isoindigo-based polymers exhibiting lower
   solubility possibly leading to more fiber-like morphologies stemming,
   either from polymer dissolution in the casting solvent or from polymer
   self-assembly during film formation. This fiber-like polymer morphology
   remains unaffected by the presence of processing additives, such as
   1,8-diiodooctane. These structure property relationships developed for
   isoindigo-based polymers can also be discussed in the broader context of
   diketo-pyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and thienoisoindigo (TiI) as
   electron-deficient moieties that can also be doubly substituted on their
   amide functionality.}},

Title = {{Differences in glenohumeral translations calculated with three methods:
   Comparison of relative positions and contact point}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1944-1947}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Several published articles have reported 3-dimensional glenohumeral
   kinematics using model-image registration techniques. However, different
   methods to compute the translations were used in these articles. The
   purpose of this study was to compare glenohumeral translations
   calculated with three different methods. Fifteen healthy males with a
   mean age of 31 years (range, 27-36 years old) were enrolled in this
   study. Fluoroscopic images during scapular plane elevation were recorded
   at 30 frames per second for the right shoulder in each subject, and
   CT-derived models of the humerus and the scapula were matched with the
   silhouette of the bones in the fluoroscopic images using model-image
   registration techniques. Glenohumeral translations were computed with
   three methods: relative position of the origins of the humeral and
   scapular models, contact points of the two models, and relative
   positions based upon the calculated glenohumeral center of rotation
   (CoR). In the supero-inferior direction, translations calculated with
   the three methods were roughly parallel, with the maximum difference of
   1.6 mm (P < 0.001). In the antero-posterior direction, translations with
   the origins and CoR were parallel; however, translations computed with
   the origins and contact point describe arcs that differ by almost 2 mm
   at low humeral elevation angles and converge at higher degrees of
   humeral elevation (P < 0.001). Glenohumeral translations calculated
   using three methods showed statistically significant differences that
   may be important when comparing detailed results of different studies.
   However, these relatively small differences are likely subclinical, so
   that all three methods can reasonably be used for description of
   glenohumeral translations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) is a large-scale, communication-intensive
   problem that has been the subject of high-performance computing research
   and acceleration for years. Not surprisingly, the most success in
   accelerating MD comes from specialized systems such as the Anton
   machine. In this paper, we describe Novo-G\# (novo-jee-sharp), a
   multi-node reconfigurable system designed for the acceleration of
   communication-intensive scientific problems in general, and MD in
   particular. This system provides a high-bandwidth, low-latency 3D torus
   network to allow direct communication between kernels running on
   multiple field-programmable gate arrays. We also present a performance
   model for Novo-G\# running the 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) kernel
   that forms the core of MD simulations. We validate the model against
   published Anton performance data and through initial hardware
   experiments on Novo-G\#. Finally, through simulation studies, we show
   that this system at scale performs better than specialized systems like
   Anton and outperforms established CPU-based clusters like Blue Gene/Q by
   an order of magnitude for the 3D FFT kernel, with greater flexibility
   and lower costs. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Superlattice (SL) structures of Ba2FeMoO6/Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 were grown via

   the effects of superlattice periodicity of Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 layers. XRD
   analysis of SLs proved their layered superlattice structure. Magnetic
   study of the SLs showed increment of saturation magnetization and
   decrease of Curie temperature when compared to magnetization of pure

   of negative magneto-resistance in all superlattice samples, similar to
   magneto-transport behavior of pure Ba2FeMoO6 thin film. Hall measurement

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles are widely studied due to the ease of controlled
   synthesis, facile surface modification, and interesting physical
   properties. However, a technique for depositing large-area, crack-free
   monolayers on solid substrates is lacking. Herein is presented a method
   for accomplishing this. Spherical gold nanoparticles were synthesized as
   an aqueous dispersion. Assembly into monolayers and ligand exchange
   occurred simultaneously at an organic/aqueous interface. Then the
   monolayer film was deposited onto arbitrary solid substrates by slowly
   pumping out the lower, aqueous phase. This allowed the monolayer film
   (and liquid-liquid interface) to descend without significant
   disturbance, eventually reaching substrates contained in the aqueous
   phase. The resulting macroscopic quality of the films was found to be
   superior to films transferred by Langmuir techniques. The surface
   plasmon resonance and Raman enhancement of the films were evaluated and
   found to be uniform across the surface of each film.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance magnetic materials have immense industrial and
   scientific importance in wide-ranging electronic, electromechanical, and
   medical device technologies. Metallic glasses with a fully amorphous
   structure are particularly suited for advanced soft-magnetic
   applications. However, fundamental scientific understanding is lacking
   for the spin-exchange interaction between metal and metalloid atoms,
   which typically constitute a metallic glass. Using an integrated
   experimental and molecular dynamics approach, we demonstrate the
   mechanism of electron interaction between transition metals and
   metalloids. Spin-exchange interactions were investigated for a Fe-Co
   metallic glass system of composition
   {[}(Co1-xFex)(0.75)B0.2Si0.05](96)Cr-4. The saturation magnetization
   increased with higher Fe concentration, but the trend significantly
   deviated from simple rule of mixtures. Ab initio molecular dynamics
   simulation was used to identify the ferromagnetic/anti-ferromagnetic
   interaction between the transition metals and metalloids. The
   overlapping band-structure and density of states represent `Stoner type'
   magnetization for the amorphous alloys in contrast to `Heisenberg type'
   in crystalline iron. The enhancement of magnetization by increasing iron
   was attributed to the interaction between Fe 3d and B 2p bands, which
   was further validated by valence-band study.}},

Title = {{Two-dimensional, three-fluid modeling of capillary plasma discharges in
   electrothermal mass accelerators}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Electrothermal (ET) plasma launchers have a wide array of applications
   as mass acceleration devices. An ET plasma launcher utilizes an ET
   plasma discharge to accelerate a projectile. ET plasma discharges are
   arc-driven capillary discharges that ablate liner materials and form
   partially ionized plasmas. ET plasma discharges are generated by driving
   current pulses through a capillary source. Current pulses typically have
   peak currents on the order of tens of kA with pulse lengths on the order
   of hundreds of mu s. These types of plasma discharges have been explored
   for their application to military ballistics, electric thrusters, and
   nuclear fusion power. ET plasma discharges have been studied using 0D,
   1D, and semi-2D fluid models. In this work, a three-fluid, fully
   two-dimensional model of ET plasma discharges is presented. First
   approximations used in the newly developed model and code are discussed
   and simulation results are compared with experiment. Simulation results
   indicate the development of back flow inside ET plasma discharges due to
   collisional drag forces between individual plasma species. This back
   flow is observed for simulations of ET plasma discharges receiving
   current pulses with peak currents of 10, 20, 30, and 40 kA. Simulation
   results also reveal the development of fluid perturbations near the
   breech of the plasma source. These perturbations cause variations in the
   plasma electrical conductivity and ultimately cause changes in the local
   ablation rate of the source liner. At higher current pulses, these
   perturbations are more localized in the region of the source closest to
   the breech. This effect causes a decrease in the ablated mass in this
   region relative to the region of the source experiencing the highest
   ablation.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Implementation of nanotechnology in agriculture is intimately dependent
   on the capacity of nanoparticles (NPs) to move within the plant body and
   reach the targeted cells. Although the fibrillar nature of the plant
   cell wall permits the movement of molecules through its porous matrix
   (apoplast), the movement of particles through the aqueous apoplastic
   milieu has its size limitations given the tightly knitted
   cellulose/hemicellulose fiber structure. In the present study, we used
   fluorescent NPs of different composition and sizes, and followed their
   movement into citrus leaves by fluorescent microscopy. Our results
   indicate that in citrus leaves, the size exclusion limit for NPs is of
   approximate to 5.4 nm. This conclusion was based on the capacity of
   PAMAM dendrimers G-4 and G-5 (4.5 and 5.4 nm, respectively) to move
   through the cell wall and into the phloem, but failure of similar PAMAM
   dendrimers G-6 (6.7 nm) to move through the apoplast. Dendrimer NPs 5.4
   nm and smaller were observed to penetrate the leaf tissue, and then
   taken up and mobilized by the phloem elements. The current study
   provides evidence on the size limit for NPs use in agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Citrus black spot (CBS) is a fungal disease caused by Phyllosticta
   citricarpa (synonym Guignardia citricarpa). CBS causes fruit lesions and
   significant yield loss in all citrus (Citrus) species. The most
   distinguishing CBS symptom is called hard spot, which is a circular
   lesion with gray tissue at the center surrounded by a black margin. The
   spectral characteristic of CBS lesions was investigated and compared
   with the spectral signature of healthy fruit tissue to determine the
   best distinguishing wave band. Healthy and CBS-affected samples
   presented similar reflectance below 500 nm and above 900 nm. However,
   healthy samples reflected more light between 500 and 900 nm, especially
   within the visible band. Also, spectral reflectance of the same
   symptomatic lesion was acquired six times over a 2-month period to
   determine the variation of symptom's spectral signatures over time after
   being harvested. A two-sample t test was employed to compare each pair
   of consecutive repetitions. The results showed that the spectral
   signature of the CBS lesion did not change significantly over 2 months.
   The wavelengths between 587 and 589 nm were identified as the
   distinguishing band to develop a monochrome vision-based sensor for CBS
   diagnosis. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained using
   the spectral reflectance data at the selected bands to identify
   CBS-affected samples in each repetition. The overall CBS detection
   accuracies varied between 93.3\% and 94.6\%.}},

Title = {{Granular gel support-enabled extrusion of three-dimensional alginate and
   cellular structures}},
Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Freeform fabrication of soft structures has been of great interest in
   recent years. In particular, it is viewed as a critical step toward the
   grand vision of organ printing-the on-demand design and fabrication of
   three-dimensional (3D) human organ constructs for implantation and
   regenerative medicine. The objective of this study is to develop a novel
   granular gel support material-enabled, two-step gelation-based
   `printing-then-gelation' approach to fabricate 3D alginate structures
   using filament extrusion. Specifically, a granular Carbopol microgel
   bath holds the ungelled alginate structure being extruded, avoiding the
   instantaneous gelation of each printed layer as well as resultant
   surface tension-induced nozzle clogging. Since Carbopol microgels react
   with multivalent cations, which are needed for alginate crosslinking,
   gelatin is introduced as a sacrificial material to make an alginate and
   gelatin bioink for extrusion, which gels thermally (step-one gelation)
   to initially stabilize the printed structure for removal from Carbopol.
   Then gelatin is melted and diffused away while alginate is ionically
   crosslinked in a 37 degrees C calcium chloride bath (step-two gelation),
   resulting in an alginate structure. The proposed
   `printing-then-gelation' approach works for alginate structure
   fabrication, and it is also applicable for the printing of cellular
   constructs and other similar homogeneous soft structures using a
   two-step or even multi-step approach. The main conclusions are: (1)
   0.8\% (w/v) Carbopol bath with a neutral pH value may be most suitable
   for soft structure printing; (2) it is most effective to use a 0.9\%
   (w/v) NaCl solution to facilitate the removal of residual Carbopol; and
   (3) alginate structures fabricated using the proposed approach
   demonstrate better mechanical properties than those fabricated using the
   conventional `gelation-while-printing' approach.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to find the optimal designing parameters of
   a plate-fin heat sink under natural convection using the Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) Algorithm. Minimization of entropy generation rate
   under given space restrictions is considered as objective functions. All
   relevant design parameters for plate-fin heat sinks are the fin height,
   fin number, fin thickness. The constraints of the variables are set
   according to the suggestion structure design. And this three variables
   influence on entropy generation are presented. In the present study, In
   order to prevent the size of the heat sink is too large, we use the
   penalty function method in this study. Then the code for the PSO is
   written in MATLAB. On this basis, the optimal size of heat sink was
   obtained through the particle swarm algorithm for numerical simulation
   of this model: fin height is 44.8mm, number of fins is 25, fin thickness
   is 0.6mm and base temperature is 342.6241k.}},

Title = {{Initial breakdown and fast leaders in lightning discharges producing

Abstract = {{The recent discovery of long recovery, early VLF scattering events
   (LOREs) indicates that the electric field changes from lightning
   discharges are capable of producing long-lasting disturbances (up to
   tens of minutes) in the upper mesosphere and lower ionosphere.
   Comparison of lightning mapping array, broadband (up to 10 MHz) electric
   field, and VLF (similar to 300 Hz to 42 kHz) magnetic field measurements
   shows that the field changes produced by initial breakdown (IB)
   processes and the following leaders in natural, cloud-to-ground
   lightning discharges are detectable in VLF magnetic field measurements
   at long distances. IB radiation has been detected in VLF for lightning
   discharges occurring up to 2630 km away from the VLF observing station.
   Radio atmospherics associated with 52 LOREs, 51 regular recovery events,
   and 3098 flashes detected by National Lightning Detection Network and/or
   GLD360 were examined for IB radiation occurring up to 15 ms before the
   return stroke. Our analysis reveals that in contrast to regular recovery
   early VLF events, LOREs are strongly associated with lightning
   discharges which exhibit an intense IB process and a fast first leader
   (typical duration < 4 ms). These experimental results demonstrate that
   initial breakdown and leader processes are indicators of discharge
   properties highly relevant to the total energy transfer between
   lightning discharges and the middle/upper atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the reliability of high angular resolution diffusion
   tensor imaging (HARDI) data collected on a single individual across
   several sessions using the same scanner. HARDI data was acquired for one
   healthy adult male at the same time of day on ten separate days across a
   one-month period. Environmental factors (e.g. temperature) were
   controlled across scanning sessions. Tract Based Spatial Statistics
   (TBSS) was used to assess session-to-session variability in measures of
   diffusion, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). To
   address reliability within specific structures of the medial temporal
   lobe (MTL; the focus of an ongoing investigation), probabilistic
   tractography segmented the Entorhinal cortex (ERc) based on connections
   with Hippocampus (HC), Perirhinal (PRc) and Parahippocampal (PHc)
   cortices. Streamline tractography generated edge weight (EW) metrics for
   the aforementioned ERc connections and, as comparison regions,
   connections between left and right rostral and caudal anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC). Coefficients of variation (CoV) were derived for the
   surface area and volumes of these ERc connectivity-defined regions (CDR)
   and for EW across all ten scans, expecting that scan-to-scan reliability
   would yield low CoVs. TBSS revealed no significant variation in FA or MD
   across scanning sessions. Probabilistic tractography successfully
   reproduced histologically-verified adjacent medial temporal lobe
   circuits. Tractography-derived metrics displayed larger ranges of
   scanner-to-scanner variability. Connections involving HC displayed
   greater variability than metrics of connection between other
   investigated regions. By confirming the test retest reliability of HARDI
   data acquisition, support for the validity of significant results
   derived from diffusion data can be obtained.}},
