Abstract = {{Accurately predicting the fate and transport of graphene oxide (GO) in
   porous media is critical to assess its environmental impact. In this
   work, sand column experiments were conducted to determine the effect of
   input concentration and grain size on transport, retention, and size
   perturbation of GO in saturated porous media. The mobility of GO in the
   sand columns reduced with decreasing grain size and almost all GO were
   retained in fine sand columns for all of the tested conditions. This
   result can be explained with colloid filtration and XDLVO theories.
   Input concentration also influenced the retention and transport of GO in
   the sand columns because of the `blocking' mechanism that reduces the
   particle retention rate. After passing through the column, average GO
   sizes increased dramatically. In addition, the sizes of GO retained in
   the sand also increased with travel distance. These results suggested
   that transport through the porous media induced GO aggregation. A
   mathematical model based on the advection-dispersion equation coupled
   with the second-order kinetics to reflect the blocking effect simulated
   the experimental data well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Batch and column sorption of arsenic onto iron-impregnated biochar
   synthesized through hydrolysis}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{206-216}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Iron (Fe)-impregnated biochar, prepared through a novel method that
   directly hydrolyzes iron salt onto hickory biochar, was investigated for
   its performance as a low-cost arsenic (As) sorbent. Although iron
   impregnation decreased the specific surface areas of the biochar, the
   impregnated biochar showed much better sorption of aqueous As (maximum
   sorption capacity of 2.16 mg g(-1)) than the pristine biochar (no/little
   As sorption capacity). Scanning electron microscope equipped with an
   energy dispersive spectrometer and X-ray diffraction analysis indicated
   the presence of crystalline Fe hydroxide in the impregnated biochar but
   no crystal forms of arsenic were found in the post-sorption biochar
   samples. However, large shifts in the binding energy of Fe-2p, As-3d,
   O-1s. and C-1s region on the following As sorption indicated a change in
   chemical speciation from As(V) to As(III) and Fe(II) to Fe(III) and
   strong As interaction with oxygen-containing function groups of the
   Fe-impregnated biochar. These findings suggest that the As sorption on
   the Fe-impregnated biochar is mainly controlled by the chemisorption
   mechanism. Columns packed with Fe-impregnated biochar showed good As
   retention, and was regenerated with 0.05 mol L-1 NaHCO3 solution. These
   findings indicate that Fe-impregnated biochar can be used as a low-cost
   filter material to remove arsenic from aqueous solutions. (C) 2014

Title = {{Ion-exchange selectivity of diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and
   naproxen in ureolyzed human urine}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{510-521}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{This research advances the knowledge of ion-exchange of four
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) - diclofenac (DCF),
   ibuprofen (IBP), ketoprofen (KTP), and naproxen (NPX) - and one
   analgesic drug paracetamol (PCM) - by strong-base anion exchange resin
   (AER) in synthetic ureolyzed urine. Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin
   -Astakhov, and Dubinin - Radushkevich isotherm models were fit to
   experimental equilibrium data using nonlinear least squares method.
   Favorable ion-exchange was observed for DCF, KTP, and NPX, whereas
   unfavorable ion-exchange was observed for IBP and PCM. The ion-exchange
   selectivity of the AER was enhanced by van der Waals interactions
   between the pharmaceutical and AER as well as the hydrophobicity of the
   pharmaceutical. For instance, the high selectivity of the AER for DCF
   was due to the combination of Coulombic interactions between quaternary
   ammonium functional group of resin and carboxylate functional group of
   DCF, van der Waals interactions between polystyrene resin matrix and
   benzene rings of DCF, and possibly hydrogen bonding between
   dimethylethanol amine functional group side chain and carboxylate and
   amine functional groups of DCF. Based on analysis of covariance, the
   presence of multiple pharmaceuticals did not have a significant effect
   on ion-exchange removal when the NSAIDs were combined in solution. The
   AER reached saturation of the pharmaceuticals in a continuous-flow
   column at varying bed volumes following a decreasing order of DCF > NPX
   approximate to KTP > IBP. Complete regeneration of the column was
   achieved using a 5\% (m/m) NaCl, equal-volume water methanol solution.
   Results from multiple treatment and regeneration cycles provide insight
   into the practical application of pharmaceutical ion-exchange in
   ureolyzed urine using AER. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospinning provides a promising route to quickly produce
   high-purity ceramic fibers from readily available sol-gel precursors.
   Recently, techniques have been developed to enable the production of
   biphasic nanocomposites on a single fiber, enabling the development of
   novel composites with connectivities that are difficult to obtain using
   existing methods. These composites on a fiber can be used as a unique
   anisotropic building block for creating more complex ordered structures.
   This work examines links between processing, structure, and properties
   for Janus-type composite nanofibers for the magnetoelectric
   BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 system. Specifically, we show how altering the viscosity
   and conductivity of precursor solutions can provide a unique route to
   synthesize biphasic composites of a range of sizes and compositions.
   Furthermore, we show how altering these properties can impact the
   magnetic and magnetoelectric behavior of these fibers. While this work
   focuses specifically on the BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 system, lessons learned can
   be applied to electrospinning biphasic ceramic materials from a variety
   of material systems and applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, results of an experimental study on the quasi-static and
   high-rate plastic deformation due to impact of a high-purity,
   polycrystalline, alpha-titanium material are presented. It was found
   that the material is transversely isotropic and displays strong strength
   differential effects. Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar tests in tension and
   compression and Taylor impact tests were conducted. For an impact
   velocity of 196 m/s, plastic deformation extended to 64\% of the length
   of the deformed specimen, with little radial spreading. A
   three-dimensional constitutive model was developed. Key in the
   formulation was the use of a macroscopic yield function that
   incorporates the specificities of the plastic flow, namely the combined
   effects of anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. Comparison
   between model predictions and data show the capabilities of the model to
   describe with accuracy the plastic behavior of the alpha-titanium
   material for both quasi-static and high-rate loadings. In particular,
   the three-dimensional simulations of the Taylor impact test show a very
   good agreement with data, both the post-test major and minor side
   profiles and impact interface footprints are very well described. (C)

Abstract = {{This work presents a re-derivation of relative Jacobian matrix for
   parallel (dual-arm) manipulators, expressed in terms of the individual
   manipulator Jacobians and multiplied by their corresponding
   transformation matrices. This is particularly useful when the individual
   manipulator Jacobians are given, such that one would not need to derive
   an entirely new expression of a relative Jacobian but will only use the
   existing manipulator Jacobians and perform the necessary
   transformations. In this work, the final result reveals a wrench
   transformation matrix which was not present in previous derivations, or
   was not explicitly expressed. The proposed Jacobian expression results
   in a simplified, more compact and intuitive form. It will be shown that
   the wrench transformation matrix is present in stationary as well as
   mobile combined manipulators. Simulation results show that at high
   angular end-effector velocities, the contribution of the wrench
   transformation matrix cannot be ignored. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The formation, characterization and application of polyvinylpyrrolidone
   (PVP) encapsulated silver nanoparticles with a regular rippled pattern
   is reported. The metal precursor was reduced by an in situ reduction
   technique, where glucose was used as an organic and mild reducing agent
   to control the process. In order to create the rippled structured of the
   film by molecular self organization of the encapsulated Ag
   nanoparticles, the concentrations of the reactants were optimized. The
   structural properties of the deposited films were established by X-ray
   diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy
   and dynamic light scattering techniques. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   revealed a highly ordered ripple structure of the film, which originated
   due to the self organization of the Ag nanoparticles in the PVP matrix,
   whereas, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the core-shell
   structure of the Ag/PVP unit. UV-vis spectrophotometric analysis
   resulted in a broad absorption peak between 350 to 500 nm (centered at
   418 nm), which is characteristic of Ag nanoparticles. A notable
   reduction in reflectance and an increase in transmittance, leading to an
   enhancement in the overall efficiency, were observed when the rippled
   pattern was spin-coated on a c-Si solar cell.}},

Abstract = {{Randall's plaque (RP) deposits seem to be consistent among the most
   common type of kidney stone formers, idiopathic calcium oxalate stone
   formers. This group forms calcium oxalate renal stones without any
   systemic symptoms, which contributes to the difficulty of understanding
   and treating this painful and recurring disease. Thus, the development
   of an in vitro model system to study idiopathic nephrolithiasis,
   beginning with RP pathogenesis, can help in identifying how plaques and
   subsequently stones form. One main theory of RP formation is that
   calcium phosphate deposits initially form in the basement membrane of
   the thin loops of Henle, which then fuse and spread into the
   interstitial tissue, and ultimately make their way across the
   urothelium, where upon exposure to the urine, the mineralized tissue
   serves as a nidus for overgrowth with calcium oxalate into a stone. Our
   group has found that many of the unusual morphologies found in RP and
   stones, such as concentrically laminated spherulites and mineralized
   collagenous tissue, can be reproduced in vitro using a polymer-induced
   liquid precursor (PILP) process, in which acidic polypeptides induce a
   liquid phase amorphous precursor to the mineral, yielding
   non-equilibrium crystal morphologies. Given that there are many acidic
   proteins and polysaccharides present in the renal tissue and urine, we
   have put forth the hypothesis that the PILP system may be involved in
   urolithiasis. Therefore, our goal is to develop an in vitro model system
   of these two stages of composite stone formation to study the role that
   various acidic macromolecules may play. In our initial experiments
   presented here, the development of ``biomimetic{''} RP was investigated,
   which will then serve as a nidus for calcium oxalate overgrowth studies.
   To mimic the tissue environment, MatriStem (R) (ACell, Inc.), a
   decellularized porcine urinary bladder matrix was used, because it has
   both an intact epithelial basement membrane surface and a tunica propria
   layer, thus providing the two types of matrix constituents found
   associated with mineral in the early stages of RP formation. We found
   that when using the PILP process to mineralize this tissue matrix, the
   two sides led to dramatically different mineral textures, and they bore
   a striking resemblance to native RP, which was not seen in the tissue
   mineralized via the classical crystal nucleation and growth process. The
   interstitium side predominantly consisted of collagen-associated
   mineral, while the luminal side had much less mineral, which appeared to
   be tiny spherules embedded within the basement membrane. Although these
   studies are only preliminary, they support our hypothesis that kidney
   stones may involve non-classical crystallization pathways induced by the
   large variety of macromolecular species in the urinary environment. We
   believe that mineralization of native tissue scaffolds is useful for
   developing a model system of stone formation, with the ultimate goal of
   developing strategies to avoid RP and its detrimental consequences in
   stone formation, or developing therapeutic treatments to prevent or cure
   the disease. Supported by NIDDK grant RO1DK092311.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen 6-related dystrophies and myopathies (COL6-RD) are a group of
   disorders that form a wide phenotypic spectrum, ranging from severe
   Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, intermediate phenotypes, to the
   milder Bethlem myopathy. Both inter- and intrafamilial variable
   expressivity are commonly observed. We present clinical,
   immunohistochemical, and genetic data on four COL6-RD families with
   marked intergenerational phenotypic heterogeneity. This variable
   expression seemingly masquerades as anticipation is due to parental
   mosaicism for a dominant mutation, with subsequent full inheritance and
   penetrance of the mutation in the heterozygous offspring. We also
   present an additional fifth simplex patient identified as a mosaic
   carrier. Parental mosaicism was confirmed in the four families through
   quantitative analysis of the ratio of mutant versus wild-type allele
   (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) in genomic DNA from various tissues,
   including blood, dermal fibroblasts, and saliva. Consistent with somatic
   mosaicism, parental samples had lower ratios of mutant versus wild-type
   allele compared with the fully heterozygote offspring. However, there
   was notable variability of the mutant allele levels between tissues
   tested, ranging from 16\% (saliva) to 43\% (fibroblasts) in one mosaic
   father. This is the first report demonstrating mosaicism as a cause of
   intrafamilial/intergenerational variability of COL6-RD, and suggests
   that sporadic and parental mosaicism may be more common than previously
   suspected.}},

Abstract = {{Information theory provides principled ways to analyze different
   inference and learning problems, such as hypothesis testing, clustering,
   dimensionality reduction, classification, and so forth. However, the use
   of information theoretic quantities as test statistics, that is, as
   quantities obtained from empirical data, poses a challenging estimation
   problem that often leads to strong simplifications, such as Gaussian
   models, or the use of plug in density estimators that are restricted to
   certain representation of the data. In this paper, a framework to
   nonparametrically obtain measures of entropy directly from data using
   operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined by infinitely
   divisible kernels is presented. The entropy functionals, which bear
   resemblance with quantum entropies, are defined on positive definite
   matrices and satisfy similar axioms to those of Renyi's definition of
   entropy. Convergence of the proposed estimators follows from
   concentration results on the difference between the ordered spectrum of
   the Gram matrices and the integral operators associated to the
   population quantities. In this way, capitalizing on both the axiomatic
   definition of entropy and on the representation power of positive
   definite kernels, the proposed measure of entropy avoids the estimation
   of the probability distribution underlying the data. Moreover,
   estimators of kernel-based conditional entropy and mutual information
   are also defined. Numerical experiments on independence tests compare
   favorably with state-of-the-art.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{A novel adaptation of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) was recently
   introduced in literature for simultaneous multitensor estimation and
   fiber tractography from diffusion MRI. This technique has the advantage
   over other tractography methods in terms of computational efficiency,
   due to the fact that the UKF simultaneously estimates the diffusion
   tensors and propagates the most consistent direction to track along.
   This UKF and its variants reported later in literature however are not
   intrinsic to the space of diffusion tensors. Lack of this key property
   can possibly lead to inaccuracies in the multitensor estimation as well
   as in the tractography. In this paper, we propose a novel intrinsic
   unscented Kalman filter (IUKF) in the space of diffusion tensors which
   are symmetric positive definite matrices, that can be used for
   simultaneous recursive estimation of multitensors and propagation of
   directional information for use in fiber tractography from diffusion
   weighted MR data. In addition to being more accurate, IUKF retains all
   the advantages of UKF mentioned above. We demonstrate the accuracy and
   effectiveness of the proposed method via experiments publicly available
   phantom data from the fiber cup-challenge (MICCAI 2009) and diffusion
   weighted MR scans acquired from human brains and rat spinal cords.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent problems with grouted posttensioning tendons in U.S. bridges have
   led to interest in tendons that are not grouted, but rather filled with
   a pliable corrosion protection system such as grease or wax. The use of
   a flexible filler material in place of cementitious grout results in an
   unbonded tendon, which not only affects the structural behavior but also
   enables the application of new methods for improved monitoring and
   maintenance. This paper outlines a novel continuous monitoring approach
   that aims to detect wire breakage in unbonded tendons based on relative
   strain variation in the anchor head (or wedge plate). The feasibility of
   the method is investigated using a finite-element model calibrated with
   experimental data from a seven-strand anchor head. The model is
   subsequently extended to a 19-strand anchor head to assess the method's
   performance on detection, localization, and quantification of tendon
   damage. The numerical results confirm the correlation between wire
   breakage and relative strain variation among the monitoring points and
   illustrate the method's effectiveness in determining the location and
   severity of damage. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000639. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The earliest approaches to the cell formation problem in group
   technology, dealing with a binary machine-part incidence matrix, were
   aimed only at minimizing the number of intercell moves (exceptional
   elements in the block-diagonalized matrix). Later on this goal was
   extended to simultaneous minimization of the numbers of exceptions and
   voids, and minimization of intercell moves and within-cell load
   variation, respectively. In this paper we design the first exact
   branch-and-bound algorithm to create a Pareto-optimal front for the
   bi-criterion cell formation problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analytically characterizes certain classes of low-diameter
   strongly attack-tolerant networks of arbitrary size, which are globally
   optimal in the sense that they contain the minimum possible number of
   edges. Strong attack tolerance property of level implies that a network
   preserves connectivity and diameter after the deletion of up to network
   elements (vertices and/or edges). In addition to identifying such
   optimal network configurations, we explicitly derive their entire
   Laplacian spectra, that is, all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
   graph Laplacian matrix. Each of these eigenvalues is by itself a
   solution to a global optimization problem; thus, the results of this
   study show that these optimization problems yield analytical solutions
   for the considered classes of networks. As an important special case, we
   show that the algebraic connectivity (i.e., the second-smallest
   eigenvalue of the Laplacian) considered as a function on all networks
   with fixed vertex connectivity reaches its maximum on the optimal
   -robust 2-club, which has diameter 2 and strong attack tolerance of
   level . We also demonstrate that the obtained results have direct
   implications on the exact calculation of convergence speed of consensus
   algorithms utilizing the entire Laplacian spectrum, which is in contrast
   to traditionally used simulation-based estimates through just the
   algebraic connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{The inverse max + sum spanning tree (IMSST) problem is studied, which is
   the first inverse problem on optimization problems with combined
   minmax-minsum objective functions. Given an edge-weighted undirected
   network , the MSST problem is to find a spanning tree which minimizes
   the combined weight , which can be solved in time, where and . Whereas,
   in an IMSST problem, a spanning tree of is given, which is not an
   optimal MSST. A new sum-cost vector is to be identified so that becomes
   an optimal MSST of the network , where and . The objective is to
   minimize the cost incurred by modifying the sum-cost vector under
   weighted norm, where . We show that the unbounded IMSST problem is a
   linear fractional combinatorial optimization (LFCO) problem and develop
   a discrete type Newton method to solve it. Furthermore, we prove an
   bound on the number of iterations, although most LFCO problems can be
   solved in iterations. Therefore, both the unbounded and bounded IMSST
   problems can be solved by solving MSST problems. Computational results
   show that the algorithms can efficiently solve the problems.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of alkyl chain length and concentration of quaternary
   ammonium surfactants (QAS) in the micellar catalysis of cross aldol
   reaction was investigated. The NaOH-micellar system catalyzed aldol
   reaction of benzaldehyde and cyclohexanone to alpha,alpha'-dibenzylidene
   cyclohexanone (di condensation/desired product) over mono condensation
   product was used as model reaction for this study. The C(16)QAS micellar
   system (QAS with n-hexadecyl group) gave highest cyclohexanone
   conversion (90\%) to desired product (82\%) showing that C(16)QAS
   micellar system possesses optimum properties and/or microenvironment for
   this reaction. Furthermore, the micellar system with high surfactant
   concentration (C(16)QAS; >150 mM) made the reaction faster giving >99\%
   conversion to selectively desired product (>99\%) within 30 min The
   large interface created by C(16)QAS micelles in the aqueous medium at
   high surfactant concentration makes the reaction faster by facilitating
   the interaction of hydrophobic reactants and water soluble catalyst (OH-
   ions). The activation of benzaldehyde molecules, their localization
   preferably near the interface and stabilization of enolate ions
   (reactive intermediates) by micellar system at high surfactant
   concentration were observed to be promoting the cross reaction
   selectively to the desired product. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The thermal conductivities of UO2 single crystals containing nanoscale
   size pores and He gas bubbles are calculated using non-equilibrium
   molecular dynamics as a function of pore size and gas density in the
   bubble. As expected, the thermal conductivity decreases as pore size
   increases, while the decrease in thermal conductivity is determined to
   be more substantial than the predictions of traditional analytical
   models by Loeb and Maxwell-Eucken. However, the recent model of Alvarez,
   which is applicable when the phonon mean-free path is comparable to the
   pore size, is able to quantitatively reproduce the simulation results.
   The thermal conductivity of UO2 of the small pores considered here is
   reduced further when the pore is filled with He gas. This surprising
   result is due to the penetration of the helium atoms into the lattice
   where they act as phonon scattering centers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the scheduling problems of a single
   serial-batching machine with independent setup time and deteriorating
   job processing times. With the assumption of deteriorating jobs, the job
   processing times are described by an increasing function of their
   starting times. All the jobs are first partitioned into serial batches
   and then processed on a single serial-batching machine. Before each
   batch is processed, an independent constant setup time is required. Two
   optimization algorithms are proposed to solve the problems of minimizing
   the makespan and the total number of tardy jobs, respectively.
   Specifically, for the problem of minimizing the total completion time,
   two special cases with the smallest and the largest number of batches
   are studied, and an optimization algorithm is also presented for the
   special case without setup time.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-(1 year) and post-(2 years) passive hydration data were used to
   evaluate the effects on spatiotemporal storages at two pastoral wetlands
   in the Lake Okeechobee (LO) watershed within the Everglades basin,
   Florida, United States. To partially restore the predrainage wetland
   storage and hydroperiod, passive hydration was implemented by raising
   the discharge elevation using a culvert structure with removable boards
   at the end of the drainage ditch that drained the wetland/upland system.
   During the wet season (July-October) groundwater and total storages
   (surface water plus groundwater; rainfall normalized) in the wetland
   footprints increased 17 and 12\% during the post-hydration periods at
   wetland 1. At wetland 2, these increases were 39 and 12\%, respectively.
   When analyzed at the subwatershed (wetland plus upland) scale, total
   storages (rainfall normalized) during wet season increased 12\% in both
   wetlands in the posthydration periods. Annual surface storage (rainfall
   normalized) increased from 25 to 188 m(3) for wetland 1, whereas at
   wetland 2, it increased from 0.2 to 6 m(3) during posthydration periods
   (annual) at subwatershed level. Differences in rainfall, storage areas,
   topography, and wetland hydrology masked the hydration effects and
   resulted in inconsistent results across years and wetlands. At the LO
   watershed-scale, increased storage was only 14\% of the desired storage.
   Long-term data are needed before implementation of passive hydration for
   achieving storage goals. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the emerging various data services, current cellular networks
   have been experiencing a surge of data traffic and are already
   overloaded; thus, they are not able to meet the ever exploding traffic
   demand. In this study, we first introduce a multi-radio multi-channel
   multi-hop cognitive cellular network ((MCN)-C-3-N-2) architecture to
   enhance network throughput. Under the proposed architecture, we then
   investigate the minimum length scheduling problem by exploring joint
   frequency allocation, link scheduling, and routing. In particular, we
   first formulate a maximal independent set based joint scheduling and
   routing optimization problem called original optimization problem (OOP).
   It is a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) and generally
   NP-hard problem. Then, employing a column generation based approach, we
   develop an is an element of-bounded approximation algorithm which can
   obtain an is an element of-bounded approximate result of OOP.
   Noticeably, in fact we do not need to find the maximal independent sets
   in the proposed algorithm, which are usually assumed to be given in
   previous works although finding all of them is NP-complete. We also
   revisit the minimum length scheduling problem by considering uncertain
   channel availability. Simulation results show that we can efficiently
   find the is an element of-bounded approximate results and the optimal
   result as well, i.e., when is an element of = 0\% in the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the performance of traditional Monte Carlo (FMC)
   for the nonlinear propagation of initial uncertainty in the two-body
   problem: an essential task in space situational awareness. This is done
   in light of a newly developed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based
   particle approach that combines the benefits of MCMC sampling with the
   method of characteristics (MOC) for solving first order partial
   differential equations - in this case, the stochastic Liouville equation
   (SLE). The resulting MCMC-MOC ensemble is by construction, equivalent in
   measure to the true state probability density. Our recent results on the
   MCMC-MOC approach indicate that for systems with divergence-free
   dynamics, the FMC and MCMC-MOC ensembles are statistically consistent.
   Unfortunately, the unperturbed two-body problem (Keplerian motion) is
   one such system. In this paper, we demonstrate through simulation that
   the traditional MC propagated ensemble is indeed equivalent in measure
   to MCMC-MOC ensemble, which in turn is the true system measure by
   construction. As a result, it is not possible to improve upon FMC and
   its slow convergence rate for this problem.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear Bayesian filter is proposed in this paper for a general
   nonlinear system of continuous time dynamics and discrete time
   measurements. In this filter, a transient Fokker-Planck equation solver
   based on tensor decomposition is used for propagating the conditional
   state probability density function (PDF) in conjunction with a
   measurement update via Bayes' rule. This filter is not restricted by
   assumptions of linearity or Gaussianity since it relies on the exact
   state PDF which captures the entire information of the underlying
   uncertainty. Moreover, it is suitable for system of high-dimensional
   state space by virtue of the efficient tensor decomposition scheme,
   which enables the computational efforts for solving the state PDF grow
   benignly with dimensionality. This is possible because every dimension
   of the state space as well as the time domain is separated from each
   other in the solution process, as a result of which originally expensive
   high-dimensional operations are decoupled into a series of simple
   one-dimensional operations. Numerical examples are provided to
   demonstrate the advantages of the proposed filter over the extended
   Kalman filter for state estimation.}},

Abstract = {{The shortest path computation between two given locations in a road
   network is an important problem that finds applications in a wide range
   of fields. There has been a lot of research efforts targeting at the
   preciseness and performance of finding shortest paths in road networks.
   However, rarely of them have really taken into account the influence of
   traffic factors such as traffic lights, road conditions, traffic jams
   and turning cost. In other words, existing approaches are rather purely
   based on the topology of the network, but forgot that there are multiple
   factors in a real road network that impact the accuracy of the
   algorithm. The contribution of our paper is twofold. First, we present a
   generic two-layered framework for moving objects in road networks
   environment and demonstrate the important role of traffic factors on
   path finding and route planning. Second, we develop an efficient
   parallel shortest path algorithm in road networks with the consideration
   of traffic influence factors. Detailed analysis presented shows that our
   parallel TRAFFic-aware shortest path algORITHM (Trafforithm), is
   accurate and practical.}},

Abstract = {{Decision support based on spatial (and not only alphanumerical) data has
   received increasing interest in geographical applications, such as
   geoscience, agriculture, and economics applications, and has led to
   Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS). SDSS use spatial database
   systems and Geographical Information Systems as their data management
   and analysis components in order to get and handle the needed spatial
   data and perform recommendations, estimations, or predictions. For
   instance, farmers want to know what the best areas of their farmland are
   to grow a speci fi c crop. In most cases, the extent and the properties
   of the spatial phenomena of interest are vague and imprecise. They can
   be adequately represented by fuzzy spatia lobjects (e.g., fuzzy points,
   fuzzy lines, fuzzy regions). In this paper, we formally propose a model
   named Fuzzy Inference on Fuzzy Spatial Objects (FIFUS), which infers
   recommendations, estimations, and predictions based on fuzzy rules and
   knowledge of domain specialists. It incorporates fuzzy spatial objects
   into the components of the existing fuzzy inference methods in order to
   take into account the spatial imprecision found in the real world. As a
   main advantage, FIFUS is a general- purpose model and can thus be
   applied in many geoscience applications.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, applications like geospatial, genomic, and multimedia
   have made use of very large and diverse application objects such as
   spatial networks and protein structures. These objects are complex in
   the sense that they are highly structured and of variable size. Storing,
   accessing and manipulating them in a standard and efficient manner is
   very challenging. The state-of-the-art solutions handle such objects by
   using file system formats like HDF and XML, serialization technique like
   Protocol Buffers and BLOB data type in databases. However, specialized
   file format solutions lack any well established database system
   features, and neither a uniform concept nor mechanisms exist for
   supporting complex objects for BLOBs. In this article, a novel and
   database-friendly framework of specifying and interpreting complex
   objects is proposed. Empirical studies have shown that our approach
   outperforms prevailing methods with efficient processing time and less
   storage consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Transportation simulation technologies should accurately model traffic
   demand, distribution, and assignment parameters for urban environment
   simulation. These three parameters significantly impact transportation
   engineering benchmark process, are also critical in realizing realistic
   traffic modeling situations. In this paper, we model and characterize
   traffic density distribution of thousands of locations, intersection,
   and roadways around the world. The traffic densities are generated from
   millions of images collected over several years and processed using
   computer vision techniques. The resulting traffic density distribution
   time series are then analyzed. It is found using the goodness-of-fit
   test that the traffic density distributions follow heavy-tail models
   such as Weibull in over 90\% of analyzed locations. Moreover, a
   heavy-tail gives rise to long-range dependence and self-similarity,
   which we studied by estimating the Hurst exponent (H). Our analysis
   based on seven different Hurst estimators strongly indicates that the
   traffic distribution patterns are stochastically self-similar (0.5 <= H
   <= 1.0). We believe this is an important finding that will influence the
   design and development of the next generation traffic simulation
   techniques and also aid in accurately modeling traffic engineering of
   urban systems. In addition, it shall provide a much-needed input for the
   development of smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is rapidly
   transitioning to STEAM, which is the integration of the arts and design
   into the sciences. This transition is due to the need of adapting
   creativity in the sciences and engineering fields. This demonstrates the
   growing importance of the arts contribution towards the sciences in
   various ways. An area where art shows promise is in brain-computer
   interfaces. In this paper, we propose a definition for artistic
   brain-computer interfaces (artistic BCI) from a passive BCI perspective.
   We defined its composition in four fields: human-computer interaction,
   neurophysiology, art, and computing. This definition is based on the
   user's state stimulation and expression and how art could help us and
   the end user understand the user's affective state. We also discuss its
   applicability towards different areas and how these areas can benefit
   from artistic BCI.}},

Abstract = {{People affected by severe neuro-degenerative diseases (e.g., late-stage
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or locked-in syndrome) eventually
   lose all muscular control. Thus, they cannot use traditional assistive
   communication devices that depend on muscle control, or brain-computer
   interfaces (BCIs) that depend on the ability to control gaze. While
   auditory and tactile BCIs can provide communication to such individuals,
   their use typically entails an artificial mapping between the stimulus
   and the communication intent. This makes these BCIs diffcult to learn
   and use. In this study, we investigated the use of selective auditory
   attention to natural speech as an avenue for BCI communication. In this
   approach, the user communicates by directing his/her attention to one of
   two simultaneously presented speakers. We used electrocorticographic
   (ECoG) signals in the gamma band (70-170 Hz) to infer the identity of
   the attended speaker, thereby removing the need to learn such an
   artificial mapping. Our results from 12 human subjects show that a
   single cortical location over superior temporal gyrus or premotor cortex
   is typically sufficient to identify the attended speaker within 10 s and
   with 77\% accuracy (50\% accuracy due to chance). These results lay the
   groundwork for future studies that may determine the real-time
   performance of BCIs based on selective auditory attention to speech.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of rainfall has major impacts in agriculture, affecting
   the soil, hydrology, and plant health in agricultural systems. The goal
   of this study was to test for recent changes in rainfall intensity and
   seasonal rainfall variability in the Southeastern U.S. by exploring the
   data collaboratively with agricultural stakeholders. Daily rainfall
   records from the Global Historical Climatology Network were used to
   analyze changes in rain intensity and seasonal rainfall variability.
   During the last 30 years (1985-2014), there has been a significant
   change (53\% increase) in the number of extreme rainfall days (> 152.4
   mm/day) and there have been significant decreases in the number of
   moderate intensity (12.7-25.4 mm/day) and heavy (25.4-76.2 mm/day)
   rainfall days in the Southeastern U.S., when compared to the previous
   30-year period (1955-1984). There have also been significant decreases
   in the return period of months in which greater than half of the monthly
   total rain occurred in a single day; this is an original,
   stakeholder-developed rainfall intensity metric. The variability in
   spring and summer rainfall increased during the last 30 years, but
   winter and fall showed less variability in seasonal totals in the last
   30 years. In agricultural systems, rainfall is one of the leading
   factors affecting yield variability; so it can be expected that more
   variable rainfall and more intense rain events could bring new
   challenges to agricultural production. However, these changes can also
   present opportunities for producers who are taking measures to adjust
   management strategies to make their systems more resilient to increased
   rain intensity and variability. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{An engineered micropattern to reduce bacterial colonization, platelet
   adhesion and fibrin sheath formation for improved biocompatibility of
   central venous catheters}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and
   catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) are common complications of central
   venous catheters (CVC), which are used to monitor patient health and
   deliver medications. CVCs are subject to protein adsorption and platelet
   adhesion as well as colonization by the natural skin flora (i.e.
   Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Antimicrobial and
   antithrombotic drugs can prevent infections and thrombosis-related
   complications, but have associated resistance and safety risks. Surface
   topographies have shown promise in limiting platelet and bacterial
   adhesion, so it was hypothesized that an engineered Sharklet
   micropattern, inspired by shark-skin, may provide a combined approach as
   it has wide reaching anti-fouling capabilities. To assess the
   feasibility for this micropattern to improve CVC-related healthcare
   outcomes, bacterial colonization and platelet interactions were analyzed
   in vitro on a material common for vascular access devices.
   Methods: To evaluate bacterial inhibition after simulated vascular
   exposure, micropatterned thermoplastic polyurethane surfaces were
   preconditioned with blood proteins in vitro then subjected to a
   bacterial challenge for 1 and 18 h. Platelet adhesion was assessed with
   fluorescent microscopy after incubation of the surfaces with
   platelet-rich plasma (PRP) supplemented with calcium. Platelet
   activation was further assessed by monitoring fibrin formation with
   fluorescent microscopy after exposure of the surfaces to platelet-rich
   plasma (PRP) supplemented with calcium in a flow-cell. Results are
   reported as percent reductions and significance is based on t-tests and
   ANOVA models of log reductions. All experiments were replicated at least
   three times.
   Results: Blood and serum conditioned micropatterned surfaces reduced 18
   h S. aureus and S. epidermidis colonization by 70\% (p <= 0.05) and 71\%
   (p < 0.01), respectively, when compared to preconditioned unpatterned
   controls. Additionally, platelet adhesion and fibrin sheath formation
   were reduced by 86\% and 80\% (p < 0.05), respectively, on the
   micropattern, when compared to controls.
   Conclusions: The Sharklet micropattern, in a CVC-relevant thermoplastic
   polyurethane, significantly reduced bacterial colonization and relevant
   platelet interactions after simulated vascular exposure. These results
   suggest that the incorporation of the Sharklet micropattern on the
   surface of a CVC may inhibit the initial events that lead to CRBSI and
   CRT.}},

Abstract = {{A closed-loop system that provides both the sensing of glucose and the
   appropriate dosage of insulin could dramatically improve treatment
   options for insulin-dependent diabetics. The intrahepatic implantation
   of allogeneic islets has the potential to provide this intimate control,
   by transplanting the very cells that have this inherent sensing and
   secretion capacity. Limiting islet transplantation, however, is the
   significant loss and dysfunction of islets following implantation, due
   to the poor engraftment environment and significant immunological
   attack. In this review, we outline approaches that seek to address these
   challenges via engineering biomimetic materials. These materials can
   serve to mimic natural processes that work toward improving engraftment,
   minimizing inflammation, and directing immunological responses.
   Biomimetic materials can serve to house cells, recapitulate native
   microenvironments, release therapeutic agents in a physiological manner,
   and/or present agents to direct cells towards desired responses. By
   integrating these approaches, superior platforms capable of improving
   long-term engraftment and acceptance of transplanted islets are on the
   horizon.}},

Abstract = {{Noise generation via turbulent-flow interactions is a multifaceted
   problem that appears in many instances, from flow over bodies to jet
   flows found in circulation-control airfoils. The work presented here
   centers on an investigation of the noise generation due to a turbulent
   wall jet that operates at a moderate Reynolds number based on nozzle
   height of 25,500. A multistage, experimental-based method is
   demonstrated which utilizes spatially-resolved velocity field data
   obtained from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and temporally-resolved
   fluctuating surface pressure measurements. The PIV snapshots and surface
   pressure measurements have been acquired synchronously to allow for
   correlations between the quantities to be leveraged in a Stochastic
   Estimation procedure. The spatially-resolved information obtained in PIV
   was decomposed using the snapshot Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
   to obtain a set of spatially-dependent basis functions and
   time-dependent scalar expansion coefficients. The modified-Stochastic
   Estimation is used in this work to estimate the time-dependent POD
   coefficients based on their relationship with the surface pressure
   measurements. When the estimated POD expansion coefficients are combined
   with the spatially-resolved POD modes, an estimated velocity field is
   obtained at a temporal resolution dictated by the fluctuating surface
   pressure measurements. With a sufficiently resolved velocity field
   series, Poisson's equation is solved for the fluctuating pressure field
   with the measured surface pressure used as boundary conditions in
   discrete locations in addition to the pressure gradient calculated by
   the Navier-Stokes equation at the other domain boundaries. This pressure
   field in turn is used as source in an acoustic analogy estimate of the
   far-field acoustics. Specifically in this work, Curle's acoustic analogy
   is employed, and the resulting quadrupole and dipole terms are
   investigated to further understand the acoustics of the turbulent wall
   jet. By treating the rigid wall as a passive reflector of perturbations
   caused by turbulent fluctuations and not an acoustic source, estimates
   of the far-field acoustics are found to match the Sound Pressure Level
   of direct far-field measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Irrigation can account for a substantial portion of a home's water use,
   and reductions in irrigation can have a large water conservation impact.
   This project provides an improved understanding of residential
   irrigation practices for the purpose of assisting utilities in planning
   and managing potable water demand Customers are classified into groups
   of occasional, low, medium, and high irrigators. All customer groups
   were compared to a planning design standard. Monthly potable combined
   (indoor and irrigation) water billing records, property appraiser data,
   daily weather data, and U.S. Census data for Northwest Hillsborough
   County in Florida were used for this analysis. Irrigation applied per
   unit area was estimated by subtracting estimated indoor use from total
   water use, then dividing by the estimated irrigated area. Theoretical
   gross irrigation required was calculated using an irrigation efficiency
   and a daily soil-water balance that included weather and soil inputs at
   each customer's parcel. Ratios of irrigation applied to irrigation
   required were used to classify customers into irrigating groups. The
   majority of customers were classified as occasional irrigators (69\%),
   followed by low irrigators (19\%), and medium and high irrigators (6\%
   each). Low, medium, and high irrigator groups all had potential for
   reducing irrigation without compromising landscape quality. The demand
   of the high irrigating group exceeded the requirement by 623 mm/year
   (92\%).}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for the development of low-cost adsorbents to removal
   arsenic (As) from aqueous solutions. In this work, a magnetic biochar
   was synthesized by pyrolyzing a mixture of naturally-occurring hematite
   mineral and pinewood biomass. The resulting biochar composite was
   characterized with Xray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS). In comparison to the unmodified
   biochar, the hematite modified biochar not only had stronger magnetic
   property but also showed much greater ability to remove As from aqueous
   solution, likely because the gamma-Fe2O3 particles on the carbon surface
   served as sorption sites through electrostatic interactions. Because the
   magnetized biochar can be easily isolated and removed with external
   magnets, it can be used in various As contaminant removal applications.

   falling part of the return stroke waveform. The time interval between
   the primary and secondary peaks depends upon the height of the branching
   point above ground and the speed at which the incident current wave
   moves upward from the ground. The presence of branch serves to slightly
   decrease the magnitude of the opposite polarity overshoot. The effects
   of the height of the branching point above ground, fraction of total

Abstract = {{Ceria ceramics have the unique ability to protect cells from free
   radical-induced damage, making them materials of interest for biomedical
   applications. To expand upon the understanding of the potential of ceria
   as a biomaterial, porous ceria, fabricated via direct foaming, was
   investigated to assess its biocompatibility and its ability to scavenge
   free radicals. A mouse osteoblast (7F2) cell line was cultured with the
   ceria foams to determine the extent of the foams' toxicity. Toxicity
   assessments indicate that mouse osteoblasts cultured directly on the
   ceria scaffold for 72 h did not show a significant (p>0.05) increase in
   toxicity, but rather show comparable toxicity to cells cultured on
   porous 45S5 Bioglass (R). The in vitro inflammatory response elicited
   from porous ceria foams was measured as a function of tumor necrosis
   factor alpha (TNF-) secreted from a human monocytic leukemia cell line.
   Results indicate that the ceria foams do not cause a significant
   inflammatory response, eliciting a response of 27.1 +/- 7.1 pg mL(-1) of
   TNF- compared to 36.3 +/- 5.8 pg mL(-1) from cells on Bioglass, and 20.1
   +/- 2.9 pg mL(-1) from untreated cells. Finally, we report cellular
   toxicity in response to free radicals from tert-butyl hydroperoxide with
   and without foamed ceria. Our preliminary results show that the foamed
   ceria is able to decrease the toxic effect of induced oxidative stress.
   Collectively, this study demonstrates that foamed ceria scaffolds do not

Abstract = {{This paper is to provide practical options for prognostics so that
   beginners can select appropriate methods for their fields of
   application. To achieve this goal, several popular algorithms are first
   reviewed in the data-driven and physics-based prognostics methods. Each
   algorithm's attributes and pros and cons are analyzed in terms of model
   definition, model parameter estimation and ability to handle noise and
   bias in data. Fatigue crack growth examples are then used to illustrate
   the characteristics of different algorithms. In order to suggest a
   suitable algorithm, several studies are made based on the number of data
   sets, the level of noise and bias, availability of loading and physical
   models, and complexity of the damage growth behavior. Based on the
   study, it is concluded that the Gaussian process is easy and fast to
   implement, but works well only when the covariance function is properly
   defined. The neural network has the advantage in the case of large noise
   and complex models but only with many training data sets. The particle
   filter and Bayesian method are superior to the former methods because
   they are less affected by noise and model complexity, but work only when
   physical model and loading conditions are available. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Modification and enhancement of cryogenic quenching heat transfer by a
   nanoporous surface}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Since the average chilldown efficiency for cryogenic systems is only
   about 8\%, significant improvements to heat transfer are needed for many
   applications. An experiment was performed to evaluate the modification
   and enhancement on the quenching heat transfer by a nanoporous heat
   transfer surface in this study. For comparison purposes, two sample
   surfaces were used. One is the mechanically polished conventional normal
   aluminum surface serving as the base case and the other is an aluminum
   surface with the anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) nanoporous finish. In
   this work, the effect of the nanoporous surface on the heat transfer
   during chilldown in a liquid nitrogen pool is investigated. The results
   indicated that the nanoporous surface completely modified and enhanced
   the phase-change heat transfer in all three quenching regimes. Comparing
   to the conventional surface case, the Leidenfrost temperature was
   increased by 32 K and the critical heat flux (CHF) was raised by 160\%
   due to the nanoporous surface. However, the most significant
   modification on the boiling mechanisms by the nanoporous surface was
   found in the transition regime that is composed of transitional film and
   transitional nucleate sub-regimes with quite different quenching curve
   slopes. For cryogenic quenching applications, it is estimated that the
   nanoporous surface could save 20\% in the amount of cryogen consumption
   by shortening the chilldown time. The modification and enhancement are
   mainly attributed to the superhydrophilic property and nanoscale
   nucleation sites offered by the nanoporous surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel methodology based upon the information-theoretic
   measures of entropy and mutual information was implemented to downscale
   soil moisture (SM) observations from 10 km to 1 km. It included a
   transformation function that related auxiliary remotely sensed (RS)
   products at high resolution to in situ SM observations to obtain first
   estimates of SM at 1 km and merging this estimate with SM at coarse
   resolutions through Principle of Relevant Information (PRI). The
   PRI-based estimates were evaluated using synthetic observations in NC
   Florida for heterogeneous agricultural land covers (LC), with two
   growing seasons of sweet corn and one of cotton, annually. The
   cumulative density function showed an overall error in SM of < 0.03
   cubic meter/cubic meter in the region, with a confidence interval of
   95\% during the simulation period. The PRI estimates at 1 km were also
   compared with those from the method based upon Universal Triangle (UT).
   The spatially averaged root mean square error (RMSE) aggregated over the
   vegetative LC were 0.01 cubic meter/cubic meter and 0.15 cubic
   meter/cubic meter using the PRI and UT methods, respectively. The RMSE
   for downscaled estimates using the UT method increased to 0.28 cubic
   meter/cubic meter when Laplacian errors are used, while the
   corresponding RMSE for the PRI remains the same for both Laplacian or
   Gaussian errors. The Kullback-Liebler divergence (KLD) for estimates
   using PRI is about 50\% lower than those using the method based upon UT
   indicating that the probability density function (PDF) of the PRI
   estimate is closer to PDF of the true SM, than the UT method.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging
   technique for nondestructive measurement of color components (Delta
   L{*}, Delta a{*} and Delta b{*}) and classify tea leaves during
   different drying periods. Hyperspectral images of tea leaves at five
   drying periods were acquired in the spectral region of 380-1030 nm. The
   three color features were measured by the colorimeter. Different
   preprocessing algorithms were applied to select the best one in
   accordance with the prediction results of partial least squares
   regression (PLSR) models. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling
   (CARS) and successive projections algorithm (SPA) were used to identify
   the effective wavelengths, respectively. Different models (least
   squares-support vector machine {[}LS-SVM], PLSR, principal components
   regression {[}PCR] and multiple linear regression {[}MLR]) were
   established to predict the three color components, respectively.
   SPA-LS-SVM model performed excellently with the correlation coefficient
   (r(p)) of 0.929 for Delta L{*}, 0.849 for Delta a{*} and 0.917 for Delta
   b{*}, respectively. LS-SVM model was built for the classification of
   different tea leaves. The correct classification rates (CCRs) ranged
   from 89.29\% to 100\% in the calibration set and from 71.43\% to 100\%
   in the prediction set, respectively. The total classification results
   were 96.43\% in the calibration set and 85.71\% in the prediction set.
   The result showed that hyperspectral imaging technique could be used as
   an objective and nondestructive method to determine color features and
   classify tea leaves at different drying periods.}},

Abstract = {{We present a molecular dynamics study of grain boundary (GB) resistance
   to dislocation-mediated slip transfer and phonon-mediated heat transfer
   in nanocrystalline silicon bicrystal. Three most stable < 110 > tilt GBs
   in silicon are investigated. Under mechanical loading, the nucleation
   and growth of hexagonal-shaped shuffle dislocation loops are reproduced.
   The resistances of different GBs to slip transfer are quantified through
   their constitutive responses. Results show that the Sigma 3 coherent
   twin boundary (CTB) in silicon exhibits significantly higher resistance
   to dislocation motion than the Sigma 9 GB in glide symmetry and the
   Sigma 19 GB in mirror symmetry. The distinct GB strengths are explained
   by the atomistic details of the dislocation-GB interaction. Under
   thermal loading, based on a thermostat-induced heat pulse model, the
   resistances of the GBs to transient heat conduction in
   ballistic-diffusive regime are characterized. In contrast to the trend
   found in the dislocation-GB interaction in bicrystal models with
   different GBs, the resistances of the same three GBs to heat transfer
   are strikingly different. The strongest dislocation barrier Sigma 3 CTB
   is almost transparent to heat conduction, while the
   dislocation-permeable Sigma 9 and Sigma 19 GBs exhibit larger resistance
   to heat transfer. In addition, simulation results suggest that the GB
   thermal resistance not only depends on the GB energy but also on the
   detailed atomic structure along the GBs. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the ultrafast improvement of surface wettability,
   electrical, and room temperature magnetic characteristics of cubic
   zirconia single crystalline thin films after laser annealing. The point
   defects generated by the laser treatment are envisaged to play a
   critical role in altering the above properties. Yttria stabilized
   zirconia (YSZ) thin films were epitaxially grown on Si(100) substrates
   by pulsed laser deposition technique and subsequently annealed by a KrF
   excimer laser beam (tau = 25 ns) using low-energy laser pulses. An
   atomically sharp interface, parallel to the film free surface, between
   laser annealed layer and the pristine region was observed. The single
   crystalline nature of thin films was preserved following the laser
   treatment. The lasersolid interaction with YSZ led to the introduction
   of point defects, i.e., oxygen vacancies, resulting in a strained
   structure which, in turn, resulted in the formation of a tetragonal-like
   zirconia. With the increase of number of laser pulses the laser treated
   films got highly disordered due to the high concentration of the point
   defects, while maintaining their crystalline nature. Although the
   surface of the pristine sample showed weak hydrophilic characteristics
   (contact angle similar to 73 degrees), the laser annealed samples
   exhibited significantly improved hydrophilic characteristics. It was
   found that there is an optimum number of laser pulses where the maximum
   hydrophilicity (contact angle similar to 22 degrees) is obtained. The
   carrier concentration in the sample with the highest hydrophilicity was
   determined to be higher by about 5 orders of magnitude compared to the
   pristine sample. This sample possessed the lowest electrical
   resistivity. The laser annealed YSZ epilayers showed a superior
   room-temperature ferromagnetic behavior, compared to the pristine
   samples. A 2-fold enhancement in the magnetization of the samples was
   observed following the laser treatment which is a clear demonstration of
   the key role of defects and their transient distribution throughout the
   lattice. All these observations were correlated with the formation of
   point defects due to the photon interaction with YSZ and absorption of
   energy of the KrF laser photons to produce defects.}},

Abstract = {{Microtopography has been observed to lead to altered attachment behavior
   for marine fouling organisms; however, quantification of this phenomenon
   is lacking in the scientific literature. Here, we present quantitative
   measurement of the disruption of normal attachment behavior of the
   fouling algae Ulva linza by antifouling microtopographies. The
   distribution of the diatom Navicula incerta was shown to be unaffected
   by the presence of topography. The radial distribution function was
   calculated for both individual zoospores and cells as well as aggregates
   of zoospores from attachment data for a variety topographic
   configurations and at a number of different attachment densities.
   Additionally, the screening distance and maximum values were mapped
   according to the location of zoospore aggregates within a single unit
   cell. We found that engineered topographies decreased the distance
   between spore aggregates compared to that for a smooth control surface;
   however, the distributions for individual spores were unchanged. We also
   found that the local attachment site geometry affected the screening
   distance for aggregates of zoospores, with certain geometries decreasing
   screening distance and others having no measurable effect. The
   distribution mapping techniques developed and explored in this article
   have yielded important insight into the design parameters for
   antifouling microtopographies that can be implemented in the next
   generation of antifouling surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Optical and Hall effect measurements have been performed on single
   crystals of Pb0.77Sn0.23Se, a IV-VI mixed chalcogenide. The
   temperature-dependent (10-300 K) reflectance was measured over 40-7000
   cm(-1) (5-870 meV) with an extension to 15 500 cm(-1) (1.92 eV) at room
   temperature. The reflectance was fitted to the Drude-Lorentz model using
   a single Drude component and several Lorentz oscillators. The optical
   properties at the measured temperatures were estimated via
   Kramers-Kronig analysis as well as by a Drude-Lorentz fit. The carriers
   were p type with the carrier density determined by Hall measurements. A
   signature of valence intraband transition is found in the low-energy
   optical spectra. It is found that the valence-conduction band transition
   energy as well as the free-carrier effective mass reach minimum values
   at 100 K, suggesting temperature-driven band inversion in the material.
   Density functional theory calculations for the electronic band structure

Abstract = {{The conversion coefficients (CCs) relate protection quantities, mean
   absorbed dose (D-T) and effective dose (E), with physical radiation
   field quantities, such as fluence (Phi). The calculation of CCs through
   Monte Carlo simulations is useful for estimating the dose in individuals
   exposed to radiation. The aim of this work was the calculation of
   conversion coefficients for absorbed and effective doses per fluence
   (D-T/Phi and E/Phi) using a sitting and standing female hybrid phantom
   (UFH/NCI) exposure to monoenergetic protons with energy ranging from 2
   MeV to 10 GeV. The radiation transport code MCNPX was used to develop
   exposure scenarios implementing the female UFH/NCI phantom in sitting
   and standing postures. Whole-body irradiations were performed using the
   recommended irradiation geometries by ICRP publication 116 (AP, PA,
   RLAT, LLAT, ROT and ISO). In most organs, the conversion coefficients
   D-T/Phi were similar for both postures. However, relative differences
   were significant for organs located in the abdominal region, such as
   ovaries, uterus and urinary bladder, especially in the AP, RLAT and LLAT
   geometries. Anatomical differences caused by changing the posture of the
   female UFH/NCI phantom led an attenuation of incident protons with
   energies below 150 MeV by the thigh of the phantom in the sitting
   posture, for the front-to-back irradiation, and by the arms and hands of
   the phantom in the standing posture, for the lateral irradiation.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing a blocking layer between the interfaces of the photoanode
   is an effective approach to improve the performance of dye-sensitized
   solar cells (DSSCs). In this work, HfO2 blocking layers are deposited
   via atomic layer deposition (ALD) onto tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) and
   TiO2. In both cases, addition of the blocking layer increases cell
   efficiencies to greater than 7\%. The improved performance for a HfO2
   layer inserted between the ITO/TiO2 interface is associated with an
   energy barrier that reduces electron recombination. HfO2 blocking layers
   between the TiO2/dye interface show more complex behavior and are more
   sensitive to the number of ALD cycles. For thin blocking layers on TiO2,
   the improved device performance is attributed to the passivation of
   surface states in TiO2. A distinct transition in dark current and
   electron lifetime are observed after 4 ALD cycles. These changes to
   performance indicate thick HfO2 layers on TiO2 formed an energy barrier
   that significantly hinders cell performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study is aimed at understanding the limits in reducing the size of
   a membrane-based CO2 separator and its pressure head needs and energy
   consumption, while maximizing its selectivity. The separator consists of
   a flow channel capped by a hydrophobic nanoporous membrane through which
   CO2 exits the anode flow stream of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). A
   systematic study is conducted to determine the effect of differential
   pressure across the membrane, flow velocity, and flow channel dimensions
   on the separation process. The extraction flux was found to change
   linearly with pressure difference across the membrane, The effect of
   flow velocity on the extraction flux was negligible up to a critical
   velocity beyond which the separation process ceased. The separation
   selectivity enhanced by increasing the differential pressure across the
   membrane but did not change with varying the flow velocity and channel
   depth. Using the findings of the first part of the study, an optimal
   micro-separator (with a footprint of approximately 10 x 1 mm(2)) was
   designed/fabricated for a 20 W DMFC and its performance was
   experimentally analyzed. An unprecedented separation selectivity of
   close to 200 was achieved at a differential pressure of about 10 kPa and
   negligible energy consumption. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data are used to compare the propagation
   paths of seven rocket-triggered lightning flashes to the inferred charge
   structure of the thunderstorms in which they were triggered. This is the
   first LMA study of Florida thunderstorm charge structure. Three
   sequentially (within 16min) triggered lightning flashes, whose initial
   stages were the subject of Hill et al. (2013), are reexamined by
   comparing the complete flashes to the preceding natural lightning to
   demonstrate that the three rocket-triggered flashes propagated through
   an inferred negative charge region that decreased from about 6.8 to
   about 4.4 km altitude as the thunderstorm dissipated. Two other flashes
   were also sequentially triggered (within 9 min) in a thunderstorm that
   contained a convectively intense region ahead of a stratiform region,
   with similar observed results. Finally, two unique cases of triggered
   lightning flashes are presented. In the first case, the in-cloud portion
   of the triggered lightning flash, after ascending to and turning
   horizontal at 5.3 km altitude, just above the 0 degrees C level, was

   flash was triggered relatively early in the storm's lifecycle that did
   not turn horizontal near the 0 degrees C level, as is usually the case
   for triggered lightning in dissipating storms, but ascended to nearly
   7.5km altitude before exhibiting extensive horizontal branching.}},

Abstract = {{The correlations between channel-bottom light intensity and channel-base
   current of all discharge processes of a rocket-and-wire-triggered
   lightning flash, including initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, ICC
   pulse background continuing current (IBCC), return strokes, M
   components, and M component background continuing currents (MBCC), have
   been investigated. A rough linear correlation has been found between the
   current squared and the light intensity for ICC pulses (including peaks
   of different ICC pulses), IBCC, the initial rising stage (IRS) of return
   strokes (including current peaks of different strokes), and MBCC. The
   slopes of the correlation regression lines for the current squared
   versus light intensity of ICC pulses and IBCC are similar, but they are
   about 2-3 times smaller than the slopes of MBCC and 5-7 times smaller
   than the slopes of the IRS of return strokes. In contrast, a rough
   linear correlation has been found between the current and the light
   intensity for the later slow decay stage of return strokes and for the M
   components. The slopes of the correlation regression lines of the
   current versus the light intensity for these latter two processes are
   found to be similar. No simple correlation has been found between the
   current and the light intensity for the initial fast decay stage (IFDS)
   of return strokes. The duration of the IFDS of return strokes generally
   lasts from several microseconds to several tens of microseconds and is
   more or less directly proportional to the corresponding peak return
   stroke current squared. A time delay ranging from 12 mu s to 300 mu s
   has been found between the current and the light intensity of all ICC
   pulses and M components. The time delay decreases as the corresponding
   peak current increases.}},

Title = {{CO Oxidation on PdO(101) during Temperature-Programmed Reaction
   Spectroscopy: Role of Oxygen Vacancies}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the oxidation of CO on PdO(101) using
   temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS), reflection
   absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), and density functional theory
   (DFT). We find that about 71\% of the CO molecules adsorbed in a
   saturated layer on PdO(101) transform to CO2 during TPRS, with the CO2
   desorbing in two main features centered at 330 and 520 K. RAIRS shows
   that CO molecules initially adsorb in an atop configuration on
   coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Pd sites of PdO(101) located next to
   Ocus atoms, yielding a RAIRS peak at 2135 cm(-1), and that the oxidation
   of these species produces the CO2 TPRS peak at 330 K. Concurrent with
   reaction, a large fraction of CO molecules migrates to atop-Pdcus sites
   located next to Ocus atom vacancies (Ov) that are created during
   reaction, as evidenced by the appearance of a RAIRS peak centered at
   similar to 2085 cm(-1). Our RAIRS measurements demonstrate that
   oxidation of the CO-Pdcus/Ov species is responsible for the CO2 TPRS
   peak at 520 K, and further show that oxygen atoms from the subsurface
   readily fill Ov sites as CO molecules vacate the Pd-cus/O-v sites above
   about 400 K. DFT calculations show that a strong enhancement in binding
   (similar to 70 kJ/mol) is responsible for the rapid migration of CO
   molecules from Pd-cus/O-cus sites to Pd-cus/O-v sites as the PdO(101)
   surface is reduced at low temperature. DFT also predicts that both CO
   species can access facile pathways for oxidation on PdO(101) via
   reaction with O-cus atoms, wherein the apparent reaction barriers are
   nearly identical in each pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The recently synthesized cubic pyrochlore Bi2Ti2O7 has been shown to
   possess displacive disorder in both the anion and cation sublattices.
   Here, the nature and characteristics of the displacive disorder are
   further investigated via vibrational spectroscopy. The infrared
   reflectance was measured over 30-3300 cm(-1) at temperatures between 20
   and 300 K, while the Raman spectra were collected from 50 to 3500 cm(-1)
   at room temperature. It is found that Bi2Ti2O7 exhibits more than the
   six modes expected in the Raman spectrum for the ideal pyrochlore
   structure. In addition, infrared-active modes are also present in the
   Raman spectra. These two results suggest displacements in the atomic
   positions of bismuth and oxygen away from their higher symmetry
   conventional pyrochlore Wyckoff positions and are strong and surprising
   evidence of disorder at the titanium site. Infrared-active phonon modes
   have been assigned to specific bending and stretching vibrational modes.
   The effect of the Bi ion on the OBiO and O'BiO' phonon modes is
   discussed.}},

   characteristics}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Both lab-scale (50 L/day) and pilot-scale (10 m(3)/day) ceramic membrane
   bioreactors (CMBRs), equipped with two additional implements
   (step-feeding and internal recycling), have been tested for the removal
   of nitrogen and organic matter from municipal wastewater. During the 180
   days of operation, 0.5Q of step-feeding increased the removal rate of
   total nitrogen by 46.2\% in the lab-scale CMBR, whereas a 59.0\%
   increase was observed with the additional 3Q internal recycling in the
   pilot-scale CMBR. This was presumably due to the supply of insufficient
   carbon source as an electron donor in the denitrification stage. The
   ceramic membrane also exhibited high rigidity sufficient for periodic
   bacicwashing using the highly-pressurized permeate. A constant flux test
   with 30 s of backwashing after every 9.5 min of filtration successfully
   removed foulants from the pores of the ceramic membrane, and
   instantaneously restored the trans-membrane pressure (TMP). During the
   test, the TMP in case of without the hydraulic backwashing steadily
   increased (20-80 kPa) for 40 min, whereas it took more than two times to
   reach the same TMP in the case of with the hydraulic backwashing, which
   eventually doubled the time span between required chemical washings. (C)

Abstract = {{We present detailed studies of the high photocurrent gain behavior in
   multilayer organic photodiodes containing tailored carrier blocking
   layers we reported earlier in a Letter {[}W. T. Hammond and J. Xue,
   Appl. Phys. Lett. 97, 073302 (2010)], in which a high photocurrent gain
   of up to 500 was attributed to the accumulation of photogenerated holes
   at the anode/organic active layer interface and the subsequent drastic
   increase in secondary electron injection from the anode. Here, we show
   that both the hole-blocking layer structure and layer thickness strongly
   influence the magnitude of the photocurrent gain. Temporal studies
   revealed that the frequency response of such devices is limited by three
   different processes with lifetimes of 10 mu s, 202 mu s, and 2.72 ms for
   the removal of confined holes, which limit the 3 dB bandwidth of these
   devices to 1.4 kHz. Furthermore, the composition in the mixed organic
   donor-acceptor photoactive layer affects both gain and bandwidth, which
   is attributed to the varying charge transport characteristics, and the
   optimal gain-bandwidth product is achieved with approximately 30\% donor
   content. Finally, these devices show a high dynamic range of more than
   seven orders of magnitude, although the photocurrent shows a sublinear
   dependence on the incident optical power. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the first of a two-part study concerning the relation
   between the geometry of micropillar array wicks and their
   thermohydraulic performance. In this paper, a parametric study of pillar
   array geometries is conducted, and the efficacies of existing capillary
   pressure and permeability models in predicting the experimental results
   are examined. A new method is utilized to independently measure the
   permeability and capillary pressure of a wick structure. A permeability
   model based on creeping flow past infinitely long cylinders, corrected
   to account for the effect of Meniscus curvature on mass flow rate
   through pillar arrays with a limited height, closely predicts the
   experimental data. Also, a model that relates the capillary pressure to
   the wick geometry using a thermodynamic approach better predicts the
   experimental results. The approach adopted by this model involves using
   a surface energy minimization algorithm to determine the shape of the
   meniscus within the pillars. These permeability and capillary pressure
   models were coupled with Darcy's law for fluid flow to obtain an overall
   expression for flow through micropillar arrays. The overall model is
   utilized in the second part of this study to determine optimized
   micropillar wick geometries and the theoretical limits of their
   performance. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This article, the second of a two-part study, is aimed at finding
   optimal micropillar wick geometries and their theoretical performance
   limits. For the first time, the theoretical optimization results are
   experimentally verified. The permeability and capillary pressure models
   determined in the first part of this study are utilized in the
   optimization process. First, the existence of optimality is ascertained
   through constrained parametric sweeps of the individual variables in the
   wick performance model, which reveal the presence of optimal values of
   each variable for a specific combination of the other variables. Then,
   the overall optimization of wicks is accomplished through a genetic
   algorithm. It is established that a unique optimal geometry, i.e. a
   combination of diameter, spacing and height, exists at each wicking
   length. Finally, these results are used to determine the theoretical
   performance limits of micropillar array wicks. The results suggest that
   the theoretical performance limit is 3-4 times greater than the highest
   performance reported in literature. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Infrared, visible, and multispectral photodetectors are important
   components for sensing, security and electronics applications. Current
   fabrication of these devices is based on inorganic materials grown by
   epitaxial techniques which are not compatible with low-cost large-scale
   processing. Here, air-stable multispectral solution-processed inorganic
   double heterostructure photodetectors, using PbS quantum dots (QDs) as
   the photoactive layer, colloidal ZnO nanoparticles as the electron
   transport/hole blocking layer (ETL/HBL), and solution-derived NiO as the
   hole transport/electron blocking layer (HTL/EBL) are reported. The
   resulting device has low dark current density of 20 nA cm(-2) with a
   noise equivalent power (NEP) on the order of tens of picowatts across
   the detection spectra and a specific detectivity (D-star) value of 1.2 x
   10(12) cm Hz(1/2) W-1. These parameters are comparable to commercially
   available Si, Ge, and InGaAs photodetectors. The devices have a linear
   dynamic range (LDR) over 65 dB and a bandwidth over 35 kHz, which are
   sufficient for imaging applications. Finally, these solution-processed
   inorganic devices have a long storage lifetime in air, even without
   encapsulation.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The outflowing currents from tidal inlets are influenced both by the
   morphology of the ebb-tide shoal and interaction with incident surface
   gravity waves. Likewise, the propagation and breaking of incident waves
   are affected by the morphology and the strength and structure of the
   outflowing current. The 3-D Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment
   Transport (COAWST) modeling system is applied to numerically analyze the
   interaction between currents, waves, and bathymetry in idealized inlet
   configurations. The bathymetry is found to be a dominant controlling
   variable. In the absence of an ebb shoal and with weak wave forcing, a
   narrow outflow jet extends seaward with little lateral spreading. The
   presence of an ebb-tide shoal produces significant pressure gradients in
   the region of the outflow, resulting in enhanced lateral spreading of
   the jet. Incident waves cause lateral spreading and limit the seaward
   extent of the jet, due both to conversion of wave momentum flux and
   enhanced bottom friction. The interaction between the vorticity of the
   outflow jet and the wave stokes drift is also an important driving force
   for the lateral spreading of the plume. For weak outflows, the outflow
   jet is actually enhanced by strong waves when there is a channel across
   the bar, due to the return current effect. For both strong and weak
   outflows, waves increase the alongshore transport in both directions
   from the inlet due to the wave-induced setup over the ebb shoal. Wave
   breaking is more influenced by the topography of the ebb shoal than by
   wave-current interaction, although strong outflows show intensified
   breaking at the head of the main channel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the multimodal network design problem (MMNDP)
   that optimizes the auto network expansion scheme and bus network design
   scheme in an integrated manner. The problem is formulated as a
   single-level mathematical program with complementarity constraints
   (MPCC). The decision variables, including the expanded capacity of auto
   links, the layout of bus routes, the fare levels and the route
   frequencies, are transformed into multiple sets of binary variables. The
   layout of transit routes is explicitly modeled using an alternative
   approach by introducing a set of complementarity constraints. The
   congestion interaction among different travel modes is captured by an
   asymmetric multimodal user equilibrium problem (MUE). An active-set
   algorithm is employed to deal with the MPCC, by sequentially solving a
   relaxed MMNDP and a scheme updating problem. Numerical tests on
   nine-node and Sioux Falls networks are performed to demonstrate the
   proposed model and algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel six degree of freedom, ground-based
   experimental testbed, designed for testing new guidance, navigation, and
   control algorithms for the relative motion of nano-satellites. The
   development of innovative guidance, navigation and control methodologies
   is a necessary step in the advance of autonomous spacecraft. The testbed
   allows for testing these algorithms in a one-g laboratory environment.
   The system stands out among the existing experimental platforms because
   all degrees of freedom of motion are controlled via real thrusters, as
   it would occur on orbit, with no use of simulated dynamics and servo
   actuators. The hardware and software components of the testbed are
   detailed in the paper, as is the motion tracking system used to perform
   its navigation. A Lyapunov-based strategy for closed loop control is
   used in hardware-in-the loop experiments to successfully demonstrate the
   full six-degree-of-freedom system's capabilities. In particular, the
   test case shows a two-phase regulation experiment, commanding both
   position and attitude to reach specified final state vectors. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This work describes the hydrographic conditions found in Puyuhuapi
   Channel (northern Chilean Patagonia) during recent years on a seasonal
   scale. Puyuhuapi Channel was once a glacial valley, but the retreating
   ice allowed the inflow of marine waters. Five surveys were conducted
   between 2008 and 2012; historical data from 1995 to 2007 were included.
   A meteorological/oceanographic buoy was also installed in the northern
   section of Puyuhuapi Channel and was operational beginning on April
   12th, 2011. Puyuhuapi Channel's surface characteristics highlight a
   fresher northern part and a more haline southern part except during
   winter when the pattern can reverse due to the intrusion of oceanic
   water via Jacaf Channel. The channel exhibits a highly variable
   meridional and seasonal vertical stratification, especially in its
   northern part where during spring and summer the water column is highly
   stratified but partially mixed during winter. Puyuhuapi Channel is the
   only fjord/channel with severe hypoxic conditions in all of Chilean
   Patagonia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{A, SI}},
Pages = {{19-34}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The fjords of central Chilean Patagonia (47 degrees S) receive fresh
   water from both precipitation and the Baker River. This buoyancy input
   generates a two layer hydrographic system characterized by strong
   salinity stratification (similar to 30 g kg(-1) over a depth range of
   7-15 m), which favors baroclinic conditions in the fjord. Hourly current
   velocity profiles were collected with an acoustic Doppler current
   profiler (ADCP) moored at a depth of 40 m during March-April 2009, and
   complemented by 11 CTD profiles and hourly sea level time series. These
   data allowed the detection of semidiurnal internal tidal waves for the
   first time in this region. Wavelength and horizontal phase speeds were
   determined by the dynamical mode 1 for internal waves. Maximum
   wavelength was 52 km, travelling at a horizontal phase speed of similar
   to 1.16 m s(-1). Wavelet, spectral and empirical orthogonal function
   (EOF) analysis techniques applied to the echo anomaly signal and to the
   baroclinic velocity showed largest semidiumal amplitudes near the
   pycnocline. Out of three modes obtained from the EOF analysis, two modes
   displayed a two- or three-layer flow structure with flow direction
   reversing at the pycnocline. The semidiurnal internal waves were found
   as fluctuations near the pycnocline in sporadic packets correlated to
   high discharge pulses of the Baker River (r(2) = 0.77). Additionally,
   internal Froude number calculations at the mouth of the Baker River
   indicated critical flow conditions, which allowed for generation of
   internal waves at the plume front. These waves are separated from the
   river plume after internal wave phase speeds surpassed frontal speeds.
   This suggests that the internal waves were modulated by pulses in high
   river discharge rather than the interaction of barotropic tide with
   bathymetry (a sill). An implication of these internal waves would be to
   increase vertical mixing of nutrients toward the surface, through shear
   instabilities, which would favor primary production. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Double-diffusive layering and mixing in Patagonian fjords}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{A, SI}},
Pages = {{35-49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Double-diffusive layering was quantified for the first time in the
   Chilean Patagonian fjords region (41.5-56 degrees S). Approximately 600
   temperature and salinity profiles collected during 1995-2012 were used
   to study water masses, quantify diffusive layering and compute the
   vertical diffusivity of heat. Development of ``diffusive-layering{''} or
   simply ``layering{''} was favored by relatively fresh-cold waters
   overlying salty-warm waters. Fresh waters are frequently derived from
   glacial melting that influences the fjord either directly or through
   rivers. Salty waters are associated with Modified Subantarctic (MSAAW)
   and Subantarctic Water (SAAW). Double-diffusive convection occurred as
   layering in 40\% of the year-round data and as salt fingering in <1\% of
   the time. The most vigorous layering, was found at depths between 20 and
   70 m, as quantified by (a) Turner angles, (b) density ratios, and (c)
   heat diffusivity (with maximum values of 5 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1)).
   Diffusive-layering events presented a meridional gradient with less
   layering within the 41-47 degrees S northern region, relative to the
   southern region between 47 degrees and 56 degrees S. Layering occupied,
   on average, 27\% and 56\% of the water column in the northern and
   southern regions, respectively. Thermohaline staircases were detected
   with microprofile measurements in Martinez and Baker channels (48
   degrees S), showing homogeneous layers (2-4 m thick) below the
   pycnocline (10-40 m). Also in this area, increased vertical mixing
   coincided with the increased layering events. High values of Thorpe
   scale (L-T similar to 7 m), dissipation rate of TKE (epsilon
   =10(-5)-10(-3) W kg(-1)) and diapycnal eddy diffusivity (K-rho =
   10(-6)-10(-3) m(-2) s(-1)) were associated with diffusive layering.
   Implications of these results are that diffusive layering should be
   taken into account, together with other mixing processes such as shear
   instabilities and wind-driven flows, in biological and geochemical
   studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the morphodynamics of river-influenced barrier basins
   numerically, with a particular emphasis on the effects of landscape and
   hydrodynamic settings. The simulated morphologies are qualitatively
   comparable to natural systems (e.g., tidal inlets along the East Coast
   of the USA). Model results suggest that the basin morphology is governed
   by the relative importance of tidal and fluvial forcing which is
   reflected, to the first-order approximation, in the ratio (r(Q)) between
   the mean tidal and river discharge. In agreement with empirical
   knowledge, the model indicates that riverine influence can be neglected
   when r(Q) is larger than 20. On the other hand, the river may dominate
   when r(Q) is smaller than 5. Pronounced differences in morphodynamic
   evolution are observed for different landscape settings (i.e., initial
   basin bathymetries and river inflow locations), indicating their
   fundamental importance in governing the evolution of barrier basins.
   Model results also show that the addition of a river tends to compensate
   the flood dominance in the tidal basin. Overall, the river flow has
   limited influence on the volumetric change of tidal flats, while it
   plays a more important role in determining the depth of the tidal
   channels and the size of the ebb delta. The riverine sediment source
   appears to be more important in shaping the basin morphology when the
   fluvial forcing is stronger. Finally, we show that the presence of a
   large river in a tidal inlet system influences the performance of the
   widely adopted relation between tidal prism and inlet cross-sectional
   area.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, zerovalent iron (ZVI)-biochar composite (BBCF) was used to
   remove and reclaim silver ions from aqueous solution. Sorption
   experimental data showed that BBCF quickly and efficiently removed Ag+
   from aqueous solutions with a capacity greater than 600 mg/g. The strong
   sorption of silver on BBCF was mainly controlled by a reduction
   mechanism between the ZVI and Ag+, which was confirmed by the
   characterization of the post-sorption sorbent (BBCF-Ag). The
   characterization results also showed that the sorbed silver on biochar
   surfaces were nanoparticles with an average size of 28 nm. As a result,
   the BBCF-Ag showed strong antimicrobial ability and effectively
   inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), while the original
   BBCF without silver nanoparticle promoted their growth. These findings
   suggest that, not only can biochar-supported ZVI be used to remove
   silver ions from aqueous solutions, but the products formed represent a
   new value-added nanocomposite. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic computation methods (ECMs) have been widely used in
   analyzing lightning electromagnetic pulses (LEMPs) and lightning-caused
   surges in various systems. One of the advantages of ECMs, in comparison
   with circuit simulation methods, is that they allow a self-consistent
   full-wave solution for both the transient current distribution in a 3-D
   conductor system and resultant electromagnetic fields, although they are
   computationally expensive. Among ECMs, the finite-difference time-domain
   (FDTD) method for solving Maxwell's equations has been most frequently
   used in LEMP and surge simulations. In this paper, we review
   applications of the FDTD method to LEMP and surge simulations, including
   1) lightning electromagnetic fields at close and far distances, 2)
   lightning surges on overhead power transmission line conductors and
   towers, 3) lightning surges on overhead distribution and
   telecommunication lines, 4) lightning electromagnetic environment in
   power substations, 5) lightning surges in wind-turbine-generator towers,
   6) lightning surges in photovoltaic (PV) arrays, 7) lightning
   electromagnetic environment in electric vehicles (EVs), 8) lightning
   electromagnetic environment in airborne vehicles, 9) lightning surges

Abstract = {{The leader progression model (LPM) is a tool for estimating the

   describing the movement of upward and downward leaders are obtained,
   starting with differential equations. Based on the trajectory equations,
   the average electric field between the upward and downward leader tips
   is represented with a comprehensive nonlinear equation. The final strike

   proposed method effectively mitigates the large computation time problem

Abstract = {{Introduced species can often cause negative environmental and economic
   effects, but also offer opportunities to study the rate of range
   expansion from localized population centers. The green mussel, Perna
   viridis, was introduced to the waters of the Caribbean and Florida from
   the Indo-Pacific and remains relatively isolated in portions of
   northeastern Florida. The present study aimed at identifying the factors
   that influence the spatial and temporal patterns of green mussel larval
   settlement throughout the Intracoastal Waterway (ION) of northeastern
   Florida, and to estimate dispersal distance using both field
   observations and a hydrographic model. Green mussel spat were collected
   from sites within the ICW on a monthly basis for much of 2007, 2008 and
   2010 and a particle tracking model was used to predict larval movement
   during observed settlement periods from 2007. Settlement typically
   occurred during the summer months and was correlated to water
   temperature but not salinity or chlorophyll a concentration. Habitat
   also significantly influenced settlement patterns since most of the
   settlement occurred within the main channel of the ICW and not in
   adjacent feeder creeks. Observed settlement patterns suggested that most
   green mussel larvae likely dispersed 10 km or less but some were
   collected a minimum of 18 km from a potential source population. Model
   projections suggested that dispersal distance could often exceed 100 km
   but most of the particles dispersed along the coast as opposed to
   remaining within the ICW making comparisons between the model results
   and the observed settlement patterns difficult (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The macroscopic properties of two-dimensional random periodic packs of
   polydisperse cylinders are investigated by means of numerical methods.
   We solve the unsteady, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on a
   staggered Cartesian grid and use the immersed boundary method to treat
   internal flow boundaries. The effects of porosity, polydispersity, and
   Reynolds numbers on the macroscopic permeability are studied. For small
   Reynolds numbers, we show that the permeability can be correlated to the
   underlying microstructure by means of a suitably defined statistical
   descriptor, the mean shortest Delaunay edge. With proper scaling, the
   results for polydisperse cylinders collapse onto the data for
   monodisperse cylinders, which can then be fitted with a universal curve.
   We also carry out a statistical analysis of the permeability computed
   for 500 samples and show that rare events, where the permeability lies
   outside the mean plus/minus three times the standard deviation, are
   possible. Finally, for larger Reynolds numbers, we show that a modified
   Forchheimer equation can characterize the flow. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Online social networks (OSNs) have become one of the most effective
   channels for marketing and advertising. Since users are often influenced
   by their friends, ``word-of-mouth{''} exchanges, so-called viral
   marketing, in social networks can be used to increase product adoption
   or widely spread content over the network. The common perception of
   viral marketing about being cheap, easy, and massively effective makes
   it an ideal replacement of traditional advertising. However, recent
   studies have revealed that the propagation often fades quickly within
   only few hops from the sources, counteracting the assumption on the
   self-perpetuating of influence considered in literature. With only
   limited influence propagation, is massively reaching customers via viral
   marketing still affordable? How do we economically spend more resources
   to increase the spreading speed? We investigate the cost-effective
   massive viral marketing problem, taking into the consideration the
   limited influence propagation. Both analytical analysis based on
   power-law network theory and numerical analysis demonstrate that the
   viral marketing might involve costly seeding. To minimize the seeding
   cost, we provide mathematical programming to find optimal seeding for
   medium-size networks and propose VirAds, an efficient algorithm, to
   tackle the problem on large-scale networks. VirAds guarantees a relative
   error bound of O(1) from the optimal solutions in power-law networks and
   outperforms the greedy heuristics that realizes on the degree
   centrality. Moreover, we also show that, in general, approximating the
   optimal seeding within a ratio better than O(log n) is unlikely

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and thermoacoustic imaging (TAI) are two
   emerging biomedical imaging techniques that both utilize ultrasonic
   signals as an information carrier. Unique advantages of PAI and TAI are
   their abilities to provide high resolution functional information such
   as hemoglobin and blood oxygenation and tissue dielectric properties
   relevant to physiology and pathology. These two methods, however, may
   have a limited detection depth and lack of endogenous contrast. An
   exogenous contrast agent is often needed to effectively resolve these
   problems. Such agents are able to greatly enhance the imaging contrast
   and potentially break through the imaging depth limit. Furthermore, a
   receptor-targeted contrast agent could trace the molecular and cellular
   biological processes in tissues. Thus, photoacoustic and thermoacoustic
   molecular imaging can be outstanding tools for early diagnosis, precise
   lesion localization, and molecular typing of various diseases. The
   agents also could be used for therapy in conjugation with drugs or in
   photothermal therapy, where it functions as an enhancer for the
   integration of diagnosis and therapy. In this article, we present a
   detailed review about various exogenous contrast agents for
   photoacoustic and thermoacoustic molecular imaging. In addition,
   challenges and future directions of photoacoustic and thermoacoustic
   molecular imaging in the field of translational medicine are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Patterned landscapes are often evidence of biotic control on geomorphic
   processes, emerging in response to coupled ecosystem processes acting at
   different spatial scales. Self-reinforcing processes at local scales
   expand patches, while self-inhibiting processes, operating at a
   distance, impose limits to expansion. In Big Cypress National Preserve
   (BICY) in southwest Florida, isolated forested wetland depressions
   (cypress domes) appear to be evenly distributed within a mosaic of
   short-hydroperiod marshes and pine uplands. To test the hypothesis that
   the apparent patterning is regular, we characterized frequency
   distributions and spatial patterns of vegetation communities, surface
   and bedrock elevation, and soil properties (thickness and phosphorus
   content). Nearest neighbor distances indicate strongly significant
   wetland spatial overdispersion, and bedrock elevations exhibited
   periodic spatial autocorrelation; both observations are consistent with
   regular patterning. Bedrock elevations and soil P were clearly bimodal,
   suggesting strong positive feedbacks on wetland patch development.
   Soil-surface elevations exhibited weaker bimodality, indicating
   smoothing of surface morphology by some combination of sediment
   transport, mineral reprecipitation, and organic matter production.
   Significant negative autocorrelation of bedrock elevations at scales
   similar to wetland spacing suggest the presence of distal negative
   feedbacks on patch expansion. These findings support the inference of
   regular patterning, and are consistent with the presence of local
   positive feedbacks among hydroperiod, vegetation productivity and
   bedrock dissolution. These processes are ultimately constrained by
   distal negative feedbacks, potentially induced by landscape scale
   limitations on the water volume required to enable this biogeomorphic
   mechanism. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Improved performance by texturing has become attractive in the field of
   lead-free ferroelectrics, but the effect depends heavily on the degree
   of texture, type of preferred orientation, and whether the material is a
   rotator or extender ferroelectric. Here, we report on successful
   texturing of K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN) ceramics by alignment of needlelike KNN
   templates in a matrix of KNN powder using tape casting. Homotemplated
   grain growth of the needles was confirmed during sintering, resulting in
   a high degree of texture parallel to the tape casting direction (TCD)
   and the aligned needles. The texture significantly improved the
   piezoelectric response parallel to the tape cast direction,
   corresponding to the direction of the strongest < 001 >(pc) orientation,
   while the response normal to the tape cast plane was lower than for a
   nontextured KNN. In situ X-ray diffraction during electric field
   application revealed that non-180 degrees domain reorientation was
   enhanced by an order of magnitude in the TCD, compared to the direction
   normal to the tape cast plane and in the nontextured ceramic. The effect
   of texture in KNN is discussed with respect to possible rotator
   ferroelectric properties of KNN.}},

Title = {{Simulating water table response to proposed changes in surface water
   management in the C-111 agricultural basin of south Florida}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{185-200}},

Abstract = {{As part of an effort to restore the hydrology of Everglades National
   Park (ENP), incremental raises in canal stage are proposed along a major
   canal draining south Florida called C-111, which separates ENP from
   agricultural lands. The study purpose was to use monitoring and modeling
   to investigate the effect of the proposed incremental raises in canal
   stage on water table elevation in agricultural lands. The objectives
   were to: (1) develop a MODFLOW based model for simulating groundwater
   flow within the study area, (2) apply the developed model to determine
   if the proposed changes in canal stage result in significant changes in
   water table elevation, root zone saturation or groundwater flooding and
   (3) assess aquifer response to large rainfall events. Results indicate
   the developed model was able to reproduce measured water table elevation
   with an average Nash-Sutcliffe >0.9 and Root Mean Square Error <0.05 m.
   The model predicted that incremental raises in canal stage resulted in
   significant differences (p <0.05) in water table elevation. Increases in
   canal stage of 9 and 12 cm resulted in occasional root zone saturation
   of low elevation sites. The model was able to mimic the rise and fall of
   the water table pre and post Tropical Storm Isaac of August 2012. The
   model also predicted that lowering canal stage at least 48 h prior to
   large storm (>2 year return period storm), reduced water table intrusion
   into the root zone. We conclude that the impact of operational changes
   in canal stage management on root zone saturation and groundwater
   flooding depended on micro-topography within the field and depth of
   storm events. The findings of this study can be used in fine tuning
   canal stage operations to minimize root zone saturation and groundwater
   flooding of agricultural fields while maximizing environmental benefits
   through increased water flow in the natural wetland areas. This study
   also highlights the benefit of detailed field scale simulations. (C)

Abstract = {{Mixing in self-ignited supersonic combustors continues to be an
   important process that influences the performance and limitations for
   propulsion applications. A common approach for current generation
   combustors involves the employment of fuel-jet-injection schemes that
   enhance shear-layer mixing. These fuel jets issuing in a supersonic
   crossflow induce a bow shock coupled with an oblique shock causing total
   pressure losses and consequently reducing scramjet-combustor efficiency.
   This paper explores a novel approach for enhancing mixing using
   transverse active microjet-based actuators injecting in a supersonic
   backward-facing-step flow, while reducing pressure losses through
   weak-shock formation. Shear-layer mixing and flow features were
   characterized using particle image velocimetry and shadowgraph imaging.
   Relative comparisons were made with and without microjet actuation under
   nonreacting conditions. The main flow mechanisms attributed to enhancing
   mixing are explained. A triple-microjet-injection configuration, in the
   form of three microjet arrays supplied with different pressures, was
   investigated. The multiple-microjet-injection configuration formed a
   virtual ramp at the trailing edge of the backward-facing step that
   further enhanced mixing and increased the shear-layer thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Doppler radar has been used for small-scale displacement detection, e.g.
   respiration and heartbeat. The motion amplitude is less than half a
   carrier wavelength. In this letter, a novel Doppler radar technique is
   presented for accurate tracking of large-scale displacement of several
   carrier wavelengths, e.g., the water level variation. The DC-coupled
   architecture is used to ensure precise measurement of slow motions even
   with stationary moment. A novel signal processing approach is proposed
   to increase the demodulation linearity to deal with inconstant signal
   amplitude, dynamic dc offset and phase ambiguity in large-scale
   displacement tracking. Experiments have been carried out in the outdoor
   environment to monitor the relative water level position in a rain
   barrel when the water was pumped in or drained out. It is shown that the
   proposed technique can accurately gauge the relative water level
   variation of 3.5 wavelengths with mm accuracy.}},

Title = {{Characterization of ammonia gas release from concrete added with

Abstract = {{To characterize the release of ammonia (NH3) from ammoniated fly ash in
   concrete, laboratory experiments were carried out with concrete added
   with fly ash containing ammonium loading ranging from 65 to 3,200 mg NH4
   (+)/kg fly ash. A physical description of the NH3 release from concrete
   was given, and a quantitative diffusion model was developed. In the
   experiments, NH3 gas release lasted 5 days to 3 weeks. After the ammonia
   gas release rate gradually decreased to a non-detectable level, there
   was still 20 to 70 \% of ammonium retained in the concrete. Of all the
   NH3 gas released, over 80 \% was emitted in the first 8 h after the
   concrete was mixed. According to the physical and chemical condition of
   the concrete, NH3 release from concrete was divided into three periods:
   mixing, initial settling, and curing. Mechanics of NH3 release in the
   three periods were quantitatively analyzed for the first time.
   Convective mass transfer caused by air movement dominated NH3 release in
   the first two periods. In the curing period, due to decreased moisture
   content and filled capillaries in the concrete, diffusion of NH3 from
   inside of concrete to its surface became the rate-limiting factor.
   Diffusivity of the mixing period and the initial settling period was 9.1
   x 10(-8) (+/- 1.25 x 10(-7)) and 3.93 x 10(-9) (+/- 2.78 x 10(-9))
   m(2)/s, respectively. In the curing period, NH3 diffusivity in the
   concrete continuously decreased, ranging from 5.36 x 10(-9) m(2)/s to
   below detection limit in 3 weeks. The difference in diffusivity among
   different periods reflected the physical and chemical change of the
   concrete.}},

Abstract = {{Fission products, such as krypton (Kr), are known to be insoluble within
   UO2, segregating toward grain boundaries and eventually leading to a
   lowering in thermal conductivity and fuel swelling. Recent computational
   studies have identified that differences in grain boundary structure
   have a significant effect on the segregation behavior of fission
   products. However, experimental work supporting these simulations is
   lacking. Atom probe tomography was used to measure the Kr distribution
   across grain boundaries in UO2. Polycrystalline depleted UO2 samples
   were irradiated with 0.7 MeV and 1.8 MeV Kr-ions and annealed to 1000
   degrees C, 1300 degrees C, and 1600 degrees C for 1 h to produce a
   Kr-bubble dominated microstructure. The results of this work indicate a
   strong dependence of Kr concentration as a function of grain boundary
   structure. Temperature also influences grain boundary chemistry with
   greater Kr concentration evident at higher temperatures, resulting in a
   reduced Kr concentration in the bulk. Although Kr segregation takes
   place at elevated temperatures, no change in grain size or texture was
   observed in the irradiated UO2 samples.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Supplemental irrigation is often required to maintain residential
   landscapes in Florida, but existing and projected water shortages have
   led to an increased focus on reducing the amount of publically supplied
   potable water used for irrigation. Florida-Friendly Landscaping (FFL)
   has been promoted as a method to reduce irrigation, but the actual water
   savings has not been previously quantified. Analysis of monthly combined
   (indoor and outdoor) potable water billing records and parcel data for
   125 FFL and 736 traditionally landscaped comparison homes in southwest
   Florida indicated that FFL homes used 50\% less irrigation. Irrigation
   savings increased to 76\% when considering only good examples of FFL and
   comparison landscapes with high-quality turfgrass. The FFL customers
   reduced their irrigation use (279 mm/year) after their landscapes became
   recognized (202 mm/year). Prior to recognition, these customers were
   already using less irrigation than their neighbors (279 versus 464
   mm/year, respectively), indicating that those most concerned with water
   use were more likely to choose Florida-Friendly Landscaping. The results
   of this study demonstrate the ability of alternative landscapes in a
   hot, humid climate to conserve potable water used for irrigation;
   however, mechanisms for irrigation reduction in these landscapes are
   still unknown.(C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been interest in applying statistical process
   monitoring methods to processes controlled with feedback controllers in
   order to eliminate assignable causes and achieve reduced overall

   monitor processes regulated with proportional-integral controllers. The
   approach is based on fitting an exponential rise model to the control
   input actions in response to a step shift and employs a change-point
   method to detect the change. Simulation studies show that the proposed
   method has better run-length performance in detecting step shifts in
   controlled processes than Shewhart chart on individuals and
   special-cause chart on residuals of time series model. Copyright (c)

   population balance model with selection and breakage distribution
   functions that have been related to a minimal number of mill-dependent

   to determine the mill-dependent parameters for a specific mill, by
   milling a base powder at multiple operating conditions. Powder-dependent
   parameters can be determined from either mill experiments or from
   material characterization measurements that require small amounts of
   powder (presented in Part 2). Ultimately, the milling model presented
   successfully predicts the product particle size using as inputs the feed
   particle-size distribution and mill operating conditions. Three
   crystalline powders, sodium bicarbonate, lactose monohydrate, and
   sucrose, have been used to test the proposed milling model. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Cerebral aneurysms are thought to develop at locations of hemodynamic
   shear stress, via an inflammatory process. The molecular mechanism that
   links shear stress to inflammation, however, is not completely
   understood. Progress in studying this disease is limited by a lack of a
   suitable in vitro model. To address this, we designed novel in vitro
   parallel-plate flow chamber models of a straight artery, a bifurcation,
   and a bifurcation aneurysm. We compared endothelial cell phenotypes
   across the 3 different models and among microenvironments within each
   flow model by cytokine array, ELISA, and relative immunofluorescence.
   Human aneurysms express interleukin-8 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand
   1 (CXCL1), whereas normal arteries do not. The bifurcation aneurysm
   model showed significantly higher interleukin-8 and CXCL1 levels than
   both the straight artery and bifurcation models. Within the bifurcation
   and bifurcation aneurysm models, endothelial cells near the bifurcation
   or within the aneurysm sac microenvironments have significantly higher
   expression of CXCL1, and interleukin-8 and CXCL1, respectively, than at
   the straight proximal segment or the limbs of the bifurcation. Murine
   aneurysms express CXCL1, and it is the primary ELR+ CXC chemokine
   expressed, whereas normal arteries do not. CXCL1 antibody blockade
   results in significantly fewer murine aneurysms (13.3 versus 66.7\%;
   P=0.0078), decreased neutrophil infiltration, and vascular cell adhesion
   molecule 1 expression than an immunoglobulin G control. We successfully
   designed and validated a novel hemodynamic model of cerebral aneurysms
   in vitro. We also show that shear stress-induced CXCL1 plays a critical
   role in cerebral aneurysm formation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe two related algorithms that provide both
   rigid and non-rigid point set registration with different computational
   complexity and accuracy. The first algorithm utilizes a nonlinear
   similarity measure known as correntropy. The measure combines second and
   high order moments in its decision statistic showing improvements
   especially in the presence of impulsive noise. The algorithm assumes
   that the correspondence between the point sets is known, which is
   determined with the surprise metric. The second algorithm mitigates the
   need to establish a correspondence by representing the point sets as
   probability density functions (PDF). The registration problem is then
   treated as a distribution alignment. The method utilizes the
   Cauchy-Schwarz divergence to measure the similarity/distance between the
   point sets and recover the spatial transformation function needed to
   register them. Both algorithms utilize information theoretic
   descriptors; however, correntropy works at the realizations level,
   whereas Cauchy-Schwarz divergence works at the PDF level. This allows
   correntropy to be less computationally expensive, and for correct
   correspondence, more accurate. The two algorithms are robust against
   noise and outliers and perform well under varying levels of distortion.
   They outperform several well-known and state-of-the-art methods for
   point set registration.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies with granular bed filters composed of sized
   metallic granules have demonstrated their use in aerosol filtration.
   However, the effectiveness of metallic membrane filters against
   bioaerosols has not been established. In this work, the filtration
   efficiency and filter quality of these filters against airborne B.
   subtilis endospore and MS2 virus were determined as a function of face
   velocity and loading time. In experiments, a physical removal efficiency
   greater than 99.9\% and a viable removal efficiency greater than
   99.999\% were observed for both bacterial spore and viral aerosols. A
   lower face velocity produced both higher collection efficiency and
   filter quality for virus but was not a statistically significant factor
   for spore filtration. Although the filter had high filtration efficiency
   of the test bioaerosols, its high pressure drop resulted in a low filter
   quality (0.25-0.75kPa-1). Overall, filters with micrometer-sized
   collectors capture bioaerosols effectively but their applications in
   aerosol filtration may be limited by their high pressure drop.}},

Abstract = {{Graph coloring is an important tool in the study of optimization,

   this paper, we consider one important coloring, vertex coloring of a
   total graph, which is familiar to us by the name of ``total
   coloring{''}. Total coloring is a coloring of V boolean OR Esuch that no
   two adjacent or incident elements receive the same color. In other
   words, total chromatic number of G is the minimum number of disjoint
   vertex independent sets covering a total graph of G. Here, let be a
   planar graph with Delta >= 8. We proved that if for every vertex v is an
   element of V, there exists two integers iv, jv is an element of \{3, 4,
   5, 6, 7, 8\} such that is not incident with intersecting i(v)-cycles and
   j(v)-cycles, then the vertex chromatic number of total graph of is Delta
   + 1, i.e., the total chromatic number of G is Delta + 1.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new adhesive strength test (AST) was developed to determine the
   adhesive strength of joint sealant. A series of sealant thicknesses,
   displacement rates, and curing times was tested to determine proper AST
   testing parameters using self-leveling (SL) and non-self-leveling (NS)
   silicone sealants. A series of tests was conducted under varying
   moisture conditions. The results appeared to indicate that moisture may
   reduce adhesive strength. Drying-time tests were conducted to determine
   the approximate appropriate wait time between joint washing and sealant
   installation for 3.2mm (1/8in.) and 9.5mm (3/8in.) joints. A series of
   tests was also conducted on artificially aged sealants, which appeared
   to indicate that oven aging reduces adhesive strength for SL sealant.
   Non-self-leveling sealant, on the other hand, appeared to be largely
   unaffected by oven aging. Hot-water aging and freeze-thaw aging appeared
   to reduce adhesive strengths for both sealant mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) is universally regarded as a brilliant
   polymath, designer, astronomer, artist, philosopher, and a visionary
   engineer of the Renaissance era. Interestingly, due to the delayed
   discovery of several caches of his notebook pages (as late as the
   1960s), his immense contribution to the field of tribology has only
   recently surfaced. From these salvaged documents, da Vinci's three
   notable observations that preceded the development of the laws of
   friction were uncovered: (1) Friction is independent of apparent contact
   area, (2) the resistance of friction is directly proportional to applied
   load, and (3) friction has a consistent value of A mu = 0.25. In this
   work, we have attempted to construct a nearly faithful recreation of
   Leonardo da Vinci's apparatus for measuring friction based on his
   notebook illustrations and investigate the conditions under which
   Leonardo da Vinci's experiments produced his findings. Our experiments,
   performed roughly 500 years later, reproduced Leonardo da Vinci's
   findings of friction coefficients with wood of A mu = 0.25, but only
   under conditions of roughly cut and brusquely squared samples of dry
   wood that were handled and sullied by hand in a fashion typical of wood
   working but inconsistent with the modern laboratory practice. Thus, our
   interpretation of Leonardo da Vinci's findings is that these first
   tribological studies were actually performed on roughly cut and
   unpolished samples that had been handled extensively prior to and during
   testing; Such a procedure of sample preparation is entirely reasonable
   for the time period and suggests an active, dusty, and dynamic
   laboratory environment.}},

   instant messaging, file sharing, and advertisement broadcast, etc. In
   real life, for various kinds of time-insensitive contents, such as
   family photos and video clips, the process of content dissemination
   forms a delay tolerant networks (DTNs). To improve the data forwarding
   performance in DTNs, several social-based approaches have been proposed,
   most of which leverage mobile users' social information, including
   contact history, moving trajectory, and personal profiles as metrics to
   design routing schemes. However, although the social-based approaches
   provide better performance, the revealing of mobile users' information
   apparently compromises their privacy. Moreover, users' contents may only
   be shared with a particular group of users rather everyone in the
   system. In this paper, we propose the PSaD: a Privacy-preserving
   Social-assisted content Dissemination scheme in DTNs. We apply users'
   verifiable attributes to establish their social relationships in terms
   of identical attributes in a privacy-preserving way. Besides, to provide
   the confidentiality of contents, our approach enables users to encrypt
   contents before the dissemination process, and only allows users who
   have particular attributes to decrypt them. By trace-driven simulations
   and experiments, we show the performance, privacy preservation, and
   efficiency of our proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Organ printing, among different tissue engineering innovations, is a
   freeform fabrication approach for making three-dimensional (3D) tissue
   and organ constructs using cellular spheroids or bioinks as building
   blocks. The capability to fabricate vascular-like tubular constructs is
   an important indicator of the overall feasibility of envisioned organ
   printing technology. In this study, vascular-like alginate tubes, which
   mimic typical vascular constructs, are fabricated both vertically and
   horizontally using drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjetting.
   Manufacturing-related challenges are different for the vertical and
   horizontal printing configurations. In general, the vertical printing
   configuration has instability or collapse/buckling problems and may
   experience some difficulty in fabricating complex constructs such as Y-
   or K-shaped constructs if there is no supporting material. The
   horizontal printing configuration may easily result in a deformed hollow
   cross section and may require extra effort to mitigate the undesired
   deformation. It is envisioned that the combination of vertical and
   horizontal printing provides an efficient and effective way to fabricate
   complex tubular constructs with both vertical and horizontal branching
   features.}},

   with data on building area, number of employees, and annual sales as
   measures of size that can be used to develop water use benchmarks.
   Additionally, this methodology allows coefficients for water use per

Title = {{Investigating the blending of reclaimed asphalt with virgin materials

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The nature of blending of virgin materials with reclaimed asphalt
   pavement (RAP) has been investigated using a multi scale approach using
   the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), electron microscopy and computer
   tomography (CT). In order to simplify the visualization of the blending
   of the virgin and reclaimed materials five specially engineered hot
   asphalt mixtures were produced incorporating large mineral fraction
   (8/11 mm) of virgin aggregates and small fraction (2/4 mm) from RAP
   mixed with virgin bitumen. The complex modulus and phase angle of
   reclaimed binder from the blended mixtures were found to be between that
   of RAP and virgin binder. The CT slices of compacted cylindrical samples
   (150 mm diameter x 120 mm height) could incorporate the effect of
   compaction on the blending. They show lumped regions with virgin large
   aggregates as well as lumped regions of RAP aggregates. Using micro CT
   the spatial distribution of the different binders was investigated at
   the micro-scale. Millimeter size distinct clusters of virgin binder and
   clusters of RAP binder could be distinguished. The existence of RAP
   binder next to large virgin aggregates indicated the migration of the
   old RAP binder from the RAP aggregates to the virgin aggregates. From
   these CT images, it was not possible to verify if blending between the
   virgin and old binders occurred. Using electron microscopy micro-crack
   formations in the zone between old and new binder were identified
   suggesting weak spots that could lead to larger crack formation and
   propagation. However, using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy good
   qualitative distribution of titanium dioxide tracer in the virgin binder
   in the mixture could be seen, indicating good blending at the
   investigated location. Hence, the results show that blending is not
   homogeneous throughout the sample. Some locations show good blending
   whereas other locations appear non-blended with micro-cracks forming at
   the binder boundaries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Filtration and transport of heavy metals in graphene oxide enabled sand
   columns}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{257}},
Pages = {{248-252}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A fixed-bed sand column with graphene oxide (GO) layer was used to
   remove heavy metals (Cu(II) and Pb(II)) from an aqueous solution
   injected under steady flow. Due to the time constrained kinetic process
   of heavy metal sorption to GO, removal efficiency was affected by the
   injection flow rate. When injection flow rate changed from 1 to 5 mL
   min(-1), the removal efficiency of the two metals decreased from 15.3\%
   to 10.3\% and from 26.7\% to 19.0\% for Cu(II) and Pb(II), respectively.
   Provided a fixed concentration of heavy metals in the injected flow, an
   increase in GO in column from 10 to 30 mg resulted in an sharp increase
   in the removal efficiency of Pb(II) from 26.7\% to 40.5\%. When Cu(II)
   and Pb(II) were applied simultaneously, the removal efficiency of the
   two metals was lower than when applied by individually. GO-sand column
   performance was much better for the removal of Pb(II) than for Cu(II) in
   each corresponding treatment. When breakthrough curve (BTC) data were
   simulated by the convection-dispersion-reaction (CDER) model, the
   fittings for Cu in every treatment were better than that of Pb in
   corresponding treatment. Considering the small amount of GO used to
   enable the sand columns that resulted in a great increase in k value,
   compared to the GO-free sand columns, the authors propose GO as an
   effective adsorption media in filters and reactive barriers to remove
   Pb(II) from flowing water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of water treatment additives on lime softening residual trace
   chemical composition - Implications for disposal and reuse}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{240-248}},

Abstract = {{Drinking water treatment residues (WTR) offer potential benefits when
   recycled through land application. The current guidance in Florida, US
   allows for unrestricted land application of lime softening WTR; alum and
   ferric WTR require additional evaluation of total and leachable
   concentrations of select trace metals prior to land application. In some
   cases a mixed WTR is produced when lime softening is accompanied by the
   addition of a coagulant or other treatment chemical; applicability of
   the current guidance is unclear. The objective of this research was to
   characterize the total and leachable chemical content of WTR from
   Florida facilities that utilize multiple treatment chemicals. Lime and
   mixed lime WTR samples were collected from 18 water treatment facilities
   in Florida. Total and leachable concentrations of the WTR were measured.
   To assess the potential for disposal of mixed WTR as clean fill below
   the water table, leaching tests were conducted at multiple liquid to
   solid ratios and under reducing conditions. The results were compared to
   risk-based soil and groundwater contamination thresholds. Total metal
   concentrations of WTR were found to be below Florida soil contaminant
   thresholds with Fe found in the highest abundance at a concentration of
   3600 mg/kg-dry. Aluminum was the only element that exceeded the Florida
   groundwater contaminant thresholds using SPLP (95\% UCL = 0.23 mg/L;
   risk threshold = 0.2 mg/L). Tests under reducing conditions showed
   elevated concentrations of Fe and Mn, ranging from 1 to 3 orders of
   magnitude higher than SPLP leachates. Mixed lime WTR concentrations
   (total and leachable) were lower than the ferric and alum WTR
   concentrations, supporting that mixed WTR are appropriately represented
   as lime WTR. Testing of WTR under reducing conditions demonstrated the
   potential for release of certain trace metals (Fe, Al, Mn) above
   applicable regulatory thresholds; additional evaluation is needed to
   assess management options where reducing conditions may develop. (C)

Abstract = {{Organic solar cells have great potential as a clean and renewable solar
   energy conversion system, due to their low cost materials, ease of

   Harnessing the unique set of characteristics of organic solar cells,
   here we demonstrate a new form factor for organic solar cells, a ``solar
   tree{''} or an electricity-generating artificial tree with organic solar
   cells as leaves. We first fabricated polymer:fullerene based organic
   solar cells on flexible plastic substrates that show similar performance
   to devices on rigid glass substrates using the inverted device
   structure. Large-area flexible devices were fabricated and cut into palm
   leaf shapes with an active device area of 6.5 cm(2) using a steel rule
   die. 12 leaf-shaped organic solar cells were then assembled to form a
   prototype ``solar palm tree{''}. Two different wiring configurations
   among the devices provided different power delivery modes: a
   low-voltage, high-current ``fan mode{''} and a high voltage, low-current
   ``LED mode{''}. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a clique relaxation model based on the concept of relative
   vertex connectivity. It extends the classical definition of a
   k-vertex-connected subgraph by requiring that the minimum number of
   vertices whose removal results in a disconnected (or a trivial) graph is
   proportional to the size of this subgraph, rather than fixed at k.
   Consequently, we further generalize the proposed approach to require
   vertex-connectivity of a subgraph to be some function f of its size. We
   discuss connections of the proposed models with other clique relaxation
   ideas from the literature and demonstrate that our generalized
   framework, referred to as f-vertex-connectivity, encompasses other known
   vertex-connectivity-based models, such as s-bundle and k-block. We study
   related computational complexity issues and show that finding maximum
   subgraphs with relatively large vertex connectivity is NP-hard. An
   interesting special case that extends the R-robust 2-club model recently
   introduced in the literature, is also considered. In terms of solution
   techniques, we first develop general linear mixed integer programming
   (MIP) formulations. Then we describe an effective exact algorithm that
   iteratively solves a series of simpler MIPs, along with some
   enhancements, in order to obtain an optimal solution for the original
   problem. Finally, we perform computational experiments on several
   classes of random and real-life networks to demonstrate performance of
   the developed solution approaches and illustrate some properties of the
   proposed clique relaxation models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are gaining popularity as bactericidal
   agents in commercial products; however, the mechanisms of toxicity (MOT)
   of Ag NPs to other organisms are not fully understood. It is the goal of
   this research to determine differences in MOT induced by ionic Ag+ and
   Ag NPs in Daphnia magna, by incorporating a battery of traditional and
   novel methods. Daphnia embryos were exposed to sublethal concentrations
   of AgNO3 and Ag NPs (130-650 ng/L), with uptake of the latter confirmed
   by confocal reflectance microscopy. Mitochondrial function was
   non-invasively monitored by measuring proton flux using self-referencing
   microsensors. Proton flux measurements revealed that while both forms of
   silver significantly affected proton efflux, the change induced by Ag
   NPs was greater than that of Ag+. This could be correlated with the
   effects of Ag NPs on mitochondrial dysfunction, as determined by
   confocal fluorescence microscopy and JC-1, an indicator of mitochondrial
   permeability. However, Ag+ was more efficient than Ag NPs at displacing
   Na+ within embryonic Daphnia, based on inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis. The abnormalities in mitochondrial
   activity for Ag NP-exposed organisms suggest a nanoparticle-specific
   MOT, distinct from that induced by Ag ions. We propose that the MOT of
   each form of silver are complementary, and can act in synergy to produce
   a greater toxic response overall.}},

   Not only does particle shape affect how particles flow and deposit, the

Title = {{In vivo evaluation of needle force and friction stress during insertion
   at varying insertion speed into the brain}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{237}},
Pages = {{79-89}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Convection enhanced delivery (CED) infuses drugs directly
   into brain tissue. Needle insertion is required and results in tissue
   damage which can promote flowback along the needle track and improper
   targeting. The goal of this study was to evaluate friction stress
   (calculated from needle insertion force) as a measure of tissue contact
   and damage during needle insertion for varying insertion speeds.
   New method: Forces and surface dimpling during needle insertion were
   measured in rat brain in vivo. Needle retraction forces were used to
   calculate friction stresses. These measures were compared to track
   damage from a previous study. Differences between brain tissues and soft
   hydrogels were evaluated for varying insertion speeds: 0.2, 2, and 10
   mm/s.
   Results: In brain tissue, average insertion force and surface dimpling
   increased with increasing insertion speed. Average friction stress along
   the needle-tissue interface decreased with insertion speed (from 0.58
   +/- 0.27 to 0.16 +/- 0.08 kPa). Friction stress varied between brain
   regions: cortex (0.227 +/- 0.27 kPa), external capsule (0.222 +/- 0.19
   kPa), and CPu (0.383 +/- 0.30 kPa). Hydrogels exhibited opposite trends
   for dimpling and friction stress with insertion speed.
   Comparison with existing methods: Previously, increasing needle damage
   with insertion speed has been measured with histological methods.
   Friction stress appears to decrease with increasing tissue damage and
   decreasing tissue contact, providing the potential for in vivo and real
   time evaluation along the needle track.
   Conclusion: Force derived friction stress decreased with increasing
   insertion speed and was smaller within white matter regions. Hydrogels
   exhibited opposite trends to brain tissue. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The eddy covariance (EC) method was used in a 30-month study to quantify
   evapotranspiration (ET) and vegetation coefficient (K-CW) for a wetland
   on a ranch in subtropical south Florida. To evaluate the errors in ET
   estimates, the EC-based ET (ETC-EC) and the Food and Agricultural
   Organization (FAO) Penman-Monteith (PM) based ET (ETC-PM) estimates
   (with literature crop coefficient, K-C) were compared with each other.
   The ETC-EC and FAO-PM reference ET were used to develop K-CW. Regression
   models were developed to estimate K-CW using climatic and hydrologic
   variables. Annual and daily ETC-EC values were 1152 and 3.27mm,
   respectively. The FAO-PM model underestimated ET by 25\% with ETC-EC
   being statistically higher than ETC-PM. The K-CW varied from 0.79
   (December) to 1.06 (November). The mean K-CW for the dry
   (November-April) season (0.95) was much higher than values reported for
   wetlands in literature; whereas for the wet (May-October) season, K-CW
   (0.97) was closer to literature values. Higher than expected K-CW values
   during the dry season were due to higher temperature, lower humidity and
   perennial wetland vegetation. Regression analyses showed that factors
   affecting the K-CW were different during the dry (soil moisture,
   temperature and relative humidity) and wet (net radiation, inundation
   and wind speed) seasons. Separate regression models for the dry and wet
   seasons were developed. Evapotranspiration and K-CW from this study, one
   of the first for the agricultural wetlands in subtropical environment,
   will help improve the ET estimates for similar wetlands. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Large-scale climate can provide predictive information for streamflow
   forecasts in many parts of the world. However, the optimal selection of
   predictors can be problematic when focusing on a localized region. This
   work evaluated multiple gridded climate datasets in order to determine
   optimal predictors of seasonal streamflow in West-Central Florida. Using
   persistence in streamflow, existing indices of climate, and sea surface
   temperature (SST) expansion coefficient time-series from singular value
   decomposition (SVD) analysis, this work developed probability of
   exceedance streamflow forecasts for multiple stations, seasons, and
   lead-times. Forecasts were found to be generally skillful between the
   September-November and April-June seasons with this range narrowing as
   lead time increased and skill was mainly related to the impact of the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the region. Using multiple indices
   of ENSO that were determined by correlation and composite analyses to
   track its evolution from the west Pacific at long lead-times to the east
   Pacific at short lead-times was not found to appreciably improve
   forecasts over using the Nino 3.4 index alone. Using SST expansion
   coefficient time-series from SVD analysis was found to capture the
   evolution of ENSO from west to east and to provide skillful forecasts of
   streamflow at earlier leads (up to 7 months in advance) compared to that
   found by pre-defined indices, indicating the importance of predictor
   selection in achieving optimal forecast skill. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This study demonstrated the first application of a GSA technique to a
   transient ISSHM-LSM application developed for a large-scale river basin.
   The Morris method was used to identify the spatially and temporally
   variable sensitivity amongst a large number of model parameters to
   provide insights on hydrologic processes dominating behavior in the
   basin and to identify a small subset of parameters that should be
   evaluated in subsequent, more computationally intensive quantitative GSA
   and parameter estimation techniques. Results showed that in the upper
   region of the basin, evapotranspiration (ET), total streamflow and peak
   streamflow were less sensitive to surficial aquifer system
   characteristics, but highly sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity of
   the confining unit separating the surficial aquifer and the regional
   aquifer system and leaf area index of near stream vegetation. In the
   lower region of the basin, hydraulic conductivity of the regional
   aquifer system was found to have a significant effect on ET, total
   stream flow, and groundwater contributions to streamflow while
   surface-groundwater dynamics during storm events was most sensitive to
   storage properties of the regional aquifer system. Peak streamflow in
   the lower basin was most sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity of the
   confining unit in the upper basin, and the Manning's coefficient of
   upper basin streams, indicating that all peak storm flows originate in
   the upper basin. Throughout the basin ET was sensitive to soil/geologic
   properties and vegetation properties, with unsaturated zone processes
   and relevant parameters gaining importance in moisture limited
   conditions existing in the lower regions of the basin. Published by

Abstract = {{Cortical reorganization following sensory deprivation is characterized
   by alterations in the connectivity between neurons encoding spared and
   deprived cortical inputs. The extent to which this alteration depends on
   Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), however, is largely unknown.
   We quantified changes in the functional connectivity between layer V
   neurons in the vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vSI) (barrel
   cortex) of rats following sensory deprivation. One week after chronic
   implantation of a microelectrode array in vSI, sensory-evoked activity
   resulting from mechanical deflections of individual whiskers was
   recorded (control data) after which two whiskers on the contralateral
   side were paired by sparing them while trimming all other whiskers on
   the rat's mystacial pad. The rats' environment was then enriched by
   placing novel objects in the cages to encourage exploratory behavior
   with the spared whiskers. Sensory-evoked activity in response to
   individual stimulation of spared whiskers and adjacent re-grown whiskers
   was then recorded under anesthesia 1-2 days and 6-7 days post-trimming
   (plasticity data). We analyzed spike trains within 100 ms of stimulus
   onset and confirmed previously published reports documenting changes in
   receptive field sizes in the spared whisker barrels. We analyzed the
   same data using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) to infer the functional
   connectivity between the recorded neurons. We found that DBNs inferred
   from population responses to stimulation of each of the spared whiskers
   exhibited graded increase in similarity that was proportional to the
   pairing duration. A significant early increase in network similarity in
   the spared-whisker barrels was detected 1-2 days post pairing, but not
   when single neuron responses were examined during the same period. These
   results suggest that rapid reorganization of cortical neurons following
   sensory deprivation may be mediated by an STDP mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in the fundamental understanding of alkane activation on oxide
   surfaces are essential for developing new catalysts that efficiently and
   selectively promote chemical transformations of alkanes. In this
   tutorial review, we discuss the current understanding of alkane
   activation on crystalline metal oxide surfaces, and focus mainly on
   summarizing our findings on alkane adsorption and C-H bond cleavage on
   the PdO(101) surface as determined from model ultrahigh vacuum
   experiments and theoretical calculations. These studies show that
   alkanes form strongly-bound sigma-complexes on PdO(101) by datively
   bonding with coordinatively-unsaturated Pd atoms and that these
   molecularly adsorbed species serve as precursors for C-H bond activation
   on the oxide surface. In addition to discussing the binding and
   properties of alkane sigma-complexes on PdO(101), we also summarize
   recent advances in kinetic models to predict alkane dissociation rates
   on solid surfaces. Lastly, we highlight computations which predict that
   the formation and facile C-H bond activation of alkane sigma-complexes
   also occurs on RuO2 and IrO2 surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The force interaction of an alpha-alumina particle against Teflon AF
   (TM) in the presence of several non-polar and polar solvents was
   quantified. Solvents were chosen based on calculation of a negative
   Hamaker constant, indicating a repulsive van der Waals interaction.
   These results were compared to those predicted by theoretical models for
   van der Waals forces. Measured forces for the non-polar solvent
   interactions are comparable to theoretical predictions, whereas the
   polar solvent interactions show repulsive forces between one and two
   orders of magnitude smaller than those predicted. In the case of water,
   surface charges were large enough to completely counteract the repulsive
   van der Waals forces and lead to an attractive force interaction. This
   minimization of repulsion, and even attraction, can be predicted by DLVO
   theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed investigation of the impact of molecular weight distribution

   carrier transport properties is reported. It is found that different
   batches of as-received polymers have substantial differences in their
   molecular weight distribution. As revealed by gel permeation
   chromatography (GPC), two peaks can generally be observed. One of the
   peaks corresponds to a high molecular weight component and the other
   peak corresponds to a low molecular weight component. Photovoltaic
   devices fabricated with a higher proportion of low molecular weight
   component have power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reduced from 5.7\%
   to 2.5\%. The corresponding charge carrier mobility at the short-circuit
   region is also significantly reduced from 2.7 x 10(-5) to 1.6 x 10(-8)
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The carrier transport properties of the polymers at
   various temperatures are further analyzed by the Gaussian disorder model
   (GDM). All polymers have similar energetic disorders. However, they
   appear to have significant differences in carrier hopping distances.
   This result provides insight into the origin of the molecular weight
   effect on carrier transport in polymeric semiconducting materials.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal wetlands occupy a delicate position at the intersection of fresh
   and saline waters. Changing climate and watershed hydrology can lead to
   saltwater intrusion into historically freshwater systems, causing plant
   mortality and loss of freshwater habitat. Understanding the hydrological
   functioning of tidally influenced floodplain forests is essential for
   advancing ecosystem protection and restoration goals, however finding
   direct relationships between hydrological inputs and floodplain
   hydrology is complicated by interactions between surface water,
   groundwater, and atmospheric fluxes in variably saturated soils with
   heterogeneous vegetation and topography. Thus, an alternative method for
   identifying common trends and causal factors is required. Dynamic factor
   analysis (DFA), a time series dimension reduction technique, models
   temporal variation in observed data as linear combinations of common
   trends, which represent unexplained common variability, and explanatory
   variables. DFA was applied to model shallow groundwater salinity in the
   forested floodplain wetlands of the Loxahatchee River (Florida, USA),
   where altered watershed hydrology has led to changing hydroperiod and
   salinity regimes and undesired vegetative changes. Long-term,
   high-resolution groundwater salinity datasets revealed dynamics over
   seasonal and yearly time periods as well as over tidal cycles and storm
   events. DFA identified shared trends among salinity time series and a
   full dynamic factor model simulated observed series well (overall
   coefficient of efficiency, C-eff = 0.85; 0.52 <= C-eff <= 0.99). A
   reduced multilinear model based solely on explanatory variables
   identified in the DFA had fair to good results (C-eff = 0.58; 038 <=
   C-eff <= 0.75) and may be used to assess the effects of restoration and
   management scenarios on shallow groundwater salinity in the Loxahatchee
   River floodplain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simplified analytical solutions, developed as source strength functions
   (SSFs), are capable of describing the temporal dissolution of nonaqueous

   from a flow cell consisting of three injection and four extraction wells
   to analytical dissolution models (power law model (PLM) and equilibrium
   streamtube model (EST)) at a trichloroethene (TCE) contaminated site,

   soil core collection, a recirculated partitioning tracer test, passive

   SSF parameters using information such as the TCE mass, distribution and
   porous media heterogeneity. The exponential decay model (a subset of the
   PLM) accurately predicted the enhanced dissolution, likely because the
   site was significantly aged (most of the mass in the plume rather than
   in the source zone) or middle stage, and the mass in the source zone
   could be approximately estimated. The EST tracer-based model, when
   combined with data from the recirculated partitioning tracer test, soil
   cores, and the push-pull tracer test, was capable of accurately
   predicting the observed aqueous dissolution. The mass in the source zone
   and the fraction of contaminated flowpaths were the most important site
   characteristics, requiring the greatest accuracy to predict aqueous
   dissolution. Establishing steady state dissolution was essential to
   provide a more accurate estimate of the fraction contaminated and high
   resolution data from soil cores in the source zone were needed to
   estimate the mass present. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale recurrent networks have drawn increasing attention recently
   because of their capabilities in modeling a large variety of real-world
   phenomena and physical mechanisms. This paper studies how to identify
   all authentic connections and estimate system parameters of a recurrent
   network, given a sequence of node observations. This task becomes
   extremely challenging in modern network applications, because the
   available observations are usually very noisy and limited, and the
   associated dynamical system is strongly nonlinear. By formulating the
   problem as multivariate sparse sigmoidal regression, we develop
   simple-to-implement network learning algorithms, with rigorous
   convergence guarantee in theory, for a variety of sparsity- promoting
   penalty forms. A quantile variant of progressive recurrent network
   screening is proposed for efficient computation and allows for direct
   cardinality control of network topology in estimation. Moreover, we
   investigate recurrent network stability conditions in Lyapunov's sense,
   and integrate such stability constraints into sparse network learning.
   Experiments show excellent performance of the proposed algorithms in
   network topology identification and forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared two types of approaches to downscale seasonal
   precipitation (P) and 2-m air temperature (T2M) forecasts from the North
   American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) over the states of Alabama, Georgia,
   and Florida in the southeastern United States (SEUS). Each NMME model
   forecast was evaluated. Two multimodel ensemble (MME) schemes were
   tested by assigning equal weight to all forecast members (SuperEns) or
   by assigning equal weights to each model's ensemble mean (MeanEns). One
   type of downscaling approach used was a model output statistics (MOS)
   method, which was based on direct spatial disaggregation and bias
   correction of the NMME P and T2M forecasts using the quantile mapping
   technique {[}spatial disaggregation with bias correction (SDBC)]. The
   other type of approach used was a perfect prognosis (PP) approach using
   nonparametric locally weighted polynomial regression (LWPR) models,
   which used the NMME forecasts of Nino-3.4 sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs) to predict local-scale P and T2M. Both SDBC and LWPR downscaled P
   showed skill in winter but no skill or limited skill in summer at all
   lead times for all NMME models. The SDBC downscaled T2M were skillful
   only for the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), model even at
   far lead times, whereas the LWPR downscaled T2M showed limited skill or
   no skill for all NMME models. In many cases, the LWPR method showed
   significantly higher skill than the SDBC. After bias correction, the
   SuperEns mostly showed higher skill than the MeanEns and most of the
   single models, but its skill did not outperform the best single model.}},

Abstract = {{The water gas shift reaction (WGSR) performance was experimentally
   studied using Pt-based catalysts for temperature, time factor and steam
   to carbon (S/C) molar ratio at ranges of 750-850 degrees C, 10-20
   g(cat)h/mol(co), and 1-5, respectively. Al2O3 spheres were used as the
   catalyst support. For the high S/C cases, it was found that CO
   conversion can be enhanced when Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst was used as
   compared with Pt/Al2O3. For the low S/ C ratio cases, CO conversion
   enhancement was not significant with the addition of CeO2. It was also
   found that CO conversion was not influenced by the CeO2 amount to a
   large extent. Using bimetallic Pt-Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst, it was found
   that higher CO conversion can be obtained as compared with CO
   conversions obtained from monometallic catalysts (Pt/Al2O3 or
   Pt/CeO2/Al2O3). The experimental data also indicated that good thermal
   stability can be obtained for the Pt-based catalysts studied. Copyright

Abstract = {{Cooperative cognitive radio networks (CCRNs) enable secondary users
   (SUs) to access primary resource by cooperation with active primary
   users (PUs). For the cooperation-generated resource, existing schemes in
   CCRNs allocate the resource only to the relay SUs. However, this may
   lead to inefficient spectrum utilization, when the relay SUs have poor
   channel condition or little traffic load for their own secondary
   transmissions. In this paper, considering user diversity in secondary
   networks, we focus on network-level throughput optimization for
   secondary networks, by allowing all SUs to optimally share the
   cooperation-generated period. Besides, considering the energy constraint
   on SUs, we formulate the resource allocation problem from long-term
   perspective, to reflect the time-varying change of user diversity in
   channel condition, traffic load and energy amount. We present an online
   SUM scheme to solve the long-term optimization problem. Although a
   mixed-integer and non-convex problem is involved in the SUM scheme, we
   transform the problem into multiple convex subproblems, and then
   optimally solve it with low computational complexity. Extensive
   simulations show that the proposed SUM scheme significantly outperforms
   the existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of phenological development in maize (Zea mays L.)
   is fundamental to determining crop adaptation and yield potential. A
   number of thermal functions are used in crop models, but their relative
   precision in predicting maize development has not been quantified. The
   objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the precision of eight
   thermal functions, (ii) to assess the effects of source data on the
   ability to differentiate among thermal functions, and (iii) to attribute
   the precision of thermal functions to their response across various
   temperature ranges. Data sets used in this study represent >1000
   distinct maize hybrids, >50 geographic locations, and multiple planting
   dates and years. Thermal functions and calendar days were evaluated and
   grouped based on their temperature response and derivation as empirical
   linear, empirical nonlinear, and process-based functions. Precision in
   predicting phase durations from planting to anthesis or silking and from
   silking to physiological maturity was evaluated. Large data sets enabled
   increased differentiation of thermal functions, even when smaller data
   sets contained orthogonal, multi-location and -year data. At the highest
   level of differentiation, precision of thermal functions was in the
   order calendar days < empirical linear < process based < empirical
   nonlinear. Precision was associated with relatively low temperature
   sensitivity across the 10 to 26 degrees C range. In contrast to other
   thermal functions, process-based functions were derived using
   supra-optimal temperatures, and consequently, they may better represent
   the developmental response of maize to supra-optimal temperatures.
   Supra-optimal temperatures could be more prevalent under future
   climate-change scenarios, but data sets in this study contained few data
   in that range.}},

Title = {{Hyperspectral band selection for detecting different blueberry fruit

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imagery divides spectrum into many bands with. very narrow
   bandwidth. It is more capable to detect or classify objects, where
   visible information is not sufficient for the task. However,
   hyperspectral image contains a large amount of redundant information,
   which eliminates its discriminability. Band selection is used to both
   reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral images and save useful bands
   for further application. This study explores the feasibility of
   hyperspectral imaging for the task of classifying blueberry fruit growth
   stages and background. Three information theory based band selection
   methods using Kullback-Leibler divergence: pair-wise class
   discriminability, hierarchical dimensionality reduction and
   non-Gaussianity measures were applied. Three classifiers, K-nearest
   neighbor, support vector machine and AdaBoost were used to test the
   performance of the selected bands by the three methods. The selected
   bands achieved classification accuracies of 88\% and higher. Therefore,
   the band selection methods are very useful in reducing the volume of the
   hyperspectral data, and constructing a multispectral imaging system for
   detecting blueberry fruit maturity stages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Year-long time series of water level are analyzed at five locations
   along the St. Johns River Estuary, Florida, to investigate propagation
   of subtidal pulses. Hilbert-transformed Empirical Orthogonal Functions
   (HEOFs) are obtained after a dominant seasonal signal is extracted from
   the data. These functions provide information on spatial structure and
   propagation phase of subtidal water level pulses. The first HEOF mode
   explains 96\% of the subtidal variability and features an unusual
   spatial structure: amplitude attenuation (averaging 1 mm/km) to 55 km
   upstream, slight amplification (0.16 mm/km) over the middle 70 km, and
   attenuation (2.3 mm/km) over the final 18 km of the estuary. The phase
   suggests a shift from progressive to quasi-standing wave behavior at 55
   km from the estuary mouth. Additionally, local minima in the phase
   suggest two sources of subtidal forcing: the coastal ocean and the
   upstream end. An analytical model describing the evolution of long waves
   through a channel with frictional damping is fit to the amplitude of
   HEOF mode 1. Solutions are obtained as a function of two parameters: the
   nondimensional length of the basin, , and the nondimensional frictional
   depth, . Values of between 0.55 and 0.67 and between 1.45 and 1.7
   provide the best fit with the HEOF results (1\% error or less). These
   values indicate a highly frictional environment in which the average
   subtidal wavelength is 10 times the basin length. Subtidal pulses in
   this estuary, therefore, behave as damped waves that can be represented
   with idealized models.

Abstract = {{To provide a probable explanation on the field observed rapid
   sedimentation process near river mouths, we investigate the convective
   sedimentation in stably stratified saltwater using 3-D numerical
   simulations. Guided by the linear stability analysis, this study focuses
   on the nonlinear interactions of several mechanisms, which lead to
   various sediment finger patterns, and the effective settling velocity
   for sediment ranging from clay (single-particle settling velocity
   V-0=0.0036 and 0.0144 mm/s, or particle diameter d=2 and 4 m) to silt
   (V-0=0.36 mm/s, or d=20 m). For very fine sediment with V-0=0.0036 mm/s,
   the convective instability is dominated by double diffusion,
   characterized by millimeter-scale fingers. Gravitational settling
   slightly increases the growth rate; however, it has notable effect on
   the downward development of vertical mixing shortly after the sediment
   interface migrates below the salt interface. For sediment with
   V-0=0.0144 mm/s, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities become dominant before
   double-diffusive modes grow sufficiently large. Centimeter-scale and
   highly asymmetric sediment fingers are obtained due to nonlinear
   interactions between different modes. For sediment with V-0=0.36 mm/s,
   Rayleigh-Taylor mechanism dominates and the resulting centimeter-scale
   sediment fingers show a plume-like structure. The flow pattern is
   similar to that without ambient salt stratification. Rapid sedimentation
   with effective settling velocity on the order of 1 cm/s is likely driven
   by convective sedimentation for sediment with V-0 greater than 0.1 mm/s
   at concentration greater than 10-20 g/L.}},

Abstract = {{Levitation and consecutive deposition of naturally charged particles on
   lunar surface were troublesome in previous NASA explorations. Protecting
   sensitive surfaces from dust deposition in the limiting condition of the
   lunar atmosphere is imperative for future space exploration. This study
   reports experimental investigation of the collection efficiency of an
   electrostatic lunar dust collector (ELDC). A dual-functional remotely
   controlled particle charger/dropper was designed for tribocharging 20 mu
   m lunar dust simulants, and a system of Faraday cup connected to an
   electrometer working in the nC range was used to measure the particle
   charges. Tribochargeability of two lunar dust simulants was studied, and
   the process was found to be the most effective with the JSC-1A samples.
   Aluminum was verified to be a more effective plate material than
   stainless steel. For the tested range of electrostatic field strength
   (0.66-2.6 kV/m), the mass-based and charge-based collection efficiencies
   were in the range of 0.25-1\% and 0.45-1.45\% for the low vacuum (10(-1)
   Torr), and 8-35\% and 12-54\% for the high vacuum (10(-5) Torr)
   conditions. The linear relationship between the applied voltage and ELDC
   collection efficiency predicted by the theoretical model was confirmed,
   and the collection pattern of the collected particles over the
   collection plate was consistent with the previously computed charge
   distribution on the collection plate. Aside from validating the
   predictability of the theoretical model, this study offers a novel
   method of particle charging inside a vacuum chamber with a variety of
   applications for studying chargeability of particles at different
   temperatures and pressures. (C) 2014 The Society of Powder Technology

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Wheat is the third largest crop globally and an essential source of
   calories in human diets. Maintaining and increasing global wheat
   production is therefore strongly linked to food security. A large
   geographic variation in wheat yields across similar climates points to
   sizeable yield gaps in many nations, and indicates a regionally variable
   flexibility to increase wheat production. Wheat is particularly
   sensitive to a changing climate thus limiting management opportunities
   to enable (sustainable) intensification with potentially significant
   implications for future wheat production. We present a comprehensive
   global evaluation of future wheat yields and production under distinct
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) using the Environmental
   Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agro-ecosystem model. We project, in a
   geographically explicit manner, future wheat production pathways for
   rainfed and irrigated wheat systems. We explore agricultural management
   flexibility by quantifying the development of wheat yield potentials
   under current, rainfed, exploitable (given current irrigation
   infrastructure), and irrigated intensification levels. Globally, because
   of climate change, wheat production under conventional management
   (around the year 2000) would decrease across all RCPs by 37 to 52 and 54
   to 103 Mt in the 2050s and 2090s, respectively. However, the exploitable
   and potential production gap will stay above 350 and 580 Mt,
   respectively, for all RCPs and time horizons, indicating that negative
   impacts of climate change can globally be offset by adequate
   intensification using currently existing irrigation infrastructure and
   nutrient additions. Future world wheat production on cropland already
   under cultivation can be increased by similar to 35\% through
   intensified fertilization and similar to 50\% through increased
   fertilization and extended irrigation, if sufficient water would be
   available. Significant potential can still be exploited, especially in
   rainfed wheat systems in Russia, Eastern Europe and North America. (C)

Abstract = {{A through Si-substrate via-hole under the active area of GaN-based HEMTs
   grown on Si substrates is proposed to reduce the maximum junction
   temperature. Due to the large lattice mismatch between Si and GaN, an
   AlN nucleation layer and an AlGaN transition layer are required to grow
   GaN layers on Si substrates. This AlN nucleation layer is very defective
   and thermally resistive. The proposed through Si-substrate via-hole
   offers access to this AlN nucleation layer from the back side of the
   wafer. By removing this highly thermally resistive layer and plating the
   via hole with copper, the maximum junction temperature can be reduced
   from 146 to 120 degrees C at a power density of 5 W/mm. Besides reducing
   the maximum junction temperature of the HEMT, this through Si-substrate
   via-hole can be electrically connected to the source contact and act as
   a backside source field plate to reduce the maximum electric field
   around the gate edges and thereby increase the drain breakdown voltage.
   If this through Si-substrate via-hole is connected to the front gate
   pad, it can also behave as a back gate to improve front gate modulation.

Abstract = {{Droplets with diameters from a few to hundreds of micrometers have found
   increasing applications in various fields. For inkjet printing, there is
   always a great need to control and reduce the droplet size for a given
   nozzle diameter and print viscous fluids by avoiding clogging. This
   study investigates the electric field-assisted droplet formation process
   under piezoactuation-based drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet printing. For
   better control of droplet monodispersity, the Taylor cone is
   intentionally suppressed to avoid undesirable satellite droplets. The
   droplet formation process of deionized water is investigated, and some
   main conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) with an increase of applied
   voltage, the droplet velocity increases and the droplet size decreases,
   (2) the pinch-off location may be different depending on the applied
   voltage; and (3) the combination effect of the electric field and
   meniscus oscillation can be utilized to significantly reduce the droplet
   diameter to less than one-fifth of the orifice diameter. The electric
   field also demonstrates its capability in facilitating the DOD inkjet
   printing of high-concentration cell-alginate suspensions.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic characteristics have been found to influence pain management
   decisions, but limited focus has been placed on participants' reactions
   to feedback about their use of sex, race, or age to make these
   decisions. The present study aimed to examine the effects of providing
   feedback about the use of demographic cues to participants making pain
   management decisions. Participants (N = 107) viewed 32 virtual human
   patients with standardized levels of pain and provided ratings for
   virtual humans' pain intensity and their treatment decisions. Real-time
   lens model idiographic analyses determined participants' decision
   policies based on cues used. Participants were subsequently informed
   about cue use and completed feedback questions. Frequency analyses were
   conducted on responses to these questions. Between 7.4 and 89.4\% of
   participants indicated awareness of their use of demographic or pain
   expression cues. Of those individuals, 26.9 to 55.5\% believed this
   awareness would change their future clinical decisions, and 66.6 to
   75.9\% endorsed that their attitudes affect their imagined clinical
   practice. Between 66.6 and 79.1\% of participants who used cues reported
   willingness to complete an online tutorial about pain across demographic
   groups. This study was novel because it provided participants feedback
   about their cue use. Most participants who used cues indicated
   willingness to participate in an online intervention, suggesting this
   technology's utility for modifying biases.
   Perspective: This is the first study to make individuals aware of
   whether a virtual human's sex, race, or age influences their decision
   making. Findings suggest that a majority of the individuals who were
   made aware of their use of demographic cues would be willing to
   participate in an online intervention. (C) 2014 by the American Pain

Abstract = {{Ocean prediction systems rely on an array of assumptions to optimize
   their data assimilation schemes. Many of these remain untested,
   especially at smaller scales, because sufficiently dense observations
   are very rare. A set of 295 drifters deployed in July 2012 in the
   north-eastern Gulf of Mexico provides a unique opportunity to test these
   systems down to scales previously unobtainable. In this study,
   background error covariance assumptions in the 3DVar assimilation
   process are perturbed to understand the effect on the solution relative
   to the withheld dense drifter data. Results show that the amplitude of
   the background error covariance is an important factor as expected, and
   a proposed new formulation provides added skill. In addition, the
   background error covariance time correlation is important to allow
   satellite observations to affect the results over a period longer than
   one daily assimilation cycle. The results show the new background error
   covariance formulations provide more accurate placement of frontal
   positions, directions of currents and velocity magnitudes. These
   conclusions have implications for the implementation of 3DVar systems as
   well as the analysis interval of 4DVar systems. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop optimal electricity storage control policies
   to manage charging and discharging activities for plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicles for the benefit of an energy market participant. We
   first develop models for both risk-neutral and risk-averse aggregators
   to participate only in a real-time market. The proposed models capture
   the impact of the charging and discharging activities on real-time
   electricity prices. Next, we extend our study to the case in which
   aggregators participate in both the real-time and day-ahead markets. For
   each developed model, we analyze the properties of the optimal objective
   value function, prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal
   policy, and explore the corresponding optimal policy structure.
   Moreover, through numerical studies, we explore insights into how
   electricity prices are influenced by charging and discharging
   activities. In particular, we observe that aggregated
   charging/discharging activities with market-impact consideration could
   reduce the variance of the real-time electricity prices more
   efficiently, as compared to individual activities. In addition,
   considering market impact, an aggregator tends to use less electricity
   storage. Finally, it is beneficial to let an aggregator control the
   electricity storage and participate in both the real-time and day-ahead
   markets, instead of participating only in the real-time market.}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Biotribology and tribocorrosion are often not included in numerical or
   computational modeling efforts to predict wear because of the apparent
   complexity in the geometry, the variability in removal rates, and the
   challenge associated with mixing time-dependent removal processes such
   as corrosion with cyclic material removal from wear. The lollipop is an
   accessible bio-tribocorrosion problem that is well known but
   underexplored scientifically as a tribocorrosion process.
   Stress-assisted dissolution was found to be the dominant tribocorrosion
   process driving material removal in this system. A model of material
   removal was described and approached by lumping the intrinsically
   time-dependent process with a mechanically driven process into a single
   cyclic volumetric material removal rate. This required the collection of
   self-reported wear data from 58 participants that were used in
   conjunction with statistical analysis of actual lollipop cross-sectional
   information. Thousands of repeated numerical simulations of material
   removal and shape evolution were conducted using a simple Monte Carlo
   process that varied the input parameters and geometries to match the
   measured variability. The resulting computations were analyzed to
   calculate both the average number of licks required to reach the Tootsie
   Roll (R) center of a Tootsie Roll (R) pop, as well as the expected
   variation thereof.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen production and purification via methanol-steam reforming was
   studied in a membrane reactor coupled with a catalytic combustor heat
   supply, applying 1D non-isothermal mathematical models. Both mass and
   heat transfer behaviors were evaluated simultaneously in three reactor
   components. Based on data of methanol conversion, hydrogen recovery, and
   carbon monoxide selectivity, the membrane reactor performance was found
   to be controlled by the methanol-air flow rate in the combustor,
   reformer operating pressure, and sweep gas flow rate. Higher hydrogen
   permeation driving force leads to high reformer operating pressure and
   sweep gas flow rate. Methanol conversion is enhanced compared with a
   conventional reactor under the same operation conditions with increased
   hydrogen removal from the reformer.}},

Title = {{MBPOA-based LQR controller and its application to the double-parallel
   inverted pendulum system}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{262-268}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{As the performance of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers
   greatly depends on its weighting matrices, i.e. Q and R, designing these
   two matrices is one of the most important components in the LQR problem
   which is a tedious and challenging work in the applications of LQR.
   Hence, a novel LQR approach based on the Pareto-based Multi-objective
   Binary Probability Optimization Algorithm (MBPOA) is proposed in this
   paper, in which MBPOA is utilized to search for the optimal weighting
   matrices to relieve the effort of parameter settings and improve the
   control performance according to the pre-defined objective functions. By
   combining LQR with MBPOA, the optimal controllers can be obtained easily
   and effortless. Moreover, the control performance can be adjusted
   further conveniently to meet the requirements of applications as a set
   of Pareto-optimal LQR controllers is offered. The simulation and
   experiment results on the double-parallel inverted pendulum system
   demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed
   MBPOA-based LQR method. Considering the characteristics such as
   robustness, the optimal dynamic performance and easy implementation
   without prior knowledge, the MBPOA-based LQR is a promising control
   approach for engineering applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an expected value and chance constrained stochastic
   optimization approach for the unit commitment problem with uncertain
   wind power output. In the model, the utilization of wind power can be
   adjusted by changing the utilization rate in the proposed expected value
   constraint. Meanwhile, the chance constraint is used to restrict the
   probability of load imbalance. Then a Sample Average Approximation (SAA)
   method is used to transform the objective function, the expected value
   constraint, and the chance constraint into sample average
   reformulations. Furthermore, a combined SAA framework that considers
   both the expected value and the chance constraints is proposed to
   construct statistical upper and lower bounds for the optimization
   problem. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm with
   different utilization rates and different risk levels is tested for a
   six-bus system. A revised IEEE 118-bus system is also studied to show
   the scalability of the proposed model and algorithm.}},

   to the uncertainty associated with the number of transit-dependent

Abstract = {{Zone-refined ultra high pure ZrC with five C/Zr ratios ranging from 0.84
   to 1.17 was irradiated using a 2 MeV proton beam at 1125 degrees C. The
   stoichiometry effect on the irradiation response of ZrC microstructure
   was examined using transmission electron microscopy following the
   irradiation. The irradiated microstructures generally feature a high
   density of perfect dislocation loops particularly at away from the
   graphite precipitates, and the C/Zr ratio shows a notable effect on the
   size and density of dislocation loops. The dislocation loops are
   identified as interstitial type perfect loops, and it was indirectly
   proved that the dislocation loop core likely consists of carbon atoms.
   Graphite precipitates that form with excess carbon in the
   super-stoichiometric ZrC are detrimental, and the dramatic increases in
   the size of and density of dislocation loops in the vicinity of graphite
   precipitates in ZrC phase were observed. Irradiation-induced faceted
   voids were only observed in ZrC0.95, which is attributed to the
   pre-existing dislocation lines as biased sinks for vacancies. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The rate distortion function in information theory provides performance
   bounds for lossy source coding. However, it is not clear how to causally
   encode a Gaussian sequence under rate constraints while achieving R-D
   optimality. This problem has significant implications in the design of
   rate control for video communication. To address this problem, we take
   distortion fluctuation into account and develop a new theory, called
   gamma rate theory, to quantify the trade-off between rate and distortion
   fluctuation. The gamma rate theory implies that, to evaluate the
   performance of causal rate controls in source coding, the traditional
   R-D metric needs to be replaced by a new GRD metric. The gamma rate
   theory identifies the trade-off between quality fluctuation and
   bandwidth, which is not known previously. To validate the gamma rate
   theory, we design a rate control algorithm for video coding; our
   experimental results demonstrate the utility of the gamma rate theory in
   video coding. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of sea level variations due to tides and wave setup on
   turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was observed at a point source submarine
   groundwater discharge in a fringing coral reef lagoon. Tidal and wave
   setup variations modulated speed, TKE, TKE dissipation, and water
   temperature and salinity at the buoyant jet. The primary driver of jet
   TKE and speed variations was tides, while wave setup was a minor
   contributor. An inverse relationship between surface elevation and TKE
   was explained with an exponential equation based on sea level
   variations. During low tides, peak jet speeds (up to 0.3 m s(-1)) and
   TKE per unit mass (up to 0.4 m(2) s(-2)) were observed. As high tide
   approached, the jet produced minimum TKE of similar to 0.003 m(2) s(-2)
   and TKE dissipation ranged from 2 to 8x10(-4) m(2) s(-3). This
   demonstrated the sensitivity of the jet discharge to tides despite the
   small tidal range (< 20 cm). Jet temperatures and salinities displayed
   semidiurnal oscillations with minimum salinity and temperature values
   during maximum discharge. Jet salinities increased throughout low tides
   while temperatures decreased. This pattern suggested the jet conduit was
   connected to a stratified cavity within the aquifer containing cool
   fresh water over cool salty water. As low tides progressed, jet outflow
   increased in salinity because of the mixing within the conduit, while
   lower jet temperatures suggested water coming from further or deeper in
   the aquifer. The presence of such a cavity has been recently confirmed
   by divers.}},

Abstract = {{We report a series-connected small molecule tandem photovoltaic cell

   near infrared (NIR) response up to 1 mu m and high open-circuit voltage

   spectral measurements, we are able to tune the optical field
   distribution inside the active layers and increase the photocurrent
   outputs from both subcells, leading to EQE > 30\% over the wavelength
   range 400 nm < lambda < 900 nm. This optimized tandem cell exhibits

Abstract = {{Measurements of normal stress differences are reported for suspensions

   measuring the deformation in the free surface in a tilted trough and in
   a Weissenberg rheometer. Simulations are performed as well, and the
   hydrodynamic and contact contributions to the normal stresses are
   calculated. The experiments and simulations indicate that the second
   normal stress difference is negative and that its magnitude increases as
   the concentration is raised and the aspect ratio is lowered. The first
   normal stress difference is positive and its magnitude is approximately
   twice that of the second normal stress difference. Simulation results

Abstract = {{A case study of landfill liquids addition using small diameter (5 cm)

   via 134 vertical wells installed 3 m, 12 m, and 18 m deep over five
   years in a landfill in Florida, US. Liquids addition performance (flow
   rate per unit screen length per unit liquid head) ranged from 5.6 x
   10(-8) to 3.6 x 10(-6) m(3) s(-1) per m screen length per m liquid head.
   The estimated radial hydraulic conductivity ranged from 3.5 x 10(-6) to
   4.2 x 10(-4) m s(-1). The extent of lateral moisture movement ranged
   from 8 to 10 m based on the responses of moisture sensors installed
   around vertical well clusters, and surface seeps were found to limit the
   achievable liquids addition rates, despite the use of concrete collars
   under a pressurized liquids addition scenario. The average moisture

Abstract = {{Limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) affect current fighter aircraft and are
   expected to be present on next generation fighter aircraft. Current
   efforts in control systems designed to suppress LCO behavior have either
   used a linear model, restricting the flight regime, require exact
   knowledge of the system dynamics, or require uncertainties in the system
   dynamics to be linear-in-the-parameters and only present in the
   torsional stiffness. Furthermore, the aerodynamic model used in prior
   research efforts neglects nonlinear effects. This paper presents the
   development of a controller consisting of a continuous robust integral
   of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback term with a neural network (NN)
   feedforward term to achieve asymptotic tracking of uncertainties that do
   not satisfy the linear-in-the-parameters assumption. Simulation results

Title = {{A unified model for Digitized Heat Transfer in a microchannel}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{393-407}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Digitized Heat Transfer (DHT) is a novel method of adaptive thermal
   management for high powered devices that uses discrete microdroplets to
   remove heat. In this paper, the heat transfer characteristics of DHT are
   investigated for parallel plate and axisymmetric circular microchannels
   using scale analysis and numerical simulations. DHT in axisymmetric
   microchannels are also studied using experimental tests. Through scale
   analysis, it is found that DHT is quantified by the Nusselt number (Nu)
   and is a function of the Reynolds number (Re), Prandtl number (Pr),
   nondimensional axial distance (x/D-H), and droplet aspect ratio (AR). In
   simulation and experiment, Nu shows a direct relationship with Re and Pr
   as well as an inverse relationship with AR. Using the Graetz problem as
   a model, new scaling relations are proposed for the axial distance, x,
   and Nu in an effort to collapse the Nu curves that exist for different
   flow parameters. To align the characteristic oscillations of Nu found in
   DHT, x is scaled by the droplet circulation length, L-circ, to create a
   new nondimensional axial distance, x(circ) = x/L-circ. In order to match
   the overall magnitude, Nu scaling is derived based on the two different
   modes of heat transfer that occur before and after one circulation
   length. Prior to one circulation length, heat transfer is characterized
   by thermal boundary layer growth and the scaling parameter is determined
   to be f(1) = root RePr/AR. After one circulation length, recirculation
   of heat is dominant and a scaling parameter f(2) is found to be a linear
   function of 1/AR.f(2) is modeled by the equation f(2) = c(1)/AR + c(2)
   where c(1) and c(2) are dependent on Re and Pr. The two scaling
   constants are merged using an inverse tangent weighting function (w) so
   that a fully scaled Nusselt number, Nu{*}, is defined by
   Nu{[}(1/f(1))(1-w)-(1/f(2))w]. Using this unified model, numerical and
   experimental data are reduced to a single curve that depicts the heat
   transfer to any digitized flow. In the future, this model will be
   helpful in comparing various DHT systems as well as enabling the design
   of powerful and efficient DHT based thermal management systems. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A slow-release fertilizer was developed by encapsulating KNO3 pellets
   with graphene oxide (GO) films. The material was then subjected to heat
   treatment, where adjacent GO sheets were soldered and reduced to reduced
   graphene oxide (re-GO) sheets by potassium. After the re-GO shell formed
   on KNO3 pellets, the slow-release characteristics of the fertilizer
   dramatically improved. The process of releasing fertilizer was prolonged
   to 8 h in water. We believe that this new coating technology could hold
   great promise for the development of environmentally-benign
   controlled-release fertilizer for crop production. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many ceramic structural applications involve a combination of tensile
   (mode I) and shear (mode II) loading conditions. Quantitative
   fractography was performed on monolithic and R-curve materials.
   Soda-lime-silica glass was selected as the monolithic material. A mica
   glass ceramic was selected to represent R-curve materials. Mixed-mode
   fracture surfaces in both materials were characterized by an absence of
   the mist region. For the mica glass ceramic, crack-to-mirror size ratios
   were found to be a function of the crack length and mode mixity. Hackle
   markings on mixed-mode fracture surfaces appear as lances and differ
   from those observed on surfaces failed in pure Mode I. Atomic force
   microscopy showed that the features in different regions on the
   mixed-mode fracture surfaces are similar and differ only by scale. The
   practical implications of these observations are that forensic analyses
   can be used without a priori knowledge of the loading conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multilayer wiring board that integrates a copper
   air-core microinductor to enable a highly compact, chip-scale power
   converter module. The wiring board is wafer-level fabricatedwith three
   30-mu m-thick electroplated copper layers and is subsequently detached
   from the fabrication wafer to yield a board that is only 90 mu m thick
   for minimum overall module volume. Within this platform, a
   stacked-spiral air-core microinductor is designed for
   high-switching-frequency power conversion and yields high inductance
   density of 128 nH/mm(2) (100 nH/mm(3) by volume, including 600 mu m
   clearances both above and below the inductor to minimize coupling with
   external conductors). Although this technology is anticipated to be more
   appropriate for emerging, experimental converters with switching
   frequencies > 30 MHz, a proof-of-concept, ultraminiature (9 mm(2)
   footprint, 0.7 mm thick) power converter module is presented that
   utilizes the microinductor wiring board in conjunction with a
   commercially available surface-mount boost regulator (similar to 4 MHz
   switching frequency). The converter module yielded a maximum output
   power of 153 mW at 60\% efficiency for a volumetric power density of 24
   mW/mm(3) based on the physical volume occupied by themodule (13 mW/mm(3)
   based on the volume needing to be kept clear from external conductors).}},

Title = {{Transparent electrodes for organic optoelectronic devices: a review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHOTONICS FOR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Transparent conductive electrodes are one of the essential components
   for organic optoelectronic devices, including photovoltaic cells and
   light-emitting diodes. Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is the most common
   transparent electrode in these devices due to its excellent optical and
   electrical properties. However, the manufacturing of ITO film requires
   precious raw materials and expensive processes, which limits their
   compatibility with mass production of large-area, low-cost devices. The
   optical/electrical properties of ITO are strongly dependent on the
   deposition processes and treatment conditions, whereas its brittleness
   and the potential damage to underlying films during deposition also
   present challenges for its use in flexible devices. Recently, several
   other transparent conductive materials, which have various degrees of
   success relative to commercial applications have been developed to
   address these issues. Starting from the basic properties of ITO and the
   effect of various ITO surface modification methods, here we review four
   different groups of materials, doped metal oxides, thin metals,
   conducting polymers, and nanomaterials (including carbon nanotubes,
   graphene, and metal nanowires), that have been reported as transparent
   electrodes in organic optoelectronic materials. Particular emphasis is
   given to their optical/electrical and other material properties,
   deposition techniques, and applications in organic optoelectronic
   devices. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{Cation disorder plays a major role in the performance deterioration of
   Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) (CZTSSe) photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Unfortunately the
   quantitative impact of cation disorder in this material is not well
   understood. Here, we show that changes in microstate configurational
   entropy (S-MCE), predicted by a combination of statistical mechanics,
   density functional theory, and phonon calculations, can quantitatively
   describe cation disorder and the associated properties in CZTSSe. For
   example, the predicted critical temperature of the second-order phase
   transition and the thermal expansion anomaly of CZTS based on SMCE are
   in good agreement with experiments. We further reveal that the more
   separated is the same kind of cations (Cu, Zn, or Sn), the lower the
   energy of the corresponding microstate will be, implying the maximum
   entropy probability distribution of cations at high temperatures. It is
   suggested that the introduction of SMCE can serve as a framework to
   quantitatively understand and tailor cation disorder and associated
   properties for synthesis of the high-quality CZTS-based solar cells.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{6303-6308}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Multifunctional materials have received significant research interest
   due to the potential for performance enhancements over traditional
   materials through the integration of responsive properties. Composite
   materials are ideally suited for use as multifunctional materials due to
   their use of two or more phases and the ease at which their properties
   can be anisotropically tailored. Here, a methodology for the integration
   of ferroelectricity into a fiber reinforced polymer composite is
   presented by synthesizing a barium titanate nanowire film on the surface
   of carbon fibers using a novel two-step hydrothermal process. A refined
   piezoelectric force microscopy method is used to quantify the
   piezoelectric properties of the core-shell fiber resulting in an average
   d(33) of 31.6 +/- 14.5 pm V-1 and an average d(31) of -5.4 +/- 3.2 pm
   V-1. The multifunctionality of this piezoelectric coated fiber is
   demonstrated through excitation of a cantilevered fiber with a 0.5 g
   sinusoidal base acceleration at the fiber's fundamental resonant
   frequency, producing a root-mean-square voltage of 16.4 mV. This result
   demonstrates the ferroelectric properties of the multifunctional
   structural fiber and its application for sensing and energy harvesting.}},

   non-equilibrium hypersonic flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{A numerical study employing discontinuous Galerkin method demonstrating
   net surface heat reduction for a cylindrical body in Mach 17 hypersonic
   flow is presented. This application focuses on using sinusoidal
   dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators to inject momentum near
   the stagnation point. A 5 species finite rate air chemistry model
   completes the picture by analyzing the effect of the actuator on the
   flow chemistry. With low velocity near the stagnation point, the plasma
   actuator sufficiently modifies the fluid momentum. This results in
   redistribution of the integrated surface heating load on the body.
   Specifically, a particular configuration of normally pinching plasma
   actuation is predicted to reduce the surface heat flux at the stagnation
   point. An average reduction of 0.246\% for the integrated and a maximum
   reduction of 7.68\% are reported for the surface heat flux. The
   temperature contours in the fluid flow (with maximum temperature over 12
   000 K) are pinched away from the stagnation point, thus resulting in
   reduced thermal load. Plasma actuation in this configuration also
   affects the species concentration distribution near the wall, in
   addition to the temperature gradient. The combined effect of both, thus
   results in an average reduction of 0.0986\% and a maximum reduction of
   4.04\% for non-equilibrium calculations. Thus, this study successfully
   demonstrates the impact of sinusoidal dielectric barrier discharge
   plasma actuation on the reduction of thermal load on a hypersonic body.

Abstract = {{A time-resolved photoluminescence quenching approach is developed for
   determining the triplet exciton diffusion coefficient and diffusion
   length (D and L-D, respectively) of phosphorescent conjugated polymers.
   This method is applied to a solid-state organometallic conjugated
   polymer with the structure {[}-Pt(PBu3)(2)CCC6H4CC-]n (where Bu =
   n-butyl and -C6H4 is 1,4-phenylene). The approach relies on analysis of
   the lifetime quenching of the polymers phosphorescence by a series of
   three different quenchers that are dispersed into the polymer phase at
   varying concentration. The lifetime quenching data are analyzed by using
   a modified SternVolmer quenching expression to determine the
   diffusion-controlled quenching rate constant, kq, which is then related
   to the exciton diffusivity, D, and diffusion length, LD. The diffusion
   coefficients that are determined using the three quenchers are
   consistent, D approximate to 4 x 106 cm2 s1, and combined with the
   triplet exciton lifetime of the pristine polymer (t = 1.05 mu s) give an
   exciton diffusion length L-D approximate to 22 nm. The results are
   compared to literature studies of singlet exciton diffusion in
   conjugated polymers and triplet exciton diffusion in molecular

Abstract = {{Aggregation raises attention in Nanotoxicology due to its methodological
   implications. Aggregation is a physical symptom of a more general
   physicochemical condition of colloidal particles, namely, colloidal
   stability. Colloidal stability is a global indicator of the tendency of
   a system to reduce its net surface energy, which may be achieved by
   homo-aggregation or hetero-aggregation, including location at
   bio-interfaces. However, the role of colloidal stability as a driver of
   ENM bioactivity has received little consideration thus far. In the
   present work, which focuses on the toxicity of nanoscaled Fe
   nanoparticles (nZVI) towards a model microalga, we demonstrate that
   colloidal stability is a fundamental driver of ENM bioactivity,
   comprehensively accounting for otherwise inexplicable differential
   biological effects. The present work throws light on basic aspects of
   Nanotoxicology, and reveals a key factor which may reconcile
   contradictory results on the influence of aggregation in bioactivity of
   ENMs.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of air venting and moisture variation on H2S production and
   the leaching of metals/metalloids (arsenic, copper, chromium, and boron)
   from treated wood in aged mature construction and demolition (C\&D)
   debris landfills were examined. Three simulated C\&D debris landfill
   lysimeters were constructed and monitored, each containing as a major
   debris component either wooden pallets, chromated copper arsenate (CCA)
   treated wood, or alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ) treated wood. The
   lysimeters were operated with alternating periods of water addition (a
   total of 160 L in four equal amounts) and air venting (68.4 m(3) per day
   for 121 days in two phases). Moisture addition did not increase H2S
   levels in the long term, and a significant drop in H2S concentration was
   observed (up to 99\%) when aerobic conditions were promoted through air
   venting. H2S concentrations increased after venting stopped up to values
   approximately two orders of magnitude lower than observed prior to
   venting. Venting had the immediate consequence of suppressing biological
   H2S production, and the longer-term effect of decreasing organic matter
   that could otherwise be utilized in this process. Under aerobic
   conditions, the levels of arsenic, chromium, and boron in leachate
   decreased up to 96\%, 49\%, and 68\%, respectively, while copper was
   found to increase up to 200\% in CCA and 445\% in ACQ column leachates.}},

Title = {{Interfacial Tension and Surface Elasticity of Carbon Black (CB) Covered
   Oil-Water Interface}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{41}},
Pages = {{12287-12296}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Carboxyl-terminated carbon black (CB) particles have been proposed as
   readily available, biocompatible dispersants to stabilize oil-in-water
   emulsions after an oil spill. Since the reduction in interfacial tension
   and the increase in interfacial elasticity are the key parameters which
   relate interfacial mechanics to emulsion stability, this investigation
   explores the effect of CB adsorption and surface coverage on oil-water
   interfacial tension and elasticity. Flocculation of CB was explored as
   ionic strength was increased from 0 to 0.6 M, approximately the salinity
   of seawater. As salinity increases, CB aggregates into larger particles
   from 100 nm to 6 mu m. The interfacial tension and dilational
   viscoelasticity were measured for two systems: a drop of a CB suspension
   in oil and an inverted oil drop in a CB suspension. For the arrangement
   of a CB suspension drop in oil, most of the CB settles and accumulates
   toward the bottom of the drop with only small surface adsorption and no
   appreciable effect is observed on the dynamic interfacial tension or the
   dilational viscoelasticity. On reversing the arrangement to an inverted
   oil drop in CB suspension and increasing the convection of the outer
   phase, the surface coverage increases considerably. The CB coverage
   becomes more uniform with higher convection with an average value of
   approximately 2.6 g/m(2), which is representative of the coverage in
   Pickering emulsions stabilized by CB particles. The CB coverage
   decreases the surface tension from about 30 to 8.5 mN/m accompanied by
   an increase in the surface elasticity to 20.7 mN/m. The sharp contrast
   between the results from the CB suspension drop and the oil drop could
   be partially due to the effect of the wetting characteristics of the
   particles or due to the significant differences between the convection
   in the two cases.}},

Abstract = {{We report biodegradable electroactive polymer (EAP)-based materials and
   their application as drug delivery devices. Copolymers composed of
   oligoaniline-based electroactive blocks linked to either polyethylene
   glycol or polycaprolactone blocks via ester bonds were synthesized in
   three steps from commercially available starting materials and isolated
   without the need for column chromatography. The physicochemical and
   electrochemical properties of the polymers were characterized with a
   variety of techniques. The ability of the polymers to deliver the
   anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone phosphate on the application of
   electrochemical stimuli was studied spectroscopically. Films of the
   polymers were shown to be degradable and cell adhesive in vitro. Such
   EAP-based materials have prospects for integration in implantable fully
   biodegradable/bioerodible EAP-based drug delivery devices that are
   capable of controlling the chronopharmacology of drugs for future
   clinical application.}},

Abstract = {{Schottky barrier field-effect transistors (SBFETs) based on few and mono

   formalism. It is shown that scaling down the gate oxide thickness
   results in pronounced ambipolar I-V characteristics and significant
   increase of the minimal leakage current. The problem of leakage is
   especially severe when the gate insulator is thin and the number of
   layer is large, but can be effectively suppressed by reducing
   phosphorene to mono or bilayer. Different from two-dimensional graphene
   and layered dichalcogenide materials, both the ON-current of the
   phosphorene SBFETs and the metal-semiconductor contact resistance
   between metal and phosphorene strongly depend on the transport
   crystalline direction. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Three stereochemically pure isomers and two isomeric mixtures of a
   solution-processable diketopyrrolopyrrole-containing oligothiophene
   (SMDPPEH) have been used to study the effect of 2-ethylhexyl
   solubilizing group stereochemistry on the film morphology and bulk
   heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell characteristics of small molecule
   organic photovoltaics. The different SMDPPEH stereoisomer compositions
   exhibit nearly identical optoelectronic properties in the molecularly
   dissolved state, as well as in amorphous films blended with PCBM.
   However, for films in which SMDPPEH crystallization is induced by
   thermal annealing, significant differences in molecular packing between
   the different stereoisomer formulations are observed. These differences
   are borne out in photovoltaic device characteristics for which
   unannealed devices show very similar behavior, while after annealing the
   RR- and SS-SMDPPEH enantiomers show blue-shifted peak EQE relative to
   the SMDPPEH isomer mixtures. Unannealed devices made from the most
   crystalline stereoisomer, meso RS-SMDPPEH, are not completely amorphous,
   and show improved photocurrent generation as a result. Unlike the other
   compounds, after thermal annealing the RS-SMDPPEH devices show reduced
   device performance. The results reveal that the chirality of commonly
   used 2-ethylhexyl solubilizing chains can have a significant effect on
   the morphology, absorption, and optimum processing conditions of small
   molecule organic thin films used as photovoltaic device active layers.}},

   In principle, compared with conventional bipolar transistors, PMBTs
   should have a higher speed and are easier to fabricate compatible with
   flexible and printed electronics. However, functional PMBTs are not
   realized due to low current gains (<50) and lack of output current
   saturation. In this paper, making use of the nano-textured surface of an
   organic semiconductor, we are able to fabricate devices with permeable
   metal base films having a pore size of about 20 nm and achieve current
   gains up to 476 with output current saturation. Correlations between the
   nano-scale porosity and the charge transmission/amplification behaviors
   in the device are explained with characterization of the metal base
   porosity. From our device simulation results, the small pore size is
   essential to achieve current saturation in the device due to the
   potential-pinning effect in the small pore regions. Finally, using a
   similar strategy, we also demonstrate a high gain (=260)
   solution-processed metal oxide-based PMBTs with output current
   saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Waste treatment and management for manned long term exploratory missions
   to moon will be a challenge due to longer mission duration. The present
   study investigated appropriate digester technologies that could be used
   on the base. The effect of stirring, operation temperature, organic
   loading rate and reactor design on the methane production rate and
   methane yield was studied. For the same duration of digestion, the
   unmixed digester produced 20-50\% more methane than mixed system.
   Two-stage design which separated the soluble components from the solids
   and treated them separately had more rapid kinetics than one stage
   system, producing the target methane potential in one-half the retention
   time than the one stage system. The two stage system degraded 6\% more
   solids than the single stage system. The two stage design formed the
   basis of a prototype digester sized for a four-person crew during one
   year exploratory lunar mission. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Boundaries between neighboring grains with different numbers of faces
   exhibit a wide range of tendencies to occur in a structure, from high
   preference to high avoidance. These tendencies are described here in
   terms their contact affinity, which describes the extent to which an i-j
   faced grain pair actually occurs in the structure relative to that
   expected from statistically random contact. An affinity of unity
   indicates random occurrence and values above or below unity indicate the
   corresponding factor above or below random with which a particular
   pairing occurs. Grain contact affinities determined for both 3-D Monte
   Carlo grain growth simulations and experimental serial sectioned grains
   show similar trends of high affinity for contact between few- and
   many-faced grains, avoidance of contact between grains in similar face
   classes, and random contact between grains of intermediate face classes
   and all other classes. Contact affinities have been modeled in terms of
   the relative face curvatures, with high curvatures of opposite sign
   exhibiting the highest contact affinities, like signs the lowest, and
   relatively flat-faced grains showing near-random contact with all other
   classes. The measure of affinity is thus interpreted as the degree of
   stability or instability of boundaries against rapid face loss from
   topological events. The affinity approach overcomes a significant bias
   of the Aboav-Weaire analysis, which describes the average neighbors of
   face classes but is insensitive to the actual preference or avoidance
   for boundaries with other classes. The contact affinity term quantifies
   these tendencies. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Penman's sink-strength model as an improved approach to estimating plant
   canopy transpiration}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{197}},
Pages = {{136-141}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The Penman energy balance equation has become a common approach to
   estimating the evaporation of plant canopies. Unfortunately,
   implementation of the energy balance equation requires various
   assumptions and empiricisms, including ``crop coefficients{''}, so that
   in practice the Penman equation is used as a framework in which to apply
   empirical approximations. These limitations are reviewed in this paper.
   An alternative to the energy balance approach suggested by Penman was a
   ``sink strength{''} model in which the gradient in vapor pressure was
   considered the prime driver of plant water loss. In this paper, the sink
   strength model is developed for determining plant canopy transpiration
   based on explicitly defined properties of the plants. The key variables
   are the carbon assimilation pathway of photosynthesis and the
   biochemical composition of the plant material being synthesized. These
   two parameters define the transpiration efficiency coefficient and
   radiation use efficiency that are required in the calculation of
   transpiration. Also, it is necessary to define a weighted vapor pressure
   gradient for transpiration when making estimates of the amount of
   transpiration on a daily basis. The derived expression of the sink
   strength model was used to compare predicted transpiration with measured
   values of four turf grass species measured over three years. A close
   linear correlation was observed for all grasses (P < 0.0001). However,
   there was an indication that the grasses may vary slightly in their
   radiation use efficiencies, which with measurement of photosynthetic
   capacity would further improve the predicted transpiration rates. The
   ability to directly compute transpiration from explicitly defined
   variables based on plant traits offers an attractive alternative to the
   Penman energy balance approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Can climate-smart agriculture reverse the recent slowing of rice yield
   growth in China?}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{196}},
Pages = {{125-136}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Worldwide evidence indicates a reduction in the rate of yield growth for
   many key food crops, but reasons for this remain unclear. Here, we
   quantitatively demonstrate the role and significance of different
   drivers (climate change, fertilizer use, change in rice cultivation
   area, and changes in crop varieties and management) in explaining rice
   yield development in China, through the use of two temporally and
   regionally calibrated crop models - EPIC and DSSAT. China's rice yield
   has increased from 4324 kg ha(-1) in 1981 to 6553 kg ha(-1) in 2010,
   with an evidently slowing growth rate over this time period. The
   observed flattening growth trend is well captured by both crop models.
   EPIC simulated a yield increase of 2024 kg ha(-1) up to 2010, with
   agricultural intensification together with increased application of
   chemical fertilizer and improved crop varieties and management
   dominating the growth, contributing 64\% and 37\% respectively, while
   changes in climate (2\%) and cultivation area (-3\%) contributed only
   minimally. The recent slowing rate of rice yield growth is largely
   interpreted as a decreasing relative contribution of fertilizer, that is
   not being compensated by relative benefits from improved varieties and
   management. We also find that adaptation to climate change may have
   contributed to the observed increase of rice yield by facilitating the
   relocation of rice growing areas and the adoption of improved rice
   cultivars. Crop model simulations demonstrate that additional yield
   increases could be achieved through the introduction of rice cultivars
   and management optimized for climate, suggesting viable options for
   reversing the slowing of rice yield growth. Moving towards an
   agriculture that utilizes climate benefits more smartly is one of the
   solutions to enhance future food supply in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   yield similar levels of activation (1.0 x 10(19) cm(-3) in the

   upon rapid thermal annealing for 5 s at 750 degrees C despite having
   very different types of resulting damage in the electrically active
   layers. The subsequent microstructural characterization by TEM indicates
   that the highly defective regrown layers in the pre-amorphized substrate
   leads to poor mobility in the active layers, which result in lower sheet
   resistances. The results suggest that solid phase epitaxy (SPE) in
   compound semiconductors can lead to some improved activation at lower

Title = {{Efficiency and life cycle environmental impacts of ion-exchange
   regeneration using sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate salts}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{254}},
Pages = {{198-209}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to investigate the efficiency and life
   cycle environmental impacts of ion exchange (IX) regeneration using
   conventional NaCl and the alternative salts KCl, NaHCO3, and KHCO3. The
   regeneration efficiency was evaluated by considering anion exchange
   resin (AER) exhausted with nitrate and cation exchange resin (CER)
   exhausted with calcium. The regeneration efficiency of chloride was
   higher than bicarbonate for polystyrene AER, while the regeneration
   efficiency of bicarbonate was higher than chloride for polyacrylic AER.
   The regeneration efficiency of potassium was higher than sodium for all
   CERs. Because all salts showed high regeneration efficiency, assessing
   the environmental impacts of the salts from upstream and downstream
   phases was deemed key to improving the sustainability of the IX unit
   process. The increasing environmental burden of the salts was NaCl < KCl
   < KHCO3, while the impacts of NaHCO3 were greater or less than KCl
   depending on the impact category. The environmental burden was based on
   a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of mining and processing, and
   did not include disposal of the waste regeneration solution. A
   literature study regarding the environmental impacts of the regeneration
   ions indicated the potential benefit of the alternative salts over NaCl
   was due to disposal applications. For instance, disposal of KCl waste
   regeneration solution to soils can offset the demand for potassium
   fertilizer inputs and is not harmful to soil structure, and disposal of
   KHCO3 and NaHCO3 waste regeneration solution can offset the chemicals
   needed during wastewater treatment when nitrification is limited by low
   alkalinity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Volitional control of the anterior insula in criminal psychopaths using
   real-time fMRI neurofeedback: a pilot study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{This pilot study aimed to explore whether criminal psychopaths can learn
   volitional regulation of the left anterior insula with real-time fMRI
   neurofeedback. Our previous studies with healthy volunteers showed that
   learned control of the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal
   was specific to the target region, and not a result of general arousal
   and global unspecific brain activation, and also that successful
   regulation modulates emotional responses, specifically to aversive
   picture stimuli but not neutral stimuli. In this pilot study, four
   criminal psychopaths were trained to regulate the anterior insula by
   employing negative emotional imageries taken from previous episodes in
   their lives, in conjunction with contingent feedback. Only one out of
   the four participants learned to increase the percent differential BOLD
   in the up-regulation condition across training runs. Subjects with
   higher Psychopathic Checklist-Revised (PCL:SV) scores were less able to
   increase the BOLD signal in the anterior insula than their lower PCL:SV
   counterparts. We investigated functional connectivity changes in the
   emotional network due to learned regulation of the successful
   participant, by employing multivariate Granger Causality Modeling (GCM).
   Learning to up-regulate the left anterior insula not only increased the
   number of connections (causal density) in the emotional network in the
   single successful participant but also increased the difference between
   the number of outgoing and incoming connections (causal flow) of the
   left insula. This pilot study shows modest potential for training
   psychopathic individuals to learn to control brain activity in the
   anterior insula.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the distribution and dynamics of microbial community in

   pyrosequencing of 16s rRNA was conducted. It revealed the distinct
   community compositions between the two digesters and their progressive
   shifting over time. Methanogens and syntrophic bacteria were found much
   less abundant in the agitated digester, which was mainly attributed to
   the presence of bacterial genera Acetanaerobacterium and Ruminococcus
   with relatively high abundance. The characterization of the microbial
   community corroborated the digestion performance affected at the
   agitated condition, where lower methane yield and delayed methane
   production rate were observed. This was further verified by the
   accumulation of propionic acid in the agitated digester.}},

Title = {{Automatic diagnosis of melanoma using machine learning methods on a
   spectroscopic system}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early and accurate diagnosis of melanoma, the deadliest type
   of skin cancer, has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality
   rate. However, early diagnosis of melanoma is not trivial even for
   experienced dermatologists, as it needs sampling and laboratory tests
   which can be extremely complex and subjective. The accuracy of clinical
   diagnosis of melanoma is also an issue especially in distinguishing
   between melanoma and mole. To solve these problems, this paper presents
   an approach that makes non-subjective judgements based on quantitative
   measures for automatic diagnosis of melanoma.
   Methods: Our approach involves image acquisition, image processing,
   feature extraction, and classification. 187 images (19 malignant
   melanoma and 168 benign lesions) were collected in a clinic by a
   spectroscopic device that combines single-scattered, polarized light
   spectroscopy with multiple-scattered, un-polarized light spectroscopy.
   After noise reduction and image normalization, features were extracted
   based on statistical measurements (i.e. mean, standard deviation, mean
   absolute deviation, L-1 norm, and L-2 norm) of image pixel intensities
   to characterize the pattern of melanoma. Finally, these features were
   fed into certain classifiers to train learning models for
   classification.
   Results: We adopted three classifiers - artificial neural network, naive
   bayes, and k-nearest neighbour to evaluate our approach separately. The
   naive bayes classifier achieved the best performance - 89\% accuracy,
   89\% sensitivity and 89\% specificity, which was integrated with our
   approach in a desktop application running on the spectroscopic system
   for diagnosis of melanoma.
   Conclusions: Our work has two strengths. (1) We have used single
   scattered polarized light spectroscopy and multiple scattered
   unpolarized light spectroscopy to decipher the multilayered
   characteristics of human skin. (2) Our approach does not need image
   segmentation, as we directly probe tiny spots in the lesion skin and the
   image scans do not involve background skin. The desktop application for
   automatic diagnosis of melanoma can help dermatologists get a
   non-subjective second opinion for their diagnosis decision.}},

Abstract = {{The parallel replacement problem under economies of scale (PRES)
   determines minimum cost replacement schedules for each individual asset
   in a group of assets that operate in parallel. A fixed cost is incurred
   in any period in which an asset is purchased. These fixed costs induce
   economies of scale, making replacement schedules for these assets
   economically interdependent. We prove that PRES is NP-hard and present
   integer programming formulations for four variants of the problem in
   which multiple asset types, or challengers, are available for
   replacement (MPRES). We then derive valid inequalities for PRES and
   MPRES, which are similar in structure to flow cover inequalities
   developed in the context of fixed charge network problems. Experiments
   illustrate that the inequalities are effective in improving the
   integrality gap of MPRES instances.}},

Abstract = {{A general-purpose MATLAB software program called GPOPS - II is described
   for solving multiple-phase optimal control problems using variable-order
   Gaussian quadrature collocation methods. The software employs a
   Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature orthogonal collocation method where the
   continuous-time optimal control problem is transcribed to a large sparse
   nonlinear programming problem (NLP). An adaptive mesh refinement method
   is implemented that determines the number of mesh intervals and the
   degree of the approximating polynomial within each mesh interval to
   achieve a specified accuracy. The software can be interfaced with either
   quasi-Newton (first derivative) or Newton (second derivative) NLP
   solvers, and all derivatives required by the NLP solver are approximated
   using sparse finite-differencing of the optimal control problem
   functions. The key components of the software are described in detail
   and the utility of the software is demonstrated on five optimal control
   problems of varying complexity. The software described in this article
   provides researchers a useful platform upon which to solve a wide
   variety of complex constrained optimal control problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present the simulation results of phonon properties,
   including phonon dispersion relations, group velocities, phonon
   relaxation time and mode-specific thermal conductivity, of
   low-dimensional crystals using the newly developed concurrent
   atomistic-continuum (CAC) method. With significantly less number of
   degrees of freedoms than all-atom molecular dynamics, the CAC method
   predicts the phonon properties of one-dimensional (1D) polyatomic
   crystals at finite temperatures with the full anharmonicity of the
   atomic interactions being incorporated. Complete phonon branches of
   polyatomic crystals are obtained by CAC through the phonon spectral
   energy density analysis. It is shown that CAC allows medium to
   long-wavelength phonon transport from atomic to coarsely meshed finite
   element region without the need of special numerical treatment. The
   frequency-dependent phonon group velocities are explicitly measured in
   the simulation. Sub-THz phonon lifetimes in 100 -mm-long polyatomic
   chains containing 400 million of atoms are predicted. Analysis of the
   phonon mode-specific thermal conductivity shows that the medium to
   long-wavelength acoustic phonons are contributing to the majority of the
   heat transport in 1D crystal, suggesting that the long-wavelength
   phonons effectively act as thermal carriers in 1D system. This work
   provides a possible explanation for the anomalous heat transport
   observed in low-dimensional materials.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Roadside units (RSUs), which enable vehicle-to-infrastructure
   communications, are deployed along roadsides to handle the growing
   communication demands as the number of vehicles increases. The current
   opportunistic RSU-aided content dissemination schemes, however, do not
   address heterogeneous networks in terms of data items and users. We
   establish a mathematical framework to study the problem of multiple
   content dissemination under realistic RSU-aided opportunistic network
   assumptions, where: 1) mobile content items are heterogeneous in terms
   of size and lifetime; 2) vehicles' interests are different to different
   data; and 3) the RSU' storage for content dissemination is limited in
   size. We formulate the maximum data dissemination as a submodular
   function maximization (SFM) problem with multiple linear constraints
   (MLCs) of limited storage. Then, we propose an efficient heuristic
   algorithm to solve this NP-hard problem. Finally, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive simulations using
   realistic vehicular traces. The simulation results show that our
   proposed low-complexity heuristic algorithm performs much better than
   the existing feasible solutions, and it achieves similar performance to
   that of the most accurate algorithm currently available, whose
   computational complexity is unacceptable in practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple spatial equilibrium model for a linear
   monocentric city to investigate the effects of rationing and pricing on
   morning commuters' travel cost and modal choice behavior in each
   location. Under rationing and pricing, every day in the morning peak
   hour, each commuter is classified as either ``free{''} or
   ``rationed{''}. ``Free{''} commuters are allowed to use the highway
   without paying the toll, whereas ``rationed{''} commuters can avoid the
   toll only if they travel by transit. Each day, a fraction of commuters
   are rationed in their free use of the highway, and the rationing
   fractions are determined systematically so that everyone is equally
   rationed in a given period. It is found that Pareto-improving rationing
   and pricing scheme might be obtained as a combination of the rationing
   degree and the toll associated with rationing. Extension to the
   rationing and pricing scheme with cordon and park-and-ride service has
   been made. Cordon and park-and-ride might help in improving the
   efficiency of rationing and pricing strategy although remains its
   Pareto-improving property. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A combined laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman
   spectroscopy system for depth profile analyses is presented. The system
   incorporates a single 532 nm laser source, which is delivered through an
   optical fiber to the sample site. The homogenized laser beam results in
   well-defined cylindrical craters with diameters of 100 gm. LIBS depth
   profiling analyses of metals was performed applying pulse energies of
   about 1 mJ. The application of up to 500 pulses allowed to drill through
   layers of several tens of microns, while observing sharp transitions at
   the layer interfaces. The capability of the system for Raman
   spectroscopy was investigated for various polymer samples by reducing
   the pulse energies below the respective ablation threshold. A combined
   Raman/LIBS depth profiling was applied to a polymer-coated metal.
   Additionally, the capability of the system for calibration-free LIBS
   quantification (CF-LIBS) was evaluated. Quantification of major elements
   in metallic reference materials showed good agreement with the certified
   values with relative deviations of less than 30\%. Finally, the
   optimized system was applied for depth profiling and elemental
   composition analysis of ancient Roman bronze rings. Overall, the
   presented setup combines the high flexibility of a fiber-coupled system
   with Raman and micro-LIES, making the system interesting for depth
   profiling and elemental quantification in archaeometric as well as
   industrial applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a methodology to quantify a risk consistent
   directionality factor (K-d) appropriate for components and cladding
   (C\&C) on low-rise structures located In hurricane-prone regions.
   Currently the same K-d value is applied for structures in hurricane and
   non-hurricane prone regions. However, the nature of the wind hazard
   differs considerably between these regions with respect to the
   intensity, duration and direction swath of the severe wind event.
   Further, the current K-d implementation considers the vulnerability of
   individual C\&C elements in isolation. This study employs a Monte Carlo
   framework to incorporate the influence of four issues on the
   determination of a risk consistent C\&C K-d factor for hurricane prone
   structures. These issues include the hurricane duration and direction
   swath, the treatment of individual cladding elements as contributors to
   a series system, the uncertainty of the building surface peak pressure
   coefficients, and the size of the cladding elements. The issue of mean
   recurrence interval is not addressed in the presented results, but its
   future incorporation within the methodology is discussed. A specific
   revised value of K-d is not recommended herein. Rather, the methodology
   provides the means to assess the risk associated with a given K-d value.

Abstract = {{Seepage irrigation is the most common irrigation system for potato
   production in Florida, which relies on control of the water table to
   irrigate the crop. A 2-year trial was established to evaluate the
   feasibility of drip irrigation as an alternative to seepage for potato
   production. The performance of `Atlantic', `Fabula', and `Red LaSoda'
   varieties were evaluated by comparing two drip tape installation depths,
   surface (SUR) and subsurface (SUB) with seepage (SEP). The overall
   potato total yield was 25.3; 19.2 and 29.9 Mg ha(-1) for SUR, SUB and
   SEP, respectively. The SUR and SEP treatments yielded similarly for
   `Fabula' in both years and `Atlantic' in 2011. The `Red LaSoda'
   consistently obtained lower yields under both drip treatments compared
   to SEP. Conversely, drip irrigation promoted significant reduction of
   the incidence of tuber physiological disorders such as brown center,
   hollow heart, and internal heat necrosis.}},

Abstract = {{Immune dysregulation drives the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory,
   autoimmune, and dysplastic disorders. While often intended to address
   localized pathology, most immune modulatory therapies are administered
   systemically and carry inherent risk of multiorgan toxicities. Here, we
   demonstrate, in a murine model of spontaneous gastrointestinal
   polyposis, that site-specific uptake of orally administered IL10
   microparticles ameliorates local and systemic disease to enhance
   survival. Mechanistic investigations showed that the therapeutic benefit
   of this treatment derived from neutralization of disease-promoting
   FoxP3(+)RoR gamma t(+)IL17(+) pathogenic T-regulatory cells (pgTreg),
   with a concomitant restoration of FoxP3(+)RoR gamma t(-)IL17(-)
   conventional T-regulatory cells (Treg). These findings provide a
   proof-of-principle for the ability of an oral biologic to restore immune
   homeostasis at the intestinal surface. Furthermore, they implicate local
   manipulation of IL10 as a tractable therapeutic strategy to address the
   inflammatory sequelae associated with mucosal premalignancy. (C)2014

Title = {{Simultaneous real-time monitoring of multiple cortical systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Real-time monitoring of the brain is potentially valuable for
   performance monitoring, communication, training or rehabilitation. In
   natural situations, the brain performs a complex mix of various sensory,
   motor or cognitive functions. Thus, real-time brain monitoring would be
   most valuable if (a) it could decode information from multiple brain
   systems simultaneously, and (b) this decoding of each brain system were
   robust to variations in the activity of other (unrelated) brain systems.
   Previous studies showed that it is possible to decode some information
   from different brain systems in retrospect and/or in isolation. In our
   study, we set out to determine whether it is possible to simultaneously
   decode important information about a user from different brain systems
   in real time, and to evaluate the impact of concurrent activity in
   different brain systems on decoding performance. Approach. We study
   these questions using electrocorticographic signals recorded in humans.
   We first document procedures for generating stable decoding models given
   little training data, and then report their use for offline and for
   real-time decoding from 12 subjects (six for offline parameter
   optimization, six for online experimentation). The subjects engage in
   tasks that involve movement intention, movement execution and auditory
   functions, separately, and then simultaneously. Main results. Our
   real-time results demonstrate that our system can identify intention and
   movement periods in single trials with an accuracy of 80.4\% and 86.8\%,
   respectively (where 50\% would be expected by chance). Simultaneously,
   the decoding of the power envelope of an auditory stimulus resulted in
   an average correlation coefficient of 0.37 between the actual and
   decoded power envelopes. These decoders were trained separately and
   executed simultaneously in real time. Significance. This study yielded
   the first demonstration that it is possible to decode simultaneously the
   functional activity of multiple independent brain systems. Our
   comparison of univariate and multivariate decoding strategies, and our
   analysis of the influence of their decoding parameters, provides
   benchmarks and guidelines for future research on this topic.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess secondary neutron doses
   received by patients treated with proton therapy for ocular melanoma and
   craniopharyngioma. MCNPX calculations of out-of-field doses were done
   for similar to 20 different organs considering realistic treatment plans
   and using computational phantoms representative of an adult male
   individual. Simulations showed higher secondary neutron doses for
   intracranial treatments, similar to 14 mGy to the salivary glands, when
   compared with ocular treatments, similar to 0.6 mGy to the non-treated
   eye. This secondary dose increase is mainly due to the higher proton
   beam energy (178 vs. 75 MeV) as well as to the impact of the different
   beam parameters (modulation, collimation, field size etc.). Moreover,
   when compared with published data, the assessed secondary neutron doses
   showed similar trends, but sometimes with sensitive differences. This
   confirms secondary neutrons to be directly dependent on beam energy,
   modulation technique, treatment configuration and methodology.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper we discussed the methods of classification of
   citrus greening and extraction of spectral features based on the
   spectral reflectance of four different statuses of citrus leaves
   (healthy, HLB, iron deficiency and nitrogen deficiency). Between two
   classes of classification, the values of discriminability of different
   spectra were calculated to extract spectral features. The greater value
   of discriminability showed a bigger difference of the two spectra, which
   means it would be easier to distinguish the two classes. By the Fisher
   linear discriminant analysis, three classification models (HLB \&
   healthy, HLB \& iron deficiency and HLB \& nitrogen deficiency) based on
   the spectral features yielded more than 90\% accuracies, which were
   better than expected. And at last, we discussed the application of the
   classification tree in multi-class discriminant analysis and spectral
   features extraction. The models trained based on the original
   reflectance spectra, first derivative and selected spectral features
   yielded more than 88\% average accuracy, and especially the model based
   on the spectral features yielded more than 94\% average accuracies,
   which verified the feasibility of detection of citrus greening in
   multi-class discriminant analysis and the importance of the spectral
   feature extraction. The results were compared based on classification
   tree, k-NN and Bayesian classifiers. Adoption of spectral features as
   input variables was significantly superior to using the original
   spectrum, which confirmed the validity of spectral feature selection.
   Spectral features could be used well for developing a multi-spectral
   imaging system to detect the citrus greening.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a delta-sigma modulator with a new feedback
   topology in combination with the recently proposed two-step
   residue-discharging quantizer. Instead of using a single
   digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with a large number of levels, a
   mixed-mode DAC is presented which takes advantage of the two-step nature
   of the quantizer. Hence, only one feedback DAC, which is associated with
   the coarse bits (MSBs), is required for the modulator and LSBs are fed
   back as a time-modulated pulse (TMP). Therefore, high quantization
   resolution is achieved without increasing the front-end DAC complexity.
   Additionally, a new data weighted averaging (DWA) technique is proposed
   which not only suppresses the mismatch between the unit elements of the
   MSB DAC, but also aims to average out the gain error between the MSB and
   LSB DACs. Therefore, the possible quantization noise leakage is
   drastically reduced. Detailed mathematical models as well as
   comprehensive simulation results are provided to prove the efficiency of
   the proposed structure.}},

   utilizing an ontology-based simulation (OntoSim-Sugarcane) framework
   adapted to analyze groundwater table (WT) fluctuations and drainage
   practices on four farm basins in the Everglades Agricultural Area of
   south Florida.
   Utilizing two water years (WY96-97) of farm WT fluctuations observed at
   a portion (< 16 ha) of each farm basin, two parameterslateral hydraulic
   conductivities of soil profile and vertical hydraulic conductivity of
   underlying limestonewere automatically calibrated. Regardless of farms,
   the best parameter sets that minimize the objective function of daily
   root mean square error could be found after 1500 simulation runs. The
   quality of matching simulated to observed values of farm WT were further
   assessed by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE). The NSE
   ranged from 0.38 to 0.75 (calibration period, WY96-97) and 0.10 to 0.76
   (validation period, WY98-99) on all four farms. These results indicate
   that this coupling strengthens the capability of OntoSim-Sugarcane to
   model hydrology by objectively finding the best parameter sets.

Abstract = {{The dynamics associated with lateral circulation in a tidally driven
   estuarine channel is analyzed on the basis of streamwise vorticity.
   Without rotational effects, differential advection and diffusive
   boundary mixing produce two counterrotating vortices (in the
   cross-channel section) whose strength and sense of circulation may
   change during a tidal cycle. The streamwise vorticity equation is
   determined by a balance between baroclinic forcing and turbulent
   diffusion, which explains the flood ebb asymmetry of the lateral
   circulation. Analysis of the lateral salinity gradient shows that
   differential advection is the main driver of lateral flows, but boundary
   mixing can also be an important contributor in stratified estuaries. The
   strength of lateral circulation decreases with increasing
   stratification. With rotational effects, the lateral Ekman forcing in
   the bottom boundary layer drives a one-cell lateral circulation that
   switches its sense of rotation over the tidal cycle. The vorticity
   budget analysis reveals a three-way balance among the tilting of
   planetary vorticity by the vertical shear in the along-channel current,
   baroclinic forcing, and turbulent diffusion. The structure and magnitude
   of the lateral circulation change with the width of the estuary,
   expressed nondimensionally as the Kelvin number Ke. This lateral
   circulation features two counterrotating vortices in narrow estuaries,
   one vortex filling up the entire cross section in estuaries of
   intermediate widths and one vortex confined to the left side (looking
   into the estuary) in wide estuaries. The magnitude of the streamwise
   vorticity increases rapidly with Ke, reaches a maximum at Ke approximate
   to 0.5, and decreases slightly in wide estuaries subject to strong
   rotational control.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Asynchronous stimulation has been shown to reduce fatigue
   during electrical stimulation; however, it may also exhibit a force
   ripple. We quantified the ripple during asynchronous and conventional
   single-channel transcutaneous stimulation across a range of stimulation
   frequencies. Methods: The ripple was measured during 5 asynchronous
   stimulation protocols, 2 conventional stimulation protocols, and 3
   volitional contractions in 12 healthy individuals. Results: Conventional
   40 HZ and asynchronous 16 HZ stimulation were found to induce
   contractions that were as smooth as volitional contractions.
   Asynchronous 8, 10, and 12 HZ stimulation induced contractions with
   significant ripple. Conclusions: Lower stimulation frequencies can
   reduce fatigue; however, they may also lead to increased ripple. Future
   efforts should study the relationship between force ripple and the
   smoothness of the evoked movements in addition to the relationship
   between stimulation frequency and NMES-induced fatigue to elucidate an
   optimal stimulation frequency for asynchronous stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{When released into natural aquatic systems, cerium oxide (CeO2)
   nanoparticles (NPs) may have toxic effects to the ecosystems and public
   health; it is thus important to understand their environmental fate and
   transport. This work studied the effects of humic acid (HA)
   concentrations (0-10 mg L-1) and solution chemistry (ionic strength (IS)
   and pH) on the retention and transport of CeO2 NPs in water-saturated
   porous media under environmental relevant conditions. HA and IS showed
   remarkable effect on the retention and transport of CeO2 NPs in the
   porous media. Even at low concentrations (i.e., 5 and 10 mg L-1), HA
   stabilized CeO2 NPs in the suspensions by introducing both negative
   surface charge and steric repulsion and thus enhanced their mobility in
   the porous media. When solution HA concentration increased or ionic
   strength decreased, mobility of CeO2 NPs in the porous media enhanced
   dramatically. Solution pH, however, had little influence on the mobility
   of the CeO2 NPs under the tested experimental conditions, and increasing
   solution pH only slightly increased the transport of the NPs.
   Mathematical models were applied to describe the experimental data.
   Predictions from the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO)
   theory and advection-dispersion-reaction (ADR) model matched the
   experimental data well.}},

Abstract = {{Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) refers to a vascular anomaly where
   arteries and veins are directly connected through a complex, tangled web
   of abnormal AV fistulae without a normal capillary network. Hereditary
   hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) types 1 and 2 arise from heterozygous
   mutations in endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1),
   respectively. HHT patients possess AVMs in various organs, and
   telangiectases (small AVMs) along the mucocutaneous surface.
   Understanding why and how AVMs develop is crucial for developing
   therapies to inhibit the formation, growth, or maintenance of AVMs in
   HHT patients. Previously, we have shown that secondary factors such as
   wounding are required for Alk1-deficient vessels to develop skin AVMs.
   Here, we present evidences that AVMs establish from nascent arteries and
   veins rather than from remodeling of a preexistent capillary network in
   the wound-induced skin AVM model. We also show that VEGF can mimic the
   wound effect on skin AVM formation, and VEGF-neutralizing antibody can
   prevent skin AVM formation and ameliorate internal bleeding in
   Alk1-deficient adult mice. With topical applications at different stages
   of AVM development, we demonstrate that the VEGF blockade can prevent
   the formation of AVM and cease the progression of AVM development. Taken
   together, the presented experimental model is an invaluable system for
   precise molecular mechanism of action of VEGF blockades as well as for
   preclinical screening of drug candidates for epistaxis and
   gastrointestinal bleedings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the family of CVaR norms in , based on the CVaR

   to the non-scaled CVaR norm. We present two relatively simple
   definitions of the CVaR norm: (i) as the average or the sum of some
   percentage of largest absolute values of components of vector; (ii) as
   an optimal solution of a CVaR minimization problem suggested by
   Rockafellar and Uryasev. CVaR norms are piece-wise linear functions on
   and can be used in various applications where the Euclidean norm is
   typically used. To illustrate, in the computational experiments we
   consider the problem of projecting a point onto a polyhedral set. The
   CVaR norm allows formulating this problem as a convex or linear program

Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Patients with osteoarthritis (OA) primarily seek treatment due to pain
   and disability, yet the primary endpoints for rodent OA models tend to
   be histological measures of joint destruction. The discrepancy between
   clinical and preclinical evaluations is problematic, given that
   radiographic evidence of OA in humans does not always correlate to the
   severity of patient-reported symptoms. Recent advances in behavioral
   analyses have provided new methods to evaluate disease sequelae in
   rodents. Of particular relevance to rodent OA models are methods to
   assess rodent gait. While obvious differences exist between quadrupedal
   and bipedal gait sequences, the gait abnormalities seen in humans and in
   rodent OA models reflect similar compensatory behaviors that protect an
   injured limb from loading. The purpose of this review is to describe
   these compensations and current methods used to assess rodent gait
   characteristics, while detailing important considerations for the
   selection of gait analysis methods in rodent OA models.}},

   (BRKGA). Given a nonlinear system, we construct a corresponding
   optimization problem, which we solve multiple times, making use of a
   BRKGA, with areas of repulsion around roots that have already been
   found. The heuristic makes no use of derivative information. We
   illustrate the approach on seven nonlinear equations systems with
   multiple roots from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as one of the major trends for
   the next evolution of the Internet, where billions of physical objects
   or things (including but not limited to humans) will be connected over
   the Internet, and a vast amount of information data will be shared among
   them. However, the current Internet was built on a host-centric
   communication model, which was primarily designed formeeting the demand
   of pair-wise peer-to-peer communications and cannot well accommodate
   various advanced data-centric services boosted by the IoT in which users
   care about content and are oblivious to locations where the content is
   stored. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for the future
   Internet based on information-centric networking (ICN), which is called
   DataClouds, to better accommodate data-centric services. Different from
   existing ICN-based architectures, we take the sharing nature of
   data-centric services under the IoT into consideration and introduce
   logically and physically formed communities as the basic building blocks
   to construct the network so that data could be more efficiently shared
   and disseminated among interested users. We also elaborate on several
   fundamental design challenges for the Internet under this new
   architecture and show that DataClouds could offer more efficient and
   flexible solutions than traditional ICN-based architectures.}},

Title = {{Correlation between swift effects and tension-compression asymmetry in
   various polycrystalline materials}},

Abstract = {{The Swift phenomenon, which refers to the occurrence of permanent axial
   deformation during monotonic free-end torsion, has been known for a very
   long time. While plastic anisotropy is considered to be its main cause,
   there is no explanation as to why in certain materials irreversible
   elongation occurs while in others permanent shortening is observed.
   In this paper, a correlation between Swift effects and the stress-strain
   behavior in uniaxial tension and compression is established. It is based
   on an elastic-plastic model that accounts for the combined influence of
   anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. It is shown that, if for a
   given orientation the uniaxial yield stress in tension is larger than
   that in compression, the specimen will shorten when twisted about that
   direction; however, if the yield stress in uniaxial compression is
   larger than that in uniaxial tension, axial elongation will occur.
   Furthermore, it is shown that on the basis of a few simple mechanical
   tests it is possible to predict the particularities of the plastic
   response in torsion for both isotropic and initially anisotropic
   materials. Unlike other previous interpretations of the Swift effects,
   which were mainly based on crystal plasticity and/or texture evolution,
   it is explained the occurrence of Swift effects at small to moderate
   plastic strains. In particular, the very good quantitative agreement
   between model and data for a strongly anisotropic AZ31-Mg alloy confirm
   the correlation established in this work between tension-compression
   asymmetry and Swift effects. Furthermore, it is explained why the sign
   of the axial plastic strains that develop depends on the twisting
   direction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hole transport materials are critical to the performance of organic
   light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). While
   1,1-bis(di-4-tolylaminophenyl)cyclohexane (TAPC) with a high triplet
   energy is widely used for high efficiency phosphorescent OLEDs, devices
   using TAPC as a hole transport layer (HTL) have a short operating
   lifetime due to the build-up of trapped charges at the TAPC/emitting
   layer (EML) interface during device operation. In this work, to solve
   the operating stability problem, instead of using conventional HTLs, we
   use a(fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III))(Ir(ppy)3) doped layer as
   an HTL to replace the conventional HTLs. Because of the hole injecting
   and transporting abilities of the phosphorescent dye, holes can be
   directly injected into the emitting layer without an injection barrier.
   OLEDs based on a phosphorescent dye-doped HTL show significant
   improvement in operational stability without loss of efficiency. (C)

Abstract = {{In calm sea environments and for compact architectures, the power
   generation performance of wave energy converters may be drastically
   inhibited due to undesired dissipative effects in the conversion
   mechanisms. This research develops an alternative power take-off
   methodology to surmount these challenges and to enable practical wave
   energy conversion for mobile converter architectures that could power
   monitoring instrumentation or telecommunications. Building upon related
   research findings and engineering insights, the basis for energy
   conversion is the harnessing of impulsive kinetics induced as a
   multistable structure is extended and compressed. A prototype system is
   built and analyzed to evaluate the potential for this conversion
   framework. Composed of modular ``cells{''}, the chain-like platform
   exhibits an increased number of stable configurations with each
   additional unit cell. Extension and compression of one end of the
   multistable chain (representative of wave heaving) while the opposing
   end remains mostly fixed, excites high frequency inter-cell dynamics due
   to impulsive transitions amongst configurations that are converted to
   electric current through electromagnetic induction. An experimentally
   validated model is utilized to gain insight towards successful
   realization of the power conversion concept and design guidelines are
   derived to maximize performance and ensure viability. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present work builds on the success of a dielectric barrier discharge
   driven plasma channel by exploring an electrode configuration that
   directly actuates the bulk fluid minimizing jet impingement and
   viscosity related losses. Influence of several electrical and physical
   parameters including electrode materials are experimentally
   investigated. Results indicate significant variation of performance with
   these parameters and suggest that in comparison to surface dielectric
   barrier plasma actuator driven flows, at least an order of magnitude
   improvement in efficiency is possible. The jet produced from this plasma
   channel configuration allows greater versatility for applications in
   boundary layer flow control and internal flows. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{An unusual natural lightning flash containing two branched negative

   cloud at a height of about 3.5 km above ground level. The first leader
   showed profuse branching and what appears to be corona-like formations
   with spatial extent of 100 to 200 m (probably an intensified portion of
   radial corona sheath) at the upper part of the channel. Leader branching
   process facilitated by two simultaneous space stems was observed. The
   corresponding step lengths were estimated to be 14 and 15 m. The
   first-stroke attachment process involved a streamer zone about 50 m in
   length. One of the second-leader branches appeared to abruptly change

Abstract = {{Electric field derivative (dE/dt) pulse waveforms from
   dart-stepped-leaders in rocket-and-wire triggered lightning, recorded a
   distance of 226m from the channel base, are characterized. A single
   dE/dt pulse associated with a leader step consists of a fast initial
   rise of the same polarity as the following return stroke followed by an
   opposite polarity overshoot of smaller amplitude and subsequent decay to
   background level, without superimposed secondary pulses. A ``slow
   front{''} often precedes the fast initial rise. For 47 single dE/dt
   leader pulses occurring during the final 15 mu s of 24
   dart-stepped-leaders, the pulse mean half-peak width was 76 ns, mean
   10-to-90\% risetime 73 ns, and mean range-normalized peak amplitude 2.5
   V/m/mu s. For integrated dE/dt, the mean half-peak width was 214 ns and
   the mean range-normalized peak amplitude 0.21 V/m. Most
   dart-stepped-leader dE/dt pulses are more complex than a single pulse.
   Interpulse interval and average peak amplitude range normalized to 100
   km were measured for both single and complex dE/dt pulses during the
   final 15 mu s of 10 dart-stepped-leaders preceding triggered return
   strokes with peak currents ranging from 8.1 to 31.4 kA. The average
   range-normalized dE/dt and numerically integrated dE/dt (electric field)
   peak amplitude increased from 0.9 to 4.9 V/m/mu s and 0.13 to 0.47 V/m,
   respectively, with increasing return stroke peak current while the
   interpulse interval remained relatively constant at about 2 mu s. Strong
   positive linear correlations were found between both average
   range-normalized peak pulse amplitude and interstroke interval versus
   the following return stroke peak current.}},

Title = {{Taylor dispersion in oscillatory flow in rectangular channels}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{183-197}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on exploring the effect of the side walls on
   dispersion in oscillatory Poiseuille flows in rectangular channels. The
   method of multiple time scales with regular expansions is utilized to
   obtain analytical expressions for the effective dispersivity D-3D{*}.
   The dispersion coefficient is of the form D-3D{*}/Pe(2) = f(Omega
   equivalent to omega h(2)/D, Sc equivalent to D/v, chi equivalent to w/h)
   where Pe equivalent to < u > h/D, < u > is the root mean square of the
   cross-section averaged velocity, omega is the angular velocity, 2w and
   2h are, respectively, the width and the height of the cross-section. D
   is the solute diffusivity, and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity. The
   analytical results are compared with full numerical simulations and
   asymptotic expressions. Also effect of various parameters on dispersion
   coefficient is explored. For small oscillation frequency Omega the
   dispersion coefficient approaches the time averaged dispersion of the
   Poiseuille flow and for large Omega, D-3D{*} scales as Pe(2)/Omega(2)
   where Pe = < u > h/D. Due to its relative simplicity, the 2D model is
   frequently utilized for calculating dispersion in channels. However at
   small dimensionless frequencies the 20 model can significantly
   underestimate the dispersion, particularly for channels with large chi.
   At large Omega the dispersion coefficient predicted from the 20 model
   becomes reasonably accurate, particularly for channels with large chi.
   For a square channel, the 20 prediction is reasonably accurate for all
   frequencies. The results of this study will enhance our understanding of
   transport in microscale systems that are subjected to oscillating flows,
   and potentially aid technological advances in diverse areas relevant to
   microfluidic devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species threaten biodiversity and incur costs exceeding
   billions of US\$. Eradication efforts, however, are nearly always
   unsuccessful. Throughoutmuch of North America, land managers have used
   expensive, and ultimately ineffective, techniques to combat invasive
   Phragmites australis in marshes. Here, we reveal that Phragmites may
   potentially be controlled by employing an affordable measure from its
   native European range: livestock grazing. Experimental field tests
   demonstrate that rotational goat grazing (where goats have no choice but
   to graze Phragmites) can reduce Phragmites cover from 100 to 20\% and
   that cows and horses also readily consume this plant. These results,
   combined with the fact that Europeans have suppressed Phragmites through
   seasonal livestock grazing for 6,000 years, suggest Phragmites
   management can shift to include more economical and effective top-down
   control strategies. More generally, these findings support an emerging
   paradigm shift in conservation from high-cost eradication to
   economically sustainable control of dominant invasive species.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a three-dimensional numerical model that simulates
   the H-2 production from coal-derived syngas via a water-gas shift
   reaction in membrane reactors. The reactor was operated at a temperature
   of 900 degrees C, the typical syngas temperature at gasifier exit. The
   effects of membrane permeance, syngas composition, reactant residence
   time, sweep gas flow rate and steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio on reactor
   performance were examined. Using CO conversion and H-2 recovery to
   characterize the reactor performance, it was found that the reactor
   performance can be enhanced using higher sweep gas flow rate, membrane
   permeance and S/C ratio. However, CO conversion and H-2 recovery
   limiting values were found when these parameters were further increased.
   The numerical results also indicated that the reactor performance
   degraded with increasing CO2 content in the syngas composition.

Abstract = {{Substantial increases in pediatric and adult obesity in the US have
   prompted a major revision to the current UF/NCI (University of
   Florida/National Cancer Institute) family of hybrid computational
   phantoms to more accurately reflect current trends in larger body
   morphometry. A decision was made to construct the new library in a
   gridded fashion by height/weight without further reference to
   age-dependent weight/height percentiles as these become quickly
   outdated. At each height/weight combination, circumferential parameters
   were defined and used for phantom construction. All morphometric data
   for the new library were taken from the CDC NHANES survey data over the
   time period 1999-2006, the most recent reported survey period. A subset
   of the phantom library was then used in a CT organ dose sensitivity
   study to examine the degree to which body morphometry influences the
   magnitude of organ doses for patients that are underweight to morbidly
   obese in body size. Using primary and secondary morphometric parameters,
   grids containing 100 adult male height/weight bins, 93 adult female
   height/weight bins, 85 pediatric male height/weight bins and 73
   pediatric female height/weight bins were constructed. These grids served
   as the blueprints for construction of a comprehensive library of
   patient-dependent phantoms containing 351 computational phantoms. At a
   given phantom standing height, normalized CT organ doses were shown to
   linearly decrease with increasing phantom BMI for pediatric males, while
   curvilinear decreases in organ dose were shown with increasing phantom
   BMI for adult females. These results suggest that one very useful
   application of the phantom library would be the construction of a
   pre-computed dose library for CT imaging as needed for patient
   dose-tracking.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach for the synthesis of ultra-long (up to similar to 45 mu
   m) vertically aligned barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanowire (NW) arrays on
   an oxidized Ti substrate is developed. The fabrication method uses a
   two-step hydrothermal reaction that firstly, involves the growth of
   ultra-long aligned sodium titanate NW arrays and secondly, involves the
   transfer of these precursor sodium titanate NW arrays to BaTiO3 NW
   arrays while retaining the shape of the template nanowires. The
   ion-exchange during the second hydrothermal reaction in barium hydroxide
   solution results in the structural transformation from single-crystal
   sodium titanate NW arrays to BaTiO3 NW arrays. This synthesis approach
   is low-cost, scalable, and enables control over the morphology and
   aspect ratio of the resulting BaTiO3 NW arrays by tuning the
   hydrothermal reaction parameters. In addition to the synthesis methods
   reported here, the energy harvesting behavior of the BaTiO3 NW arrays is
   evaluated as a function of their aspect ratio and demonstrated to
   produce significant impact on the energy produced. The newly developed
   hydrothermal synthesis process for controlled growth of ultra-long,
   vertically aligned BaTiO3 NW arrays provides a promising method for
   their efficient utilization in nano-electromechanical system-based
   sensors, energy harvesters, and nano-scale electronic devices.}},

Title = {{Novel image markers for non-small cell lung cancer classification and
   survival prediction}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common type of
   lung cancer, is one of serious diseases causing death for both men and
   women. Computer-aided diagnosis and survival prediction of NSCLC, is of
   great importance in providing assistance to diagnosis and personalize
   therapy planning for lung cancer patients.
   Results: In this paper we have proposed an integrated framework for
   NSCLC computer-aided diagnosis and survival analysis using novel image
   markers. The entire biomedical imaging informatics framework consists of
   cell detection, segmentation, classification, discovery of image
   markers, and survival analysis. A robust seed detection-guided cell
   segmentation algorithm is proposed to accurately segment each individual
   cell in digital images. Based on cell segmentation results, a set of
   extensive cellular morphological features are extracted using efficient
   feature descriptors. Next, eight different classification techniques
   that can handle high-dimensional data have been evaluated and then
   compared for computer-aided diagnosis. The results show that the random
   forest and adaboost offer the best classification performance for NSCLC.
   Finally, a Cox proportional hazards model is fitted by component-wise
   likelihood based boosting. Significant image markers have been
   discovered using the bootstrap analysis and the survival prediction
   performance of the model is also evaluated.
   Conclusions: The proposed model have been applied to a lung cancer
   dataset that contains 122 cases with complete clinical information. The
   classification performance exhibits high correlations between the
   discovered image markers and the subtypes of NSCLC. The survival
   analysis demonstrates strong prediction power of the statistical model
   built from the discovered image markers.}},

Title = {{Surface micropattern limits bacterial contamination}},
Journal = {{ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE AND INFECTION CONTROL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bacterial surface contamination contributes to transmission
   of nosocomial infections. Chemical cleansers used to control surface
   contamination are often toxic and incorrectly implemented. Additional
   non-toxic strategies should be combined with regular cleanings to
   mitigate risks of human error and further decrease rates of nosocomial
   infections. The Sharklet micropattern (MP), inspired by shark skin, is
   an effective tool for reducing bacterial load on surfaces without toxic
   additives. The studies presented here were carried out to investigate
   the MP surfaces capability to reduce colonization of
   methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and
   methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) compared to smooth control
   surfaces.
   Methods: The MP and smooth surfaces produced in acrylic film were
   compared for remaining bacterial contamination and colonization
   following inoculation. Direct sampling of surfaces was carried out after
   inoculation by immersion, spray, and/or touch methods. Ultimately, a
   combination assay was developed to assess bacterial contamination after
   touch transfer inoculation combined with drying (persistence) to mimic
   common environmental contamination scenarios in the clinic or hospital
   environment. The combination transfer and persistence assay was then
   used to test antimicrobial copper beside the MP for the ability to
   reduce MSSA and MRSA challenge.
   Results: The MP reduced bacterial contamination with log reductions
   ranging from 87-99\% (LR = 0.90-2.18; p < 0.05) compared to smooth
   control surfaces. The MP was more effective than the 99.9\% pure copper
   alloy C11000 at reducing surface contamination of S. aureus (MSSA and
   MRSA) through transfer and persistence of bacteria. The MP reduced MSSA
   by as much as 97\% (LR = 1.54; p < 0.01) and MRSA by as much as 94\% (LR
   = 1.26; p < 0.005) compared to smooth controls. Antimicrobial copper had
   no significant effect on MSSA contamination, but reduced MRSA
   contamination by 80\% (LR = 0.70; p < 0.005).
   Conclusion: The assays developed in this study mimic hospital
   environmental contamination events to demonstrate the performance of a
   MP to limit contamination under multiple conditions. Antimicrobial
   copper has been implemented in hospital room studies to evaluate its
   impact on nosocomial infections and a decrease in HAI rate was shown.
   Similar implementation of the MP has potential to reduce the incidence
   of HAIs although future clinical studies will be necessary to validate
   the MP's true impact.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a finite-element-based algorithm for the reconstruction of

   The absolute temperature over time is then calculated using the
   recovered temperature-dependent acoustic speed. To validate our method,
   photoacoustic measurements were conducted using a graphene
   nanosheet-containing target embedded in a 20-mm-diameter tissue-like
   phantom with varied heating power. The results obtained suggest that
   quantitatively accurate temperature images can be produced, suggesting
   that our method may serve as a tool to guide and monitor the temperature
   distribution in tissue in real time noninvasively and to improve the
   safety and efficacy of thermotherapy. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Age is known to induce remodeling and stiffening of large-conduit
   arteries; however, little is known of the effects of age on remodeling
   and mechanical properties of coronary resistance arteries. We employed a
   rat model of aging to investigate whether 1) age increases wall
   thickness and stiffness of coronary resistance arteries, and 2) exercise
   training reverses putative age-induced increases in wall thickness and
   stiffness of coronary resistance arteries. Young (4 mo) and old (21 mo)
   Fischer 344 rats remained sedentary or underwent 10 wk of treadmill
   exercise training. Coronary resistance arteries were isolated for
   determination of wall-to-lumen ratio, effective elastic modulus, and
   active and passive responses to changes in intraluminal pressure.
   Elastin and collagen content of the vascular wall were assessed
   histologically. Wall-to-lumen ratio increased with age, but this
   increase was reversed by exercise training. In contrast, age reduced
   stiffness, and exercise training increased stiffness in coronary
   resistance arteries from old rats. Myogenic responsiveness was reduced
   with age and restored by exercise training. Collagen-to-elastin ratio
   (C/E) of the wall did not change with age and was reduced with exercise
   training in arteries from old rats. Thus age induces hypertrophic
   remodeling of the vessel wall and reduces the stiffness and myogenic
   function of coronary resistance arteries. Exercise training reduces
   wall-to-lumen ratio, increases wall stiffness, and restores myogenic
   function in aged coronary resistance arteries. The restorative effect of
   exercise training on myogenic function of coronary resistance arteries
   may be due to both changes in vascular smooth muscle phenotype and
   expression of extracellular matrix proteins.}},

Abstract = {{We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed
   desorption (TPD) to investigate the oxidation of Tb2O3(111) films on
   Pt(111) by gaseous oxygen atoms. We find that plasma-generated O atom
   beams are highly effective at completely oxidizing the Tb2O3 films to
   TbO2 at 300 K, for film thicknesses up to at least seven layers. Heating
   to similar to 1000 K in ultrahigh vacuum restores the films to the Tb2O3
   stoichiometry and produces two distinct O-2 TPD features centered at
   similar to 385 and 660 K, which we attribute to the release of lattice
   oxygen from the surface vs bulk trilayers, respectively. We also find
   that the adsorption of plasma-activated oxygen at 90 K produces a weakly
   bound state of oxygen on the TbOx films which desorbs between similar to
   100 and 270 K during TPD. This oxygen state is consistent with a form of
   chemisorbed oxygen, possibly an atomic and/or molecular species that
   bonds on-top of Tb atoms at the surface. TPD experiments of the
   oxidation of (Tb2O3)-O-18 films by O-16 atom beams demonstrate that
   oxygen desorption below about 500 K originates almost entirely from the
   oxygen that is added to the Tb2O3 film and that all isotopic
   combinations of O-2 desorb from the bulk above 500 K, though the
   relative amount of O-18 to O-16 which desorbs above 500 K is lower than
   that determined from the isotopic composition of the oxidized TbOx
   films. These results support the idea that oxygen desorption below 500 K
   originates from oxygen species that are localized at the surface and
   further suggest that the oxide structure only partially accommodates
   oxygen atoms that incorporate into lattice sites at 300 K.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-continuous electrokinetic dewatering process, representing an
   intermediate step in development of a technology for continuous
   electrokinetic dewatering of phosphatic clay suspensions, was designed
   and evaluated through measurement of supernatant turbidity, pH, and
   changes in solids content. The influence of feed flow rate, electric
   field, and electrode separation was evaluated. The results showed that
   low-turbidity water can be separated from a clay solids suspension by a
   combination of electrokinetic dewatering and free settling. This work
   also suggests that separation can be enhanced at larger electric fields
   and that optimized separation may be achieved at a residence time of 11
   h for this specific configuration. The energy requirement for this
   operation was shown to be consistent with previously published results
   for batch operation. The results provide guidance for the on-going
   development of a device for fully-continuous electrokinetic dewatering
   of phosphatic clay suspensions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Here we report spectroscopic studies on the interaction of negatively
   charged, amphiphilic polyphenylene ethynylene (PPE) polymers with
   liposomes prepared either from negative, positive or zwitterionic
   lipids. Emission spectra of PPEs of 7 and 49 average repeat units
   bearing carboxylate terminated side chains showed that the polymer
   embeds within positively charged lipids where it exists as free chains.
   No interaction was observed between PPEs and negatively charged lipids.
   Here the polymer remained aggregated giving rise to broad emission
   spectra characteristic of the aggregate species. In zwitterionic lipids,
   we observed that the majority of the polymer remained aggregated yet a
   small fraction readily embedded within the membrane. Titration
   experiments revealed that saturation of zwitterionic lipids with polymer
   typically occurred at a polymer repeat unit to lipid mole ratio close to
   0.05. No further membrane embedding was observed above that point. For
   liposomes prepared from positively charged lipids, saturation was
   observed at a PPE repeat unit to lipid mole ratio of similar to 0.1 and
   liposome precipitation was observed above this point. FRET studies
   showed that precipitation was preceded by lipid mixing and liposome
   fusion induced by the PPEs. This behavior was prominent for the longer
   polymer and negligible for the shorter polymer at a repeat unit to lipid
   mole ratio of 0.05. We postulate that fusion is the consequence of
   membrane destabilization whereby the longer polymer gives rise to more
   extensive membrane deformation than the shorter polymer.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{This letter reports the structural, dielectric, ferroelectric, and
   magnetic properties of Fe substituted SrTiO3 thin films in room
   temperature. The structural data obtained from x-ray diffraction
   indicates that (Fe-x, Sr1-x)TiO3, the so called FST, transforms from
   pseudocubic to tetragonal structures with increase of the Fe content in
   SrTiO3 thin films, featuring the ferroelectricity, while vibrating
   sample magnetometer measurements show magnetic hysteresis loops for the
   samples with low iron contents indicating their ferromagnetism. The
   characterized ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism confirms strong
   multiferroitism of the single phase FST thin films in room temperature.
   Also, an FST thin film metal-insulator-metal multiferroic capacitor has
   been fabricated and characterized in microwave frequencies between 10
   MHz and 5 GHz. A capacitor based on Fe0.1Sr0.9TiO3 with a thickness of
   260 nm shows a high electric tunability of 18.6\% at 10V and a maximum
   magnetodielectric value of 1.37\% at 0.4mT with a loss tangent of 0.021
   at 1 GHz. This high tuning and low loss makes this material as a good
   candidate for frequency agile microwave devices such as tunable filters,
   phase shifters, and antennas. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Networked embedded systems typically leverage a collection of low-power
   embedded systems (nodes) to collaboratively execute applications
   spanning diverse application domains (e.g., video, image processing,
   communication, etc.) with diverse application requirements. The
   individual networked nodes must operate under stringent constraints
   (e.g., energy, memory, etc.) and should be specialized to meet varying
   applications' requirements in order to adhere to these constraints.
   Phase-based tuning specializes a system's tunable parameters to the
   varying runtime requirements of an application's different phases of
   execution to meet optimization goals. Since the design space for tunable
   systems can be very large, one of the major challenges in phase-based
   tuning is determining the best configuration for each phase without
   incurring significant tuning overhead (e.g., energy and/or performance)
   during design space exploration. In this paper, we propose phase
   distance mapping, which directly determines the best configuration for a
   phase, thereby eliminating design space exploration. Phase distance
   mapping applies the correlation between a known phase's characteristics
   and best configuration to determine a new phase's best configuration
   based on the new phase's characteristics. Experimental results verify
   that our phase distance mapping approach, when applied to cache tuning,
   determines cache configurations within 1 \% of the optimal
   configurations on average and yields an energy delay product savings of
   27 \% on average.}},

Abstract = {{Muscle sensory neurons innervating muscle spindles and Golgi tendon
   organs encode length and force changes essential to proprioception.
   Additional afferent fibers monitor other characteristics of the muscle
   environment, including metabolite buildup, temperature, and nociceptive
   stimuli. Overall, abnormal activation of sensory neurons can lead to
   movement disorders or chronic pain syndromes. We describe the isolation
   of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle and nerve for in vitro
   study of stretch-evoked afferent responses in the adult mouse. Sensory
   activity is recorded from the nerve with a suction electrode and
   individual afferents can be analyzed using spike sorting software. In
   vitro preparations allow for well controlled studies on sensory
   afferents without the potential confounds of anesthesia or altered
   muscle perfusion. Here we describe a protocol to identify and test the
   response of muscle spindle afferents to stretch. Importantly, this
   preparation also supports the study of other subtypes of muscle
   afferents, response properties following drug application and the
   incorporation of powerful genetic approaches and disease models in mice.}},

Abstract = {{Spatio-temporal prediction of levels of an environmental exposure is an
   important problem in environmental epidemiology. Our work is motivated
   by multiple studies on the spatio-temporal distribution of mobile
   source, or traffic related, particles in the greater Boston area. When
   multiple sources of exposure information are available, a joint model
   that pools information across sources maximizes data coverage over both
   space and time, thereby reducing the prediction error.
   We consider a Bayesian hierarchical framework in which a joint model
   consists of a set of submodels, one for each data source, and a model
   for the latent process that serves to relate the submodels to one
   another. If a submodel depends on the latent process nonlinearly,
   inference using standard MCMC techniques can be computationally
   prohibitive. The implications are particularly severe when the data for
   each submodel are aggregated at different temporal scales.
   To make such problems tractable, we linearize the nonlinear components
   with respect to the latent process and induce sparsity in the covariance
   matrix of the latent process using compactly supported covariance
   functions. We propose an efficient MCMC scheme that takes advantage of
   these approximations. We use our model to address a temporal change of
   support problem whereby interest focuses on pooling daily and multiday
   black carbon readings in order to maximize the spatial coverage of the
   study region.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of agricultural drought on crop
   yields, through integration of crop growth models and remote sensing
   observations. The soil moisture (SM) product from SM and Ocean Salinity
   (SMOS) mission obtained at 25 km was downscaled to a spatial resolution
   of 1 km, compatible with the crop models. The downscaling algorithm is
   based upon information theoretic learning and uses data-driven
   probabilistic relationships between high-resolution remotely sensed
   products that are sensitive to SM and in situ SM. The downscaled SM
   values are assimilated in the crop model using an Ensemble Kalman
   filter-based augmented state-vector technique that estimates states and
   parameters simultaneously. The downscaling and assimilation framework
   are implemented for predominantly agricultural region of the lower
   La-Plata Basin (LPB) in Brazil during two growing seasons. This rain-fed
   region was affected by agricultural drought in the second season,
   indicated by markedly lower precipitation compared to the first growing
   season. The downscaled SM was compared with the in situ SM at a
   validation site and the root mean square difference (RMSD) was 0.045
   m(3)/m(3). The crop yields estimated by the downscaling-assimilation
   framework were compared with those provided by the Companhia Nacional de
   Asastecimento (CONAB) and Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
   Estatistica (IBGE). The assimilated yields are improved during both
   seasons with increased improvement during the second season that was
   affected by agricultural drought. The differences between the
   assimilated and observed crop yields were 16.8\% during the first
   growing season and 4.37\% during the second season.}},

Abstract = {{Wind conditions can change the uniformity of spray deposition in
   orchards by deflecting the spray droplet trajectory or reducing its
   speed. Inadequate pesticide deposition on tree foliage may reduce the
   pesticide efficacy, whereas overdosing is uneconomical and harmful to
   the environment. A field study was conducted to determine wind effects
   on spray deposition at different distances from an air-assisted sprayer.
   The sprayer was driven at two speeds in two travel directions with two
   different nozzle sizes in an open field (no trees). Using Pyranine-10G
   as tracer, spray droplet movement was sampled on artificial targets. The
   targets were located on both sides at 3, 6, and 9 m from the sprayer
   centerline and at I, 2, and 3 m height within each distance. The samples
   were analyzed fluorometrically. Wind components perpendicular to the
   sprayer path increased the deposition downwind while reducing it upwind.
   Higher wind speeds increased the differences between the depositions on
   the two sides of the sprayer. The changes in deposition were clearer at
   farther distances from the sprayer. Overall, the downwind-to-upwind
   deposition ratios at 3, 6, and 9 m distances were 1.2, 2.1, and 11.9,
   respectively. Driving against the wind (headwind) gave less deposition
   than driving in the wind direction (tailwind). In all cases, reducing
   the sprayer ground speed increased the deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have limited federal protections for
   geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) except where a significant nexus
   to a navigable water body is demonstrated. Geographic isolation does not
   imply GIWs are hydrologically disconnected; indeed, wetland-groundwater
   interactions may yield important controls on regional hydrology.
   Differences in specific yield (S-y) between uplands and inundated GIWs
   drive differences in water level responses to precipitation and
   evapotranspiration, leading to frequent reversals in hydraulic gradients
   that cause GIWs to act as both groundwater sinks and sources. These
   reversals are predicted to buffer surficial aquifer dynamics and thus
   base flow delivery, a process we refer to as landscape hydrologic
   capacitance. To test this hypothesis, we connected models of soil
   moisture, upland water table, and wetland stage to simulate hydrology of
   a low-relief landscape with GIWs, and explored the influences of total
   wetland area, individual wetland size, climate, and soil texture on
   water table and base flow variation. Increasing total wetland area and
   decreasing individual wetland size substantially decreased water table
   and base flow variation (e.g., reducing base flow standard deviation by
   as much as 50\%). GIWs also decreased the frequency of extremely high
   and low water tables and base flow deliveries. For the same total
   wetland area, landscapes with fewer (i.e., larger) wetlands exhibited
   markedly lower hydrologic capacitance than those with more (i.e.,
   smaller) wetlands, highlighting the importance of small GIWs to regional
   hydrology. Our results suggest that GIWs buffer dynamics of the
   surficial aquifer and stream base flow, providing an indirect but
   significant nexus to the regional hydrologic system.}},

Abstract = {{InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors were irradiated from the

   thermography showed that the irradiated devices had higher channel
   temperatures than unirradiated control devices, but only by similar to
   10\% under typical biasing conditions. Accordingly, the irradiated
   devices have higher thermal resistance (400 degrees C/W) compared to
   reference devices (350 degrees C/W), based on the slope of the power
   versus channel temperature line. However, increases of 42\% in off-state
   drain breakdown voltage (V-BR) and of >92\% in critical voltage (V-cri)
   were observed for the proton irradiated HEMT. This is ascribed to the
   reduction of the peak electric field at the gate edges by similar to

Abstract = {{The effects of postprocess annealing on the gate leakage current and

   transistors (HEMTs) was investigated. The fabricated AlGaN/GaN HEMTs
   were postannealed at 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 degrees C under a
   nitrogen (N-2) atmosphere by using rapid thermal annealing, and both
   direct current (dc) and pulsed measurements were performed to
   characterize the changes in device performance. The reverse gate leakage
   current (I-G) at V-G = -10V was reduced by one order of magnitude and
   the off-state drain breakdown voltage (V-off) increased by over
   three-fold after postprocess annealing at 450 degrees C. The reverse
   gate leakage current was found to be independent of gate-to-drain
   potential after annealing. The gate pulse measurements revealed the
   activation of deep traps during the postannealing at elevated

Abstract = {{Power control in a code-division multiple access (CDMA) based cellular
   network is a challenging problem because the communication channels
   change rapidly because of multipath fading. These rapid fluctuations
   cause detrimental effects on the control efforts required to regulate
   the signal-to-interference plus noise ratios (SINRs) to the desired
   level. Thus, there is a need for power-control algorithms that can adapt
   to rapid changes in the channel gain caused by multipath fading. Much of
   the previous work has either neglected the effects of fast fading,
   assumed that the fading is known, or assumed that all the link gains are
   known. In this paper, we model the effects of fast fading and develop
   practical strategies for robust power control based on SINR measurements
   in the presence of the fading. We develop a controller for the reverse
   link of a CDMA cellular system, and use a Lyapunov-based analysis to
   prove that the SINR error is globally uniformly ultimately bounded. We
   also utilize a linear prediction filter that utilizes local SINR
   measurements and estimates of the Doppler frequency that can be derived
   from local SINR measurements to improve the estimate of the channel
   fading used in the controller. The power-control algorithm is simulated
   for a cellular network with multiple cells, and the results indicate
   that the controller regulates the SINRs of all the mobile terminals
   (MTs) with low outage probability. In addition, a pulse-code-modulation
   technique is applied to allow the control command to be quantized for
   feedback to the transmitter. Simulation results indicate that the outage
   probabilities of all the MTs are still within the acceptable range if at
   least 3-bit quantization is employed. Comparisons to a standard
   algorithm illustrate the improved performance of the predictive
   controller.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{29-37}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Dual crop coefficient approach of partitioning evapotranspiration (ETc)
   into transpiration (T) and evaporation (E) has been used extensively for
   applications ranging from estimating crop water allocations to
   irrigation scheduling. Although the basal crop coefficient (K-cb)
   provides an improved estimate of T, variations in K-cb are still
   possible due to variations in climate and management practices
   necessitating the development of regional K-cb. Large drainage
   lysimeters (4.87 m x 3.65 m x 1.37 m) were used to develop K-cb for drip
   irrigated bell pepper and watermelon with plastic mulch in sub-tropical
   Florida using four and three seasons of data, respectively. The average
   K-cb values for the initial, mid-season, and late stages were 0.12,
   0.68, and 0.77, respectively, for bell pepper, and 0.05, 0.96, and 0.66
   for watermelon. The K-cb values for pepper from this study were
   statistically lower (p= 0.047) than the generic FAO-56 values (adjusted
   for mulch and plant density) and improved the estimates of T and E by
   27.3 and 7\%, respectively. Although lysimeter K-cb values for
   watermelon were numerically lower than FAO-56, no statistical difference
   was detected. However, FAO-56 overestimated watermelon E by 52\%. The
   lysimeter-based K-cb improved the ETc estimate and this improvement was
   26 and 51\% of the respective seasonal rainfall for pepper and
   watermelon. When extrapolated to all drip irrigated pepper acreage in
   Florida, the K-cb from this study could potentially reduce the applied
   water by some 6.9 million m(3) of water compared to using FAO-56 K-cb,
   highlighting the importance of accurate estimation of ETc for the
   irrigation management. The improved K-cb will help customize the
   irrigation management and reduce nutrient leaching as well as improve
   simulations of ETc within the hydrologic models for similar environment

Abstract = {{Embryos, unlike adults, are typically sessile, which allows for an
   increase in the available metrics that can be used to assess chemical
   toxicity. We investigate Daphnia magna development rate and oxygen
   consumption as toxicity metrics and compare them to arrested embryo
   development using four different techniques with potassium cyanide (KCN)
   as a common toxicant. The EC50 (95 \% CI) for arrested development was
   2,535 (1,747-3,677) mu g/L KCN. Using pixel intensity changes, recorded
   with difference imaging, we semi-quantitatively assessed a decrease in
   development rate at 200 mu g/L KCN, threefold lower than the arrested
   development lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC). Respirometry
   and self-referencing (SR) microsensors were two unique techniques used
   to assess oxygen consumption. Using respirometry, an increase in oxygen
   consumption was found in the 5 mu g/L KCN treatment and a decrease for
   148 mu g/L, but no change was found for the 78 mu g/L KCN treatment.
   Whereas, with SR microsensors, we were able to detect significant
   changes in oxygen consumption for all three treatments: 5, 78, and 148
   mu g/L KCN. While SR offered the highest sensitivity, the respirometry
   platform developed for this study was much easier to use to measure the
   same endpoint. Oxygen consumption may be subject to change during the
   development process, meaning consumption assessment techniques may only
   be useful only for short-term experiments. Development rate was a more
   sensitive endpoint though was only reliable four of the six embryonic
   developmental stages examined. Despite being the least sensitive
   endpoint, arrested embryo development was the only technique capable of
   assessing the embryos throughout all developmental stages. In
   conclusion, each metric has advantages and limitations, but because all
   are non-invasive, it is possible to use any combination of the three.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic healthcare (eHealth) systems have replaced paper-based
   medical systems due to the attractive features such as universal
   accessibility, high accuracy, and low cost. As a major component of
   eHealth systems, mobile healthcare (mHealth) applies mobile devices,
   such as smartphones and tablets, to enable patient-to-physician and
   patient-to-patient communications for better healthcare and quality of
   life (QoL). Unfortunately, patients' concerns on potential leakage of
   personal health records (PHRs) is the biggest stumbling block. In
   current eHealth/mHealth networks, patients' medical records are usually
   associated with a set of attributes like existing symptoms and
   undergoing treatments based on the information collected from portable
   devices. To guarantee the authenticity of those attributes, PHRs should
   be verifiable. However, due to the linkability between identities and
   PHRs, existing mHealth systems fail to preserve patient identity privacy
   while providing medical services. To solve this problem, we propose a
   decentralized system that leverages users' verifiable attributes to
   authenticate each other while preserving attribute and identity privacy.
   Moreover, we design authentication strategies with progressive privacy
   requirements in different interactions among participating entities.
   Finally, we have thoroughly evaluated the security and computational
   overheads for our proposed schemes via extensive simulations and

Abstract = {{The radiation dose involved in any medical imaging modality that uses
   ionizing radiation needs to be well understood by the medical physics
   and clinical community. This is especially true of screening modalities.
   Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has recently been introduced into the
   clinic and is being used for screening for breast cancer in the general
   population. Therefore, it is important that the medical physics
   community have the required information to be able to understand,
   estimate, and communicate the radiation dose levels involved in breast
   tomosynthesis imaging. For this purpose, the American Association of
   Physicists in Medicine Task Group 223 on Dosimetry in Tomosynthesis
   Imaging has prepared this report that discusses dosimetry in breast
   imaging in general, and describes a methodology and provides the data
   necessary to estimate mean breast glandular dose from a tomosynthesis
   acquisition. In an effort to maximize familiarity with the procedures
   and data provided in this Report, the methodology to perform the dose
   estimation in DBT is based as much as possible on that used in
   mammography dose estimation. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists

Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Modified laser-induced forward transfer has emerged as a promising
   bioprinting technique. Depending on the operating conditions and cell
   properties, laser cell printing may cause cell injury and even death,
   which should be carefully elucidated for it to be a viable technology.
   This study has investigated the effects of alginate gelation, gelation
   time, alginate concentration, and laser fluence on the post-transfer
   cell viability of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Sodium alginate and calcium
   chloride are used as the gel precursor and gel reactant solution to form
   cell-laden alginate microspheres. It is found that the effects of
   gelation depend on the duration of gelation. Two-minute gelation is
   observed to increase the cell viability after 24 h incubation, mainly
   due to the protective cushion effect of the forming gel membrane during
   droplet landing. Despite the cushion effect from 10 min gelation, it is
   observed that the cell viability decreases after 24 h incubation because
   of the forming thick gel membrane that reduces nutrient and oxygen
   diffusion from the culture medium. In addition, the cell viability after
   24 h incubation decreases as the laser fluence or alginate concentration
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{Discussed in detail is the synthesis and primary structure
   characterization of two polymers aimed at advancing the treatment of
   pediatric osteosarcoma. These polymers are designed to systemically
   deliver radiometals specifically to osteosarcomas using the passive
   targeting mechanism of enhanced permeability and retention (the EPR
   effect). The approach begins with the synthesis of a polymer capable of
   binding radiometals, for which prior data show improved site-specific
   targeting of solid tumors. Building on this success, a second polymer
   has been designed for improving the efficacy of currently available
   radionuclide therapies by incorporating the FDA-approved small-molecule
   ligand Quadramet (R) directly onto the polymer structure. Time-activity
   curves of the phosphonate-functionalized polymers show rapid clearance
   from the central compartment and nontargeted organs, with up to 65\% of
   injected activity being excreted within 3 hours. Both polymer ligands
   demonstrate good osteosarcoma targeting capability with little to no
   uptake in organs associated with the dose-limiting bone marrow.
   Additionally, biodistribution studies in nonosseous tumor models
   demonstrate the tumor targeting mechanism of the polymer ligands, which
   appears to be influenced by the high affinity of the phosphonate
   functionality for the positively charged hydroxyapatite mineral found in
   bone tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Ballistic device performance of monolayer black phosphorous (BP)
   field-effect transistors (FETs) is investigated in this letter. Due to
   the anisotropic effect mass of the carriers, the ON-state current is
   dependent on the transport direction. The effective masses are lower in
   the armchair direction, which provides higher drive current at the same
   biasing. The degree of anisotropy is higher for the holes, which
   improves the performance of p-type devices. The intrinsic delay of 20-nm
   BP FETs is in the range of 50 fs at ON-/OFF-current ratio of four
   orders. Monolayer BP FETs outperform both MoS2 and Si FETs for both n-
   and p-type devices in terms of ballistic performance limits, due to
   highly anisotropic band structure.}},

Abstract = {{The crystallization of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films was
   evaluated on two different platinum-coated Si substrates. One substrate
   consisted of a Pt coating on a Ti adhesion layer, whereas the other
   consisted of a Pt coating on a TiO2 adhesion layer. The Pt deposited on
   TiO2 exhibited a higher degree of preferred orientation than the Pt
   deposited on Ti (as measured by the Full Width at Half Maximum of the
   111 peak about the sample normal). PZT thin films with a nominal Zr/Ti
   ratio of 52/48 were deposited on the substrates using the inverted
   mixing order (IMO) route. Phase and texture evolution of the thin films
   were monitored during crystallization using in situ X-ray diffraction at
   a synchrotron source. The intensity of the Pt3Pb phase indicated that
   deposition on a highly oriented Pt/TiO2 substrate resulted in less
   diffusion of Pb into the substrate relative to films deposited on Pt/Ti.
   There was also no evidence of the pyrochlore phase influencing texture
   evolution. The results suggest that PZT nucleates directly on Pt, which
   explains the observation of a more highly oriented 111 texture of PZT on
   the Pt/TiO2 substrate than on the Pt/Ti substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor p-n junctions are essential building blocks for electronic
   and optoelectronic devices(1,2). In conventional p-n junctions, regions
   depleted of free charge carriers form on either side of the junction,
   generating built-in potentials associated with uncompensated dopant
   atoms. Carrier transport across the junction occurs by diffusion and
   drift processes influenced by the spatial extent of this depletion
   region. With the advent of atomically thin van der Waals materials and
   their heterostructures, it is now possible to realize a p-n junction at
   the ultimate thickness limit(3-10). Van der Waals junctions composed of
   p-and n-type semiconductors-each just one unit cell thick-are predicted
   to exhibit completely different charge transport characteristics than
   bulk heterojunctions(10-12). Here, we report the characterization of the
   electronic and optoelectronic properties of atomically thin p-n
   heterojunctions fabricated using van der Waals assembly of
   transition-metal dichalcogenides. We observe gate-tunable diode-like
   current rectification and a photovoltaic response across the p-n
   interface. We find that the tunnelling-assisted interlayer recombination
   of the majority carriers is responsible for the tunability of the
   electronic and optoelectronic processes. Sandwiching an atomic p-n
   junction between graphene layers enhances the collection of the
   photoexcited carriers. The atomically scaled van der Waals p-n
   heterostructures presented here constitute the ultimate functional unit
   for nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an interdiction problem that involves an operator (or
   defender) whose goal is to maximize flow from a source node to a sink
   node in some network that resides in Euclidean space. The problem we
   examine takes the perspective of an interdictor, who seeks to minimize
   the defender's maximum flow by locating a set of attacks that diminish
   arc capacities in accordance with the distance from the arc to the
   attack. Attacks are not restricted to node or arc locations, and can
   occur anywhere on the region in which the network is located. We refer
   to this problem as the Euclidean maximum flow network interdiction
   problem (E-MFNIP). We show that E-MFNIP is NP-hard, as it generalizes
   the maximum flow interdiction problem studied by Wood . This article
   contributes two approaches to solving E-MFNIP based on solving a
   sequence of lower-bounding integer programs from which upper bounds can
   be readily obtained, and shows that these bounds are convergent.
   Computations on a set of test instances indicate that an approach based
   on space-discretization tends to converge much faster than one based on
   linearizing the nonlinear capacity functions. We demonstrate the
   application of our space-discretization approach on a real geographical
   network. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 64(2), 109-124

Abstract = {{The limited driving ranges, the scarcity of recharging stations and
   potentially long battery recharging or swapping time inevitably affect
   route choices of drivers of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). When
   traveling between their origins and destinations, this paper assumes
   that BEV drivers select routes and decide battery recharging plans to
   minimize their trip times or costs while making sure to complete their
   trips without running out of charge. With different considerations of
   flow dependency of energy consumption of BEVs and recharging time, three
   mathematical models are formulated to describe the resulting network
   equilibrium flow distributions on regional or metropolitan road
   networks. Solution algorithms are proposed to solve these models
   efficiently. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the models

Abstract = {{Sorption and cosorption of lead (Pb(II)) and methylene blue (MB) in

   highest adsorption capacity for Pb(II), while modified cotton and peanut
   hull had higher equilibrium adsorption capacity of MB than the other
   biosorbents. Different chemical modification methods of hickory resulted
   in no great variation on the equilibrium adsorption capacity of Pb(II)
   and MB except for the one treated with alkali. Simultaneous sorption of
   Pb(II) and MB on the biosorbents showed Pb(II) to be preferentially
   adsorbed at higher Pb(II)-to-MB molar ratios in solution except for
   modified peanut hull. The equilibrium Pb adsorption contents decreased
   with the increasing pre-loading of MB and vice versa, suggesting the
   competitive rather than synergistic adsorption of the two contaminants
   on the biosorbents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many crop models have been developed for potato, and a few for sweet
   potato, and yam. More than 30 potato models, two sweet potato models,
   and three yam models are described in the literature, and each differ in
   model structure. Some potato models have been applied to studies of
   nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation management, and climate change impact,
   but most of these models have never been validated with field
   measurements. The nitrogen dynamics of potato models
   CROPSYSTVB-CSPOTATO, EXpert-N-SPASS, and LINTUL-NPOTATO have been tested
   with some field data. LPOTCO and AQUACROP are two potato models that
   have been tested under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions. None of the
   models have ever been tested with high temperature or heat stress data.
   The most tested and applied potato models include versions of LINTUL and
   SUBSTOR-Potato. Two sweet potato models, MADHURAM and SPOTCOMS, and two
   yam models, CROPSYSTVB-Yam and EPIC-Yam had limited field-testing under
   current climate conditions; however, these sweet potato and yam models
   are not ready for climate change impact assessments. To prepare potato,
   sweet potato, and yam models for climate change impact assessments, they
   need to be (i) calibrated with modern cultivars across agro-climatic
   zones; (ii) tested and improved with crop physiology and dynamic
   measurements of phenology, growth, partitioning, and water and nitrogen
   uptake under different crop management and environments; and (iii)
   tested and improved with field studies of crop responses to climate
   factors, including elevated CO2, water stress, increased temperature,
   heat stress, and combinations of these. Such extensive model testing and
   improvement with field experiments require a coordinated international
   effort and long-term commitment to potato, sweet potato, and yam
   research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electricity price volatility brings challenges to bidding strategies
   in the electricity markets. In this paper, we propose a minimax regret
   approach for a market participant to obtain an optimal bidding strategy

   recently proposed robust optimization approaches, our approach relies on
   the confidence intervals of price forecasts rather than point
   estimators. We reformulate the minimax regret model as a mixed-integer
   linear program (MILP), and solve it by the Benders' decomposition
   algorithm. Moreover, we design a bidding strategy based on the price
   forecast confidence intervals to generate the offer curve. Finally, we
   numerically test the minimax regret approach, in comparison with the
   robust optimization approach, on three types of thermal generators by
   using real electricity price data from PJM to verify the effectiveness
   of our proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced understanding of rainfall variability requires high resolution
   observations, yet most weather networks are unable to capture rainfall
   gradients that are important for modelling and decision-making. Using a
   network of 46 rain gauges over an area of 3100 km(2) in southwest
   Georgia, this study evaluated different rainfall characteristics,
   including duration, intensity and correlation, and the impact of network
   density on spatially-aggregated rainfall. Distances among the
   observation locations ranged from 1 to 60 km, which makes the network
   significantly denser than most state-level weather networks in the
   United States. Results of the analysis of storm characteristics
   indicated that summer and winter portrayed the highest contrast. Most
   summer storms had an approximate duration of 1 h and were characterized
   by high rainfall intensities. Fall and spring appeared to exhibit a mix
   of characteristics from summer and winter. During the summer, rainfall
   occurrence at a location was quasi-independent of rainfall events at
   other locations in the study area while during the winter rainfall
   tended to occur or not occur over the whole study area simultaneously.
   During the summer, the correlation of rainfall amount was only high
   (0.90) in the immediate neighbourhood of the site considered (less than
   3.3 km) while during the winter, this distance extended to approximately
   8-18 km. To allow a coefficient of variability of 5\% in the
   distribution of aggregate rainfall amount over the study area, the
   required network density sizes would be 16 gauges for summer and 4
   gauges for winter, which translates into 5.2 gauges per 1000 km(2) and
   1.3 gauges per 1000 km(2), respectively. These results provided insights
   into the characteristics and importance of rainfall variability at
   spatial resolutions ranging from local to regional. Results from this
   study may be applicable in the southeast United States and other areas
   with similar weather systems.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the development of design charts that can be used to
   estimate lateral and vertical spacing of liquids addition devices (e.g.,
   vertical well, horizontal trenches) and the operating duration needed
   for transient operating conditions (conditions until steady-state
   operating conditions are achieved). These design charts should be used
   in conjunction with steady-state design charts published earlier by Jain
   et al. (2010a, 2010b). The data suggest that the liquids addition system
   operating time can be significantly reduced by utilizing moderately
   closer spacing between liquids addition devices than the spacing needed
   for steady-state conditions. These design charts can be used by
   designers to readily estimate achievable flow rate and lateral and
   vertical extents of the zone of impact from liquid addition devices, and
   analyze the sensitivity of various input variables (e.g., hydraulic
   conductivity, anisotropy, well radius, screen length) to the design. The
   applicability of the design charts, which are developed based on
   simulations of a continuously operated system, was also evaluated for
   the design of a system that would be operated intermittently (e.g.,
   systems only operated during facility operating hours). The design
   charts somewhat underestimates the flow rate achieved and overestimates
   the lateral extent of the zone of impact over an operating duration for
   an intermittently operated system. The associated estimation errors
   would be smaller than the margin of errors associated with measurement
   of other key design inputs such as waste properties (e.g., hydraulic
   conductivity) and wider variation of these properties at a given site
   due to heterogeneous nature of waste. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of dopaminergic
   therapy on neuromuscular complexity during gait and on the relationship
   between neuromuscular complexity and gait speed in persons with
   Parkinson's disease (PD). Nine persons with PD walked at self-selected
   speed for 5 min after having withdrawn from dopaminergic medication for
   at least 12 h and while optimally-medicated. Electromyographic
   recordings were taken from eight leg muscles bilaterally. Non-negative
   matrix factorization was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the
   electromyographic signals into motor modules. We assessed neuromuscular
   complexity by investigating the number, structure, and timing of the
   modules. We also investigated the influence of dopaminergic medication
   on the relationships between neuromuscular complexity and gait speed.
   Though gait speed increased significantly after medication intake,
   medication did not affect neuromuscular complexity. Neuromuscular
   complexity was significantly associated with gait speed only while the
   participants were medicated. Thus, the supraspinal structures that
   govern neuromuscular complexity during gait do not appear to be solely
   dopaminergically-influenced in PD. The lack of dopaminergic influence on
   neuromuscular complexity may explain why persons with PD exhibit gait
   slowness even while medicated, and an intervention that restores
   neuromuscular complexity may result in gait speed improvement in PD.}},

Title = {{Importance of the consideration of the specificities of local plastic
   deformation on the response of porous solids with Tresca matrix}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{194-205}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Based on rigorous limit-analysis theorems, very recently, Cazacu et al.
   (2014) have deduced an analytic plastic potential for porous solids with
   Tresca matrix. Key in the model development was the consideration of the
   specificities of the plastic flow of the matrix. In this paper, finite
   element calculations are conducted for a voided cubic cell obeying
   Tresca's criterion and compared with the predictions of the new model.
   The numerical calculations confirm the centro-symmetry of the yield
   locus of the porous Tresca material and the combined effects of the mean
   stress and the third-invariant of the stress deviator on void evolution.
   In particular, it is shown that the rate of void growth is faster for
   axisymmetric loading histories corresponding to the third-invariant
   J(3)(Sigma) >= 0 than for those corresponding to J(3)(Sigma) <= 0, while
   void collapse occurs faster for loadings such that J(3)(Sigma) <= 0 than
   for those characterized by J(3)(Sigma) >= 0. Irrespective of the loading
   history, it is found that neglecting the local plastic heterogeneity
   leads to a drastic underestimation of the rate of void evolution. (C)

Abstract = {{This research examines the application of Macro-Fiber Composites on
   substrate materials in the form of unimorph actuators. The intent is to
   characterize the behavior of the unimorphs and to gain an understanding

   indicate that thin substrates, on the order of 0.1 mm, with a high
   modulus, on the order of 200 GPa or more, provide the largest
   displacements and load bearing capacity. Both classical laminate plate
   theory and experimental results are used to support this conclusion. The
   experimental tests used a four point bend setup to load the unimorphs
   through their entire range of deflection and quantified their load
   bearing capacity throughout this range. These results were compared to
   Classical Laminate Plate Theory, in terms of loading and curvature, with
   good agreement. The primary application of this research is for use on
   small unmanned vehicles, but these results can be expanded to other

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline Gd3+-doped Gd (x) Al6-x Si2O13 mullite powders with x
   from 0.005 to 0.025 have been synthesized via a facile coprecipitation

   alpha-Al2O3 was predominant for x = 0.025. It was found that the volume
   of the mullite unit cell increased with Gd3+ ion incorporation.
   Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms evinced that the
   exothermic peak temperature of mullite shifted to lower values with Gd3+
   ion insertion. Transmission electron microscopy observations of pure
   mullite nanoparticles displayed orthorhombic-like shapes. Meanwhile, at
   0.5\% Gd3+ ion content, the mullite particles exhibited platelet-like
   shapes, which distorted into spheroidal-like crystals at high Gd3+ ion
   contents (1\% and 2.5\%). The photoluminescence spectra indicated that
   the intensity of the emission spectra improved considerably with Gd3+
   ion doping. On the other hand, dielectric measurements of sintered
   samples showed that the maximum dielectric loss values were 1.7 and 1.4

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{At present, modeling of the plastic response of porous solids is done
   using stress-based plastic potentials. To gain understanding of the
   combined effects of all invariants for general three-dimensional
   loadings, a strain-rate based approach appears more appropriate. In this
   paper, for the first time strain rate-based potentials for porous solids
   with Tresca and von Mises, matrices are obtained. The dilatational
   response is investigated for general 3-D conditions for both compressive
   and tensile states using rigorous upscaling methods. It is demonstrated
   that the presence of voids induces dependence on all invariants, the
   noteworthy result being the key role played by the plastic flow of the
   matrix on the dilatational response. If the matrix obeys the von Mises
   criterion, the shape of the cross-sections of the porous solid with the
   octahedral plane deviates slightly from a circle, and changes very
   little as the absolute value of the mean strain rate increases. However,
   if the matrix behavior is described by Tresca's criterion, the shape of
   the cross-sections evolves from a regular hexagon to a smooth triangle
   with rounded corners. Furthermore, it is revealed that the couplings
   between invariants are very specific and depend strongly on the
   particularities of the plastic flow of the matrix. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ecosystem-based management is widely regarded as a method to improve the
   way we manage our coastal marine resources and ecosystems. Effective
   ecosystem-based management relies upon synthesizing our scientific
   knowledge and transferring this knowledge into management actions.
   Integrated ecosystem assessment is a framework to conduct this
   scientific synthesis and transfer information to resource managers.
   Portions of the framework were applied to build consensus on the focal
   ecosystem components and processes that are characteristic of a
   sustainable South Florida coastal ecosystem that is producing ecosystem
   services at the level society desires. Consensus was developed through
   facilitated meetings that aimed to conceptualize the ecosystem, develop
   ecosystem indicators, and conduct risk analysis. Resource managers,
   researchers, academics, and non-governmental organizations participated
   in these meetings and contributed to the synthesis of science and a
   myriad of science communications to transfer information to decision
   makers and the public. A proof of concept Bayesian Belief Network was
   developed to explore integrating the results of this assessment into an
   interactive management scenario evaluation tool. The four year effort
   resulted in the development of a research and management coordination
   network in South Florida that should provide the foundation for
   implementing ecosystem-based resource management across multiple
   agencies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although splitting shipments across multiple delivery modes typically
   increases total shipping costs as a result of diseconomies of scale, it
   may offer certain benefits that can more than offset these costs. These
   benefits include a reduction in the probability of stockout and in the
   average inventory costs. We consider a single-stage inventory
   replenishment model that includes two delivery modes: a cheaper, less
   reliable mode, and another, more expensive but perfectly reliable mode.
   The high-reliability mode is only utilized in replenishment intervals in
   which the lead time of the less-reliable mode exceeds a certain value.
   This permits substituting the high-reliability mode for safety stock, to
   some degree. We characterize optimal replenishment decisions with these
   two modes, as well as the potential benefits of simultaneously using two
   delivery modes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By applying an asymmetric on-site restoring force in a 1D chain of
   oscillators, we demonstrate experimentally that a morphing in the
   bandgap structure or passive bandgap reconfiguration can be triggered by
   an increase in environmental excitation amplitude. Recent studies on
   wave propagation have focused on new capabilities and behaviors
   resulting from intrinsic nonlinearities. This paper details a bistable
   experimental design that achieves amplitude dependent filtering through
   passive bandgap reconfiguration, which is triggered by a bifurcation.
   The system studied comprises a 1D chain of axially aligned pendulums in
   dimer unit cells with geometrically nonlinear nearest neighbor coupling
   where bistability is induced through repulsive magnets. When the
   bistability is asymmetric, each potential well has a different linear
   spectra. Though this paper uses mechanically coupled oscillators as an
   example, the phenomenon itself could be used in any wave propagation
   media where asymmetric bistability can be implemented. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Dielectric Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BST) thin films with a different
   concentration of Ag-dopant of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5 mol \% have been
   prepared using an alkoxide-based sol-gel method on a
   Pt(111)/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrate and their surface morphology and
   crystallinity have been examined using scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, respectively. An on-chip
   metal-insulator-metal capacitor has been fabricated with the prepared
   thin film ferroelectric sample. Concentric coplanar electrodes are used
   for high frequency electrical characterization with a vector network
   analyzer and a probe station. The SEM images show that increasing Ag
   doping concentration leads to a decrease in grain size. XRD reveals that
   the fabricated films show good BST crystallinity for all the
   concentration while a doping concentration of 5 mol \% starts to show an
   Ag peak, implying a metallic phase. Improved microwave dielectric loss
   properties of the BST thin films are observed in a low Ag doping level.
   Especially, BST with an Ag doping concentration of 1 mol \% shows the
   best properties with a dielectric constant of 269.3, a quality factor of
   48.1, a tunability at the electric field of 100 kV/cmof 41.2 \%, a
   leakage-current density of 1.045 x 10(-7)A/cm(2) at an electric field of

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{A series of conjugated polymers were designed and synthesized to extract
   structure property relationships with the goal of yielding
   yellow-to-transmissive switching electrochromes. The polymers are based
   on repeat units of propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) in alternation with
   a variety of arylenes including 1,4-phenylene (ProDOT-Ph), 2,7-fluorene
   (ProDOT-Fl), 2,7-carbazole (ProDOT-Cbz), 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene
   (ProDOT-Ph(MeO)(2)), and 2,7-pyrene (ProDOT-Py). Additionally, a random
   copolymer containing ProDOT and two different arylene units was
   produced: ProDOT-phenylene-ProDOT-dimethoxyphenylene
   (R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)(2)) and two polymers with a ProDOT dimer in
   alternation with pyrene and phenylene composed ProDOT(2)-pyrene
   (ProDOT(2)-Py) and ProDOT(2)-phenylene (ProDOT(2)-Ph), respectively. The
   polymers were synthesized using Suzuki polycondensation. Examinations of
   the optoelectronic properties via UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, differential
   pulse voltammetry, and spectroelectrochemistry show that varying the
   electron richness of the polymer by utilizing more electron rich
   arylenes, dimers of ProDOT, or less electron rich arylenes, the
   oxidation potential could be decreased or increased, respectively,
   ranging from 270 to 650 mV. Through subtle C H ortho interactions from
   the arylene unit, yellow neutral state colors were maintained with
   transmissive or near-transmissive oxidized states. Colorimetry utilizing
   L{*}a{*}b{*}, where a{*}b{*} values correlate to the chroma or
   saturation of a color (note: -a{*} and +a{*} correspond to green and red
   and -b{*} and +b{*} correspond to blue and yellow, respectively) and
   L{*} represents the lightness, was used to show the maintenance of
   yellow colors in the neutral states. Herein, the yellow polymers had
   L{*} values above 84.0, a{*} values ranging from -11.6 to 24.8, and b{*}
   values greater than 47.6. In the oxidized states, the most transmissive
   forms had L{*} values above 70.0, a{*} values ranging from -2.1 to 2.0,
   and b{*} values ranging from -6.8 to -0.1. These structure property
   relationships grant access to conjugated polymers with high energy
   absorbance in the visible, while allowing variability in redox
   potentials, providing a deeper understanding in yielding
   yellow-to-transmissive electrochromic polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Buckypaper is a freestanding, self-supported and well defined
   membrane-like black thin film. We developed a buckypaper film containing
   a MWNTs-rich surface and a CNFs-rich surface. Pt nanoparticles supported
   on this film with an ultra-low Pt content, 0.05 mg/cm(2), as a catalytic
   layer for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were synthesized by a
   sputtering process (Pt/BP-SP). The physical and chemical properties as
   well as electrochemical performance of this nanocomposite were studied.
   For comparison, Pt nanoparticles supported on buckypaper with a Pt
   content of 0.10 mg/cm(2) were prepared by an electrode-position process
   (Pt/BP-ED). The results proved that Pt/BP-SP possessed a smaller
   particle size and a more uniform distribution on buckypaper than
   Pt/BP-ED. Cyclic voltammetric investigation showed that Pt/BP-SP had a
   higher electrochemical surface area although its Pt content was lower
   than that of Pt/BP-ED. Tafel studies proved that Pt/BP-SP had a move
   positive equilibrium potential and a higher apparent exchange current
   density. Moreover, the results of linear sweep voltammetric (LSV)
   analysis exhibited that Pt/BP-SP had a higher ORR activity compared with
   Pt/BP-ED, and LSV at different rotation rates revealed that ORR on
   Pt/BP-SP electrode was a 4e(-) process. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we perform nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations
   to study phonon scattering at two tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in SrTiO3.
   Mode-wise energy transmission coefficients are obtained based on phonon
   wave-packet dynamics simulations. The Kapitza conductance is then
   quantified using a lattice dynamics approach. The obtained results of
   the Kapitza conductance of both GBs compare well with those obtained by
   the direct method, except for the temperature dependence. Contrary to
   common belief, the results of this work show that the optical modes in
   SrTiO3 contribute significantly to phonon thermal transport, accounting
   for over 50\% of the Kapitza conductance. To understand the effect of
   the GB structural disorder on phonon transport, we compare the local
   phonon density of states of the atoms in the GB region with that in the
   single crystalline grain region. Our results show that the excess
   vibrational modes introduced by the structural disorder do not have a
   significant effect on phonon scattering at the GBs, but the absence of
   certain modes in the GB region appears to be responsible for phonon
   reflections at GBs. This work has also demonstrated phonon mode
   conversion and simultaneous generation of new modes. Some of the new
   modes have the same frequency as the initial wave packet, while some
   have the same wave vector but lower frequencies. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{This investigation examined the physicochemical characteristics of a
   fullerene derivative, fullerenol {[}C60H (z) O (x) (OH) (y) ] (also
   known as ``polyhydroxyl fullerene{''}) prepared in alkaline media, and
   its synthesis by-products to enable the assessment of mechanisms and
   factors influencing biological response. Physicochemical analyses
   included characterization by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and
   transmission electron scattering (TEM), surface charge assessment
   through electrophoretic analysis of mobility, and chemical composition
   analysis using ultraviolet/visible light, Fourier-transform infrared
   (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Fullerenol was shown to
   exist in a molecular state at concentrations below 20 mg/L with
   agglomeration occur as gas concentration increased; sonication of
   fullerenol samples at multiple concentrations increased agglomeration.
   Fullerenol surface group composition varied between three independent
   synthesis events with the number of total derivatized carbon atoms
   ranging from 21 to 30 and the number of mono-oxygenated groups ranging
   from 5 to 20. Surface group configuration was influenced by the acidity
   of the solution in which it was synthesized, as determined through FTIR.
   By-products from fullerenol synthesis contained 17 to 30 surface groups
   and synthesis reactants tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) and sodium
   hydroxide (NaOH) were found to be present in all by-products.
   By-products generated from methanol rinses were shown to contain 21
   mono-oxygenated groups with no di-oxygenated moieties, the only sample
   encountered during investigations of fullerene-based materials
   containing no di-oxygenated surface groups.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposited Si-doped HfO2 thin films approximately 10 nm
   thick are deposited with various Si-dopant concentrations and

   shown to be dependent on both the Si mol. \% and the distribution of
   Si-dopants. Metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor capacitors are
   shown to exhibit a tunable remanent polarization through the adjustment
   of the Si-dopant distribution at a constant Si concentration.
   Inhomogeneous layering of Si-dopants within the thin films effectively
   lowers the remanent polarization. A pinched hysteresis loop is observed
   for higher Si-dopant concentrations and found to be dependent on the Si

Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{126-142}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{The effect of the joint action of M-2 and M-4 tidal flow, residual flow
   and spatial settling lag on the lateral entrapment of sediment is
   examined in tidally dominated estuaries with an idealized model that
   assumes along-estuary uniform conditions. Approximate solutions are
   obtained for arbitrary cross-channel bed profiles by scaling and
   perturbation analysis. The hydrodynamics include externally driven M-2
   tidal flow, externally and internally driven M-4 tidal flow and residual
   flow driven by horizontal density gradient, river discharge and
   nonlinear advection. The sediment concentration includes a mean
   component, an M-2 component driven by bed erosion and an M-2 component
   driven by both bed erosion and inertial terms. Sediment availability is
   calculated by imposing a morphodynamic equilibrium condition. The model
   is applied to a transect in the James River estuary where data of flow
   and suspended sediment concentration are available. Two types of
   sediment are separately considered, viz., fine silt and coarse silt
   Residual advective transport of sediment by the lateral flow induces
   trapping of sediment over the left shoal (looking landward). Model
   results also show that the incorporation of M-4 tidal flow and spatial
   settling lag leads to a second sediment trapping region over the right
   shoal. Model results are qualitatively in good agreement with the
   observations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Spatial and temporal relationships of electrocorticographic alpha and
   gamma activity during auditory processing}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{188-195}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging approaches have implicated multiple brain sites in musical
   perception, including the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus
   and adjacent perisylvian areas. However, the detailed spatial and
   temporal relationship of neural signals that support auditory processing
   is largely unknown. In this study, we applied a novel inter-subject
   analysis approach to electrophysiological signals recorded from the
   surface of the brain (electrocorticography (ECoG)) in ten human
   subjects. This approach allowed us to reliably identify those ECoG
   features that were related to the processing of a complex auditory
   stimulus (i.e., continuous piece of music) and to investigate their
   spatial, temporal, and causal relationships. Our results identified
   stimulus-related modulations in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and high gamma
   (70-110 Hz) bands at neuroanatomical locations implicated in auditory
   processing. Specifically, we identified stimulus-related ECoG
   modulations in the alpha band in areas adjacent to primary auditory
   cortex, which are known to receive afferent auditory projections from
   the thalamus (80 of a total of 15,107 tested sites). In contrast, we
   identified stimulus-related ECoG modulations in the high gamma band not
   only in areas close to primary auditory cortex but also in other
   perisylvian areas known to be involved in higher-order auditory
   processing, and in superior premotor cortex (412/15,107 sites). Across
   all implicated areas, modulations in the high gamma band preceded those
   in the alpha band by 280 ms, and activity in the high gamma band
   causally predicted alpha activity, but not vice versa (Granger
   causality, p < 1e(-8)). Additionally, detailed analyses using Granger
   causality identified causal relationships of high gamma activity between
   distinct locations in early auditory pathways within superior temporal
   gyrus (STG) and posterior STG, between posterior STG and inferior
   frontal cortex, and between STG and premotor cortex. Evidence suggests
   that these relationships reflect direct cortico-cortical connections
   rather than common driving input from subcortical structures such as the
   thalamus. In summary, our inter-subject analyses defined the spatial and
   temporal relationships between music-related brain activity in the alpha
   and high gamma bands. They provide experimental evidence supporting
   current theories about the putative mechanisms of alpha and gamma
   activity, i.e., reflections of thalamo-cortical interactions and local
   cortical neural activity, respectively, and the results are also in
   agreement with existing functional models of auditory processing. (C)

Abstract = {{Solid state electrochemical cells were employed to obtain standard Gibbs
   energy of formation of CuInSe2 as well as the temperature and enthalpy

   \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}YSZ\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
   In2O3(s), Cu2Se(s), Cu(s), CuInSe2(alpha or delta), C, Pt Cell I
   The calculated standard molar Gibbs energy of formation of alpha and
   delta-CuInSe2 from measured data are given by
   Delta G(f)degrees CuInSe2 (alpha) +/- 0.0003 = 0.0051T (K) - 220.92

   The alpha to delta phase transition temperature T-trans and the enthalpy
   of transition Delta H-trans degrees for CuInSe2 were determined to be
   1064 K and 10.0 kJ/mol respectively. Delta S-trans degrees was
   calculated as 9.4 J/mol K.
   The thermodynamic and phase diagram data in the Cu2Se-In2Se3
   pseudo-binary system were critically assessed. A self consistent set of
   thermochemistry and phase diagram data was obtained with the help of
   measured data. The liquid phase along the Cu2Se-In2Se3 pseudo-binary was
   calculated with the Redlich-Kister model. The beta-Cu1In3Se5 and
   gamma-Cu1In5Se8 phases were represented by the sub-regular model. The

   Solution-Processed Organic Light-Emitting Diodes}},

Abstract = {{Solution-processed nickel oxides (s-NiOx) are used as hole injection and
   transport layers in solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes
   (OLEDs). By increasing the annealing temperature, the nickel acetate
   precursor fully decomposes and the s-NiOx film shows larger crystalline
   grain sizes, which lead to better hole injection and transport
   properties. UV-ozone treatment on the s-NiOx surface is carried out to
   further modify its surface chemistry, improving the hole injection
   efficiency. The introduction of more dipolar species of nickel
   oxyhydroxide (NiO(OH)) is evidenced after the treatment. Dark injection
   space charge limited (DI-SCL) transient measurement was carried out to
   compare the hole injection efficiency of s-NiO and
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
   hole injection layers (HIL). The UV-ozone treated s-NiOx shows
   significantly better hole injection, with a high injection efficiency of
   0.8. With a p-type thin film transistor (TFT) configuration, the
   high-temperature annealed s-NiOx film shows a hole mobility of 0.141
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which is significantly higher compared to conventional
   organic hole transport layers (HTLs). Because of their improved hole
   injection and transport properties, the solution-processed
   phosphorescent green OLEDs with NiOx HIL/HTL show a maximum power
   efficiency of 75.5 +/- 1.8 lm W-1, which is 74.6 + 2.1\% higher than the
   device with PEDOT:PSS HIL. The device with NiOx HIL/HTL also shows a
   better shelf stability than the device with PEDOT:PSS HIL. The NiOx
   HIL/HTL is further compared with PEDOT:PSS
   HIL/N,N'-Di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPB)
   HTL in the thermal-evaporated OLEDs. The device with NiOx HIL/HTL shows
   a comparable efficiency at high electroluminescence (EL) intensities.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to assess in utero radiation doses and related quantities to the
   developing fetus should account for the presence of the surrounding
   maternal tissues. Maternal tissues can provide varying levels of
   protection to the fetus by shielding externally-emitted radiation or,
   alternatively, can become sources of internally-emitted radiation
   following the biokinetic uptake of medically-administered
   radiopharmaceuticals or radionuclides located in the surrounding
   environment-as in the case of the European Union's SOLO project
   (Epidemiological Studies of Exposed Southern Urals Populations). The
   University of Florida had previously addressed limitations in available
   computational phantom representation of the developing fetus by
   constructing a series of hybrid computational fetal phantoms at eight
   different ages and three weight percentiles. Using CT image sets of
   pregnant patients contoured using 3D-DOCTOR(TM), the eight 50th
   percentile fetal phantoms from that study were systematically combined
   in Rhinoceros(TM) with the UF adult non-pregnant female to yield a
   series of reference pregnant female phantoms at fetal ages 8, 10, 15,
   20, 25, 30, 35 and 38 weeks post-conception. Deformable, non-uniform
   rational B-spline surfaces were utilized to alter contoured maternal
   anatomy in order to (1) accurately position and orient each fetus and
   surrounding maternal tissues and (2) match target masses of maternal
   soft tissue organs to reference data reported in the literature.}},

   TiO2 systems based on the charge-optimized many-body (COMB) potential
   framework. The parameters of the potential function are fit to the
   structural and mechanical properties of the Ti hcp phase, the TiO2
   rutile phase, and the energetics of polymorphs of both Ti and TiO2. The
   relative stabilities of TiO2 rutile surfaces are predicted and compared
   to the results of density functional theory (DFT) and empirical
   potential calculations. The transferability of the developed potential
   is demonstrated by determining the adsorption energy of Cu clusters of
   various sizes on the rutile TiO2(1 1 0) surface using molecular dynamics
   simulations. The results indicate that the adsorption energy is
   dependent on the number of Cu-Cu bonds and Cu-O bonds formed at the
   Cu/TiO2 interface. The adsorption energies of Cu clusters on the reduced
   and oxidized TiO2(1 1 0) surfaces are also investigated, and the COMB
   potential predicts enhanced bonding between Cu clusters and the oxidized
   surface, which is consistent with both experimental observations and the
   results of DFT calculations for other transition metals (Au and Ag) on
   this oxidized surface.}},

Abstract = {{Biofabrication offers a great potential for the fabrication of
   three-dimensional living tissues and organs by precisely layer-by-layer
   placing various tissue spheroids as anatomically designed. Inkjet
   printing of living cell-laden bioink is one of the most promising
   technologies enabling biofabrication, and the bioink printability must
   be carefully examined for it to be a viable biofabrication technology.
   In this study, the cell-laden bioink droplet formation process has been
   studied in terms of the breakup time, droplet size and velocity, and
   satellite formation using a time-resolved imaging approach. The bioink
   has been prepared using fibroblasts and sodium alginate with four
   different cell concentrations: without cells, 1 x 10(6), 5 x 10(6), and
   1 x 10(7) cells/mL to appreciate the effect of cell concentration on the
   droplet formation process. Furthermore, the bioink droplet formation
   process is compared with that during the inkjetting of a comparable
   polystyrene microbead-laden suspension under the identical operating
   conditions to understand the effect of particle physical properties on
   the droplet formation process. It is found that (1) as the cell
   concentration of bioink increases, the droplet size and velocity
   decrease, the formation of satellite droplets is suppressed, and the
   breakup time increases, and (2) compared to the hard bead-laden
   suspension, the bioink tends to have a less ejected fluid volume, lower
   droplet velocity, and longer breakup time.}},

Abstract = {{Commercially available near-infrared (IR) imagers are fabricated by
   integrating expensive epitaxial grown III-V compound semiconductor
   sensors with Si-based readout integrated circuits (ROIC) by indium bump
   bonding which significantly increases the fabrication costs of these
   image sensors. Furthermore, these typical III-V compound semiconductors
   are not sensitive to the visible region and thus cannot be used for
   multi-spectral (visible to near-IR) sensing. Here, a low cost infrared
   (IR) imaging camera is demonstrated with a commercially available
   digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera and an IR sensitive organic
   light emitting diode (IR-OLED). With an IR-OLED, IR images at a
   wavelength of 1.2 mu m are directly converted to visible images which
   are then recorded in a Si-CMOS DSLR camera. This multi-spectral imaging
   system is capable of capturing images at wavelengths in the
   near-infrared as well as visible regions.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to describe the regional performance of electric-power
   distribution systems against hurricane hazards with theories based on
   the uncertainty. The uniqueness of this study is that damage-assessment
   models are proposed along with each device, and that customer minutes
   interrupted (MI) are estimated. Trees are revealed as the most likely
   cause of power outages. Wind momentum and rainfall are also verified as
   harmful elements. To assess the extent of damage, the number of device
   breaks and the customer MI could be assessed with statistical and
   stochastic models. The proposed model using two estimable models is
   examined and validated to describe power outages. Power disturbances are
   limitedly described for the territories of the Progress Energy in
   Florida. However, the proposed model could be applied to predict power
   outages of the more extensive areas. Furthermore, it can be used to
   identify zones that are vulnerable to or safe from hurricanes with a

Abstract = {{Active neutron interrogation is a powerful non-destructive assay
   technique that relies on detecting and analyzing fission neutrons
   produced in a fissionable sample by an interrogating high neutron flux.
   He-4 gas scintillation fast neutron detectors are investigated in this
   paper for use in a novel fission rate measurement technique. The He-4
   detectors have excellent gamma rejection, a fast response time, and give
   significant information on incident neutron energy, allowing for energy
   cuts to be applied to the detected signal. These features are shown in
   this work to allow for the detection of prompt fission neutrons in-situ
   during active neutron interrogation of a natural uranium sample. The
   detected neutron energy spectra from Cf-252 and (d,d) generator neutron
   sources are measured with the He-4 detection system and compared against
   incident and simulated spectra. An partial response matrix for the
   detector is determined using the kinematic interaction properties of the

Abstract = {{Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) has been used as an alternative to
   cell-based recombinant technology for protein production in academic and
   industrial labs. The continuous-exchange format generally has higher
   expression yield by constantly supplying a nutrient solution and
   removing inhibitory by-products through a porous membrane. Because of
   the concern of possible membrane clogging by large molecules in the CFPS
   solution, we investigated the effects of membrane orientation on protein
   synthesis. We fabricated a miniaturized array device called Vertical-I
   with its membrane oriented vertically in reference to the table surface
   and found that the protein synthesis yield in the Vertical-I device was
   144\% higher than the Horizontal Device reported previously. The
   reaction time was also faster; beta-glucuronidase reached the synthesis
   yield plateau after 2 h in the Vertical-I device versus 4 h in the
   Horizontal Device. Possible clogging of membrane pores was confirmed by
   fluorescein diffusion measurement. Using these results, we designed a
   device called Vertical-II that would fit into a 96 well plate holder for
   compatibility with commercial reagent dispensers and microplate readers.
   The experimentally optimized device increased protein expression 406\%
   over the Horizontal Device and consumes 5 times fewer reagents than a
   commercial device, showing the potential for high-throughput protein
   synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the carbon footprint of data centers is becoming a primary goal
   of large IT companies. Unlike traditional energy sources, renewable
   energy sources are usually intermittent and unpredictable. How to better
   utilize the green energy from these renewable sources in data centers is
   a challenging problem. In this paper, we exploit the opportunities
   offered by geographical load balancing, opportunistic scheduling of
   delay-tolerant workloads, and thermal storage management in data centers
   to facilitate green energy integration and reduce the cost of brown
   energy usage. Moreover, bandwidth cost variations between users and data
   centers are considered. Specifically, this problem is first formulated
   as a stochastic program, and then, an online control algorithm based on
   the Lyapunov optimization technique, called Stochastic Cost Minimization
   Algorithm (SCMA), is proposed to solve it. The algorithm can enable an
   explicit trade-off between cost saving and workload delay. Numerical
   results based on real-world traces illustrate the effectiveness of SCMA
   in practice.}},

   microenvironment are the initiating event for this disruption of
   homeostasis and intimal thickening in vein bypass grafts. The objective
   of this study was to investigate the relation between local flow
   perturbations and its influence on the vein graft architecture.
   Methods: An external ligature was used to create an 80\% focal midgraft
   stenosis in bilateral rabbit carotid vein grafts. A unilateral distal
   ligation created a ninefold difference in flow rate between high-flow
   and low-flow grafts. Ten vein grafts were harvested at 28 days and
   serially sectioned for morphologic evaluation and vein graft
   reconstruction. Computational fluid dynamics analyses were performed to
   examine the hemodynamic environment within these complex flow regions.
   Results: The largest intimal thickening occurred exclusively within the
   region immediately distal to the maximum stenosis in high-flow grafts,
   which was characterized by persistent flow separation and reversal for
   the entire cardiac cycle. In regions of low to moderate shear stress (<5
   Pa), the typical inverse correlation between intimal thickness and wall
   shear was observed.
   Conclusions: Regions of vein bypass grafts exposed to persistent flow
   reversal are most at risk for intimal thickening and loss of lumen.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost, highly efficient and eco-friendly cellulose-based adsorbent
   (CMGT) was synthesized and used to uptake Pb(II) and malachite green
   (MG) from aqueous solutions. The CMGT was characterized by FTIR, SEM,
   TGA and XRD. Different experimental parameters were evaluated in batch
   adsorption experiments to determine the optimal adsorption conditions.
   The optimal pHs for Pb(II) and MG were 5.5 and 7.0, respectively; the
   optimal contact times for Pb(II) and MG were 60 and 180 min,
   respectively. Among the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models,
   the Langmuir model fitted the adsorption data best for both Pb(II) and
   MG adsorption. In theory, the maximum adsorption capacities of Pb(II)
   and MG were 584.80 and 131.93 mg g(-1), respectively. The
   pseudo-second-order model fitted the experimental data very well, and
   the thermodynamics were also used to discuss the mechanism in depth.
   Additionally, desorption tests showed that CMGT could be effectively
   regenerated by 0.2 mol L-1 HCl solution and could be reused for at least
   six cycles successively with a stable sorption ability in the dynamic
   adsorption process.}},

   Energy formulas and correlation coefficient expressions are derived for

   receiving side. Beam-scanning characteristics of UWB dipole arrays are
   also investigated in the same manner. Different element lengths are used

   Derived frequency domain expressions can easily be evaluated

Abstract = {{Radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies are poised to
   revolutionize retail, warehouse, and supply chain management. One of
   their interesting applications is to automatically detect missing tags
   in a large storage space, which may have to be performed frequently to
   catch any missing event such as theft in time. Because RFID systems
   typically work under low-rate channels, past research has focused on
   reducing execution time of a detection protocol to prevent excessively
   long protocol execution from interfering normal inventory operations.
   However, when active tags are used for a large spatial coverage, energy
   efficiency becomes critical in prolonging the lifetime of these
   battery-powered tags. Furthermore, much of the existing literature
   assumes that the channel between a reader and tags is reliable, which is
   not always true in reality because of noise/interference in the
   environment. Given these concerns, this paper makes three contributions.
   First, we propose a novel protocol design that considers both energy
   efficiency and time efficiency. It achieves multifold reduction in both
   energy cost and execution time when compared to the best existing work.
   Second, we reveal a fundamental energy-time tradeoff in missing-tag
   detection, which can be flexibly controlled through a couple of system
   parameters in order to achieve desirable performance. Third, we extend
   our protocol design to consider channel error under two different
   models. We find that energy/time cost will be higher in unreliable
   channel conditions, but the energy-time tradeoff relation persists.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor-enabled radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has
   generated a lot of interest from industries lately. Integrated with
   miniaturized sensors, RFID tags can provide not only the IDs, but also
   valuable real-time information about the state of the objects or their
   surrounding environment, which can benefit many practical applications,
   such as warehouse management and inventory control. In this paper, we
   study the problem of designing efficient protocols for a reader to
   collect sensor-produced information from unknown target tags in an RFID
   system with minimum execution time. Different from information
   collection with all target tags known a priori, in the scenarios we
   consider, the reader has to first find out the target tags in order to
   read information from them, which makes traditional information
   collection protocols not efficient any more. We design a
   Bloom-filter-based information collection protocol (BIC) to address this
   challenging problem. A Bloom filter is constructed for the reader to
   efficiently determine the target tags, which significantly reduces the
   communication and time overhead. We also introduce the allocation
   vectors to coordinate the transmissions from different tags and minimize
   collision during information collection. Extensive simulation results
   demonstrate that our protocol is highly efficient in terms of execution
   time, and it performs much better than other solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Leaching of phosphorus (P) from agricultural soils, especially those
   that are sandy, is adversely impacting P-limited ecosystems like
   Florida's Everglades. A more developed understanding of P and water
   management strategies and their effects on P leaching is needed to
   achieve reductions in subsurface P losses, especially from intensively
   managed dual cropping systems under plastic mulch in shallow water
   regions. We compared the effects of conservation P and water management
   strategies with traditional practices on P transport to groundwater. A
   3-year experiment was conducted on hydrologically isolated plots with
   plastic-mulched successive cropping systems to compare high (HEI) and
   soil test based recommended (REI) external input (water and fertilizer
   P) systems with traditional sub-irrigation (seepage), and REI with a
   potential water conservation subsurface drip irrigation system (REI-SD)
   with regard to groundwater P concentrations above and below the low
   conductivity spodic horizon (Bh). The REI treatments had higher
   available storage for rainfall and P than HEI. Use of both REI systems
   (REI = 2098 mu g/L and REI-SD = 2048 mu g/L) reduced groundwater P
   concentrations above the Bh horizon by 33\% compared to HEI (3090 mu
   g/L), and results were significant at the 0.05 level. Although the
   subsurface drip system saved water, it did not offer any groundwater
   quality (P) benefit Mixing and dilution of influent P below the low
   conductivity Bh horizon between treatments and with the regional
   groundwater system resulted in no significant differences in groundwater
   P concentration below the Bh horizon. Groundwater P concentrations from
   this study were higher than reported elsewhere due to low soil P storage
   capacity (SPSC), high hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils, and a high
   water table beneath crop beds. The HEI system leached more P due to
   ferilizer Pin excess of SPSC and used higher irrigation volumes compared
   with RE! systems. Despite a 40\% difference in the average amount of
   added fertilizer P between HEI (187 kg P2O5/ha) and REI (124 kg
   P2O5/ha), soil Mehlich 1 P (M1P) values were similar for both systems
   while they received P-input Soil M1P for REI and REI-SD increased to a
   maximum of 55 mg/kg while they received P-input and then gradually
   decreased after P-input ceased. However, M1P for HEI increased steadily
   to a maximum of 145 mg/kg by the end of the study with continued P-input
   Mehlich-1 P measured six years after the study still showed relatively
   high levels of P, a legacy effect of P-input. The main factors
   influencing groundwater P concentration varied by seasons. During fall
   with frequent rainfall, the concentrations were influenced mainly by M1P
   and P-input, and highlight a need for greater focus on P-input
   management (vs. water management) during this season. However, during
   the dry period of spring, a greater focus on irrigation management is
   required since depth to water table and rainfall also become
   contributing factors. Three multivariate models (r(2) = 0.67 to 0.93),
   for spring, fall, and annual periods, were developed for predicting
   groundwater P concentrations for a wide range of water and P inputs (0
   to 191 kg P2O5/ha of P-input).
   The uniqueness of these models is that they use readily available
   hydrologic (rainfall and water table depth), management (P-input), and
   soil (M1P) data commonly monitored by growers when managing water and
   nutrient inputs on agricultural landscapes. The development of similar
   models may not be necessary for other agro-ecosystems in similar regions
   since long-term data collected in these regions may be applied, with
   verification, to the models presented here. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The small length scales that make microfluidics attractive are also the
   source of some very stringent constraints, especially with respect to
   the detection approach used. The low concentrations often analyzed in
   microfluidic devices require highly sensitive detection methods that are
   effective even in vanishingly small sample volumes. Over the years, many
   detection approaches have been developed for microfluidics. The majority
   of these methods rely upon optical phenomena, with the most common being
   fluorescence detection. Fluorescence detection is well suited to
   microfluidics because it is both flexible and sensitive; however, it
   does have shortcomings. Weak fluorescence of targets, autofluorescence
   of materials, and photobleaching are a few of the issues that have to be
   dealt with when working with fluorescence detection. Another option that
   eliminates all of these problems is thermal lens microscopy (TLM), a
   photothermal spectroscopy technique. TLM is a flexible, sensitive
   detection approach for nonfluorescent molecules that is capable of
   carrying out single-molecule detection to label-free in vivo
   quantification. Despite the potential benefits of TLM, it is still an
   underutilized detection approach. We hope this review will help broaden
   the use of TLM for microchip-based CE, as well as a host of other
   microfluidic applications.}},

Abstract = {{A method of achieving selective communication between a set of
   communication nodes on a network using a differential antenna pair is
   demonstrated. The common mode noise cancelling properties of the
   proposed polarization differential antenna facilitates controlled
   isolation of multiple wireless channels in close physical proximity and
   makes line-of-sight communications in multi-antenna systems operating in
   the same frequency channel feasible. The proposed antenna demonstrates
   clear superiority in signal isolation in comparison to its single ended
   counterpart. Routing physical transmission lines takes up space on
   chip/board and also introduces parasitic elements to the design altering
   its characteristics especially at high frequencies. The idea is to
   wirelessly transmit and receive a true differential signal emulating a
   physical differential transmission line preserving its common mode noise
   cancelling properties. A method to regulate the received power is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency and time domain models are developed for backplane (BP),
   printed circuit board (PCB), and silicon interposer (SI) links using
   six-port transfer matrices (ABCD matrices) for bumps, vias and
   connectors, and coupled multiconductor transmission lines for traces.
   The six-port transfer matrix approach enables easy computation of the
   transfer function, as well as near-end and far-end crosstalk. The
   intersymbol interference is accounted for by computing the pulse
   response for the worst case bit pattern. Furthermore, the models
   developed here are used to optimize the data-rate and trace width for
   each of the links, so that the aggregate bandwidth obtained per joule of
   energy supplied to the link is maximized. The modeling and optimization
   approach developed here serves as a good platform to compare the air-gap
   interconnects against BP, PCB, and SI interconnects on lossy
   dielectrics. It is shown that air-gap interconnects can provide an
   aggregate bandwidth improvement of 3x-4x for BP links at a comparable
   energy per bit, and a 5x-9x improvement in aggregate bandwidth of PCB
   links at the expense of 20\% higher energy per bit. For SI links,
   air-gap interconnects are shown to provide a 2x-3x improvement in
   aggregate bandwidth and a 1x-1.5x improvement in energy per bit.}},

Abstract = {{A flipped-classroom approach was implemented in a Circuits I class for
   electrical and computer engineering majors to lower its high attrition
   and failure rate. Students were asked to watch online lectures and then
   come to class prepared to work problems in small groups of four. The
   attitude, retention, and performance of students in the flipped group in
   Spring 2013 were compared to those for the traditionally taught group in
   Fall 2012. The Fall 2012 lectures were recorded, so that each group saw
   the same lectures. Student retention and test performance was
   significantly higher in the flipped course. In Fall 2012, 56\% of the
   initially enrolled students received a C or better. In Spring 2013, this
   improved to 83\%. The first exam scores were significantly better in
   Spring 2013, and this helped with student success. The authors believe
   that it was the alignment of online lectures, face-to-face
   student/teacher and peer/peer interactions, combined with the active
   learning component of the flipped classroom that led to these
   improvements.}},

Title = {{Identifying blueberry fruit of different growth stages using natural
   outdoor color images}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{91-101}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This study was conducted to identify blueberry fruit of different growth
   stages using natural outdoor images toward the development of a
   blueberry yield mapping system. As blueberries usually contain different
   maturity stages in a same branch, identification of blueberry fruit and
   their maturity stages from different background is very important for
   yield mapping. In this study, maturity stages of the fruit were divided
   into four categories: mature (m), near-mature (nm), near-young (ny) and
   young (y). A stepwised algorithm, termed `color component analysis based
   detection (CCAD)' method, was developed and validated to identify
   blueberry fruit using outdoor color images. Firstly, a dataset was built
   using manually cropped pixels from training images. Three color
   components, red (R), blue (B) and hue (H), were selected using the
   forward feature selection algorithm (FFSA), and used to separate all
   fruit of four maturity stages from background through different
   classifiers. In this work, not only the traditional classifiers such as
   K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and naive Bayesian classification (NBC) were
   used, but another newly introduced `supervised K-means clustering
   classifier (SK-means)' was also developed and applied to the dataset. In
   the second step, classifiers were built to separate a group of `mature
   \& near-mature' fruit from a group of `near-young \& young' fruit from
   all fruit pixels. Finally, classifiers were developed to separate mature
   fruit from near-mature fruit, and near-young fruit from young fruit. The
   classifiers obtained from these different steps were then applied to
   validation images, resulting in final identification. Cross validation
   was conducted using these different classifiers and their results were
   compared. KNN classifier yielded the highest classification accuracy
   (85-98\%) from the validation set of the prebuilt pixel dataset
   collected from the training images in all separations. An one-way ANOVA
   was used to compare the performance of the three classifies, which shows
   KNN performed significantly better than other methods. The newly
   proposed `SK-means' classifier yielded a fairly high accuracy (90\%) for
   the separation of mature and near-mature fruit. The newly developed
   `CCAD' method for blueberry was proved to be efficient for identifying
   blueberry fruit of different growth stages using natural outdoor color
   images toward the development of a blueberry yield mapping system. (C)

Abstract = {{In 2007-2008, 52 positive cloud-to-ground flashes containing 63 return
   strokes (52 first, 10 second, and 1 third) were recorded at the

   Lightning Detection Network located 51 (96\%) of the positive return
   strokes at distances of 7.8-157 km from the field measuring station and
   correctly identified 48 (91\%) of them as cloud-to-ground discharges. In
   this study, parameters of positive return-stroke electric field and
   electric field derivative waveforms are examined. The geometric mean
   (GM) value of initial electric field peak normalized to 100 km for 48
   strokes is 18 V/m. The GM peak electric field derivative normalized to
   100 km for 27 strokes is 9.0 V/m/mu s. The GM zero-to-peak risetime and
   10-to-90\% risetime for 62 strokes are 6.9 mu s and 3.4 mu s,
   respectively, and the GM slow front duration is 5.0 mu s. The GM
   zero-crossing time for 42 strokes is 45 mu s and the GM opposite
   polarity overshoot for 33 strokes is 13\% of the peak. These
   characteristics are compared with those of negative return strokes in
   Florida found in the literature.}},

   composite specimen obtained from a previous experimental study(1,2) are
   analyzed. In conjunction with these micrographs, model outcomes
   demonstrate the ability of warp weavers or through-thickness Z-yarns to
   shield inter-laminar cracks. Quasi-static indentation is modeled as a
   contact interaction between a rigid cylindrical indenter and a
   deformable S2-Glass/SC15 3D woven composite laminate using ABAQUS (R).
   Tow elements are modeled as transversely isotropic elastic-plastic
   material entities, whereas the inter-tow matrix is modeled as an
   isotropic elastic-plastic material. Through-thickness failure modes are
   predicted based on the Tsai-Hill criterion. Contour maps of these
   failure modes point to the location and corresponding damage initiation
   mode within the material. Experimentally obtained micrographs 1,2 are
   then analyzed on the basis of these contour maps, thereby serving to
   validate the modeling methodology. The effect of Z-yarns is demonstrated
   with the aid of two-dimensional plane strain linear elastic fracture
   mechanics analysis. Crack shielding abilities of the Z-yarns manifest as
   the variation of strain energy release rate as a function of crack
   length and location. In the vicinity of a Z-yarn, the energy release
   rate decreases precipitously, indicating the inability of the crack to
   penetrate the Z-yarns.}},

   project mainly aims to study the ability of pervious concrete pavement

   the ability of pervious concrete pavement material to reduce pollutant
   concentrations and purify water was effective in diluted sulfuric acid,
   artificial seawater, and motor oil tests. After flowing through pervious
   concrete pavement, a diluted sulfuric acid solution (pH value 2.0) could
   dramatically increase its pH value to approximately 7.0. A pervious
   concrete pavement system could greatly decrease the content of an
   artificial seawater solution (salinity 36\%) to about 1\%, and the oil
   content of motor oil combined with certain types of water could also be
   significantly decreased to 1\%. The study demonstrates that pervious
   concrete pavement holds potential for environment conservation and

Abstract = {{Objective. Neurovascular coupling in epilepsy is poorly understood; its
   study requires simultaneous monitoring of hemodynamic changes and neural
   activity in the brain. Approach. Here for the first time we present a
   combined real-time 3D photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and
   electrophysiology/electroencephalography (EEG) system for the study of
   neurovascular coupling in epilepsy, whose ability was demonstrated with
   a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced generalized seizure model in rats. Two
   groups of experiments were carried out with different wavelengths to
   detect the changes of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO(2)) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR)
   signals in the rat brain. We extracted the average PAT signals of the
   superior sagittal sinus (SSS), and compared them with the EEG signal.
   Main results. Results showed that the seizure process can be divided
   into three stages. A `dip' lasting for 1-2 min in the first stage and
   the following hyperfusion in the second stage were observed. The HbO(2)
   signal and the HbR signal were generally negatively correlated. The
   change of blood flow was also estimated. All the acquired results here
   were in accordance with other published results. Significance. Compared
   to other existing functional neuroimaging tools, the method proposed
   here enables reliable tracking of hemodynamic signal with both high
   spatial and high temporal resolution in 3D, so it is more suitable for
   neurovascular coupling study of epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{A model was developed to simulate oxygen accumulation in space and time
   within cylindrical dynamic accumulation chambers that are used to
   measure oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of materials. The model is based
   on Fick's law of diffusion and was validated against actual OTR
   measurements of polymer film samples. Measured OTR values and
   thicknesses were inputted into the model and oxygen concentrations
   outputted by the model. OTRs determined from the output of the model was
   in close agreement to within 0.3-3\% of the measured OTR. Oxygen
   concentration versus time curves generated from model output oxygen
   concentrations and experimentally measured oxygen concentrations for
   three actual films were also in agreement. The model was then used to
   simulate results from three hypothetical test films at varying chamber
   lengths in order to evaluate effects of accumulation chamber dimensions
   relative to films on resulting OTR measurements. A typical design
   scenario was used, where the oxygen sensor is mounted on the chamber
   wall opposite the sample film. Results demonstrate that dynamic
   accumulation OTR instrument designers have considerable flexibility in
   choosing accumulation chamber dimensions because deviations in OTR are
   only expected to occur at impractically extreme chamber lengths (> 10 m)
   for the entire envelope of OTRs expected for typical packaging films.

Abstract = {{Laser ablation coupled to laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LA-LIBS)
   is an analytical method, which minimizes sample matrix effects typically
   found in quantitative LIBS-based direct solid analyses. This paper
   reports the application of double-pulse laser ablation (DP-LA) to
   improve the analyte response and the achievable precisions of LA-LIBS.
   Two coaxial laser beams were applied at the ablation site and the
   analytical signals were then collected from a second free-standing LIES
   plasma downstream of the ablation site. Signal improvements of up to one
   order of magnitude were observed compared to single-pulse LA-LIBS. The
   effect of the interpulse delay on the observed signal-to-noise ratios
   was studied and the quantification capabilities of the optimized
   DP-LA-LIBS setup were investigated for manganese and iron in a broad
   range of different alloy types. A linear response was observed for
   manganese across the different matrices, allowing for nonmatrix-matched
   calibrations. Matrix effects were observed when analyzing aluminum
   samples, which, however, could be compensated for by applying iron as
   internal standard. Size distributions of the ablated material and
   electron density measurements provide additional insight into the
   double-pulse process, with additional future work suggested. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Compared to cell-based protein expression, cell-free protein synthesis
   (CFPS) offers several advantages including a greater control over system
   additives. This control is further enhanced with a CFPS system called
   the Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements (PURE) system, which
   consists of 108 purified transcriptional and translational elements.
   With the PURE system, all elements are known, nuclease and protease
   activities are reduced, and the concentration of each element can be
   optimized for maximal protein expression. However, protein expression
   yield with this system is relatively low due to the consumption of
   nutrients and energy molecules as well as the accumulation of inhibitory
   byproducts in the batch format. To enhance protein expression with the
   PURE system, we developed a feeding solution that was optimized using a
   miniaturized fluid array device (mu FAD) in a continuous-exchange
   cell-free (CECF) format. The device enabled (1) continuous supply of
   energy/nutrient molecules from the feeding solution to the reaction
   solution where protein synthesis occurred, and (2) simultaneous removal
   of inhibitory expression byproducts from the reaction solution to the
   feeding solution. Consequently, the synthesis yield of green fluorescent
   protein (GFP) increased 72.5-fold in comparison with the same reaction
   in the conventional batch format.}},

Abstract = {{The existing methods for predicting/modeling the permeability of a wick
   structure involve the use of a capillary pressure model. Thus, the
   validity of the existing permeability models has not been verified
   independent of the capillary pressure. Here, for the first time, the
   permeability and capillary pressure of monoporous wick structures have
   been independently determined using a new experimental approach. In the
   new approach, the liquid mass flow rate against gravity is measured by
   testing the wick at its dryout threshold at different wicking lengths.
   The permeability and capillary pressure of the wick are then uniquely
   determined by curve fitting the wicking length-dependent mass flow data.
   The advantage of the developed method over Washburn's rate of rise
   technique is that the current method yields both capillary pressure and
   permeability values while the former only returns the product of the two
   parameters. The permeability values obtained from the experiments were
   used to examine the accuracy of the existing permeability models.}},

Abstract = {{We study the minimum vertex blocker clique problem (VBCP), 1 which is to
   remove a subset of vertices of minimum cardinality in a weighted
   undirected graph, such that the maximum weight of a clique in the
   remaining graph is bounded above by a given integer r >= 1. Cliques are
   among the most popular concepts used to model cohesive clusters in
   different graph-based applications, such as social, biological, and
   communication networks. The general case of VBCP on weighted graphs is
   known to be NP-hard, and we show that the special case on unweighted
   graphs is also NP-hard for any fixed integer r >= 1. We present an
   analytical lower bound on the cardinality of an optimal solution to
   VBCP, as well as formulate VBCP as a linear 0-1 program with an
   exponential number of constraints. Facet-inducing inequalities for the
   convex hull of feasible solutions to VBCP are also identified.
   Furthermore, we develop the first exact algorithm for solving VBCP,
   which solves the proposed formulation by using a row generation
   approach. Computational results obtained by utilizing this algorithm on
   a test-bed of randomly generated instances are also provided. (C) 2014

Title = {{Improved small molecule drug release from in situ forming

Abstract = {{In situ forming implants are an attractive choice for controlled drug
   release into a fixed location. Currently, rapidly solidifying solvent
   exchange systems suffer from a high initial burst, and sustained release
   behavior is tied to polymer precipitation and degradation rate. The
   present studies investigated addition of hydroxyapatite (HA) and
   drug-loaded poly(-amino ester) (PBAE) microparticles to in situ forming
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based systems to prolong release
   and reduce burst. PBAEs were synthesized, imbibed with simvastatin
   (osteogenic) or clodronate (anti-resorptive), and then ground into
   microparticles. Microparticles were mixed with or without HA into a PLGA
   solution, and the mixture was injected into buffer, leading to
   precipitation and creating solid scaffolds with embedded HA and PBAE
   microparticles. Simvastatin release was prolonged through 30days, and
   burst release was reduced from 81 to 39\% when loaded into PBAE
   microparticles. Clodronate burst was reduced from 49 to 32\% after
   addition of HA filler, but release kinetics were unaffected after
   loading into PBAE microparticles. Scaffold dry mass remained unchanged
   through day 15, with a pronounced increase in degradation rate after day
   30, while wet scaffolds experienced a mass increase through day 25 due
   to swelling. Porosity and pore size changed throughout degradation,
   likely due to a combination of swelling and degradation. The system
   offers improved release kinetics, multiple release profiles, and rapid
   solidification compared to traditional in situ forming implants.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of flowing, concentrated suspensions of non-colloidal
   particles continues to surprise, despite decades of work and the
   widespread importance of suspension transport properties to industrial
   processes and natural phenomena. Blanc, Lemaire \& Peters (J. Fluid
   Mech., 2014, vol. 746, R4) report a striking example. They probed the
   time-dependent dynamics of concentrated suspensions of rigid and
   neutrally buoyant spheres by simultaneously measuring the oscillatory
   rheology and the sedimentation rate of a falling ball. The sedimentation
   velocity of the ball through the suspension depends strongly on the
   frequency of oscillation, though the rheology was found to be
   independent of frequency. The results demonstrate the complexities of
   suspension flows and highlight opportunities for improving models by
   exploring suspension dynamics and rheology over a wide range of
   conditions, beyond steady and unidirectional ones.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive and functional neural correlates of human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV) are only partially understood at present. Variability in
   neural response, which has been noted in the literature, may relate to
   clinical factors associated with HIV, including time since HIV
   diagnosis, CD4 count and nadir, HIV viral load, and comorbid infectious
   processes, especially hepatitis C. The present investigation evaluated
   working memory-related functional neural activation in 26 HIV+
   participants, 28 demographically matched HIV-seronegative individuals,
   and 8 HIV+ individuals with hepatitis C coinfection. Analyses examined
   impact of HIV infection duration, CD4 count and nadir, HIV viral load,
   and hepatitis C serostatus. Results showed that HIV-seronegative
   participants had fastest reaction times, and during the working memory
   task, HIV+ participants with hepatitis C coinfection showed strongest
   bias toward commission errors; however, signal detection (i.e., overall
   task performance) was equivalent across groups. Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) results showed HIV-related greater activation
   to an easier vigilance task and HIV-related lower activation to a more
   difficult working memory task, consistent with reduced cognitive
   reserve. Hepatitis C coinfection related to diffuse neural
   dysregulation. Correlational analyses suggested relationships of
   increasingly severe disease with poorer functioning in brain regions
   linked to error monitoring and attention regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The life extension of current pressurized water reactors and the design
   of reliable next-generation nuclear reactors call for advanced
   structural steels that can sustain radiation up to several hundred
   displacements per atom (dpa) at elevated temperatures. Here we performed
   Fe ion irradiation to 150 dpa at 450 degrees C on bulk coarse-grained
   (CG, with a grain size of similar to 2 mu m) and ultrafine-grained (UFG,
   with grain size of similar to 320 nm) T91 steels. Extensive microscopy
   studies show that fine grains in UFG T91 reduced the density of
   nanocavities and dislocation loops. The swelling rate in UFG steel is
   three times lower than that of CG T91 due to the existence of abundant
   defect sinks, such as high angle grain boundaries and dislocations. A
   strong surface effect with size dependence was noted during heavy ion
   irradiation studies. The large deviation of swelling rate from neutron
   irradiated specimens implies the significance of He concentration and
   presumably dose rate on swelling in nuclear reactors. (C) 2014 Acta

Abstract = {{Fuel cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) has been identified as one of
   the crucial issues for developing Ferritic/Martensitic (F/M) stainless
   steel claddings for metallic fuels in a fast reactor. The anticipated
   elevated temperature and high neutron flux can significantly aggravate
   the FCCI, in terms of formation of inter-diffusion and lower melting
   point eutectic phases. To mitigate the FCCI, vanadium carbide coating as
   a diffusion barrier was deposited on the HT-9 substrate using a pack
   cementation diffusion coating (PCDC) method, and the processing
   temperature was optimized down to 730 degrees C. A solid metallurgical
   bonding between the coating layer and substrate was achieved, and the
   coating is free from through depth cracks. The microstructural
   characterizations using SEM and TEM show a nanostructured grain
   structure. EDS/WDS and XRD analysis confirm the phase of coating layer
   as V2C. Diffusion couple tests at 660 degrees C for 100 h demonstrate
   that V2C layer with a thickness of less than 5 mu m can effectively
   eliminate the inter-diffusion between the lanthanide cerium and HT-9

   Harvesting}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Tensegrity systems have been used in several disciplines such as
   architecture, biology, aerospace, mechanics, and robotics during the
   last 50 years. However, just a few references in literature have stated
   the possibility of using such systems in ocean or energy-related
   applications. This work addresses the kinematic and dynamic analyses of
   a planar tensegrity mechanism for ocean wave energy harvesting. Ocean
   wave mechanics and the most important concepts related to
   fluid-structure interaction are presented. Then, a planar 3 degrees of
   freedom (3-dof) tensegrity mechanism, based on a morphology defined by
   Kenneth Snelson in 1960 which is known as ``X-frame,{''} is proposed as
   connecting linkage to transmit wave-generated forces. A geometric
   approach is used to solve the forward and reverse displacement problems.
   The theory of screws is used to perform the forward and reverse velocity
   analyses of the device. The Lagrangian approach is used to deduce the
   equations of motion considering the interaction between the mechanism
   and ocean waves. The tensegrity-based mechanism is analyzed using a
   linear model of ocean waves and its energy harvesting capabilities are
   compared to a purely heaving device. Results show that the proposed
   tensegrity configuration allows to harvest 10\% more energy than the
   traditional heaving mechanism used in several wave energy harvesting
   applications. Therefore, tensegrity systems could play an important role
   in the expansion of clean energy technologies that help the world's
   sustainable development.}},

   aggregation}},
Journal = {{MARINE GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{354}},
Pages = {{34-39}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{For modeling the rate of deposition of cohesive flocs in estuaries the
   Krone equation is extensively used. It was derived from flume
   experiments on muddy sediment from the San Francisco Bay, and is
   applicable to low suspended sediment concentration environments in which
   shear-induced aggregation - the growth and break up of flocs - has a
   limited role. It is shown that the use of this equation can lead to
   erroneous estimates of the mass deposition flux at typically higher
   estuarine concentrations. Krone's own experimental data permit the
   development of a more general equation accounting for the effects of
   concentration and turbulent shear rate on aggregation. These effects are
   dramatically observed in a deposition test in which a wire mesh was
   inserted in the flow to change the turbulent shearing rate and increase
   deposition. Even with the inclusion of aggregation effect in the general
   equation, field-based observations from San Francisco Bay suggest that
   typical flumes generally may not meet the space and time scaling
   requirements for field application of laboratory data. Thus, although
   the Krone equation should be eschewed in favor of the general equation,
   interpretations of model-predicted deposition rate must not be accepted
   without robust field-based verification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the impacts of carbon regulatory mechanisms on
   replenishment decisions in a biofuel supply chain. We employ
   mathematical models for operations which integrate replenishment and
   supplier/transportation mode selection decisions. These models
   explicitly account for carbon emissions that may result from
   transportation and inventory storage activities. This research is
   motivated by observations indicating that nearly 19\% of the energy
   consumption and 25\% of the energy-related carbon dioxide emissions
   worldwide arise from transportation. Because freight transportation is
   expected to continue to grow, we consider the impacts of different
   carbon regulatory mechanisms on transportation and inventory
   replenishment decisions in a biofuel supply chain. A set of extensive
   numerical experiments uses the biofuel supply chain context to analyze
   the impacts of different regulatory mechanisms, including carbon cap,
   carbon tax, carbon cap and trade, and carbon offset, on performance. We
   use existing methodologies to calculate emissions as a function of
   distance traveled, load weight, and transportation mode used. We also
   use publicly available data to derive representative biomass
   transportation costs. As a consequence, our numerical results are
   meaningful, and give a realistic representation of the relationships
   between emissions from different transportation modes and the resulting
   costs. The results of our computational experiments indicate that carbon
   regulatory mechanisms have a non-trivial impact on replenishment
   schedules, and as a consequence, costs and emissions in the supply
   chain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Carbon dioxide capture using biochar produced from sugarcane bagasse and
   hickory wood}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic CO2 emissions continue to climb due to increases in global
   energy demand. Because power plants are the largest stationary source of
   anthropogenic CO2, developing effective and affordable post combustion
   CO2 capture technology has attracted substantial research attention.
   This study assessed the adsorption of CO2 onto biochar, a low-cost
   adsorbent that can be produced from waste biomass through
   low-temperature pyrolysis. Sugarcane bagasse (BG) and hickory wood (HW)
   feedstock converted into biochar at 300, 450, and 600 degrees C.
   Sorption of CO2 on each of the resulted biochar was measured by
   monitoring its weight changes in CO2 at 25 or 75 degrees C. The biochar
   was found to be effective for CO2 capture and the adsorption process
   could be described by the second-order kinetics model. In general, the
   biochars produced at higher temperature had better CO2 capture
   performance. The BG biochar produced at 600 degrees C showed the most
   adsorption of CO2 (73.55 mg g(-1) at 25 degrees C). However, even when
   the feedstock was exposed to only 300 degrees C pyrolysis, the biochar
   was still able to capture more than 35 mg g(-1), CO2 at 25 degrees C.
   Experimental results suggest that CO2 weakly bound to the surface of the
   biochar through physisorption, so surface area was a significant
   determinant of CO2 adsorption (Pearson's r = 0.82); nevertheless, the
   presence of nitrogenous groups also played a role, when the surface area
   was sufficient. Biochafs porous structure and unique surface properties
   enable it to be an efficient CO2 adsorbent, while being sustainable and
   inexpensive. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Protecting sensitive surfaces from dust deposition in the limiting
   condition of the lunar atmosphere is imperative for space exploration.
   In this study, how back electrostatic field due to charge build-up on
   collection plates may affect the performance of an electrostatic lunar
   dust collector (ELDC) was investigated. The relationships between ELDC
   dimensions, collection efficiency and electrical properties of lunar
   dust particles were derived to develop a model, appropriate for any size
   of the ELDC. A Lagrangian-based discrete element method (DEM) was
   applied to track particle trajectories, and sensitivity analyses were
   conducted for the concentration of the incoming particles, the number of
   pre-collected particles and the applied voltages. The results revealed
   that the collection efficiency reduced over time due to the back
   electrostatic field of the collected particles, which ultimately led to
   a suspended regime, rather than just collected and penetrated fractions
   considered in conventional models. The generated back electrostatic
   field and the cloud of suspended particles were strong enough to disrupt
   the performances of both the ELDC and the protected device. The maximum
   time ELDC can run without significant loss in collection efficiency was
   estimated to be 10 terrestrial days for the studied ELDC size and
   applied voltage. Because the electrical power was negligible compared to
   the provided power by the solar panels, increasing the applied voltage
   was found to be the best option to counteract back electrostatic growth.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{734}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic properties of rivers and streams are primary controls on
   the abundance and structure of algal communities. In Florida, USA,
   filamentous macroalgal proliferation in spring-fed rivers has largely
   been attributed to nitrogen enrichment; however, changes in
   hydrodynamics and other potential mechanisms have not been thoroughly
   evaluated. This study tested whether macroalgal abundance (primarily
   Lyngbya wollei) was related to hydrodynamics in Gum Slough, a
   sub-tropical Florida spring-fed river. Flow velocities and macroalgal
   cover were measured at three transects bimonthly between June 2010 and
   January 2013, a period during which river discharge fluctuated in
   response to a drought and a tropical storm. Temporal variation in
   macroalgal cover was significantly inversely related to flow velocity,
   excluding fall/winter sampling events when light limitation was likely.
   The results indicate a velocity threshold below which macroalgal cover
   increased substantially, and a lower threshold below which complete
   cover frequently occurred. Local differences in channel morphology and
   substrate type (i.e., aquatic plant beds) seemed to affect the
   relationship between macroalgal cover and velocity at each transect.
   Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and other water chemistry
   parameters were not associated with variation in macroalgal cover.
   Overall, this study suggests that hydrodynamics can strongly control
   filamentous macroalgae in Florida spring-fed rivers.}},

Abstract = {{It is believed that the lateral line found in most fish and some other
   aquatic organisms plays an important role in many behaviors by providing
   hydrodynamic information about the surrounding fluid. This paper
   presents a lateral line inspired feedforward control design for the
   autonomous underwater vehicles. The goal of this paper is to improve
   maneuvering accuracy for underwater exploration and environmental
   monitoring. The proposed controller takes pressure measurements at
   multiple locations over the entire vehicle hull and forms a B-spline
   surface approximation of the pressure distribution. Hydrodynamic forces
   acting on the vehicle are then estimated and passed to the controller
   for the improved trajectory tracking performance. The algorithm is
   formulated in such a way that the force estimation is a linear, fixed
   weight combination of the pressure signals, which enables rapid online
   computation. The performance of the feedforward controller is simulated
   in conjunction with the ``robust integral of the sign of the error{''}
   control design. Trajectory tracking is investigated for control accuracy
   in the presence of localization errors. Reduced tracking errors are
   observed with the feedforward design. Experimental tests with pressure
   sensors on a moving cylinder further vindicate the force estimation
   algorithm.}},

Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{662-676}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Existing research indicated that the ambient crosswind (ACW) has very
   complex influences on the SUPPS both through the chimney outlet and
   collector inlet as demonstrated by numerical analysis from the Spanish
   prototype. But what influence exert ACW through chimney outlet and
   collector inlet independently on the overall performance of SUPPS is
   still unclear. In this research, two geometrical models are constructed
   for numerical simulation on industrial-scale SUPPS in the vicinity of 10
   MW. In model 1, ACW acts on both chimney outlet and collector inlet; in
   model 2, ACW acts only on the chimney outlet. Fluid flow, heat transfer
   and power output performances of SUPPS are investigated and discussed.
   It is found that, the negative effect of ACW only occurs at the
   collector inlet, with cold ambient air into the collector resulting in
   changing of fluid distribution and deterioration of buoyant driving
   force, whereas the positive effect occurs at the chimney outlet, with
   strong ACW passing by the chimney outlet causing entrainment of buoyant
   airflow within the chimney outlet. To avoid deterioration and to improve
   the overall performance of SUPPS, effective measures can be taken to
   prevent ACW from entering the collector inlet and also to induce
   beneficial effects of high altitude strong ACW blowing across the
   chimney outlet. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The local structure of K0.5Na0.5NbO3 is investigated using

   demonstrates its ability to accurately capture the local structure
   patterns derived from the random distribution of K and Na on the

   interactions are suggested to be the driving force behind the R3c to Pm
   phase transition. A comparison between the SQS and a rocksalt structure
   shows the inability of the latter to account for the local variability

Abstract = {{We report a systematic study of the magnetic properties in transition
   metals doped with WSe2 through the use of first principle calculations.
   The results demonstrate the possibility of generating long-range room
   temperature ferromagnetic interaction in WSe2 with the use of Mn and Fe
   doping. In the case of Fe, a percolation threshold is required for
   long-range ferromagnetism, whereas the long-range room temperature
   ferromagnetic interaction in Mn-doped WSe2 persists even at a low
   concentration (similar to 5.6\%). The ferromagnetism is mediated by the
   delocalized p states in the Se atoms, which couple antiferromagnetically
   with the spin-down a(1) and e(1) states in Fe doping through a
   correlated interaction. In Mn doping, the p states of Se tend to couple
   ferromagnetically with the 3d state of Mn, which stabilizes the
   long-range ferromagnetism between the Mn ions, although the short-range
   interaction is antiferromagnetic. In addition, the calculations indicate
   that Fe and Mn tend to configure at a high spin state, thus they possess
   much larger magnetic moments in WSe2 than when they are doped into other
   transition metal dichalcogenides. We also discovered a strong dependence
   of the exchange interaction on the dopants' spatial positions,
   distances, and concentrations, which alters the magnetic coupling from
   strong ferromagnetism to strong antiferromagnetism. These results can
   provide useful guidance to engineer the magnetic properties of WSe2 in
   future experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Permeable base transistors (PBTs) fabricated by vacuum deposition or
   solution process have the advantages of easy fabrication and low power
   operation and are a promising device structure for flexible electronics.
   Intrinsic delay of PBT, which characterizes the speed of the transistor,
   is investigated by solving the three-dimensional Poisson equation and
   drift-diffusion equation self-consistently using finite element method.
   Decreasing the emitter thickness lowers the intrinsic delay by improving
   on-current, and a thinner base is also preferred for low intrinsic delay
   because of fewer carriers in the base region at off-state. The intrinsic
   delay exponentially decreases as the emitter contact Schottky barrier
   height decreases, and it linearly depends on the carrier mobility. With
   an optimized emitter contact barrier height and device geometry, a
   sub-nano-second intrinsic delay can be achieved with a carrier mobility
   of similar to 10 cm(2)/V/s obtainable in solution processed indium
   gallium zinc oxide, which indicates the potential of solution processed
   PBTs for GHz operations. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations are often used to interpret
   experimental shifts in core level binding energies. Calculations based
   on gradient-corrected (GC) exchange-correlation functionals are known to
   reproduce measured core level shifts (CLS) of isolated molecules and
   metal surfaces with reasonable accuracy. In the present study, we
   discuss a series of examples where the shifts calculated within a
   GC-functional significantly deviate from the experimental values, namely
   the CLS of C 1s in ethyl trifluoroacetate, Pd 3d in PdO and the O 1s
   shift for CO adsorbed on PdO(101). The deviations are traced to effects
   of the electronic self-interaction error with GC-functionals and
   substantially better agreements between calculated and measured CLS are
   obtained when a fraction of exact exchange is used in the
   exchange-correlation functional. (C) 2014 Author(s). All article

Abstract = {{In order to enable communication through a brain-computer interface
   (BCD, it is necessary to discriminate between distinct brain responses.
   As a first step, we probed the possibility to discriminate between
   affirmative ({''}yes{''}) and negative ({''}no{''}) responses using a
   semantic classical conditioning paradigm, within an fMRI setting.
   Subjects were presented with congruent and incongruent word-pairs as
   conditioned stimuli (CS), respectively eliciting affirmative and
   negative responses. Incongruent word-pairs were associated to an
   unpleasant unconditioned stimulus (scream, US1) and congruent word-pairs
   were associated to a pleasant unconditioned stimulus (baby-laughter,
   US2), in order to elicit emotional conditioned responses (CR). The aim
   was to discriminate between affirmative and negative responses, enabled
   by their association with the positive and negative affective stimuli.
   In the late acquisition phase, when the US were not present anymore,
   there was a strong significant differential activation for incongruent
   and congruent word-pairs in a cluster comprising the left insula and the
   inferior frontal triangularis. This association was not found in the
   habituation phase. These results suggest that the difference in
   affirmative and negative brain responses was established as an effect of
   conditioning, allowing to further investigate the possibility of using
   this paradigm for a binary choice BCI.}},

   Carbon Nanotubes through Selective Adsorption onto Hydrogels}},

Abstract = {{The electronic-type separation of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
   by selective adsorption onto hydrogel surfaces has become a highly
   researched method. However, large variations in both SWCNT dispersion
   and separation protocols have been reported, making it difficult to
   elucidate whether changes to dispersion state or separation parameters
   are responsible for the observations reported in the literature. This
   study systematically evaluates the role that hydrogel type (dextran- or
   agarose-based) and SWCNT loading concentration have on separation
   quality, throughput, and reproducibility. For dextran-based gels,
   increased dextran concentration rather than cross-linker concentration
   improves retention and selectivity, suggesting that hydroxyl groups
   rather than linker molecules are the active adsorption sites. SWCNTs
   have much stronger interactions with agarose- than dextran-based gels.
   This stronger adsorption capacity combined with the improved retention
   of SWCNTs at higher agarose concentration suggests that the double
   helices formed by agarose are important to the adsorption of nanotubes.
   The quality and selectivity of the separations are heavily influenced by
   the initial concentration of SWCNTs; the purity of the metallic fraction
   falls rapidly as SWCNT concentration increases from 20 to 70 mg/L in
   Sephacryl 200 HR columns. The reproducibility of the separation is
   greatly affected by the amount of cross-linking in the gel, but
   restabilization of the hydrogel remains a critical concern for continued
   use. In general, the highest-throughput separations are obtained with
   dextran-based gels, while agarose-based gels produce higher purity
   fractions of metallic SWCNTs (>98\%) and better reproducibility in
   consecutive separations.}},

Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{We present 63 high-speed video frames (108 kilo-frames per second
   (kfps), 9.26 s per frame) showing the development of the downward
   negative stepped leader in the initial stage of an altitude-triggered
   flash. The downward negative stepped leader initiated from the bottom of
   the triggering wire at a height of about 128 m above ground and, 553 s
   later, it struck a lightning rod located at a distance of about 50 m
   from the launch tower. During the leader's development, electric field
   derivative pulses were detected associated with leader stepping. The
   interpulse intervals ranged from 3 to 27 mu s with a mean value of 13 mu
   s. Distinct segments of luminosity were observed ahead of the main
   leader channel that appear similar to space leaders were observed in the
   high-speed video frames. A total of eight luminous segments were
   observed that were 1 m to 6 m in length and were centered at distances
   from the main leader channel ranging from 3 m to 8 m. The new leader
   steps that appeared in the frames following the luminous segments were 5
   m to 8 m in length. Two of the observed segments apparently never
   connected to the leader channel and thus failed to produce a new leader
   step.}},

Abstract = {{A connected dominating set (CDS) is commonly used to model a virtual
   backbone of a wireless network. To bound the distance that information
   must travel through the network, we explicitly restrict the diameter of
   a CDS to be no more than s leading to the concept of a dominating
   s-club. We prove that for any fixed positive integer s it is NP-complete
   to determine if a graph has a dominating s-club, even when the graph has
   diameter s + 1. As a special case it is NP-complete to determine if a
   graph of diameter two has a dominating clique. We then propose a compact
   integer programming formulation for the related minimization problem,
   enhance the approach with variable fixing rules and valid inequalities,
   and present computational results. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   contaminated water effluents}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{276}},
Pages = {{408-414}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the interactions between
   metallic iron particles and mercury (Hg) dissolved in aqueous solutions.
   The effect of bulk zero valent iron (ZVI) particles was tested by use of
   (i) granular iron and (ii) iron particles with diameters in the
   nano-size range and referred to herein as nZVI. The results show that
   the interactions between Hgn+ and Fe are dominated by Hg volatilization
   and Hg adsorption; with Hg adsorption being the main pathway for Hg
   removal from solution. Hg adsorption kinetic studies using ZVI and nZVI
   resulted in higher rate constants (k) for nZVI when k values were
   expressed as a function of mass of iron used (day(-1) g(-1)). In
   contrast, ZVI showed higher rates of Hg removal from solution when k
   values were expressed as a function iron particles' specific surface
   area (gm(-2) day(-1)). Overall, nZVI particles had a higher maximum
   sorption capacity for Hg than ZVI, and appeared to be an efficient
   adsorbent for Hg dissolved in aqueous solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{High-temperature arc gasification (HTAG) has been proposed as a viable
   technology for the generation of energy and the production of saleable
   byproducts from municipal solid waste (MSW). Total concentrations of
   elements in HTAG slag were assessed and indicated a high partitioning of
   trace elements (Pb, Cd, and As) into the flue gas, an issue of concern
   when assessing the air pollution control residues (APCR) status as a
   hazardous waste. Hazardous waste leaching tests {[}such as the toxicity
   characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP)] were performed and confirmed
   that the slag did not meet U.S. criteria for a hazardous waste. Leaching
   was assessed using batch and column tests; the results revealed that Sb
   and Al were elevated in respect to risk-based regulatory thresholds.
   Slag samples were carbonated to simulate weathering effects, and
   although leachable concentrations of Al did decrease by an order of
   magnitude, Sb concentrations were found to increase. Low total
   concentrations of certain trace elements (As, Cd, and Pb), with respect
   to MSW incineration bottom ashes support the potential for reuse of HTAG
   slag; however, leaching of elements (Pb, Al, and Sb) in batch and column
   tests indicate that proper engineering controls would need to be taken
   to ensure protection of water supplies in a reuse application.}},

Title = {{Effect of Hydrofracking Fluid on Colloid Transport in the Unsaturated
   Zone}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{8266-8274}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing is expanding rapidly in the US to meet increasing
   energy demand and requires high volumes of hydrofracking fluid to
   displace natural gas from shale. Accidental spills and deliberate land
   application of hydrofracking fluids, which return to the surface during
   hydrofracking, are common causes of environmental contamination. Since
   the chemistry of hydrofracking fluids favors transport of colloids and
   mineral particles through rock cracks, it may also facilitate transport
   of in situ colloids and associated pollutants in unsaturated soils. We
   investigated this by subsequently injecting deionized water and flowback
   fluid at increasing flow rates into unsaturated sand columns containing
   colloids. Colloid retention and mobilization was measured in the column
   effluent and visualized in situ with bright field microscopy. While <5\%
   of initial colloids were released by flushing with deionized water,
   32-36\% were released by flushing with flowback fluid in two distinct
   breakthrough peaks. These peaks resulted from 1) surface tension
   reduction and steric repulsion and 2) slow kinetic disaggregation of
   colloid flocs. Increasing the flow rate of the flowback fluid mobilized
   an additional 36\% of colloids, due to the expansion of water filled
   pore space. This study suggests that hydrofracking fluid may also
   indirectly contaminate groundwater by remobilizing existing colloidal
   pollutants.}},

Volume = {{345}},
Pages = {{85-93}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{This study quantified the formation and speciation of halogenated
   organic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during chlorination as a function
   of seawater intrusion by spiking fresh groundwater with 0.1\% to 2\%
   seawater by volume. The four chlorine- and bromine-containing
   trihalomethanes (THM4) and the nine chlorine- and bromine-containing
   haloacetic acids (HAA9) were the DBPs investigated. The bromide
   concentration increased from 38 mu g L-1 in fresh groundwater to 974 ug
   L-1 in 2\% seawater, and upon chlorination the concentration of THM4
   increased from 43 to 206 pg L-1 and the concentration of HAA9 increased
   from 39 to 75 pig L-1. At 0.4\% seawater and higher the THM4
   concentration exceeded the U.S. EPA maximum contaminant level of 80 pg
   L-1. Although the mass concentration of HAA9 increased by nearly a
   factor of 2 over the seawater range of 0\% to 2\%, the mass
   concentration of the five regulated HAAs (i.e., HAA5) remained
   approximately constant. This is because HAA5 excludes four
   bromine-containing species. The increase in mass concentrations of THM4
   and HAA9 with increasing seawater intrusion was the result of an
   increased molar formation of DBP species and a shift from chlorinated
   species to brominated species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: One segment of a RNA sequence might be paired with another
   segment of the same RNA sequence due to the force of hydrogen bonds.
   This two-dimensional structure is called the RNA sequence's secondary
   structure. Several algorithms have been proposed to predict an RNA
   sequence's secondary structure. These algorithms are referred to as RNA
   folding algorithms.
   Results: We develop cache efficient, multicore, and GPU algorithms for
   RNA folding using Nussinov's algorithm.
   Conclusions: Our cache efficient algorithm provides a speedup between
   1.6 and 3.0 relative to a naive straightforward single core code. The
   multicore version of the cache efficient single core algorithm provides
   a speedup, relative to the naive single core algorithm, between 7.5 and
   14.0 on a 6 core hyperthreaded CPU. Our GPU algorithm for the NVIDIA
   C2050 is up to 1582 times as fast as the naive single core algorithm and
   between 5.1 and 11.2 times as fast as the fastest previously known GPU
   algorithm for Nussinov RNA folding.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the deposition of
   amyloid beta (A beta) proteins within the walls of the cerebral
   vasculature with subsequent aggressive vascular inflammation leading to
   recurrent hemorrhagic strokes. The objective of the study was to develop
   theranostic nanovehicles (TNVs) capable of a) targeting cerebrovascular
   amyloid; b) providing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast for the
   early detection of CAA; and c) treating cerebrovascular inflammation
   resulting from CAA. The TNVs comprised of a polymeric nanocore made from
   Magnevist (R) (MRI contrast agent) conjugated chitosan. The nanocore was
   also loaded with cyclophosphamide (CYC), an immunosuppressant shown to
   reduce the cerebrovascular inflammation in CAA. Putrescine modified
   F(ab')(2) fragment of anti-amyloid antibody, IgG4.1 (pF(ab')(2)4.1) was
   conjugated to the surface of the nanocore to target cerebrovascular
   amyloid. The average size of the control chitosan nanoparticles
   (conjugated with albumin and are devoid of Magnevist (R), CYC, and
   pF(ab')(2)4.1) was 164 +/- 1.2 nm and that of the TNVs was 239 +/- 4.1
   nm. The zeta potential values of the CCNs and TNVs were 21.6 +/- 1.7 mV
   and 11.9 +/- 0.5 mV, respectively. The leakage of Magnevist (R) from the
   TNVs was a modest 0.2\% over 4 days, and the CYC release from the TNVs
   followed Higuchi's model that describes sustained drug release from
   polymeric matrices. The studies conducted in polarized human
   microvascular endothelial cell monolayers (hCMEC/D3) in vitro as well as
   in mice in vivo have demonstrated the ability of TNVs to target
   cerebrovascular amyloid. In addition, the TNVs provided contrast for
   imaging cerebrovascular amyloid using MRI and single photon emission
   computed tomography. Moreover, the TNVs were shown to reduce
   pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the A beta challenged blood
   brain barrier (BBB) endothelium more effectively than the
   cyclophosphamide alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene glycol) based hydrogel microparticles were developed for
   pulmonary drug delivery. Hydrogels are particularly attractive for
   pulmonary delivery because they can be size engineered for delivery into
   the bronchi, yet also swell upon reaching their destination to avoid
   uptake and clearance by alveolar macrophages. To develop
   enzyme-responsive hydrogel microparticles for pulmonary delivery a new
   synthesis method based on a solution polymerization was developed. This
   method produces spherical poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) microparticles
   from high molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate
   (PEGDA)-based precursors that incorporate peptides in the polymer chain.
   Specifically, we have synthesized hydrogel microparticles that degrade
   in response to matrix metalloproteinases that are overexpressed in
   pulmonary diseases. Small hydrogel microparticles with sizes suitable
   for lung delivery by inhalation were obtained from solid precursors when
   PEGDA was dissolved in water at a high concentration. The average
   diameter of the particles was between 2.8 and 4 mu m, depending on the
   molecular weight of the precursor polymer used and its concentration in
   water. The relation between the physical properties of the particles and
   their enzymatic degradation is also reported, where an increased mesh
   size corresponds to increased degradation.}},

Abstract = {{A vertical transistor based on a double gated, atomically thin
   heterojunction is theoretically examined. Both p-type and n-type
   transistor operations can be conveniently achieved by using one of the
   two gates as the switching gate. The transistor shows excellent
   saturation of output I-V characteristics due to drain-induced depletion
   and lack of tunneling barrier layers. The subthreshold slope could be
   below the thermionic limit due to band filtering as the switching
   mechanism. The atomically thin vertical PN heterojunction can be
   electrostatically modulated from a type II heterojunction to a broken
   bandgap alignment, which is preferred for maximizing the on-current. (C)

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the unambiguous detection of the fission neutron signal
   produced in natural uranium during active neutron interrogation using a
   deuterium-deuterium fusion neutron generator and a high pressure 4 He
   gas fast neutron scintillation detector. The energy deposition by
   individual neutrons is quantified, and energy discrimination is used to
   differentiate the induced fission neutrons from the mono-energetic
   interrogation neutrons. The detector can discriminate between different
   incident neutron energies using pulse height discrimination of the slow
   scintillation component of the elastic scattering interaction between a
   neutron and the 4 He atom. Energy histograms resulting from this data
   show the buildup of a detected fission neutron signal at higher
   energies. The detector is shown here to detect a unique fission neutron
   signal from a natural uranium sample during active interrogation with a
   (d, d) neutron generator. This signal path has a direct application to
   the detection of shielded nuclear material in cargo and air containers.
   It allows for continuous interrogation and detection while greatly
   minimizing the potential for false alarms. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A series of four quadrupolar (Donor)(2)Acceptor-acid (D(2)A)
   sensitizers, based on two acceptor cores (dibenzophenazine (DBP) or

   connecting position to the core. This architectural design leads to the
   investigation of the structure-property relationships of the dyes, both
   in solution and upon integration in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
   Within sets of regioisomers, frontier orbital levels and absorption
   properties differed, but the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs were
   similar. When examining the effect of the core, the electronic
   properties (absorbance, LUMO level) predicted a more favourable electron

Abstract = {{The closest string problem (CSP) consists in finding a string t with
   minimum Hamming distance from the strings of a given finite input set.
   To overcome its NP-hardness, we propose a simulated annealing approach
   along with a new heuristic for finding a good initial solution for the
   problem, which allows one to speed up sensibly the convergence of the
   algorithm. To assess its effectiveness and robustness, we extensively
   compared our approach with the integer-programming (IP) exact solution,
   and with other heuristic approaches present in the literature, both on
   artificial and real instances. Experimental results show that our
   approach allows one to locate good solutions for the problem, that are
   close to the optimum found by the IP formulation and outperforms other
   heuristic methods for the CSP.}},

Abstract = {{Feature selection can efficiently improve the accuracy of classification
   and reduce the measurement, storage and computation demands, and thus it
   has been applied in biomedical research increasingly. Considering the
   non-deterministic polynomial-time hard characteristic of feature
   selection, meta-heuristics are introduced into feature selection in
   biomedicine on account of their excellent global search ability.
   However, most of biomedical problems are characterized by high
   dimensionality, which is a challenge for feature selection methods based
   on meta-heuristics due to the curse of dimensionality. Thus, six
   meta-heuristics, that is, a genetic algorithm, particle swarm
   optimization, ant colony optimization, harmony search, differential
   evolution, and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, which are widely
   studied in the meta-heuristic community, are introduced into feature
   selection in this paper and the performance of the algorithms is
   analysed and compared with each other for solving feature selection in
   biomedicine effectively. To evaluate the search ability of the
   algorithms fairly and exactly, a set of feature selection benchmark
   problems are designed and yielded for the performance tests. The
   experimental results show that all the meta-heuristics are powerful
   enough to achieve the ideal results on low-dimensional feature selection

   energy equations for the Rayleigh numbers in the range from 10(-1) to
   10(4). The Poisson equations are solved to find the grid points, which
   are distributed in a nonuniform manner with higher concentration close
   to the solid regions. In addition, the HYBRID differencing scheme is
   used for the approximation of the convective terms in the curvilinear
   coordinate. The effects of the Rayleigh numbers and cylinder spacing
   from the adiabatic ceiling on both the local and average Nusselt numbers
   around the cylinder are investigated. Numerical results are performed

Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Post-grouting of deep foundations following installation is a proven
   technique for enhancing axial resistance. The grouting is performed
   either below the tip of the foundation only (e.g., post-tip-grouted
   drilled shafts) or at both the side and the tip (e.g., jetted, side, and
   tip-grouted precast piles). The interaction of such foundations in group
   placement is currently unknown. This research focused on the group
   behavior of post-tip-grouted drilled shafts and jetted, side, and
   tip-grouted piles at a center-to-center spacing of three times the
   pile/shaft diameter. The study revealed that the post-tip-grouted
   drilled shafts acted independently within the group (i.e., negligible
   group interaction), whereas jetted, side, and tip-grouted piles behaved
   as a block under axial loading. It was determined that side grouting of
   a foundation prior to tip grouting significantly increases the grout
   pressure developed during tip grouting and helps in the formation of a
   tip grout bulb via a spherical cavity expansion process. Thus, the side
   and tip grouting of adjacent foundations within a group increases the
   confining stress and relative density of the soil mass within the group,
   resulting in block behavior under top-down loading. In contrast,
   tip-only grouted foundations showed little if any increase in radial
   stress and radial soil displacement, resulting in minimal improvement of
   the soil stiffness between shafts; as a result there was no block
   behavior and a negligible group effect at the tip.}},

Abstract = {{Infection of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) by Aspergillus flavus and
   subsequent aflatoxin contamination is a serious health and economic
   concern worldwide. Considering the role of calcium (Ca) in cell wall
   development, it has been shown to be associated with reduced A. flavus
   infection. In order to examine the influence of Ca content in shell
   (also called pod wall or hull), seed coat, and seed in relation to
   resistance to A. flavus infection, a pot experiment was conducted in a
   greenhouse of the Faculty of Agriculture, Chiang Mai University,
   Thailand during May- September, 2006, using three peanut genotypes:
   419CC, drought and aflatoxin susceptible; 511CC, drought and aflatoxin
   resistant; and Tainan 9, a commercial variety in Thailand. Results
   showed that an increase in the concentration of Ca in the nutrient
   solution increased in the amount of Ca in shell, seed coat, and seed,
   and that higher Ca content was reduced the incidence of shell and seed
   infection by A. flavus for all three peanut genotypes. Genotype 511CC
   had the highest Ca content in shell (0.35 g/100 g), seed coat (0.37
   g/100 g) and seed (0.40 g/100 g) and had the lowest incidence of A.
   flavus infection in shell (8.1\%) and seed (2.2\%) as compared to
   genotype 419CC, which had the lowest Ca content in shell (0.21 g/100 g),
   seed coat (0.18 g/100 g), and seed (0.20 g/100 g) and had the highest
   infection of shell (36.3\%) and seed (13.3\%). No seed infection was
   found in genotype 511CC under a high concentration of Ca (2500 ppm).
   From these results, it could be suggested that Ca content in peanut
   shell, seed coat, and seed might be applied as a criterion in selection
   for resistance to A. flavus infection. It was also found that genotype
   511CC supported the lowest levels of A. flaws infection which suggested
   that this genotype might be a potential source of resistance that could
   be used to incorporate aflatoxin resistance into commercial peanut
   hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{An effective urban water demand management program can greatly influence
   both peak and average demand and therefore long-term water supply and
   infrastructure planning. Although a theoretical framework for evaluating
   residential indoor demand management has been well established, little
   has been done to evaluate other water use sectors such as residential
   irrigation in a compatible manner for integrating these results into an
   overall solution. This paper presents a systematic procedure to evaluate
   the optimal blend of single family residential irrigation demand
   management strategies to achieve a specified goal based on performance
   functions derived from parcel level tax assessor's data linked to
   customer level monthly water billing data. This framework is then
   generalized to apply to any urban water sector, as exponential functions
   can be fit to all resulting cumulative water savings functions. Two
   alternative formulations are presented: maximize net benefits, or
   minimize total costs subject to satisfying a target water savings.
   Explicit analytical solutions are presented for both formulations based
   on appropriate exponential best fits of performance functions. A direct
   result of this solution is the dual variable which represents the
   marginal cost of water saved at a specified target water savings goal. A
   case study of 16,303 single family irrigators in Gainesville Regional
   Utilities utilizing high quality tax assessor and monthly billing data
   along with parcel level GIS data provide an illustrative example of
   these techniques. Spatial clustering of targeted homes can be easily
   performed in GIS to identify priority demand management areas.}},

Abstract = {{Asymmetrical activation of right and left hemispheres differentially
   influences the autonomic nervous system. Additionally, each hemisphere
   primarily receives retinocollicular projections from the contralat-eye.
   To learn if asymmetrical hemispheric activation induced by monocular
   viewing would influence relative pupillary size and respiratory hippus
   variability (RHV), a measure of parasympathetic activity, healthy
   participants had their left, right or neither eye patched. Pupillary
   sizes were then recorded with infrared pupillography. Pupillary dilation
   was significantly greater with left than right eye viewing. RHV,
   however, was not different between eye viewing conditions. These
   differences in pupil dilatation may have been caused by relatively
   greater activation of the right hemispheric- mediated sympathetic
   activity induced by left monocular viewing or relatively greater
   deactivation of the left hemispheric- mediated para sympathetic activity
   induced by right eye patching. The absence of an asymmetry in RHV,
   however, suggests that hemispheric asymmetry of sympathetic activation
   was primarily responsible for this oculara symmetry of pupil dilation.

Abstract = {{Motivated by various applications in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs)
   that require nodes to share their individual information to each other,
   we study the multi-message dissemination problem in a MANET, which is to
   distribute multiple messages to all mobile nodes in the network in
   parallel. The objective is to minimize the stopping time, i.e., the time
   taking for all nodes to receive a copy of the whole messages. We
   consider an intrinsically one-sided protocol based on random linear
   network coding (RLNC), where all packets forwarded are in the form of
   random linear combinations of packets received so far. Its supreme
   performance is demonstrated theoretically for two cases, low mobility
   and high mobility, according to the node velocity. In particular, we
   show that, under general settings, our derived upper bounds of the
   stopping time match the established lower bound in both cases, although
   the effects of mobility in the two cases are significantly different.
   Thus, we conclude that RLNC achieves order optimality for fast
   information dissemination in MANETs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the implementation of a power supply for the generation

   mechanism is used to handle load variation. This is achieved through the
   characterization of the load at high voltages while generating plasma.
   Portability of the system is the primary goal of this paper. Thus, the
   implementation of a miniaturized circuit capable of achieving high
   efficiency and low power consumption at the same time is critical. The
   design and implementation of the complete battery-powered system, as

Abstract = {{Smart mobile phones are capable of performing video coding and streaming
   over wireless networks, but are often constrained by the end-to-end
   delay requirement and energy supply. To achieve optimal performance
   under the delay and energy constraints, in this paper we extend the
   traditional ratedistortion (R-D) model and the previously proposed delay
   R-D model to a novel delay-power-rate-distortion (d-P-R-D) model by
   including another two dimensions (the encoding time and encoder power
   consumption), which quantifies the relationship among source encoding
   delay, rate, distortion, and power consumption for IPPPP coding mode in
   H.264/AVC. We have verified the accuracy of our proposed d-P-R-D model
   through experiments. Based on the proposed d-P-R-D model, we develop a
   novel rate-control (RC) algorithm, which minimizes the encoding
   distortion under the constraints of rate, delay, and power. The
   experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RC
   algorithm over the existing scheme. Therefore, the d-P-R-D model and the
   model-based RC provide a theoretical basis and a practical guideline for
   the cross-layer system design and performance optimization in wireless
   video communication under delay and energy constraints.}},

Abstract = {{There is great interest in providing reliable and durable treatments for
   one- and two-compartment arthritic degeneration of the cruciate-ligament
   intact knee. One approach is to resurface only the diseased compartments
   with discrete unicompartmental components, retaining the undamaged
   compartment(s). However, placing multiple small implants into the knee
   presents a greater surgical challenge than total knee arthroplasty, so
   it is not certain that the natural knee mechanics can be maintained or
   restored. The goal of this study was to determine whether near-normal
   knee kinematics can be obtained with a robot-assisted
   multi-compartmental knee arthroplasty.
   Thirteen patients with 15 multi-compartmental knee arthroplasties using
   haptic robotic-assisted bone preparation were involved in this study.
   Nine subjects received a medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
   (UKA), three subjects received a medial UKA and patellofemoral (PF)
   arthroplasty, and three subjects received medial and lateral
   bi-unicondylar arthroplasty. Knee motions were recorded using
   video-fluoroscopy an average of 13 months (6-29 months) after surgery
   during stair and kneeling activities. The three-dimensional position and
   orientation of the implant components were determined using model-image
   registration techniques.
   Knee kinematics during maximum flexion kneeling showed femoral external
   rotation and posterior lateral condylar translation. All knees showed
   femoral external rotation and posterior condylar translation with
   flexion during the step activity. Knees with medial UKA and PF
   arthroplasty showed the most femoral external rotation and posterior
   translation, and knees with bicondylar UKA showed the least.
   Knees with accurately placed uni- or bi-compartmental arthroplasty
   exhibited stable knee kinematics consistent with intact and functioning
   cruciate ligaments. The patterns of tibiofemoral motion were more
   similar to natural knees than commonly has been observed in knees with
   total knee arthroplasty. Larger series are required to confirm these as
   general observations, but the present results demonstrate the potential
   to restore or maintain closer-to-normal knee kinematics by retaining
   intact structures and compartments.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of
   clean gaseous fuels made from plastics, automobile tire rubber,
   municipal solid waste (MSW), and woody biomass feedstock using a
   high-temperature pure-steam gasification process. Super-high-temperature
   steam at 1000 degrees C was used as the gasifying agent to generate the
   syngas which mainly contains hydrogen and carbon monoxide and can be
   used as a gaseous fuel. Since the process does not involve air, the
   syngas is free of nitrogen and its oxides which usually dilutes the
   syngas and lowers its heating value in the case of an air-blown
   partial-oxidation/partial gasification process. A lab-scale experimental
   apparatus was used to produce the high-quality syngas, and the gas was
   analyzed using a gas chromatography. The results showed that the syngas
   contained very high H-2 concentrations, and the heating values of the
   syngas for all four types of feedstock reached 8-10 MJ/m(3) which were
   approximately 2.5 times higher by weight and 1.6 times by volume as
   compared to those from the previous air-blown gasification system. In
   addition, a thermodynamic equilibrium model was developed and
   successfully verified by the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{A shoreline change data base for Florida dating back to the mid-1800s is
   unique in the United States, and perhaps the world, with thousands of
   shoreline change measurements at a nominal spacing of 300 m. Moreover,
   data are available on factors contributing to shoreline change,
   including beach nourishment, disposal of dredged sand outside the
   littoral zone, cutting of new inlets and subsequent growth of ebb
   shoals, and longshore sediment transport into and along the east coast
   of Florida. Effects of relative sea level rise can be estimated using
   the Bruun Rule. These factors should have caused significant shoreline
   recession since the mid-1800s, but instead, the east coast of Florida
   has experienced significant average shoreline advance. The formation of
   carbonate sand is shown not to account for this difference. Onshore
   transport of sand from beyond closure depth, probably during episodic
   storm events, is the only possible source of the large quantity of sand
   that has advanced on average the shoreline of Florida's east coast. For
   shorelines with significant offshore deposits of sand, it is possible
   that sea level rise in conjunction with wave action contributes to
   onshore transport and shoreline accretion.}},

Abstract = {{Designing eco-friendly system has been at the forefront of computing
   research. Faced with a growing concern about the server energy
   expenditure and the climate change, both industry and academia start to
   show high interest in computing systems powered by renewable energy
   sources. Existing proposals on this issue mainly focus on optimizing
   resource utilization or workload performance. The key supporting
   hardware structures for cross-layer power management and emergency
   handling mechanisms are often left unexplored. This paper presents
   GreenPod, a research framework for exploring scalable and dependable
   renewable power management in datacenters. An important feature of
   GreenPod is that it enables joint management of server power supplies
   and virtualized server workloads. Its interactive communication portal
   between servers and power supplies allows datacenter operators to
   perform real-time renewable energy driven load migration and power
   emergency handling. Based on our system prototype, we discuss an
   important topic: virtual machine (VM) workloads survival when facing
   extended utility outage and insufficient onsite renewable power budget.
   We show that whether a VM can survive depends on the operating
   frequencies and workload characteristics. The proposed framework can
   greatly encourage and facilitate innovative research in dependable green
   computing.}},

Abstract = {{When total parking supply in an urban downtown area is insufficient,
   morning commuters would choose their departure times not only to trade
   off bottleneck congestion and schedule delays, but also to secure a
   parking space. Recent studies found that an appropriate combination of
   reserved and unreserved parking spaces can spread the departures of
   those morning commuters and hence reduce their total travel cost. To
   further mitigate both traffic congestion and social cost from
   competition for parking, this study considers a parking reservation
   scheme with expiration times, where commuters with a parking reservation
   have to arrive at parking spaces for the reservation before a
   predetermined expiration time. We first show that if all parking
   reservations have the same expiration time, it is socially preferable to
   set the reservations to be non-expirable, i.e., without expiration time.
   However, if differentiated expiration times are properly designed, the
   total travel cost can be further reduced as compared with the
   reservation scheme without expiration time, since the peak will be
   further smoothed out. We explore socially desirable equilibrium flow
   patterns under the parking reservation scheme with differentiated
   expiration times. Finally, efficiencies of the reservation schemes are
   examined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Morning commuters may have to depart from home earlier to secure a
   parking space when parking supply in the city center is insufficient.
   Recent studies show that parking reservations can reduce highway
   congestion and deadweight loss of parking competition simultaneously.
   This study develops a novel tradable parking permit scheme to realize or
   implement parking reservations when commuters are either homogeneous or
   heterogeneous in their values of time. It is found that an expirable
   parking permit scheme with an infinite number of steps, i.e., the
   ideal-scheme, is superior to a time-varying pricing scheme in the sense
   that designing a permit scheme does not require commuters' value of time
   information and the performance of the scheme is robust to the variation
   of commuters' value of time. Although it is impractical to implement the
   ideal-scheme with an infinite number of steps, the efficiency loss of a
   permit scheme with finite steps can be bounded in both cases of
   homogeneous and heterogeneous commuters. Moreover, considering the
   permit scheme may lead to an undesirable benefit distribution among
   commuters, we propose an equal cost-reduction distribution of parking
   permits where auto commuters with higher value of time will receive
   fewer permits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{A Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) system generates an output in each operating
   cycle by combining results of multiple models (the ``experts{''}). The
   contribution of any given expert to a final solution depends on a
   parameter called responsibility, which can vary from cycle to cycle.
   When resources are insufficient to run all experts, two problems arise:
   1) how much utilization is to be allocated to experts and 2) how can a
   schedule be created based on these allocations. Problem (1) can be
   formulated as a succession of optimization problems, each of which
   calculates experts' allocations in a cycle. Explicit mappings from
   responsibilities to allocation weights are needed to solve each of these
   problems in every cycle using a technique called ``task compression
   (TC).{''} We refer to this baseline approach as TT-TC. Two other
   proposed heuristics TT-TC and TT-Top reduce TC's execution time to O(N)
   for N experts. To address (2), the proposed EPOC scheduler converts the
   heuristics' allocations into schedules that satisfy capacity, execution,
   and learning constraints across cycles. Simulations demonstrate that our
   approaches enable real-time computation and significantly decrease the
   average percentage error of limited-resource outputs (i.e., 0.2\%-40\%
   and 0.3\%-0.5\% when scheduled with TT-TC{*} and TT-Top, respectively,
   versus 0.2\%-97\% when using TT-TC).}},

Abstract = {{The accurate simulation of N cycle in winter cover crop-maize rotations
   can help to study management practices aimed at reducing N leaching. A
   lysimeter and field experiment were used to calibrate and test the model
   under irrigated Mediterranean conditions. Thereafter, the model was used
   to evaluate the impact of cover crop-maize rotations on N leaching for a
   range of soil types and irrigation managements during a 14 yr rotation
   in La Violada watershed, Spain. The Decision Support System for
   Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) v4.5.0.51 soil temperature subroutine
   overpredicted soil temperature, but this was improved when using a new
   EPIC-based soil temperature subroutine that will be available in DSSAT
   v4.6. The model was accurate simulating total maize N content in maize
   after fallow and after different cover crops (root mean square error
   {[}RMSE] = 25 kg N ha(-1)), adequately simulated N leaching reductions
   with cover crops, and was less efficient simulating soil inorganic N.
   Overall, the DSSAT-CENTURY model proved appropriate to simulate N cycle.
   DSSAT-CERES-Maize did not adequately simulate the observed yield
   reduction under N limitation in our high yielding conditions.
   Simulations in La Violada watershed indicate that N leaching in maize
   would still be high (44-98 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) under an optimized water
   and N management. Cover crop-maize rotations could reduce N leaching by
   31\% while supplying similar N availability to maize than fallow-maize
   rotations. The model was useful to study several management scenarios
   that would be difficult to investigate under field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{There is a large variety of trackers, which have been proposed in the
   literature during the last two decades with some mixed success. Object
   tracking in realistic scenarios is a difficult problem, therefore, it
   remains a most active area of research in computer vision. A good
   tracker should perform well in a large number of videos involving
   illumination changes, occlusion, clutter, camera motion, low contrast,
   specularities, and at least six more aspects. However, the performance
   of proposed trackers have been evaluated typically on less than ten
   videos, or on the special purpose datasets. In this paper, we aim to
   evaluate trackers systematically and experimentally on 315 video
   fragments covering above aspects. We selected a set of nineteen trackers
   to include a wide variety of algorithms often cited in literature,
   supplemented with trackers appearing in 2010 and 2011 for which the code
   was publicly available. We demonstrate that trackers can be evaluated
   objectively by survival curves, Kaplan Meier statistics, and Grubs
   testing. We find that in the evaluation practice the F-score is as
   effective as the object tracking accuracy (OTA) score. The analysis
   under a large variety of circumstances provides objective insight into
   the strengths and weaknesses of trackers.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal storage potential in commercial buildings is an enormous
   resource for providing various ancillary services to the grid. In this
   paper, we show how fans in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning
   (HVAC) systems of commercial buildings alone can provide substantial
   frequency regulation service, with little change in their indoor
   environments. A feedforward architecture is proposed to control the fan
   power consumption to track a regulation signal. The proposed control
   scheme is then tested through simulations based on a calibrated high
   fidelity non-linear model of a building. Model parameters are identified
   from data collected in Pugh Hall, a commercial building located on the
   University of Florida campus. For the HVAC system under consideration,
   numerical experiments demonstrate how up to 15\% of the rated fan power
   can be deployed for regulation purpose while having little effect on the
   building indoor temperature. The regulation signal that can be
   successfully tracked is constrained in the frequency band {[}1/tau(0,)
   1/tau(1) where tau(0) approximate to 3 minutes and tau(1) approximate to
   8 seconds. Our results indicate that fans in existing commercial
   buildings in the U.S. can provide about 70\% of the current national
   regulation reserve requirements in the aforementioned frequency band. A
   unique advantage of the proposed control scheme is that assessing the
   value of the ancillary service provided is trivial, which is in stark
   contrast to many demand-response programs.}},

Abstract = {{Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3), a perovskite material, rich in properties and
   with wide functionality, has had a marked impact on the field of
   multiferroics, as evidenced by the hundreds of articles published
   annually over the past 10 years. Studies from the very early stages and
   particularly those on polycrystalline BiFeO3 ceramics have been faced
   with difficulties in the preparation of the perovskite free of secondary
   phases. In this review, we begin by summarizing the major processing
   issues and clarifying the thermodynamic and kinetic origins of the
   formation and stabilization of the frequently observed secondary,
   nonperovskite phases, such as Bi25FeO39 and Bi2Fe4O9. The second part
   then focuses on the electrical and electromechanical properties of
   BiFeO3, including the electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity,
   high-field polarization, and strain response, as well as the weak-field
   piezoelectric properties. We attempt to establish a link between these
   properties and address, in particular, the macroscopic response of the
   ceramics under an external field in terms of the dynamic interaction
   between the pinning centers (e.g., charged defects) and the
   ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain walls.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloys have the potential to replace
   currently used implants for fixation, thereby eliminating the need for
   removal surgeries. To achieve a controllable degradation rate, surface
   oxidation has been proposed as an avenue to reduce the initial
   degradation. This study aims to investigate the oxidation behavior of
   binary Mg-rare earth alloys and the effect on biodegradation. Cast Mg-3X
   alloys (X = Gd, Y, Sc) were prepared and then oxidized in pure oxygen.
   The oxidation rate was evaluated using TGA and the oxides were further
   investigated and characterized using SEM, AES and XPS. The effect of
   oxidation on the degradation rate was investigated by immersion testing
   in Hanks' solution. The thermodynamics and oxidation kinetics of the
   alloys are discussed in regard to the obtained results, and it was
   concluded that the experimental results are in agreement with
   thermodynamic predictions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   differences between deterministic designs and reliability-based ones in

   failure, a deterministic design based on the same safety factor for both
   loads can be substantially heavier than the reliability-based design.
   The difference in weight is due to very different risk allocation

Abstract = {{Arsenic leaching and speciation in landfills, especially those with
   arsenic bearing waste and drywall disposal (such as construction and
   demolition (C\&D) debris landfills), may be affected by high levels of
   sulfide through the formation of thioarsenic anions. A methodology using
   ion chromatography (IC) with a conductivity detector was developed for
   the assessment of thioarsenic formation potential in sulfidic landfill
   environments. Monothioarsenate (H2AsSO3-) and dithioarsenate (H2AsS2O2-)
   were confirmed in the IC fractions of thioarsenate synthesis mixture,
   consistent with previous literature results. However, the observation of
   Ass; (x = 5-8) in the supposed trithioarsenate (H2AsS3O-) and
   tetrathioarsenate (H2AsS4-) IC fractions suggested the presence of new
   arsenic polysulfide complexes. All thioarsenate anions, particularly
   trithioarsenate and tetrathioarsenate, were unstable upon air exposure.
   The method developed for thioarsenate analysis was validated and
   successfully used to analyze several landfill leachate samples.
   Thioarsenate anions were detected in the leachate of all of the C\&D
   debris landfills tested, which accounted for approximately 8.5\% of the
   total aqueous As in the leachate. Compared to arsenite or arsenate,
   thioarsenates have been reported in literature to have lower adsorption
   on iron oxide minerals. The presence of thioarsenates in C\&D debris
   landfill leachate poses new concerns when evaluating the impact of
   arsenic mobilization in such environments. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   organic photovoltaics, particularly on various innovative device
   architectures and optical designs to maximize the power conversion
   efficiency of OPV cells for a given set of photoactive donor and

   materials, we firstly present different device architectures that have
   been used to optimize the charge generation and collection
   characteristics within the OPV devices. We then discuss various methods
   to manage and manipulate the light wave propagation in OPV devices for
   more complete absorption of the incident light, an important area that

Abstract = {{This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of a
   high-density multilayer stacked metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor
   based on a novel process of depositing the MIM multilayer on pillars
   followed by polishing and selective etching steps to form a stacked
   capacitor with merely three photolithography steps. In this paper, the
   pillars were made of glass to prevent substrate loss, whereas an
   oxide-nitride-oxide dielectric was employed for lower leakage, better
   voltage/frequency linearity, and better stress compensation. MIM
   capacitors with six dielectric layers were successfully fabricated,
   yielding capacitance density of 3.8 fF/mu m(2), maximum capacitance of
   2.47 nF, and linear and quadratic voltage coefficients of capacitance
   below 21.2 ppm/V and 2.31 ppm/V-2. The impedance was measured from 40 Hz
   to 3 GHz, and characterized by an analytically derived equivalent
   circuit model to verify the radio frequency applicability. The
   multilayer stacking-induced plate resistance mismatch and its effect on
   the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and effective capacitance was
   also investigated, which can be counteracted by a corrected metal
   thickness design. A low ESR of 800 m Omega was achieved, whereas the
   self-resonance frequency was >760 MHz, successfully demonstrating the
   feasibility of this method to scale up capacitance densities for
   high-quality-factor, high-frequency, and large-value MIM capacitors.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the uncertainty of transmission opportunities between mobile
   nodes, the routing in delay tolerant networks (DTNs) exploits the
   mechanism of store-carry-and-forward. In this routing mechanism,
   mobility plays an important role, and we need to control the mobility of
   nodes around the network to help with carrying messages from the source
   to the destination. This is a difficult problem because the nodes in the
   network may move arbitrarily and it is difficult for us to determine
   when the nodes should move faster to help the data transmission while
   considering the complicated energy consumption in such a network. At the
   same time, for most DTNs, the system energy is limited, and energy
   efficient algorithms are crucial to maximizing the message delivery
   probability while reducing the delivery cost. In this paper, we
   investigate the problem of energy efficient mobility speed control in
   epidemic routing of DTN. We model the message dissemination process
   under variable mobility speed by a continuous-time Markov model. With
   this model, we then formulate the optimization problem of the optimal
   mobility control for epidemic routing and obtain the optimal policy from
   the solution of this optimization problem. Furthermore, extensive
   numerical results demonstrate that the proposed optimal policy
   significantly outperforms the static policy with constant speed, in
   terms of energy saving. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to determine the
   effectiveness of ozonation as a pretreatment option for treating
   stabilized landfill leachate using reverse osmosis and nanofiltration
   membranes. Leachate from three different landfills was collected and
   characterized as stabilized leachate with a ratio of biochemical oxygen
   demand to chemical oxygen demand in the range of 0.02 to 0.12. Batch
   ozonation experiments were conducted by using an ozonation dose of 66.7
   g m(-3) for duration of 5 to 30 min. A maximum reduction of 78\% UV-254
   absorbing compounds and 23\% dissolved organic carbon was observed for
   all three leachates. An effective ozonation time of 10 min at an ozone
   dose of 66.7 g m(-3) was selected for leachate pretreatment before
   membrane operation. Even though the ozone-treated leachate contained
   approximately 50\% fewer UV-254 absorbing compounds than raw leachate,
   ozonation of leachate prior to membrane treatment resulted in a greater
   reduction in permeate flux as compared to raw leachate. The cause of
   increased permeate flux reduction with the ozonated leachate was
   assessed by using a flux dedine analysis alongside Hermia's crossflow
   filtration model. Hermia's crossflow filtration model indicated that
   each fouling mechanism occurred. The flux decline analysis suggested
   that distinct stages of fouling did not develop. While the cause of the
   increased fouling is suspected to be the coagulation of calcium and
   natural organic matter, further investigation is needed to determine the
   primary source of fouling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{40-51}},

Abstract = {{Previous publications have outlined recommended practices for hydrologic
   and water quality (H/WQ) modeling, but limited guidance has been
   published on how to consider the project's purpose or model's intended
   use, especially for the final stage of modeling applications namely
   evaluation, interpretation, and communication of model results. Such
   guidance is needed to more effectively evaluate and interpret model
   performance and more accurately communicate that performance to
   decision-makers and other modeling stakeholders. Thus, we formulated a
   methodology for evaluation, interpretation, and communication of H/WQ
   model results. The recommended methodology focuses on interpretation and
   communication of results, not on model development or initial
   calibration and validation, and as such it applies to the modeling
   process following initial calibration. The methodology recommends the
   following steps: 1) evaluate initial model performance; 2) evaluate
   outliers and extremes in observed values and bias in predicted values;
   3) estimate uncertainty in observed data and predicted values; 4)
   re-evaluate model performance considering accuracy, precision, and
   hypothesis testing; 5) interpret model results considering intended use;
   and 6) communicate model performance. A flowchart and tables were
   developed to guide model interpretation, refinement, and proper
   application considering intended model uses (i.e., Exploratory,
   Planning, and Regulatory/Legal). The methodology was designed to enhance
   application of H/WQ models through conscientious evaluation,
   interpretation, and communication of model performance to
   decision-makers and other stakeholders; it is not meant to be a
   definitive standard or a required protocol, but together with recent
   recommendations and published best practices serve as guidelines for
   enhanced model application emphasizing the importance of the model's
   intended use. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{How do various maize crop models vary in their responses to climate

Abstract = {{Potential consequences of climate change on crop production can be
   studied using mechanistic crop simulation models. While a broad variety
   of maize simulation models exist, it is not known whether different
   models diverge on grain yield responses to changes in climatic factors,
   or whether they agree in their general trends related to phenology,
   growth, and yield. With the goal of analyzing the sensitivity of
   simulated yields to changes in temperature and atmospheric carbon
   dioxide concentrations {[}CO2], we present the largest maize crop model
   intercomparison to date, including 23 different models. These models
   were evaluated for four locations representing a wide range of maize
   production conditions in the world: Lusignan (France), Ames (USA), Rio
   Verde (Brazil) and Morogoro (Tanzania). While individual models differed
   considerably in absolute yield simulation at the four sites, an ensemble
   of a minimum number of models was able to simulate absolute yields
   accurately at the four sites even with low data for calibration, thus
   suggesting that using an ensemble of models has merit. Temperature
   increase had strong negative influence on modeled yield response of
   roughly -0.5 Mg ha(-1) per degrees C. Doubling {[}CO2] from 360 to 720
   mu mol mol(-1) increased grain yield by 7.5\% on average across models
   and the sites. That would therefore make temperature the main factor
   altering maize yields at the end of this century. Furthermore, there was
   a large uncertainty in the yield response to {[}CO2] among models. Model
   responses to temperature and {[}CO2] did not differ whether models were
   simulated with low calibration information or, simulated with high level
   of calibration information.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of barium titanate (BT) to be electrically active makes it
   a material of interest in regenerative medicine. To enhance the
   understanding of this material for orthopedic applications, the in vitro
   biocompatibility of porous BT fabricated using a direct foaming
   technique was investigated. Characterization of the resultant foams
   yielded an overall porosity between 50 and 70\% with average pore size
   in excess of 30 mu m in diameter. A mouse osteoblast (7F2) cell line was
   cultured with the BT to determine the extent of the foams' toxicity
   using a LDH assay. After 72 h, BT foams showed a comparable cytotoxicity
   of 6.4 +/- 0.8\% to the 8.4 +/- 1.5\% of porous 45S5 Bioglass (R). The
   in vitro inflammatory response elicited from porous BT was measured as a
   function of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secreted from a
   human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). Results indicate that the BT
   foams do not cause a significant inflammatory response, eliciting a 9.4

Abstract = {{Membrane wings have applications that involve low Reynolds number flyers
   such as micro air vehicles. The time-averaged and time-dependent
   deformations of the membrane affect the aerodynamic characteristics of
   the wing, primarily in the region beyond the maximum aerodynamic
   efficiency of the wing. This paper investigates an appropriate
   nondimensional vibration frequency scaling of a spanwise tensioned
   membrane with free (unattached) leading and trailing edges at low
   Reynolds numbers relative to nondimensional aeroelastic parameters.
   Silicone rubber membranes with varying spanwise pre-tension, aerodynamic
   tension (due to wing angle-of-attack and flow dynamic pressure), modulus
   of elasticity, span, and thickness are studied. Experimental results are
   compared to a proposed scaling that simplifies the aerodynamic loading
   as a uniform pressure distribution acting on the membrane. Data is
   further compared and discussed relative to previous published results of
   membrane wings with finite wing spans (three-dimensional flow) and fixed
   (rigid) leading edges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the wind-induced tearing and blow-off of asphalt
   roofing shingles, which are the most frequently observed forms of
   residential building damage in hurricanes. Field surveys indicate that
   in-service asphalt shingle sealant strips can lose adhesion along their
   leading edge over time, leaving the shingle partially unsealed and
   susceptible to wind uplift. Two interrelated studies presented in this
   paper show that unsealing is a naturally occurring process and that
   unsealed shingles are a contributing cause of shingle roof cover damage
   in high winds. The first study quantified the number, location, and
   failure mode of laminate and three-tab style shingle systems installed
   on residential buildings at 30 sites in Florida and Texas. Systematic
   patterns of partially unsealed field shingles found on 22 of the 30
   roofs resembled spatial patterns of wind-induced shingle damage observed
   in post-hurricane building performance assessments. As expected, older
   roofs generally contained more unsealed shingles than newer roofs. The
   results of the second study link blow-off to partially unsealed
   shingles. Seventeen ASTM D7158 Class H asphalt shingle roofs were aged
   outside for nominally one year at the Insurance Institute for Business
   \& Home Safety Research Center and then evaluated in full-scale wind
   tunnel tests. Partially unsealed field and hip shingles frequently
   exhibited damage during wind testing, while fully sealed shingles were
   not damaged unless adjacent, unsealed shingles failed first. Published

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We propose an algorithm for adjusting data transmission parameters, such
   as the packet size and the code rate of forward error correction (FEC),
   to obtain maximum video quality under dynamic channel conditions. When
   determining transmission parameters, it is essential to calculate an
   accurate effective loss rate that reflects FEC recovery failures and
   over-deadline packets. To this end, we analyze the delays caused by FEC
   coding and the potential packet size variations. In our analysis, we
   consider the effect of delayed transmission of video packets incurred by
   the parity packets as well as the encoder and decoder buffers. With the
   analysis reflecting the delay effect, we are able to accurately estimate
   the delay patterns of all video packets. Based on the analysis results,
   we establish an accurate model for estimating the effective loss rate.
   Simulations show that the proposed effective loss rate model accurately
   estimates the effective loss rate and significantly improves the
   reconstructed video quality at the receiver. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{485}},
Pages = {{31-40}},

Abstract = {{High concentrations of iron (Fe(II)) and manganese (Mn(II)) reductively
   dissolved from soil minerals have been detected in groundwater
   monitoring wells near many municipal solid waste landfills. Air sparging
   and vadose zone aeration (VZA) were evaluated as remedial approaches at
   a closed, unlined municipal solid waste landfill in Florida, USA. The
   goal of aeration was to oxidize Fe and Mn to their respective immobile
   forms. VZA and shallow air sparging using a partially submerged well
   screen were employed with limited success (Phase 1); decreases in
   dissolved iron were observed in three of nine monitoring wells during
   shallow air sparging and in two of 17 wells at VZA locations. During
   Phase 2, where deeper air sparging was employed, dissolved iron levels
   decreased in a significantly greater number of monitoring wells
   surrounding injection points, however no radial pattern was observed.
   Additionally, in wells affected positively by air sparging (mean total
   iron (Fe-TOT) <4.2 mg/L, after commencement of air sparging), rising
   manganese concentrations were observed, indicating that the redox
   potential of the groundwater moved from an iron-reducing to a
   manganese-reducing environment. The mean Fe-TOT concentration observed
   in affected monitoring wells throughout the study was 1.40 mg/L compared
   to a background of 15.38 mg/L, while the mean Mn concentration was 0.60
   mg/L compared to a background level of 0.27 mg/L Reference wells located
   beyond the influence of air sparging areas showed little variation in
   Fe-TOT and Mn, indicating the observed effects were the result of air
   injection activities at study locations and not a natural phenomenon.
   Air sparging was found effective in intercepting plumes of dissolved Fe
   surrounding municipal landfills, but the effect on dissolved Mn was
   contrary to the desired outcome of decreased Mn groundwater
   concentrations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ESTUARIES AND COASTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1028-1040}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic models are
   used to simulate the hurricane-induced storm surge and coastal
   inundation in regions with vegetation. Typically, 2D storm surge models
   use an enhanced Manning coefficient while 3D storm surge models use a
   roughness height to represent the effects of coastal vegetation on flow.
   This paper presents a 3D storm surge model which accurately resolves the
   effects of vegetation on the flow and turbulence. First, a
   vegetation-resolving 1DV Turbulent Kinetic Energy model (TKEM) is
   introduced and validated with laboratory data. This model is both robust
   enough to accurately model flows in complex canopies, while compact and
   efficient enough for incorporation into a 3D storm surge-wave modeling
   system: Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in 3D-Surface WAves Nearshore
   (CH3D-SWAN). Using the 3D vegetation-resolving model, three numerical
   experiments are conducted. In the first experiment, comparisons are made
   between the 2D Manning coefficient approach and the 3D
   vegetation-resolving approach for simple wind-driven flow. In a second
   experiment, 2D and 3D representations of vegetation produce similar
   inundations from the same hurricane forcing, but differences in momentum
   are found. In a final experiment, varying inundation between seemingly
   analogous 2D and 3D representations of vegetation are demonstrated,
   pointing to a significant scientific need for data within wetlands
   during storm surge events. This study shows that the complex flow
   structures within vegetation canopies can be accurately simulated using
   a vegetation-resolving 3D storm surge model, which can be used to assess
   the feasibility for future wetland restoration projects.}},

Abstract = {{As an imperative channel for fast information propagation, online social
   networks (OSNs) also have their defects. One of them is the information
   leakage, i.e., information could be spread via OSNs to the users whom we
   are not willing to share with. Thus the problem of constructing a circle
   of trust to share information with as many friends as possible without
   further spreading it to unwanted targets has become a challenging
   research topic but still remained open. Our work is the first attempt to
   study the Maximum Circle of Trust problem seeking to share the
   information with the maximum expected number of poster's friends such
   that the information spread to the unwanted targets is brought to its
   knees. First, we consider a special and more practical case with the
   two-hop information propagation and a single unwanted target. In this
   case, we show that this problem is NP-hard, which denies the existence
   of an exact polynomial-time algorithm. We thus propose a Fully
   Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS), which can not only adjust
   any allowable performance error bound but also run in polynomial time
   with both the input size and allowed error. FPTAS is the best
   approximation solution one can ever wish for an NP-hard problem. We next
   consider the number of unwanted targets is bounded and prove that there
   does not exist an FPTAS in this case. Instead, we design a
   Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) in which the allowable error
   can also be controlled. When the number of unwanted targets are not
   bounded, we provide a randomized algorithm, along with the analytical
   theoretical bound and inapproximaibility result. Finally, we consider a
   general case with many hops information propagation and further show its
   \#P-hardness and propose an effective Iterative Circle of Trust
   Detection (ICTD) algorithm based on a novel greedy function. An
   extensive experiment on various real-world OSNs has validated the
   effectiveness of our proposed approximation and ICTD algorithms. Such an
   extensive experiment also highlights several important observations on
   information leakage which help to sharpen the security of OSNs in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{A support vector machine (SVM) stable to data outliers is proposed in
   three closely related formulations, and relationships between those
   formulations are established. The SVM is based on the value-at-risk
   (VaR) measure, which discards a specified percentage of data viewed as
   outliers (extreme samples), and is referred to as -SVM. Computational

   showed that films exhibited mass densities similar to bulk values. X-ray
   diffraction investigations found that films were nanocristalline,
   exhibited a (1 1 1) texture and high micro-strain values. Auger electron
   spectroscopy investigations indicated that films contained in bulk a
   relatively low oxygen concentration, usually below 2.0\%. Atomic force
   microscopy found that ZrN films deposited under 2 X 10(-2) Pa of N-2
   exhibited a very smooth surface, with an rms value of only 3 angstrom,

Abstract = {{Elements in a conforming mesh are often distorted to fit the geometry
   which can cause numerical errors. If a background mesh is used for

   this approach is extended to traditional Reissner-Mindlin plate elements

Abstract = {{Problems in the subject of frictional heating have been studied
   extensively, yet their complexity remains a barrier to further
   understanding. This study simplifies the frictional heating problem by
   examining the temperature rise due to a heat source of prescribed
   geometry. A single positive feature on the sliding face of the
   countersurface causes a local temperature rise. The cylindrical feature
   has a diameter of 150 A mu m and aspect ratio of 0.1 and slides under
   the larger contact area whose contact width is similar to 600 to not
   approximate to 750 A mu m. An infrared camera, acquiring at 870 Hz,
   observed the temperature rise at the contact interface between the
   feature and the rubber pin. The applied force for all tests was 200 mN,
   and the sliding velocity was varied from 10 to 200 mm/s. Maximum
   temperature rises of similar to 1-17 A degrees C and average temperature
   rises of similar to 1-8 A degrees C were measured. Measured values were
   compared to the Jaeger's frictional heating models for sliding contacts.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{79-94}},

Abstract = {{The problem of permeable reactive barrier (PRB) capture and release
   behavior is investigated by means of an approximate analytical approach
   exploring the invariance of steady-state solutions of the
   advection-dispersion equation to conformal mapping. PRB configurations
   considered are doubly-symmetric funnel-and-gate as well as less frequent
   drain-and-gate systems. The effect of aquifer heterogeneity on
   contaminant plume spreading is hereby incorporated through an effective
   transverse macro-dispersion coefficient, which has to be known. Results
   are normalized and graphically represented in terms of a relative
   capture efficiency M of contaminant mass or groundwater passing a
   control plane (transect) at a sufficient distance up-stream of a PRB as
   to comply with underlying assumptions. Factors of safety FS are given as
   the ratios of required capture width under advective-dispersive and
   purely advective transport for achieving equal capture efficiency M. It
   is found that M also applies to the release behavior down-stream of a
   PRB, i.e., it describes the spreading and dilution of PRB treated
   groundwater possibly containing incompletely remediated contamination
   and/or remediation reaction products. Hypothetical examples are given to
   demonstrate results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A major barrier to widespread implementation of urine source-separation
   is the uncontrolled precipitation of magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca)
   minerals in waterless urinal plumbing, which results in clogging that
   increases maintenance requirements. The goal of this research was to
   investigate the use of ion-exchange softening of undiluted, fresh human
   urine to control precipitation reactions in hydrolyzed urine. The
   working hypothesis was that selective removal of Ca and Mg from
   undiluted, fresh urine by cation exchange resin would decrease the
   precipitation of Ca and Mg minerals in hydrolyzed urine. Ion-exchange
   experiments and precipitation experiments were used to investigate
   ion-exchange reactions in synthetic urine. Cation exchange resin
   (Amberlite A200C) removed both Ca and Mg from undiluted, fresh urine
   with a greater affinity for Ca over Mg. Precipitation experiments showed
   that struvite, MgNH(4)PO(4)6H(2)O, and hydroxyapatite, Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH),
   were the dominant minerals in untreated and ion-exchange treated
   hydrolyzed urine. Overall, ion-exchange softening decreased the mass of
   solids that would be deposited in the urinal plumbing and increased the
   phosphate available for nutrient recovery. (c) 2013 American Institute

Abstract = {{Hidden patterns, rendered visible by hindsight, often stand revealed as
   strong influences. Rama Chellappa's lab in the mid to late `80s molded
   our character and scholarship in more ways than one. Rama ably handled
   the transition from image processing to computer vision and established
   an applied math and computing infrastructure from which we continue to
   benefit. In particular, the themes important to King-Sun Fu-syntax,
   semantics and statistics-were all debated in Rama's lab at that time. We
   argue that this triad remains important. With syntactic representations
   losing mindshare to statistics, we remain in the hunt for unification.
   And with the syntax versus semantics debate unresolved, it deserves a
   hearing as well. We offer two themes-uncertainty and interaction-to aid
   in the process of unification. First, we show that complex wave
   functions carry probabilistic location information in their magnitude
   and syntactic (curve) information in their phase while representing
   uncertainty at a fundamental level. Next, after reviewing work in
   analytic philosophy, we connect semantics to intentional, mental
   content. Analytic philosophy reminds us to take human experience
   seriously but remaining physicalist if possible. To this end, we
   introduce a nondualist interactionist model of experience, wherein
   compositional (physical) subjects are constantly shaping and being
   shaped by a physical world. We then demonstrate that wave functions can
   accommodate interaction, closely tracking previous work in physics on
   the measurement problem. The linearity and superposition properties of
   wave functions allow for literal addition of waves created by human
   interaction with shapes. Finally, we briefly survey the current
   situation in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field and argue that
   mathematical models of interaction akin to those in pattern recognition
   can aid HCI. We close by arguing that we can follow in Fu's footsteps
   and incorporate the mathematical modeling of human interaction into
   pattern recognition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new model for nonlinear spectral mixing observed in
   hyperspectral imagery and demonstrate how this model can be used for
   unmixing and obtaining abundance maps. The model is based on the idea
   that a single pixel can contain several spatially segregated areas
   containing different mineral mixtures and fuses Hapke's radiative
   transfer model for intimate mineral mixtures with the traditional linear
   mixing model. The resulting model allows great flexibility for
   generating spectra, provides abundance coefficients in terms of total
   relative ground cover for each endmember, and can be reduced to several
   other nonlinear mixing models by an appropriate choice of the
   parameters. Experiments on laboratory mineral mixtures and real
   hyperspectral imagery show reduced reconstruction errors and more
   accurate abundance coefficients compared with the linear mixing model or
   the recently introduced multimixture pixel model. Moreover, the
   reconstruction error improvement can be used as a per-pixel measure of
   the size of the intimate mixing component.}},

Title = {{Novel Strategy Involving Surfactant-Polymer Combinations for Enhanced
   Stability of Aqueous Teflon Dispersions}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{7077-7084}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Among various polymers, the Teflon surface possesses extreme
   hydrophobicity (low surface energy), which is of great interest to both
   industry and academia. In this report, we discuss the stability of
   aqueous Teflon dispersions (particle size range of 100-3000 nm)
   formulated by a novel strategy that involves distinct combinations of
   surfactant and polymer mixtures for dispersion stabilization. As a first
   step, the hydrophobic Teflon particles were wetted using a range of
   surfactants (ionic, Triton, Brij, Tween, and Pluronic series) bearing
   different hydrophobic-lipophilic balance (HLB) and further characterized
   by contact angle and liquid penetration in packed powder measurements.
   The interaction between hydrophobic chains of surfactants and the Teflon
   particle surface is the driving force resulting in wetting of the Teflon
   particle surface. Further, these wetted particles in aqueous solutions
   were mixed with various polymers, for example, poly(vinyl alcohol)
   (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), and
   hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). The rate of sedimentation for the
   final dispersions was measured using a pan suspended into the dispersion
   from a transducer recording the increase in weight with time. A
   significant stability was noticed for Teflon particles suspended in
   surfactant + polymer mixtures, which was linearly proportional to the
   concentration of added polymer. The observed phenomenon can be possibly
   explained by molecular interactions between the hydrophobic chains of
   surfactant molecules and polar groups in the polymer architecture.
   Brij-O10 + HEC mixture was found to be the best surfactant - polymer
   combination for decreasing the sedimentation of the Teflon particles in
   the final dispersion. As measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), the
   hydrodynamic volume of the Teflon particles increases up to similar to
   55\% in the final formulation. These dispersions could be further
   explored for various technological applications such as paints, inks,
   protective coatings, and so forth.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a variant of the multidimensional assignment problem (MAP)

   of multi-sensor multi-target tracking problems, where a set of
   measurements, obtained from a collection of sensors, must be associated
   to a set of different targets. To solve this problem we study two
   different formulations. First, we introduce a continuous nonlinear
   program and its linearization, along with additional valid inequalities
   that improve the lower bounds. Second, we state the standard MAP
   formulation as a set partitioning problem, and solve it via branch and
   price. These approaches were put to test by solving instances ranging
   from tripartite to 20-partite graphs of 4 to 30 nodes per partition.
   Computational results show that our approaches are a viable option to
   solve this problem. A comparative study is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Polarization reversal in polycrystalline ferroelectrics is shown to
   occur via two distinct and sequential domain reorientation steps. This
   reorientation sequence, which cannot be readily discriminated in the
   overall sample polarization, is made apparent using time-resolved
   high-energy x-ray diffraction. Upon application of electric fields
   opposite to the initial poling direction, two unique and significantly
   different time constants are observed. The first (faster time constant)
   is shown to be derived by the release of a residual stress due to
   initial electrical biasing and the second (slower time constant) due to
   the redevelopment of residual stress during further domain wall motion.
   A modified domain reorientation model is given that accurately describes
   the domain volume fraction evolution during the reversal process. (C)

Abstract = {{Deep hole traps were studied in bulk free-standing GaN crystals and in
   thinner (10-20 mu m) GaN films prepared by hydride vapor phase epitaxy
   (HVPE) on sapphire. Six hole traps in different combinations were
   detected in these crystals, H1 (activation energy 0.92-0.94 eV), H2
   (0.55 eV), H3 (0.65-0.7 eV), H4 (0.85-0.9 eV), H5 (1.1-1.2 eV), and H6
   (0.95-1.05 eV). The dominant traps in all samples were the H5 and H6
   traps that were attributed, respectively, to gallium vacancy complexes
   with oxygen (V-Ga-O) and substitutional carbon related centers. We
   associate the H5 hole traps with the red luminescence bands, the H4 hole
   traps with the green luminescence bands, and the H6 hole traps with the
   yellow luminescence bands often observed in HVPE GaN. These attributions
   are based on the low energy thresholds of the deep traps optical
   excitation spectra and the depth of the respective trap levels. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The rotational motion of soft magnetic tri-axial ellipsoidal particles
   suspended in a Newtonian fluid has been studied using rotational
   Brownian dynamics simulations by solving numerically the stochastic
   angular momentum equation in an orientational space described by the
   quaternion parameters. The model is applicable to particles where the
   effect of shape anisotropy is dominant. The algorithm quantifies the
   magnetization of a monodisperse suspension of tri-axial ellipsoids in
   dilute limit conditions under applied constant and time-varying magnetic
   fields. The variation of the relative permeability with the applied
   magnetic field of the particle's bulk material was included in the
   simulations. The results show that the equilibrium magnetization of a
   suspension of magnetizable tri-axial ellipsoids saturates at high
   magnetic field amplitudes. Additionally, the dynamic susceptibility at
   low magnetic field intensity presents a peak in the out-of-phase
   component, which is significantly smaller than the in-phase component
   and depends on the Langevin parameter. The dynamic magnetization of the
   particle suspension is in phase with the magnetic field at low and high

Abstract = {{For decades, a link between increased levels of iron and areas of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has been recognized, including AD
   lesions comprised of the peptide beta-amyloid (A beta). Despite many
   observations of this association, the relationship between Ab and iron
   is poorly understood. Using X-ray microspectroscopy, X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy, electron microscopy and spectrophotometric iron(II)
   quantification techniques, we examine the interaction between A
   beta(1-42) and synthetic iron(III), reminiscent of ferric iron stores in
   the brain. We report Ab to be capable of accumulating iron(III) within
   amyloid aggregates, with this process resulting in A beta-mediated
   reduction of iron(III) to a redox-active iron(II) phase. Additionally,
   we show that the presence of aluminium increases the reductive capacity
   of A beta, enabling the redox cycling of the iron. These results
   demonstrate the ability of A beta to accumulate iron, offering an
   explanation for previously observed local increases in iron
   concentration associated with AD lesions. Furthermore, the ability of
   iron to form redox-active iron phases from ferric precursors provides an
   origin both for the redox-active iron previously witnessed in AD tissue,
   and the increased levels of oxidative stress characteristic of AD. These
   interactions between Ab and iron deliver valuable insights into the
   process of AD progression, which may ultimately provide targets for
   disease therapies.}},

   Adult Male Rats}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked to the effects of
   anti-depressant drugs on behavior in rodent models of depression. To
   explore this link further, we tested whether the
   serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine impacted
   adult hippocampal neurogenesis differently than its primary active SNRI
   metabolite desvenlafaxine. Adult male Long Evans rats (n = 5-6 per
   group) were fed vehicle, venlafaxine (0.5 or 5 mg) or desvenlafaxine
   (0.5 or 5 mg) twice daily for 16 days. Beginning the third day of drug
   treatment, the rats were given a daily bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 50
   mg/kg) injection for 5 days to label dividing cells and then perfused 2
   weeks after the first BrdU injection to confirm total new hippocampal
   cell numbers and their phenotypes. The high desvenlafaxine dose
   increased total new BrdU(+) cell number and appeared to accelerate
   neuronal maturation because fewer BrdU(+) cells expressed maturing
   neuronal phenotypes and more expressed mature neuronal phenotypes in the
   dentate gyri of these versus vehicle-treated rats. While net
   neurogenesis was not increased in the dentate gyri of rats treated with
   the high desvenlafaxine dose, significantly more mature neurons were
   detected. Our data expand the body of literature showing that
   antidepressants impact adult neurogenesis by stimulating NPC
   proliferation and perhaps the survival of neuronal progeny and by
   showing that a high dose of the SNRI antidepressant desvenlafaxine, but
   neither a high nor low venlafaxine dose, may also accelerate neuronal
   maturation in the adult rat hippocampus. These data support the
   hypothesis that hippocampal neurogenesis may indeed serve as a biomarker
   of depression and the effects of antidepressant treatment, and may be

Abstract = {{We report experimental investigations of externally applied mechanical
   stress on 70 nm Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3 ferroelectric capacitors embedded within a
   130 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing process. An
   average increase in the remnant polarization of 3.37\% per 100 MPa
   compressive uniaxial stress was observed. The maximum polarization
   increased by 2.68\% per 100 MPa, while the cycling endurance was not
   affected by stress. The significant difference between experiment and
   the lattice distortion model suggests that two mechanisms are
   responsible for the polarization change. These results indicate that
   stress engineering may be used to enhance the signal margin in
   ferroelectric random access memory and enable technology scaling. (C)

Abstract = {{In hyperspectral unmixing, the prevalent model used is the linear mixing
   model, and a large variety of techniques based on this model has been
   proposed to obtain endmembers and their abundances in hyperspectral
   imagery. However, it has been known for some time that nonlinear
   spectral mixing effects can be a crucial component in many real-world
   scenarios, such as planetary remote sensing, intimate mineral mixtures,
   vegetation canopies, or urban scenes. While several nonlinear mixing
   models have been proposed decades ago, only recently there has been a
   proliferation of nonlinear unmixing models and techniques in the signal
   processing literature. This paper aims to give an historical overview of
   the majority of nonlinear mixing models and nonlinear unmixing methods,
   and to explain some of the more popular techniques in detail. The main
   models and techniques treated are bilinear models, models for intimate
   mineral mixtures, radiosity-based approaches, ray tracing, neural
   networks, kernel methods, support vector machine techniques, manifold
   learning methods, piece-wise linear techniques, and detection methods
   for nonlinearity. Furthermore, we provide an overview of several recent
   developments in the nonlinear unmixing literature that do not belong
   into any of these categories.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the beta compositional model (BCM) for
   hyperspectral unmixing and four algorithms for unmixing given the BCM.
   Hyperspectral unmixing estimates the proportion of each endmember at
   every pixel of a hyperspectral image. Under the BCM, each endmember is a
   random variable distributed according to a beta distribution. By using a
   beta distribution, spectral variability is accounted for during
   unmixing, the reflectance values of each endmember are constrained to a
   physically realistic range, and skew can be accounted for in the
   distribution. Spectral variability is incorporated to increase
   hyperspectral unmixing accuracy. Two BCM-based spectral unmixing
   approaches are presented: BCM-spectral and BCM-spatial. For each
   approach, two algorithms, one based on quadratic programming (QP) and
   one using a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampler, are developed. Results
   indicate that the proposed BCM unmixing algorithms are able to
   successfully perform unmixing on simulated data and real hyperspectral
   imagery while incorporating endmember spectral variability and spatial
   information.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Waste hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy represent two important
   parameters controlling fluid movement in landfills, and thus are the key
   inputs in design methods where predictions of moisture movement are
   necessary. Although municipal waste hydraulic conductivity has been
   estimated in multiple laboratory and field studies, measurements of
   anisotropy, particularly at full scale, are rare, even though landfilled
   municipal waste is generally understood to be anisotropic. Measurements
   from a buried liquids injection well surrounded by pressure transducers
   at a full-scale landfill in Florida were collected and examined to
   provide an estimate of in-situ waste anisotropy. Liquids injection was
   performed at a constant pressure and the resulting pore pressures in the
   surrounding waste were monitored. Numerical fluid flow modeling was
   employed to simulate the pore pressures expected to occur under the
   conditions operated. Nine different simulations were performed at three
   different lateral hydraulic conductivity values and three different
   anisotropy values. Measured flowrate and pore pressures collected from
   conditions of approximate steady state were compared with the simulation
   results to assess the range of anisotropies. The results support that
   compacted municipal waste in landfills is anisotropic, provide
   anisotropy estimates greater than previous measurements, and suggest
   that anisotropy decreases with landfill depth.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an algorithm for the maximum clique problem that is
   parameterized by the graph's degeneracy d. The algorithm runs in O (nm +
   nT(d)) time, where Td is the time to solve themaximum clique problem in
   an arbitrary graph on d vertices. The best bound as of now is Td =
   O(2(d/4)) by Robson. This shows that the maximum clique problem is
   solvable in O(nm) time in graphs for which d <= 4 log(2) m + O(1). The
   analysis of the algorithm's runtime is simple; the algorithm is easy to
   implement when given a subroutine for solving maximum clique in small
   graphs; it is easy to parallelize. In the case of Bianconi-Marsili
   power-law random graphs, it runs in 2(O)(root n) time with high
   probability. We extend the approach for a graph invariant based on
   common neighbors, generating a second algorithm that has a smaller
   exponent at the cost of a larger polynomial factor.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the dynamics of woody tree species distribution in savanna
   systems remains a challenge despite considerable attention the topic has
   received in recent years. Disturbances such as fire and elephant effects
   on woody vegetation are well documented, yet the influence of these
   factors on emerging landscape-scale patterns such as height and species
   distributions continue to be poorly understood. The aim of this study
   was to identify how a suite of environmental variables (rainfall,
   temperature, aspect, slope, geology, fire frequency and elephant
   density) and their relative contributions, may affect woody species
   distribution in relation to structural height classes. Using the Maximum
   Entropy model for three structural height classes of the fifteen most
   frequently occurring woody species in the Kruger National Park (South
   Africa), the environmental variables best explaining each species
   distribution were identified. The three structural classes were defined
   to capture canopy height categories of specific management interest,
   namely Shrub (0.75-2.5 m), Brush (2.5-5.5 m) and Tree (over 5.5 m). The
   weighted contributions of environmental variables for each species and
   its associated size class were further analyzed for similarities using a
   resemblance matrix based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index coupled
   with a hierarchical clustering test. Our main findings suggest that the
   patterns and processes driving woody composition and structure are
   largely decoupled and that the distribution of different structural
   classes of a particular species may not be driven by the same
   environmental variables. Future studies should take cognizance of this
   as ignoring one or the other may lead to confounding results.}},

Abstract = {{W e address a variant of the Euclidean traveling salesman problem known
   as the close-enough traveling salesman problem (CETSP), where the
   traveler visits a node if it enters a compact neighborhood set of that
   node. We formulate a mixed-integer programming model based on a
   discretization scheme for the problem. Both lower and upper bounds on
   the optimal CETSP tour length can be derived from the solution of this
   model, and the quality of the bounds obtained depends on the granularity
   of the discretization scheme. Our approach first develops valid
   inequalities that enhance the bound and solvability of this formulation.
   We then provide two alternative formulations, one that yields an
   improved lower bound on the optimal CETSP tour length, and one that
   greatly improves the solvability of the original formulation by
   recasting it as a two-stage problem amenable to decomposition.
   Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{SAT-based Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is promising for automated

   SAT-based BMC is unsuitable to handle complex properties with large SAT

   automatically scale down the SAT falsification complexity by utilizing
   the decision ordering based learning from decomposed sub-properties. Our
   framework makes three important contributions: i) it proposes

Title = {{Molecular Imaging of the Breast Using a Variable-Angle Slant-Hole

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this work is to develop an improved method for
   3D molecular imaging of the breast using limited angle SPECT. Methods:
   The proposed method uses a variable-angle slant-hole (VASH) collimator.
   Rather than rotate the camera around the breast, the VASH collimator
   allows limited angle, tomographic acquisition while the detector remains
   stationary and flush against the compression paddle. This design
   minimizes object-to-detector distance for high spatial resolution.
   Theoretical analysis is presented of VASH spatial resolution and
   sensitivity, including depth-of-interaction (DOI) effects and
   magnification. The theory is compared with Monte Carlo simulation
   results for a point source and breast phantom including a compression
   paddle. An iterative reconstruction method for the slant hole data is
   used. Results: The theoretical model of the VASH system showed good
   agreement with Monte Carlo simulations based on spatial resolution,
   including DOI effects, and sensitivity. For 140 keV photons and a
   NaI(Tl) scintillator, the DOI effect resulted in roughly a 2 mm loss in
   spatial resolution only in depth dimension; in the other two dimensions
   the spatial resolution was not affected by DOI. In reconstructed breast
   phantom images, VASH out-performed a parallel hole SPECT approach in
   terms of contrast-to-noise ratio. Conclusions: The proposed method for
   breast imaging using limited angle SPECT and a VASH collimator
   demonstrated the potential for superior spatial resolution/sensitivity.
   In addition to high spatial resolution/sensitivity, the system design
   has advantages of simple detector motion, ability to image close to the
   chest wall and conducive to on-board biopsy and multi-modal imaging with
   mammography.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advancements in the silicon industry, as predicted by
   Moore's law, have enabled integration of billions of transistors on a
   single chip. To exploit this high transistor density for high
   performance, embedded systems are undergoing a transition from
   single-core to multi-core. Although a majority of embedded wireless
   sensor networks (EWSNs) consist of single-core embedded sensor nodes,
   multi-core embedded sensor nodes are envisioned to burgeon in selected
   application domains that require complex in-network processing of the
   sensed data. In this paper, we propose an architecture for heterogeneous
   hierarchical multi-core embedded wireless sensor networks (MCEWSNs) as
   well as an architecture for multi-core embedded sensor nodes used in
   MCEWSNs. We elaborate several compute-intensive tasks performed by
   sensor networks and application domains that would especially benefit
   from multi-core embedded sensor nodes. This paper also investigates the
   feasibility of two multi-core architectural paradigms-symmetric
   multiprocessors (SMPs) and tiled many-core architectures (TMAs)-for
   MCEWSNs. We compare and analyze the performance of an SMP (an
   Intel-based SMP) and a TMA (Tilera's TILEPro64) based on a parallelized
   information fusion application for various performance metrics (e.g.,
   runtime, speedup, efficiency, cost, and performance per watt). Results
   reveal that TMAs exploit data locality effectively and are more suitable
   for MCEWSN applications that require integer manipulation of sensor
   data, such as information fusion, and have little or no communication
   between the parallelized tasks. To demonstrate the practical relevance
   of MCEWSNs, this paper also discusses several state-of-the-art
   multi-core embedded sensor node prototypes developed in academia and
   industry. We further discuss research challenges and future research
   directions for MCEWSNs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient job-dispatching
   algorithm for transcoding as a service (TaaS) in a multimedia cloud. We
   aim to minimize the energy consumption of service engines in the cloud
   while achieving low delay for TaaS. We formulate the job-dispatching
   problem as a constrained optimization problem under the framework of
   Lyapunov optimization. Using the drift-plus-penalty function, we propose
   an online algorithm that dispatches the transcoding jobs to service
   engines, with an objective to Reduce Energy consumption while achieving
   the QUEue STability (REQUEST). We first characterize the fundamental
   tradeoff between energy consumption and queue delay for the REQUEST
   algorithm numerically and obtain its performance bound theoretically.
   Second, we study the robustness of the REQUEST algorithm, with numerical
   results indicating that the REQUEST algorithm is robust to the
   inaccuracy of estimating the transcoding time. Third, we compare the
   performance of the REQUEST algorithm with the other two algorithms,
   i.e., the Round Robin and Random Rate algorithms. By simulation and real
   trace data, we show that by appropriately choosing the control variable,
   the REQUEST algorithm outperforms the Round Robin and Random Rate
   algorithms, with smaller time average energy consumption and time
   average queue length. The proposed REQUEST algorithm can be applied in
   cloud-assisted multimedia transcoding service.}},

Abstract = {{This paper's goal is to assess secondary neutron doses received by
   paediatric patients treated for intracranial tumours using a 178 MeV
   proton beam. The MCNPX Monte Carlo model of the proton therapy facility,
   previously validated through experimental measurements for both proton
   and neutron dosimetry, was used. First, absorbed dose was calculated for
   organs located outside the clinical target volume using a series of
   hybrid computational phantoms for different ages and considering a
   realistic treatment plan. In general, secondary neutron dose was found
   to decrease as the distance to the treatment field increases and as the
   patient age increases. In addition, secondary neutron doses were studied
   as a function of the beam incidence. Next, neutron equivalent dose was
   assessed using organ-specific energy-dependent radiation weighting
   factors determined from Monte Carlo simulations of neutron spectra at
   each organ. The equivalent dose was found to reach a maximum value of
   similar to 155 mSv at the level of the breasts for a delivery of 49
   proton Gy to an intracranial tumour of a one-year-old female patient.
   Finally, a thorough comparison of the calculation results with published
   data demonstrated the dependence of neutron dose on the treatment
   configuration and proved the need for facility-specific and
   treatment-dependent neutron dose calculations.}},

Abstract = {{We recently published effective doses per time-integrated activity (mSv
   MBq(-1) s(-1)) for paediatric and adult family members exposed to an
   adult patient released from hospital following I-131 therapy. In the
   present study, we intend to provide medical physicists with a
   methodology to estimate family member effective dose in daily clinical
   practice because the duration of post-radiation precautions for the
   patient-family member exposure scenario has not been explicitly
   delineated based on the effective dose. Four different exposure
   scenarios are considered in this study including (1) a patient and a
   family member standing face to face, (2) a patient and a family member
   lying side by side, (3) an adult female patient holding a newborn child
   to her chest and (4) a one-year-old child standing on the lap of an
   adult female patient following her I-131 therapy. The results of this
   study suggest that an adult female hyperthyroidism (HT) patient who was
   administered with 740 MBq should keep a distance of 100 cm from a
   15-year-old child for six days and the same distance from other adults
   for seven days. The HT female patient should avoid holding a newborn
   against her chest for at least 16 days following hospital discharge, and
   a female patient treated with 5550 MBq for differentiated thyroid cancer
   should not hold her newborn child for at least 15 days following
   hospital discharge. This study also gives dose coefficients allowing one
   to predict age-specific effective doses to family members given the
   measured dose rate (mSv h(-1)) of the patient. In conclusion, effective
   dose-based patient release criteria with a modified NRC two-component
   model provide a site medical physicist with less restrictive and
   age-specific radiation precaution guidance as they fully consider a
   patient's iodine biokinetics and photon attenuation within both the
   patient and the exposed family members.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular targeting agents on their own have been shown to be
   insufficient for complete treatment of solid tumors, emphasizing the
   importance of studying the vascular effects of these drugs for their use
   with conventional therapies in the clinic. First-pass fluorescence
   imaging combined with hyperspectral imaging of hemoglobin saturation of
   microvessels in the murine dorsal window chamber model provides an
   easily implementable, low cost method to analyze tumor vascular response
   to these agents in real-time. In this study, the authors utilized these
   methods to spectroscopically demonstrate distinct vessel structure,
   blood flow and oxygenation changes in human Caki-2 renal cell carcinoma
   following treatment with OXi4503 alone, Sunitinib alone and both drugs
   together. We showed that treatment with OXi4503 plus Sunitinib destroyed
   existing tumor microvessels, inhibited blood vessel recovery and
   impaired Caki-2 tumor growth significantly more than either treatment
   alone. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

   resulting in the repair of the nanocomposite. This was demonstrated by
   cutting the nanocomposite and subsequently joining two pieces together

   optical and transmission electron microscopy of the region where the two
   pieces were joined demonstrated the healing and disappearance of the
   interface between both pieces down to the nanoscale.}},

   combined with Chebyshev spectral differentiation to drastically reduce

   dimensionality increases. Following the enforcement of the normality
   condition via a penalty method, the discretized system is solved using
   alternating least squares algorithm. Numerical results for a variety of
   systems, including separable/non-separable systems, linear/nonlinear
   systems and systems with/without closed-form stationary solutions up to
   ten dimensional state-space are presented to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this report, we present a breast imaging technique combining
   high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) light induced photoacoustic
   tomography (PAT) with NIR dye-labeled amino-terminal fragments of
   urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) targeted magnetic iron
   oxide nanoparticles (NIR830-ATF-IONP) for breast cancer imaging using an
   orthotopic mouse mammary tumor model. We show that accumulation of the
   targeted nanoparticles in the tumor led to photoacoustic contrast
   enhancement due to the high absorption of iron oxide nanoparticles
   (IONP). NIR fluorescence images were used to validate specific delivery
   of NIR830-ATF-IONP to mouse mammary tumors. We found that systemic
   delivery of the targeted IONP produced 4- and 10-fold enhancement in
   photoacoustic signals in the tumor, compared to the tumor of the mice
   that received non-targeted IONP or control mice. The use of targeted
   nanoparticles allowed imaging of tumors located as deep as 3.1 cm
   beneath the normal tissues. Our study indicates the potential of the
   combination of photoacoustic tomography and receptor-targeted
   NIR830-ATF-IONP as a clinical tool that can provide improved specificity
   and sensitivity for breast cancer detection.

Abstract = {{Biomedical photoacoustic tomography (PAT), as a potential imaging
   modality, can visualize tissue structure and function with high spatial
   resolution and excellent optical contrast. It is widely recognized that
   the ability of quantitatively imaging optical absorption and scattering
   coefficients from photoacoustic measurements is essential before PAT can
   become a powerful imaging modality. Existing quantitative PAT (qPAT),
   while successful, has been focused on recovering absorption coefficient
   only by assuming scattering coefficient a constant. An effective method
   for photoacoustically recovering optical scattering coefficient is
   presently not available. Here we propose and experimentally validate
   such a method for quantitative scattering coefficient imaging using
   photoacoustic data from one-wavelength illumination. The reconstruction
   method developed combines conventional PAT with the photon diffusion
   equation in a novel way to realize the recovery of scattering
   coefficient. We demonstrate the method using various objects having
   scattering contrast only or both absorption and scattering contrasts
   embedded in turbid media. The listening-to-light-scattering method
   described will be able to provide high resolution scattering imaging for
   various biomedical applications ranging from breast to brain imaging.}},

   differences, which indicate that chemical disorder, and not atomic
   displacement on its own, is chiefly responsible for the dielectric
   relaxation in bismuth pyrochlores. A low-frequency (<10kHz) and
   relatively high-temperature (similar to 125K) dielectric relaxation was
   observed in Bi2Ti2O7. An Arrhenius function was used to model the
   relaxation behavior and yielded an activation energy of 0.162eV and an
   attempt jump frequency of similar to 1MHz. This response is consistent

Title = {{Effects of Li Doping on MgO-Supported Sm2O3 and TbOx Catalysts in the
   Oxidative Coupling of Methane}},
Journal = {{ACS CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rare earth oxides (REOs), particularly the sesquioxides, such as Sm2O3
   and La2O3, have been investigated as promising catalysts in the
   oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). Much less attention has been paid
   to the reducible REOs because they are expected to give oxidation
   products, such as CO and CO2 (COx), rather than the desirable ethane and
   ethylene (C2+). Because Li addition can improve the performance of Sm2O3
   in the OCM reaction and Li/MgO is commonly used as a reference OCM
   catalyst, the effects of lithium addition to a reducible oxide, TbOx,
   were investigated in detail in this study and compared with a Sm2O3
   catalyst, which is the best single component OCM catalyst. Because of
   the well-documented volatility of lithium under OCM conditions,
   particularly for the Li/MgO system, the stability of lithium-doped
   samaria and terbia catalysts was examined as a function of preparation
   methods in this study. As expected, terbia supported on nanoparticle
   magnesia (n-MgO) is not a very active or selective OCM catalyst, and
   most of the observed selectivity toward C2+ products is likely due to
   the n-MgO support. In contrast, Li-doped TbOx/n-MgO prepared using a
   coimpregnation method yields a highly active and selective catalyst. The
   Li-TbOx/n-MgO catalyst yields the same methane conversion as pure Sm2O3,
   and has a higher C2+ selectivity than the Li-Sm2O3/n-MgO catalyst. The
   stability of the Li-TbOx/n-MgO catalyst is also higher than that of the
   Li-Sm2O3/n-MgO catalyst, and the loss of activity for the lithium-doped
   terbia catalyst appears to be the same as for the undoped Sm2O3/n-MgO
   catalyst (and undoped TbOx/n-MgO). The characterization data indicate
   stronger interactions between Li and TbOx than between Li and Sm2O3,
   which may explain the higher stability of the Li-TbOx/n-MgO catalysts.
   There are also indications that Li enters the TbOx lattice and reduces
   TbO1.81, to Tb2O3 during reaction, which can explain the higher C2+
   selectivity compared with undoped TbOx/n-MgO. Furthermore, the
   Li-TbOx/n-MgO catalyst in this study is active at lower temperatures
   (600-700 degrees C) than typically used in the OCM (around 800 degrees
   C). Therefore, the Li-TbOx/n-MgO catalysts have potential to be very
   effective OCM catalysts, even though undoped TbOx/n-MgO catalysts are
   more selective toward COx than C2+ products.}},

Abstract = {{NOAA's second-generation retrospective forecast (reforecast) dataset was
   created using the currently operational Global Ensemble Forecast System
   (GEFS). It has the potential to accurately forecast daily reference
   evapotranspiration ETo and can be useful for water management. This
   study was conducted to evaluate daily ETo forecasts using the GEFS
   reforecasts in the southeastern United States (SEUS) and to incorporate
   the ETo forecasts into irrigation scheduling to explore the usefulness
   of the forecasts for water management. ETo was estimated using the
   Penman-Monteith equation, and ensemble forecasts were downscaled and
   bias corrected using a forecast analog approach. The overall forecast
   skill was evaluated using the linear error in probability space skill
   score, and the forecast in five categories (terciles and 10th and 90th
   percentiles) was evaluated using the Brier skill score, relative
   operating characteristic, and reliability diagrams. Irrigation
   scheduling was evaluated by water deficit WD forecasts, which were
   determined based on the agricultural reference index for drought (ARID)
   model driven by the GEFS-based ETo forecasts. All forecast skill was
   generally positive up to lead day 7 throughout the year, with higher
   skill in cooler months compared to warmer months. The GEFS reforecast
   improved ETo forecast skill for all lead days over the SEUS compared to
   the first-generation reforecast. The WD forecasts driven by the ETo
   forecasts showed higher accuracy and less uncertainty than the forecasts
   driven by climatology, indicating their usefulness for irrigation
   scheduling, hydrological forecasting, and water demand forecasting in
   the SEUS.}},

Abstract = {{Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is an important hydroclimatic
   variable for water planning and management. This research explored the
   potential of using the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), for
   seasonal predictions of ETo over the states of Alabama, Georgia, and
   Florida. The 12-km ETo forecasts were produced by downscaling
   coarse-scale ETo forecasts from the CFSv2 retrospective forecast archive
   and by downscaling CFSv2 maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature
   (Tmin), mean temperature (Tmean), solar radiation (Rs), and wind speed
   (Wind) individually and calculating ETo using those down-scaled
   variables. All the ETo forecasts were calculated using the
   Penman-Monteith equation. Sensitivity coefficients were evaluated to
   quantify how and how much does each of the variables influence ETo. Two
   statistical downscaling methods were tested: 1) spatial disaggregation
   (SD) and 2) spatial disaggregation with quantile mapping bias correction
   (SDBC). The downscaled ETo from the coarse-scale ETo showed similar
   skill to those by first downscaling individual variables and then
   calculating ETo. The sensitivity coefficients showed Tmax and Rs had the
   greatest influence on ETo, followed by Tmin and Tmean, and Wind. The
   downscaled Tmax showed highest predictability, followed by Tmean, Tmin,
   Rs, and Wind. SDBC had slightly better performance than SD for both
   probabilistic and deterministic forecasts. The skill was locally and
   seasonally dependent. The CFSv2-based ETo forecasts showed higher
   predictability in cold seasons than in warm seasons. The CFSv2 model
   could better predict ETo in cold seasons during El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) events only when the forecast initial condition was
   in either the El Nino or La Nina phase of ENSO.}},

Title = {{The Behavioral Intervention Technology Model: An Integrated Conceptual
   and Technological Framework for eHealth and mHealth Interventions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A growing number of investigators have commented on the lack of models
   to inform the design of behavioral intervention technologies (BITs).
   BITs, which include a subset of mHealth and eHealth interventions,
   employ a broad range of technologies, such as mobile phones, the Web,
   and sensors, to support users in changing behaviors and cognitions
   related to health, mental health, and wellness. We propose a model that
   conceptually defines BITs, from the clinical aim to the technological
   delivery framework. The BIT model defines both the conceptual and
   technological architecture of a BIT. Conceptually, a BIT model should
   answer the questions why, what, how (conceptual and technical), and
   when. While BITs generally have a larger treatment goal, such goals
   generally consist of smaller intervention aims (the ``why{''}) such as
   promotion or reduction of specific behaviors, and behavior change
   strategies (the conceptual ``how{''}), such as education, goal setting,
   and monitoring. Behavior change strategies are instantiated with
   specific intervention components or ``elements{''} (the ``what{''}). The
   characteristics of intervention elements may be further defined or
   modified (the technical ``how{''}) to meet the needs, capabilities, and
   preferences of a user. Finally, many BITs require specification of a
   workflow that defines when an intervention component will be delivered.
   The BIT model includes a technological framework (BIT-Tech) that can
   integrate and implement the intervention elements, characteristics, and
   workflow to deliver the entire BIT to users over time. This
   implementation may be either predefined or include adaptive systems that
   can tailor the intervention based on data from the user and the user's
   environment. The BIT model provides a step towards formalizing the
   translation of developer aims into intervention components, larger
   treatments, and methods of delivery in a manner that supports research
   and communication between investigators on how to design, develop, and
   deploy BITs.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has remained one of the fastest
   developing biomedical imaging modalities in the past decade. The
   confocal strategy of optical illumination and acoustic detection is a
   way to boost the sensitivity of PAM. To achieve confocal PAM, current
   PAM systems utilize separate acoustic and optical converging devices,
   making the systems bulky and complicated. In this Letter, we demonstrate
   the use of a single-liquid lens to successfully achieve acoustic and
   optical confocal configuration for optical-resolution PAM (ORPAM). Using
   the lens with a numerical aperture of 0.43, we show that the resolution
   of the ORPAM system is 4.8 mu m with a significantly improved
   sensitivity of acoustic detection. We also apply this compact ORPAM
   system to in vivo imaging of the vasculature of a rat ear. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Citrus greening (Huanglongbing, or HLB) is a devastating disease caused
   by Candidatus liberibacter which uses psyllids as vectors. It has no
   cure till now, and poses a huge threat to citrus industry around the
   world. In order to diagnose, assess and further control this disease, it
   is of great importance to first find a quick and effective way to detect
   it. Spectroscopy method, which was widely considered as a fast and
   nondestructive way, was adopted here to conduct a preliminary
   exploration of disease characteristics. In order to explore the spectral
   differences between the healthy and HLB infected leaves and canopies,
   this study measured the visible-NIR spectral reflectance of their leaves
   and canopies under lab and field conditions, respectively. The original
   spectral data were firstly preprocessed with smoothing(or moving
   average) and cluster average procedures, and then the first derivatives
   were also calculated to determine the red edge position(REP). In order
   to solve the multi-peak phenomenon problem, two interpolation
   methods(three-point Lagrangian interpolation and four-point linear
   extrapolation) were adopted to calculate the REP for each sample. The
   results showed that there were obvious differences at the visible \& NIR
   spectral reflectance between the healthy and HLB infected classes.
   Comparing with the healthy reflectance, the HLB reflectance was higher
   at the visible bands because of the yellowish symptoms on the infected
   leaves, and lower at NIR bands because the disease blocked water
   transportation to leaves. But the feature at NIR bands was easily
   affected by environmental factors such as light, background, etc. The
   REP was also a potential indicator to distinguish those two classes. The
   average REP was slowly moving toward red bands while the infection level
   was getting higher. The gap of the average REPs between the healthy and
   HLB classes reached to a maximum of 20 nm. Even in the dataset with
   relatively lower variation, the classification accuracy of threshold
   segmentation method by the REP could reach to more than 90\%. The
   four-point linear extrapolation method had slightly better result than
   the three-point Lagrangian interpolation method. This study provided
   useful theoretical foundation to detect HLB by spectral reflectance.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Light reflection visualization (LRV) experiments were performed to
   investigate solute diffusion in low-permeability porous media using a
   well-controlled two-dimensional flow chamber with a domain composed of
   two layers (one sand and one clay). Two different dye tracers (Brilliant
   Blue FCF and Ponceau 4R) and clay domains (kaolinite and
   montmorillonite) were used. The images obtained through the LRV
   technique were processed to monitor two-dimensional concentration
   distributions in the low-permeability zone by applying calibration
   curves that related light intensity to equilibrium concentrations for
   each dye tracer in the clay. One dimensional experimentally-measured LRV
   concentration profiles in the clay were found to be in very good
   agreement with those predicted from a one-dimensional analytical
   solution, with coefficient of efficiency values that exceeded 0.97. The
   retardation factors (R) for both dyes were relatively large, leading to
   slow diffusive penetration into the clays. At a relative concentration
   C/C-0=0.1, Brilliant Blue FCF in kaolinite (R=11) diffused approximately
   10 mm after 21 days of source loading, and Ponceau 4R in montmorillonite
   (R=7) diffused approximately 12 mm after 23 days of source loading. The
   LRV experimentally-measured two-dimensional concentration profiles in
   the clay were also well described by a simple analytical solution. The
   results from this study demonstrate that the LRV approach is an
   attractive non-invasive tool to investigate the concentration
   distribution of dye tracers in clays in laboratory experiments. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Current injury models suggest that Schwann cell (SC) migration and
   guidance are necessary for successful regeneration and synaptic
   reconnection after peripheral nerve injury. The ability of conducting
   polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) to exhibit chemical, contact and
   electrical stimuli for cells has led to much interest in their use for
   neural conduits. Despite this interest, there has been very little
   research on the effect that electrical stimulation (ES) using PPy has on
   SC behavior. Here we investigate the mechanism by which SCs interact
   with PPy in the presence of an electric field. Additionally, we explored
   the effect that the adsorption of different serum proteins on PPy upon
   the application of an electric field has on SC migration. The results
   indicate an increase in average displacement of the SC with ES,
   resulting in a net anodic migration. Moreover, indirect effects of
   protein adsorption due to the oxidation of the film upon the application
   of ES were shown to have a larger effect on migration speed than on
   migration directionality. These results suggest that SC migration speed
   is governed by an integrin- or receptor-mediated mechanism, whereas SC
   migration directionality is governed by electrically mediated phenomena.
   These data will prove invaluable in optimizing conducting polymers for
   their different biomedical applications such as nerve repair. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The pressure grouting of drilled shaft tips has become popular worldwide
   due to its effectiveness in mobilizing a larger portion of the available
   tip resistance under service displacements. This paper presents
   experimental and numerical studies on the load transfer mechanism and
   factors controlling the axial response of base grouted drilled shafts in
   cohesionless soils. The study found that the increased axial capacity of
   grout-tipped drilled shafts under service loads and displacements
   depended mainly on preloading effects and the increased tip area
   provided by the grouting process. A simple prediction approach for
   estimating the tip capacity of grouted shafts utilizing cone penetration
   resistance was suggested based on the results of the study. The validity
   of the proposed approach was verified by the analysis of full-scale case
   studies of grouted shafts reported in the literature.}},

Title = {{Accuracy of Reference Evapotranspiration Estimation by Two Irrigation
   Controllers in a Humid Climate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Increasing municipal water demand has led to new innovations in
   water-saving technology. Evapotranspiration-based irrigation
   controllers, also known as weather-based irrigation controllers, are a
   technology that use evapotranspiration (ET) estimates to schedule
   irrigation. Although real-time on-site data collection could help
   improve data quality, limited data parameters collected or simplified
   reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimation methods from an on-site
   sensor could potentially have an impact on estimated ETo values for
   stand-alone controllers. Conversely, collection of data from off-site
   weather stations that are not representative of the local conditions
   could lead to inaccurate ETo estimations for local irrigation sites. The
   Weathermatic SL1600 and Toro Intelli-sense controllers were selected for
   testing because of the different methods of data collection and ETo
   estimation. This study was conducted in two locations: Wimauma and
   Gainesville, Florida. In Wimauma the Weathermatic controller
   significantly overestimated ETo compared to on-site ETo estimates using
   the ASCE-EWRI standardized method (ETo) by 9-15\% for the duration of
   the study, while ETo sent to the Toro controllers was similar to on-site
   ETo estimations (1-3\%) for the duration of the study. However, the
   Weathermatic controller overestimated ETo for every season (fall: 5-8\%;
   winter: 6-8\%; spring: 11-16\%; summer: 22-25\%), and the Toro
   controller overestimated ETo in the summer seasons (12\%) and
   underestimated ETo in the winter seasons (17\%). In Gainesville, the
   Weathermatic and Toro controllers both overestimated ETo compared to
   on-site ETos (30 and 10\%, respectively). However, when compared to ETos
   using data from the Gainesville National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) weather station, the ETo of the Toro controller
   was consistent with the equation and location of the weather data that
   were likely used by the weather service to calculate ETo, indicating
   that this was likely the data source for the ETo sent to the Toro
   controller. Overall, ETo sent to and used by the Toro Intelli-sense
   controllers was closer to on-site ETo estimations than that which was
   estimated by the Weathermatic SL1600 controllers on site.}},

Abstract = {{Freeform surfaces, including the femoral components of knee prosthetics,
   present a significant challenge in manufacturing. The finishing process
   is often performed manually, which leads to surface finish variations.
   In the case of knee prosthetics, this can be a factor leading to
   accelerated wear of the polyethylene tibial component. The wear
   resistance of polyethylene components might be influenced by not only
   the roughness but also the lay of femoral component surfaces. This study
   applies magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) for nanometer-scale finishing
   of cobalt chromium alloys, which are commonly used in knee prosthetics
   and other freeform components. Using flat disks as workpieces, this
   paper shows the dominant parameters for controlling the lay in MAF and
   demonstrates the feasibility of MAF to alter the lay while controlling
   the surface roughness. The manually finished disk surfaces (with
   roughness around 3 nm S-a), consisting of random cutting marks, were
   compared to MAF-produced surfaces (also with roughness around 3 nm S-a)
   with different lays. Tests using deionized water droplets show that the
   lay influences the wetting properties even if the surface roughness
   changes by no more than a nanometer. Surfaces with unidirectional
   cutting marks exhibit the least wettability, and increasing the
   cross-hatch angle in the MAF-produced surfaces increases the
   wettability. Surfaces consisting of short, intermittent cutting marks
   were the most wettable by deionized water.}},

Title = {{Improved Operational Performance Assessment for Two-Lane Highway
   Facilities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Historically, two-lane highways served primarily as uninterrupted flow
   connectors between major population centers. Increasingly, however,
   population growth in areas between the major population centers along
   these highways is reaching levels such that occasional signalized
   intersections are commonly present. Given increasing congestion along
   these routes, particularly as a result of increased signalization,
   transportation engineers need methods and tools to analyze highway
   performance. The current analysis methodology contained in the commonly
   used highway capacity manual (HCM) for two-lane highways is limited in
   scope to completely uninterrupted-flow facilities. Furthermore, the
   spacing of signalized intersections along a two-lane highway is
   typically great enough such that the urban streets analysis methodology
   of the HCM is not applicable. Until recently, a simulation tool did not
   exist that could model the combination of two-lane highway segments and
   signalized intersections. This capability is now incorporated in the
   corridor simulation (CORSIM) microscopic traffic simulation program.
   This study uses the updated version of CORSIM to develop an analytical
   methodology for two-lane highway facilities (i.e.,the combination of
   two-lane highway segments and signalized intersections). This study is a
   follow-up to a similar one conducted in 2009 at the University of
   Florida. However, a major distinction is that the previous study had to
   use a hybrid simulation approach {[}TWO-lane PASsing and CORridor
   SIMulation (TWOPAS and CORSIM)] whereas this study used the improved
   version of CORSIM that provides a unified and more accurate simulation
   approach. Although many similarities exist in the results for this study
   and the preceding one, several differences in model structures and
   coefficients were identified in this study. The service measure percent
   delay was retained for its efficacy in assessing operations on complex
   two-lane highway facilities (particularly those with signalized
   intersections), but this paper presents new percent delay-based
   level-of-service criteria thresholds. This paper also provides
   additional guidance for facility segmentation in situations in which a
   speed limit reduction is applied in the vicinity of a signalized
   intersection.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a version of the stochastic network interdiction problem
   modeled by Morton et al. (IIE Trans 39:3-14, 2007) in which an
   interdictor attempts to minimize a potential smuggler's chance of
   evasion via discrete deployment of sensors on arcs in a bipartite
   network. The smuggler reacts to sensor deployments by solving a
   maximum-reliability path problem on the resulting network. In this
   paper, we develop the (minimal) convex hull representation for the
   polytope linking the interdictor's decision variables with the
   smuggler's for the case in which the smuggler's origin and destination
   are known and interdictions are cardinality-constrained. In the process,
   we propose an exponential class of easily-separable inequalities that
   generalize all of those developed so far for the bipartite version of
   this problem. We show how these cuts may be employed in a cutting-plane
   fashion when solving the more difficult problem in which the smuggler's
   origin and destination are stochastic, and argue that some instances of
   the stochastic model have facets corresponding to the solution of
   NP-hard problems. Our computational results show that the cutting planes
   developed in this paper may strengthen the linear programming relaxation
   of the stochastic model by as much as 25 \%.}},

Abstract = {{We present an updated study of the planets known to orbit 55 Cancri A
   using 1 418 high-precision radial velocity observations from four
   observatories (Lick, Keck, Hobby-Eberly Telescope, Harlan J. Smith
   Telescope) and transit time/durations for the inner-most planet, 55
   Cancri `e' (Winn et al. 2011). We provide the first posterior sample for
   the masses and orbital parameters based on self-consistent N-body
   orbital solutions for the 55 Cancri planets, all of which are
   dynamically stable (for at least 10(8) yr). We apply a GPU version of
   Radial velocity Using N-body Differential evolution Markov Chain Monte
   Carlo (RUN DMC; Nelson, Ford \& Payne) to perform a Bayesian analysis of
   the radial velocity and transit observations. Each of the planets in
   this remarkable system has unique characteristics. Our investigation of
   high-cadence radial velocities and priors based on space-based
   photometry yields an updated mass estimate for planet `e' (8.09 +/- 0.26
   M-circle plus), which affects its density (5.51+/-(1.32)(1.00) g cm(-3))
   and inferred bulk composition. Dynamical stability dictates that the
   orbital plane of planet `e' must be aligned to within 60 degrees of the
   orbital plane of the outer planets (which we assume to be coplanar). The
   mutual interactions between the planets `b' and `c' may develop an
   apsidal lock about 180 degrees. We find 36-45 per cent of all our model
   systems librate about the anti-aligned configuration with an amplitude
   of 51 degrees +/-(6 degrees)(10 degrees). Other cases showed short-term
   perturbations in the libration of (omega) over bar (b) - (omega) over
   bar (c), circulation, and nodding, but we find the planets are not in a
   3: 1 mean-motion resonance. A revised orbital period and eccentricity
   for planet `d' pushes it further towards the closest known Jupiter
   analogue in the exoplanet population.}},

Abstract = {{In studies of the nervous system, the choice of metric for the neural
   responses is a pivotal assumption. For instance, a well-suited distance
   metric enables us to gauge the similarity of neural responses to various
   stimuli and assess the variability of responses to a repeated
   stimulusexploratory steps in understanding how the stimuli are encoded
   neurally. Here we introduce an approach where the metric is tuned for a
   particular neural decoding task. Neural spike train metrics have been
   used to quantify the information content carried by the timing of action
   potentials. While a number of metrics for individual neurons exist, a
   method to optimally combine single-neuron metrics into multineuron, or
   population-based, metrics is lacking. We pose the problem of optimizing
   multineuron metrics and other metrics using centered alignment, a
   kernel-based dependence measure. The approach is demonstrated on
   invasively recorded neural data consisting of both spike trains and
   local field potentials. The experimental paradigm consists of decoding
   the location of tactile stimulation on the forepaws of anesthetized
   rats. We show that the optimized metrics highlight the distinguishing
   dimensions of the neural response, significantly increase the decoding
   accuracy, and improve nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods for
   exploratory neural analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging advances over the past several decades have provided
   increased understanding of the structural and functional brain changes
   that occur with Parkinson's disease (PD). Examination of resting state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a noninvasive
   method that focuses on low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations in the
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal that occurs when an individual
   is at rest. Several analysis methods have been developed and used to
   explore how PD affects resting state activity and functional
   connectivity, and the purpose of this review is to highlight the
   critical advances made thus far. Some discrepancies in the rs-fMRI and
   PD literature exist, and we make recommendations for consideration in
   future studies. The rs-fMRI technique holds promise for investigating
   brain changes associated with the motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD, and
   for revealing important variations across large-scale networks of the
   brain in PD.}},

Abstract = {{Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has served as an important
   technological breakthrough in the field of the physiology of movement
   disorders over the last three decades. TMS has grown popular owing to
   the ease of application as well as its painless and noninvasive

   understanding the pathophysiology of movement disorders, particularly
   Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The basic applications have included
   the study of motor cortex excitability, functioning of excitatory and
   inhibitory circuits, study of interactions between sensory and motor
   systems, and the plasticity response of the brain. TMS has also made
   important contributions to understanding the response to treatments such
   as dopaminergic medications, botulinum toxin injections, and deep brain

   Explosion Flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear growth of instabilities of an outward propagating, but
   decelerating, cylindrical interface separated by fluids of different
   densities is investigated. Single mode perturbations are introduced
   around the contact-surface, and their evolution is studied by conducting
   inviscid 2D and 3D numerical simulations. In the past, a significant
   amount of work has been carried out to model the development of the
   perturbations in a planar context where the contact surface is
   stationary or in a spherical context where a pointsource blast wave is
   initiated at the origin. However, for the finite-source cylindrical
   blast-wave problem under consideration, there is a need for a framework
   which includes additional complexities such as compressibility,
   transition from linear to nonlinear stages of instability, finite
   thickness of the contact interface (CI), and time-dependent deceleration
   of the contact surface. Several theoretical potential flow models are
   presented. The model which is able to capture the above mentioned
   effects (causing deviation from the classical Rayleigh-Taylor
   Instability (RTI)) is identified as it compares reasonably well with the
   DNS results. Only for higher wavenumbers, the early development of
   secondary instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz) complicates the model
   prediction, especially in the estimation of the high-density fluid
   moving into low-density ambient.}},

Abstract = {{Bi-axial compressive stress induced as a result of mechanical
   confinement within a zirconium diboride-silicon carbide (ZrB2-SiC)
   ceramic composite has been quantified using micro Raman spectroscopy and
   then validated using two independent experimental methods. First a
   relationship relating the Raman peak-shift on a confined silicon carbide
   (SiC) particle to magnitude of imposed confinement stress was developed
   by utilizing phonon deformation potentials for 3C-SiC diamond and
   zinc-blende crystal structures. ZrB2-5wt\%SiC samples, prepared using
   spark plasma sintering were subjected to different confinement pressure
   on the lateral surface by thermal shrink fitting metallic sleeves. The
   relationship between Raman peak-shift and confinement stress was then
   verified by comparing the measured stress in this method with that
   calculated from analytical expressions readily available for thick
   walled cylinders. The relationship was further validated independently
   using digital image correlation (DIC) by measuring the displacements for
   unknown levels of progressively increasing confinement stress induced by
   a shaft-collar ring on similar specimens. The Raman peak-shift relation
   derived for SiC phase also correctly predicted process-induced residual
   stresses due to a mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion between
   the matrix phase and SiC particles. The derived Raman peak-shift
   relationship can also be generalized and can be a valuable tool to
   experimentally determine unknown bi-axial stress in a Raman active
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Y3+ substituted mullite Y(x)Al(6-x)Si2O13 nanoparticles where x varied

   X-ray diffraction results revealed that orthorhombic mullite was the

   alpha-Al2O3 was predominant at high Y3+-ion content of x = 0.05.
   Transmission electron microscope images showed orthorhombic-like

   similar morphologies of larger particle sizes associated with small
   amount of glassy liquid phase. FT-IR spectrum evinced the formation of
   corundum particularly at high Y3+ ion content (5 \%). The
   photoluminescence emission spectra were strongly affected by the Y3+ ion
   content. Moreover, mullite sample doped with 0.5 \% Y3+ ion achieved the
   minimum electrical resistivity of 0.28 x 10(9) a{''}broken vertical bar

Abstract = {{A two-parameter elastic foundation model is used to predict the coupled

   chewing surface morphology of the dentition in a hadrosaurid dinosaur
   using wear rates measured from fossilized dental tissues. Additionally,
   to further illustrate the predictive capabilities of the coupled contact
   pressure and wear model, a two-component polymer sample was fabricated
   and experimentally evaluated through laboratory wear experiments. Data
   obtained from the abrasive wear testing of a laboratory multicomponent
   polymer sample was compared to model predictions using measured system

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{177-207}},

Abstract = {{A key question in the design of engineered competitive systems has been
   that of the efficiency loss of the associated equilibria. Yet, there is
   little known in this regard in the context of stochastic dynamic games,
   particularly in a large population regime. In this paper, we revisit a
   class of noncooperative games, arising from the synchronization of a
   large collection of heterogeneous oscillators. In Yin et al.
   (Proceedings of 2010 American control conference, pp. 1783-1790, 2010),
   we derived a PDE model for analyzing the associated equilibria in large
   population regimes through a mean field approximation. Here, we examine
   the efficiency of the associated mean-field equilibria with respect to a
   related welfare optimization problem. We construct constrained
   variational problems both for the noncooperative game and its
   centralized counterpart and derive the associated nonlinear eigenvalue
   problems. A relationship between the solutions of these eigenvalue
   problems is observed and allows for deriving an expression for
   efficiency loss. By applying bifurcation analysis, a local bound on
   efficiency loss is derived under an assumption that oscillators share
   the same frequency. Through numerical case studies, the analytical
   statements are illustrated in the homogeneous frequency regime;
   analogous numerical results are provided for the heterogeneous frequency
   regime.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics and mechanisms of Pb sorption by biochars produced
   from sugarcane bagasse at 250, 400, 500, and 600 degrees C were
   examined. The Pb sorption isotherms, kinetics and desorption were
   investigated. All biochars were effective in Pb sorption and were well
   described by Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetic
   model. The maximum sorption capacity decreased from 21 to 6.1 mg g(-1)
   as temperature increased from 250 to 600 degrees C. The Pb sorption was
   rapid initially, probably controlled by cation exchange and complexation
   and then slowed down, which might be due to intraparticle diffusions.
   FTIR data and kinetic models suggested that oxygen functional groups
   were probably responsible for the high Pb sorption onto low temperature
   biochars (250 and 400 degrees C) whereas intraparticle diffusion was
   mainly responsible for low Pb sorption onto high temperature biochars
   (500 and 600 degrees C). Decreased phosphorus concentration indicated
   that P-induced Pb precipitation was also responsible for Pb sorption.
   Pyrolysis temperature significantly affected biochar properties and
   played an important role in Pb sorption capacity and mechanisms by
   biochars. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluating UV/H2O2, UV/percarbonate, and UV/perborate for natural
   organic matter reduction from alternative water sources}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) continues to increase in drinking water
   sources due to many factors, including changes in land use and global
   climate. Water treatment facilities will need to evaluate the best
   treatment options to account for these higher NOM levels. The UV/H2O2
   advanced oxidation process (AOP) is one treatment option that has shown
   success at reducing high levels of NOM. As a result, this study
   evaluated the UV/H2O2 for the reduction of NOM in a high NOM water
   matrix, the Florida Everglades. In addition to liquid H2O2, sodium
   percarbonate and sodium perborate were used as oxidants to evaluate
   their performance as alternatives to liquid H2O2. Results showed that
   all three oxidants were able to reduce aromatic carbon (UV254) by
   46-66\% and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 11-19\% at UV fluences of
   2.6-2.7 J cm(-2) and an H2O2 dose of 100 mg L-1. When the UV fluences
   were increased to 21.8-26.1 J cm(-2) at an H2O2 dose of 100 mg L-1,
   UV254 reduction increased to 79-97\% and DOC to 42-82\% for all three
   oxidants. All three oxidants performed statistically similar for UV254
   reduction. However, for DOC reduction, H2O2 performed statically better
   than both percarbonate and perborate, and perborate performed
   statistically better than percarbonate. While the UV/H2O2 AOP is
   effective for NOM reduction in high NOM waters, advances in electrical
   efficiency are needed to make it economically feasible. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A generic agricultural drought index, called Agricultural Reference
   Index for Drought (ARID), was designed recently to quantify water stress
   for use in predicting crop yield loss from drought. This study evaluated
   ARID in terms of its ability to predict crop yields. Daily historical
   weather data and yields of cotton, maize, peanut and soybean were
   obtained for several locations and years in the south-eastern USA. Daily
   values of ARID were computed for each location and converted to monthly
   average values. Using regression analyses of crop yields vs. monthly
   ARID values during the crop growing season, ARID-yield relationships
   were developed for each crop. The ability of ARID to predict yield loss
   from drought was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), the
   Willmott index and the modelling efficiency (ME). The ARID-based yield
   models predicted relative yields with the RMSE values of 0.144, 0.087,
   0.089 and 0.142 (kgha(-1)yield per kgha(-1) potential yield); the
   Willmott index values of 0.70, 0.92, 0.86 and 0.79; and the ME values of
   0.33, 0.73, 0.60 and 0.49 for cotton, maize, peanut and soybean,
   respectively. These values indicated that the ARID-based yield models
   can predict the yield loss from drought for these crops with reasonable
   accuracy.}},

   strain rate and temperature dependence with constant strain rate
   sensitivity at each temperature in the testing regime. Microstructural

Abstract = {{The adhesion force between ceria and polyurethane (PU) pad was
   controlled to remove the step height from cell region to peripheral
   region during Shallow Trench Isolation Chemical Mechanical Planarization
   (STI-CMP) for NAND flash. Picolinic acid was found to be adsorbed on
   ceria particles at pH 4.5 following a Langmuir isotherm with the maximum
   adsorbed amount of 0.36 mg/m(2). The ceria suspension with full surface
   coverage of picolinic acid showed a threefold increase in the number of
   adhered ceria particles on the PU pad over non-coated ceria particles.
   It was shown that the coverage percent of picolinic acid on ceria
   corresponds well with the amount percent of adsorbed ceria on PU pad.
   The change in adsorbed particles was directly reflected in the CMP
   polishing process where significant improvements were achieved.
   Particularly, convex areas on the chip experienced higher friction force
   from the attached abrasives on the PU pad than concave areas. As a
   result, the convex areas have increased removal rate of step height
   compared to the ceria suspension without picolinic acid. The changing
   profiles of convex areas are reported during the step height reduction
   as a function of polishing time.}},

Abstract = {{Very thin TiN and ZrN films (<500 nm) were grown on (100) Si substrates
   at temperatures up to 500 degrees C by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD)
   technique using a KrF excimer laser under residual vacuum or various
   mixtures of CH4 or N-2. Auger electron spectroscopy investigations found
   that films contained a relatively low oxygen concentration, usually
   below 3.0 at\%. Films deposited under residual vacuum or very low N-2
   pressures (<3 x 10(-3) Pa) contained 3-6 at\% C atoms in the bulk. This
   fraction grew to 8-10 at\% when the deposition was performed under an
   atmosphere of 2 x 10(-3) Pa CH4. To avoid C atoms incorporation into the
   bulk a deposition pressure of 10 Pa N-2 was required. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy investigations found that oxygen was mostly
   bonded in an oxynitride type of compound, while carbon was bonded into a
   metallic carbide. The presence of C atoms in the chemical composition of
   the TiN or ZrN improved the measured hardness of the films. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We report the development of efficient small molecular organic
   photovoltaic devices incorporating tetracene anode interfacial layers.
   Planar heterojunction devices employing the tetracene anode interfacial
   layer achieved an EQE enhancement of 150\% in the spectral region
   corresponding to ZnPc absorption. We demonstrate that this enhancement
   is due to the combined effect of the tetracene layer providing
   exciton-blocking at the anode/donor interface and potentially an
   increase in the exciton diffusion length in the ZnPc layer due to
   increased crystallinity and more preferred molecular stacking
   orientation. A power conversion efficiency of 4.7\% was achieved for a
   planar heterojunction of a modified zinc phthalocyanine based material
   and C-60 when employing the tetracene anode interfacial layer. By
   utilizing a planar-mixed heterojunction structure a peak EQE of nearly
   70\% and a power conversion efficiency of 5.8\% was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Ceria nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely explored as a promising
   material in various fields. As synthesized under various physicochemical
   conditions, it exhibits the different surface chemistry. Here, the role
   of hydroxyl and nitrate group on ceria surface, formed under various
   physicochemical conditions, for the silicate adsorption was
   experimentally and theoretically investigated based on the adsorption
   isotherms and theoretical analyses using density functional theory (DFT)
   calculation. Experimental results acquired from adsorption isotherms
   with Freundlich model indicated that the nitrate group shows a much
   higher affinity with silicate than the hydroxyl groups. These phenomena
   were demonstrated through the theoretical approaches that exhibit the
   binding energy of the NO3-ceria (-4.383 eV) on the SiO2 surface being
   much higher than that of the OH-ceria (-3.813 eV). In good agreement
   with the experimental and the theoretical results based on adsorption
   properties, the results of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) also
   show that the nitrate groups significantly enhance the removal of SiO2
   than the hydroxyl groups. The results investigated in this study will
   provide researchers, studying the ceria NPs, with guidelines on the
   importance of exploring the surface chemistry of ceria.}},

Abstract = {{We provide an approach to optimize a block surgical schedule (BSS) that
   adheres to the block scheduling policy, using a new type of
   newsvendor-based model. We assume that strategic decisions assign a
   specialty to each Operating Room (OR) day and deal with BSS decisions
   that assign sub-specialties to time blocks, determining block duration
   as well as sequence in each OR each day with the objective of minimizing
   the sum of expected lateness and earliness costs. Our newsvendor
   approach prescribes the optimal duration of each block and the best
   permutation, obtained by solving the sequential newsvendor problem,
   determines the optimal block sequence. We obtain closed-form solutions
   for the case in which surgery durations follow the normal distribution.
   Furthermore, we give a closed-form solution for optimal block duration

Abstract = {{A systematic method for modeling direct methanol fuel cells, with a
   focus on the anode side of the system, is advanced for the purpose of
   quantifying the methanol crossover phenomenon and predicting the
   concentration of methanol in the anode catalyst layer of a direct
   methanol fuel cell. The model accounts for fundamental mass transfer
   phenomena at steady state, including convective transport in the anode
   flow channel, as well as diffusion and electro-osmotic drag transport
   across the polymer electrolyte membrane. Experimental measurements of
   methanol crossover current density are used to identify five modeling
   parameters according to a systematic parameter estimation methodology. A
   validation study shows that the model matches the experimental data
   well, and the usefulness of the model is illustrated through the
   analysis of effects such as the choice fuel flow rate in the anode flow
   channel and the presence of carbon-dioxide bubbles. Copyright (C) 2014,

Abstract = {{Crystalline uranium oxide thin films were deposited in an unbalanced
   magnetron sputtering system by sputtering from a depleted uranium target
   in an Ar+O-2 mixture using middle frequency pulsed dc magnetron
   sputtering. The substrate temperature was constantly maintained at 500
   degrees C. Different uranium oxide phases (including UO2-x, UO2, U3O7
   and U3O8) were obtained by controlling the percentage of the O-2 flow
   rate to the total gas flow rate (fo(2)) in the chamber. The crystal
   structure of the films was characterized using X-ray diffraction and the
   microstructure of the films was studied using transmission electron
   microscopy and atom probe tomography. When the fo(2) was below 10\%, the
   film contains a mixture of metallic uranium and UO2-x, phases. As the
   fo(2) was controlled in the range of 10-13\%, UO2 films with a (2 2 0)
   preferential orientation were obtained. The oxide phase rapidly changed
   to a mixture of U3O7 and U3O8 as the fo(2) was increased to the range of
   15-18\%. Further increasing the fo(2) to 20\% and above, polycrystalline
   U3O8 thin films with a (0 0 1) preferential orientation were formed. The
   hardness and Young's modulus of the uranium oxide films were evaluated
   using nanoindentation. The film containing a single UO2 phase exhibited
   the maximum hardness of 14.3 GPa and a Young's modulus of 195 GPa. The
   UO2 thin film also exhibited good thermal stability in that no phase
   change was observed after annealing at 600 degrees C in vacuum for 104h.

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is emerging as a powerful technique for
   imaging microvasculature at depths beyond the similar to 1 mm depth
   limit associated with confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy and
   optical coherence tomography. PAM, however, is currently qualitative in
   nature and cannot quantitatively measure important functional parameters
   including oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)), deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), oxygen
   saturation (sO(2)), blood flow (BF) and rate of oxygen metabolism
   (MRO2). Here we describe a new photoacoustic microscopic method, termed

Title = {{Mean force on a finite-sized spherical particle due to an acoustic field
   in a viscous compressible medium}},

Abstract = {{An analytical expression to evaluate the second-order mean force
   (acoustic radiation force) on a finite-sized, rigid, spherical particle
   due to an acoustic wave is presented. The medium in which the particle
   is situated is taken to be both viscous and compressible. A far-field
   derivation approach has been used in determining the force, which is a
   function of the particle size, acoustic wavelength, and viscous
   boundary-layer thickness. It is assumed that the viscous length scale is
   negligibly small compared to the acoustic wavelength. The force
   expression presented here (i) reduces to the correct inviscid behavior
   (for both small- and finite-sized particles) and ( ii) is identical to
   recent viscous results {[}M. Settnes and H. Bruus, Phys. Rev. E 85,
   016327 (2012)] for small-sized particles. Further, the computed force
   qualitatively matches the computational fluid dynamics (finite-element)
   results {[}D. Foresti, M. Nabavi, and D. Poulikakos, J. Fluid Mech. 709,
   581 (2012)] for finite-sized particles. Additionally, the mean force is
   interpreted in terms of a multipole expansion. Subsequently, considering
   the fact that the force expansion is an infinite series, the number of
   terms that are required or adequate to capture the force to a specified
   accuracy is also provided as a function of the particle size to acoustic
   wavelength ratio. The dependence of the force on particle density,
   kinematic viscosity, and bulk viscosity of the fluid is also
   investigated. Here, both traveling and standing waves are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Knee contact mechanics play an important role in knee implant failure
   and wear mechanics. Femoral condylar contact loss in total knee
   arthroplasty has been reported in some studies and it is considered to
   potentially induce excessive wear of the polyethylene insert.Measuring
   in vivo forces applied to the tibial plateau with an instrumented
   prosthesis is a possible approach to assess contact loss in vivo, but
   this approach is not very practical. Alternatively, single-plane
   fluoroscopy and pose estimation can be used to derive the relative pose
   of the femoral component with respect to the tibial plateau and estimate
   the distance from the medial and lateral parts of the femoral component
   towards the insert. Two measures are reported in the literature:
   lift-off is commonly defined as the difference in distance between the
   medial and lateral condyles of the femoral component with respect to the
   tibial plateau; separation is determined by the closest distance of each
   condyle towards the polyethylene insert instead of the tibia plateau.In
   this validation study, lift-off and separation as measured with
   single-plane fluoroscopy are compared to in vivo contact forces measured
   with an instrumented knee implant. In a phantom study, lift-off and
   separation were compared to measurements with a high quality bi-plane
   measurement.The results of the in vivo contact-force experiment
   demonstrate a large discrepancy between single-plane fluoroscopy and the
   in vivo force data: single-plane fluoroscopy measured up to 5.1 mm of
   lift-off or separation, whereas the force data never showed actual loss
   of contact. The phantom study demonstrated that the single-plane setup
   could introduce an overestimation of 0.22 mm + + 0.36 mm. Correcting the
   out-of-plane position resulted in an underestimation of medial
   separation by 020 mm + + 0.29 mm.In conclusion, there is a discrepancy
   between the in vivo force data and single-plane fluoroscopic
   measurements. Therefore contact loss may not always be determined
   reliably by single plane fluoroscopy analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
