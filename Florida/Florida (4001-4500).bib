Abstract = {{In this work, cotton fibers and pyrene-dispersed graphene sheets were
   used to produce graphene-coated pyrogenic carbon as an anode material
   for lithium battery. The graphene sheets were wrapped around the cotton
   fibers by simply dipping the fabric in a graphene/pyrene-derivative
   suspension. And then the cotton/graphene textile was annealed at 700
   degrees C in a quartz tube furnace under Ar flow conditions. During the
   annealing process, the gaps between separated graphene sheets were
   ``soldered{''} by ``glue{''} molecules (aromatic molecular surfactant)
   to form graphene-coated pyrogenic carbon. Because of the unique electric
   properties of the graphene ``skin{''} on the pyrogenic carbon, the
   flexible graphene-coated pyrogenic carbon showed relatively large
   storage capacity to lithium. Galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments
   also showed that the graphene-coated pyrogenic carbon electrode provided
   a reversible discharge capacity as high as 288 mA h g(-1) even after 50
   cycles and thus can be used an anode material in lithium battery. (C)

Title = {{Deposition and transport of graphene oxide in saturated and unsaturated
   porous media}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{229}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, sand and bubble column experiments were conducted to
   explore the deposition mechanisms of graphene oxide (GO) particles in
   porous media with various combinations of moisture content and ionic
   strength. Sand column experimental results indicated that retention and
   transport of GO in porous media were strongly dependent on solution
   ionic strength. Particularly, GO showed high mobility under low ionic
   strength conditions in both saturated and unsaturated porous media.
   Increasing ionic strength dramatically increased the retention of GO
   particles in porous media, mainly through secondary-minimum deposition
   as indicated in the XDLVO interaction energy profiles. Recovery rates of
   GO in unsaturated sand columns were lower than that in saturated columns
   under the same ionic strength conditions, suggesting moisture content
   also played an important role in the retention of GO in porous media.
   Findings from the bubble column experiments showed that the GO did not
   attach to the air-water interface, which is consistent with the XDLVO
   predictions. Additional retention mechanisms, such as film straining,
   thus could be responsible to the reduced mobility of GO in unsaturated
   porous media. The experimental data of GO transport through saturated
   and unsaturated porous media could be accurately simulated by an
   advection-dispersion-reaction model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of progressive resistance exercise (PRE) on the motor signs
   of Parkinson's disease have not been studied in controlled trials. The
   objective of the current trial was to compare 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month
   outcomes of patients with Parkinson's disease who received PRE with a
   stretching, balance, and strengthening exercise program. The authors
   conducted a randomized controlled trial between September 2007 and July
   2011. Pairs of patients matched by sex and off-medication scores on the
   Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, motor subscale (UPDRS-III),
   were randomly assigned to the interventions with a 1:1 allocation ratio.
   The PRE group performed a weight-lifting program. The modified fitness
   counts (mFC) group performed a stretching, balance, and strengthening
   exercise program. Patients exercised 2 days per week for 24 months at a
   gym. A personal trainer directed both weekly sessions for the first 6
   months and 1 weekly session after 6 months. The primary outcome was the
   off-medication UPDRS-III score. Patients were followed for 24 months at
   6-month intervals. Of 51 patients, 20 in the PRE group and 18 in the mFC
   group completed the trial. At 24 months, the mean off-medication
   UPDRS-III score decreased more with PRE than with mFC (mean difference,
   -7.3 points; 95\% confidence interval, -11.3 to -3.6; P<0.001). The PRE
   group had 10 adverse events, and the mFC group had 7 adverse events. PRE
   demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant reduction in
   UPDRS-III scores compared with mFC and is recommended as a useful
   adjunct therapy to improve Parkinsonian motor signs. (c) 2013 Movement

Abstract = {{Isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), from from peripheral blood
   or cancer cells from bone marrow has significant applications in cancer
   diagnosis, therapy monitoring, and drug development. CTCs are cancer
   cells shed from primary tumors; they circulate in the bloodstream,
   leading to metastasis. The extraordinary rarity of CTCs in the
   bloodstream makes their isolation a significant technological challenge.
   Herein, we report the development of a platform combining multivalent
   DNA aptamer nanospheres with microfluidic devices for efficient
   isolation of cancer cells from blood. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were
   used as an efficient platform for assembling a number of aptamers for
   high-efficiency cell capture. Up to 95 aptamers were attached onto each
   AuNP, resulting in enhanced molecular recognition capability. An
   increase of 39-fold in binding affinity was confirmed by flow cytometry
   for AuNP-aptamer conjugates (AuNP-aptamer) when compared with aptamer
   alone. With a laminar flow flat channel microfluidic device, the capture
   efficiency of human acute leukemia cells from a cell mixture in buffer
   increased from 49\% using aptamer alone to 92\% using AuNP-aptamer. We
   also employed AuNP-aptamer in a microfluidic device with herringbone
   mixing microstructures for isolation of leukemia cells in whole blood.
   The cell capture efficiency was also significantly increased with the
   AuNP-aptamer over aptamer alone, especially at high flow rates. Our
   results show that the platform combining DNA nanostructures with
   microfluidics has a great potential for sensitive isolation of CTCs and
   is promising for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{Maximizing the lifetime of a sensor network has been a subject of
   intensive study. However, much prior work defines the network lifetime
   as the time before the first data-generating sensor in the network runs
   out of energy or is not reachable to the sink due to network partition.
   The problem is that even though one sensor is out of operation, the rest
   of the network may well remain operational, with other sensors
   generating useful data and delivering those data to the sink. Hence,
   instead of just maximizing the time before the first sensor is out of
   operation, we should maximize the lifetime vector of the network,
   consisting of the lifetimes of all sensors, sorted in ascending order.
   For this problem, there exists only a centralized algorithm that solves
   a series of linear programming problems with high-order complexities.
   This paper proposes a fully distributed algorithm that runs iteratively.
   Each iteration produces a lifetime vector that is better than the vector
   produced by the previous iteration. Instead of giving the optimal result
   in one shot after lengthy computation, the proposed distributed
   algorithm has a result at any time, and the more time spent gives the
   better result. We show that when the algorithm stabilizes, its result
   produces the maximum lifetime vector. Furthermore, simulations
   demonstrate that the algorithm is able to converge rapidly toward the
   maximum lifetime vector with low overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle physicochemical properties such as surface charge are
   considered to play an important role in cellular uptake and
   particle-cell interactions. In order to systematically evaluate the role
   of surface charge on the uptake of iron oxide nanoparticles, we prepared
   carboxymethyl-substituted dextrans with different degrees of
   substitution, ranging from 38 to 5 groups per chain, and reacted them
   using carbodiimide chemistry with amine-silanecoated iron oxide
   nanoparticles with narrow size distributions in the range of 33-45 nm.
   Surface charge of carboxymethyl-substituted dextran-coated nanoparticles
   ranged from -50 to 5 mV as determined by zeta potential measurements,
   and was dependent on the number of carboxymethyl groups incorporated in
   the dextran chains. Nanoparticles were incubated with CaCo-2 human colon
   cancer cells. Nanoparticle-cell interactions were observed by confocal
   laser scanning microscopy and uptake was quantified by elemental
   analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Mechanisms
   of internalization were inferred using pharmacological inhibitors for
   fluid-phase, clathrin-mediated, and caveola-mediated endocytosis.
   Results showed increased uptake for nanoparticles with greater negative
   charge. Internalization patterns suggest that uptake of the most
   negatively charged particles occurs via non-specific interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to long-existing load uncertainty on power systems,
   continuously increasing renewable energy injections (such as wind and
   solar) have further made the power grid more volatile and uncertain.
   Stochastic and recently introduced robust optimization approaches have
   been studied to provide the day-ahead unit commitment decision with the
   consideration of real-time load and supply uncertainties. In this paper,
   we introduce an innovative minimax regret unit commitment model aiming
   to minimize the maximum regret of the day-ahead decision from the actual
   realization of the uncertain real-time wind power generation. Our
   approach will ensure the robustness of the unit commitment decision
   considering the inherent uncertainty in wind generation. Meanwhile, our
   approach will provide a system operator a clear picture in terms of the
   maximum regret value among all possible scenarios. A Benders'
   decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Finally, our
   extensive case studies compare the performances of three different
   approaches (robust optimization, minimax regret, and stochastic
   optimization) and verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a two-stage robust optimization approach to solve
   the N -k contingency-constrained unit commitment (CCUC) problem. In our
   approach, both generator and transmission line contingencies are
   considered. Compared to the traditional approach using a given set of
   components as candidates for possible failures, our approach considers
   all possible component failure scenarios. We consider the objectives of
   minimizing the total generation cost under the worst-case contingency
   scenario and/or the total pre-contingency cost. We formulate CCUC as a
   two-stage robust optimization problem and develop a decomposition
   framework to enable tractable computation. In our framework, the master
   problem makes unit commitment decisions and the subproblem discovers the
   worst-case contingency scenarios. By using linearization techniques and
   duality theory, we transform the subproblem into a mixed-integer linear
   program (MILP). The most violated inequalities generated from the
   subproblem are fed back into the master problem during each iteration.
   Our approach guarantees a globally optimal solution in a finite number
   of iterations. In reported computational experiments, we test both
   primal and dual decomposition approaches. Our computational results
   verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing penetration of wind power into the power grid,
   maintaining system reliability has been a challenging issue for
   ISOs/RTOs, due to the intermittent nature of wind power. In addition to
   the traditional reserves provided by thermal, hydro, and gas generators,
   demand response (DR) programs have gained much attention recently as
   another reserve resource to mitigate wind power output uncertainty.
   However, the price-elastic demand curve is not exactly known in advance,
   which provides another dimension of uncertainty. To accommodate the
   combined uncertainties from wind power and DR, we allow the wind power
   output to vary within a given interval with the price-elastic demand
   curve also varying in this paper. We develop a robust optimization
   approach to derive an optimal unit commitment decision for the
   reliability unit commitment runs by ISOs/RTOs, with the objective of
   maximizing total social welfare under the joint worst-case wind power
   output and demand response scenario. The problem is formulated as a
   multi-stage robust mixed-integer programming problem. An exact solution
   approach leveraging Benders' decomposition is developed to obtain the
   optimal robust unit commitment schedule for the problem. Additional
   variables are introduced to parameterize the conservatism of our model
   and avoid over-protection. Finally, we test the performance of the
   proposed approach using a case study based on the IEEE 118-bus system.
   The results verify that our proposed approach can accommodate both wind
   power and demand response uncertainties, and demand response can help
   accommodate wind power output uncertainty by lowering the unit load
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an optimal bidding strategy for independent power
   producers (IPPs) in the deregulated electricity market. The IPPs are

   two-stage stochastic price-based unit commitment problem with chance
   constraints to ensure wind power utilization. In our model, the first
   stage decision includes unit commitment and quantity of electricity
   submitted to the day-ahead market. The second stage decision includes
   generation dispatch, actual usage of wind power, and amount of energy
   imbalance between the day-ahead and real-time markets. The chance
   constraint is applied to ensure a certain percentage of wind power
   utilization so as to comply with renewable energy utilization
   regulations. Finally, a sample average approximation (SAA) approach is

Abstract = {{Due to increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy and
   introduction of demand response programs, uncertainties occur in both
   supply and demand sides in real time for the current power grid system.
   To address these uncertainties, most ISOs/RTOs perform reliability unit
   commitment runs after the day-ahead financial market to ensure
   sufficient generation capacity available in real time to accommodate
   uncertainties. Two-stage stochastic unit commitment and robust unit
   commitment formulations have been introduced and studied recently to
   provide day-ahead unit commitment decisions. However, both approaches
   have limitations: 1) computational challenges due to the large scenario
   size for the stochastic optimization approach and 2) conservativeness
   for the robust optimization approach. In this paper, we propose a novel
   unified stochastic and robust unit commitment model that takes advantage
   of both stochastic and robust optimization approaches, that is, this
   innovative model can achieve a low expected total cost while ensuring
   the system robustness. By introducing weights for the components for the
   stochastic and robust parts in the objective function, system operators
   can adjust the weights based on their preferences. Finally, a Benders'
   decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. The
   computational results indicate that this approach provides a more robust
   and computationally trackable framework as compared with the stochastic
   optimization approach and amore cost-effective unit commitment decision
   as compared with the robust optimization approach.}},

Abstract = {{A new dynamic accumulation method for measuring the oxygen transmission
   rate (OTR) of packages and packaging films using robust and inexpensive
   fluorescence oxygen sensing technology has been developed. The method
   allows for oxygen to transfer through a given area of packaging or
   sample film and accumulate over time. The test volume incorporates a
   fluorescence-based oxygen sensor that does not consume oxygen and
   therefore does not interfere with the real-time measurement of oxygen
   concentration. The new method was tested against a widely used,
   commercially available instrument (Mocon Oxtran 2/20; Mocon, Inc.,
   Minneapolis, MN, USA) designed around the steady-state gas permeation
   measurement approach described by ASTM D3985. Sample films were chosen
   to provide comparison over several orders of magnitude of OTR.
   Specifically, sample films with OTR values in the range of 10(1), 10(3)
   and 10(4) ml O-2/m(2)/day were measured, and results using the two
   methods were compared. Results showed that the new dynamic accumulation

Abstract = {{Liver disease affects millions of patients each year. The field of
   regenerative medicine promises alternative therapeutic approaches,
   including the potential to bioengineer replacement hepatic tissue. One
   approach combines cells with acellular scaffolds derived from animal
   tissue. The goal of this study was to scale up our rodent Liver
   decellularization method to Livers of a clinically relevant size.
   Porcine livers were cannulated via the hepatic artery, then perfused
   with PBS, followed by successive Triton X-100 and SDS solutions in
   saline buffer. After several days of rinsing, deceaularized liver
   samples were histologically analyzed. In addition, biopsy specimens of
   decellularized scaffolds were seeded with hepatoblastoma cells for
   cytotoxicity testing or implanted s.c. into rodents to investigate
   scaffold immunogenicity. Histological staining confirmed cellular
   clearance from pig livers, with removal of nuclei and cytoskeletal
   components and widespread preservation of structural extracellular
   molecules. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed preservation of an
   intact Liver capsule, a porous acellular Lattice structure with intact
   vessels and striated basement membrane. Liver scaffolds supported cells
   over 21 days, and no increased immune response was seen with either
   allogeneic (rat-into-rat) or xenogeneic (pig-into-rat) transplants over
   28 days, compared with sham operated on controls. These studies
   demonstrate that successful decellularization of the porcine Liver could
   be achieved with protocols developed for rat livers, yielding
   nonimmunogenic scaffolds for future hepatic bioengineering studies.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{20-32}},

Abstract = {{Residual currents induced by asymmetries in tidal mixing (ATM) were
   determined using a series of underway-current velocity profiles and
   salinity measurements, estimates of vertical mixing, and an analytical
   expression. Six different 12-hour transect surveys at the mouth of the
   James River were carried out under typical spring and neap tides and a
   range of river flows. The ATM-induced flows were found to be of the same
   order of magnitude as the density-driven flows. These flow profiles
   showed either a two or a three-layer structure in the channel and a
   two-layer structure over shoals. More stratification during ebb than
   flood periods (tidal straining) favored gravitational circulation,
   whereas reversed straining (more stratification at flood) opposed
   gravitational flow. The contribution of ATM-induced residuals increased
   as water column stratification increased. Lateral variations in ATM
   favored lateral shear in along-channel flow, enhancing the laterally
   sheared exchange. Observations were in good agreement with previous
   numerical and analytical model results. In particular, observational
   validation is presented on reverse tidal straining inducing residuals
   that act against gravitational circulation. Inconsistencies arise from
   the assumptions made in the models, namely no Coriolis forcing, no
   topographic features such as headlands, and simplified nature of
   stratification. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Phosphate removal from urine using hybrid anion exchange resin}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{322}},
Pages = {{104-112}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Urine source separation has been proposed as a more sustainable approach
   to wastewater management than treating combined wastewater streams. One
   such benefit of urine source separation is nutrient recovery, which has
   primarily focused on struvite precipitation for recovery of phosphorus.
   There is no previous research investigating phosphorus recovery from
   human urine by ion-exchange. Accordingly, the goal of this research was
   to provide an improved understanding of phosphate removal by
   ion-exchange using a hybrid anion exchange (HAIX) resin. The specific
   objectives of this research were to evaluate phosphate removal using
   HAIX resin in fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine in terms of (1) kinetic
   tests, (2) equilibrium tests, (3) sorption models, (4) competition among
   sulfate, chloride, and phosphate, and (5) pharmaceutical co-removal.
   Batch experiments were conducted using different compositions of
   synthetic urine. HAD: resin consisted of a strong-base anion exchange
   resin impregnated with hydrated ferric oxide nanoparticles. The major
   results of phosphate removal from urine using HAIX resin were rapid
   removal in 5 min or less, high removal up to 97\%, similar ion-exchange
   behavior in fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine, no affect by sulfate on
   phosphate removal, and co-removal of pharmaceutical and phosphate. (C)

Title = {{Organ S values and effective doses for family members exposed to adult
   patients following I-131 treatment: A Monte Carlo simulation study}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To calculate organ S values (mGy/Bq-s) and effective doses per
   time-integrated activity (mSv/Bq-s) for pediatric and adult family
   members exposed to an adult male or female patient treated with I-131
   using a series of hybrid computational phantoms coupled with a Monte
   Carlo radiation transport technique.
   Methods: A series of pediatric and adult hybrid computational phantoms
   were employed in the study. Three different exposure scenarios were
   considered: (1) standing face-to-face exposures between an adult patient
   and pediatric or adult family phantoms at five different separation
   distances; (2) an adult female patient holding her newborn child, and
   (3) a 1-yr-old child standing on the lap of an adult female patient. For
   the adult patient model, two different thyroid-related diseases were
   considered: hyperthyroidism and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) with
   corresponding internal distributions of I-131. A general purpose Monte
   Carlo code, MCNPX v2.7, was used to perform the Monte Carlo radiation
   transport.
   Results: The S values show a strong dependency on age and organ location
   within the family phantoms at short distances. The S values and
   effective dose per time-integrated activity from the adult female
   patient phantom are relatively high at shorter distances and to younger
   family phantoms. At a distance of 1 m, effective doses per
   time-integrated activity are lower than those values based on the NRC
   (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) by a factor of 2 for both adult male and
   female patient phantoms. The S values to target organs from the
   hyperthyroid-patient source distribution strongly depend on the height
   of the exposed family phantom, so that their values rapidly decrease
   with decreasing height of the family phantom. Active marrow of the
   10-yr-old phantom shows the highest S values among family phantoms for
   the DTC-patient source distribution. In the exposure scenario of mother
   and baby, S values and effective doses per time-integrated activity to
   the newborn and 1-yr-old phantoms for a hyperthyroid-patient source are
   higher than values for a DTC-patient source.
   Conclusions: The authors performed realistic assessments of I-131 organ
   S values and effective dose per time-integrated activity from adult
   patients treated for hyperthyroidism and DTC to family members. In
   addition, the authors' studies consider Monte Carlo simulated ``mother
   and baby/child{''} exposure scenarios for the first time. Based on these
   results, the authors reconfirm the strong conservatism underlying the
   point source method recommended by the US NRC. The authors recommend
   that various factors such as the type of the patient's disease, the age
   of family members, and the distance/posture between the patient and
   family members must be carefully considered to provide realistic dose
   estimates for patient-to-family exposures. (C) 2013 American Association

Abstract = {{Calcium carbonate-based materials (CCBM) have been found to remove
   Fe(II) and other divalent metal cations from aqueous solution and thus
   have the potential for incorporation into remediation systems to remove
   Fe(II) from groundwater at landfills. Research was conducted to examine
   the ability of a range of CCBM to remove Fe(II) and assess the mechanism
   of removal. Different CCBM (limestone, concrete, dolomite, marble), as
   well as gypsum, witherite, and quartz sand, were tested for their
   ability to remove Fe(II) from water using batch tests conducted under
   anaerobic conditions. Limestone (specific surface area of approximately
   0.46 m(2)/g) was found to have the best removal effectiveness, and the
   final Fe(II) concentration was reduced from 50 to < 0.01 mg/L. Kinetics
   experiments conducted over a 72 h period indicated that the removal
   process of Fe(II) by CCBM was a two-step process. The first step is
   rapid sorption of Fe(II) onto the CCBM surfaces within the first hour,
   and the second step is relatively slow co-precipitation of
   iron-containing solids formed through various chemical reactions. The
   two best performing CCBM (limestone and concrete) were evaluated for
   their removal ability based on media particle size (diameters of 3-5,
   7-10, 15-25, and 40-50 mm) and revealed statistically significant (p <
   0.01) increases in Fe(II) removal for each particle size class examined.
   SEM analysis of reacted materials revealed visible precipitates on the
   reactive material surface; XRD analysis was not able to detect
   crystalline Fe minerals on limestone surface.}},

Abstract = {{Current methodologies to estimate urban water end uses are largely
   limited to macro-level analyses that rely heavily on average values.
   These approaches might offer reasonable estimates in the aggregate, but
   they fail to differentiate between water users and end-use devices. In
   order to target customers for water conservation, this article presents
   a methodology by which to carry out an end-use inventory to arrive at
   the number, water use efficiency, and frequency of use of water end-use
   devices at the parcel level for four single-family, five multifamily,
   and 55 commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) public supply
   sectors. Such a detailed inventory provides a better understanding of
   water use and facilitates the evaluation of savings and targeting of
   individual end-use retrofits associated with water conservation
   practices based on cost-effectiveness. The seven modeled end uses are
   male-only toilets, mixed-use toilets, urinals, faucets, showerheads,
   clothes washers, and prerinse spray valves.}},

Abstract = {{Paper-based microfluidic devices have recently garnered an increasing
   interest in the literature. The majority of these devices were produced
   by patterning hydrophobic zones in hydrophilic paper via photoresist or
   wax. Others were created by cutting paper using a laser. Here, we
   present a fabrication method for producing devices by simple
   craft-cutting and lamination, in a way similar to making an
   identification (ID) card. The method employs a digital craft cutter and
   roll laminator to produce laminated paper-based analytical devices
   (LPAD). Lamination with a plastic backing provides the mechanical
   strength for a paper device. The approach of using a craft cutter and
   laminator makes it possible to rapid-prototype LPAD with no more
   difficulty than producing a typical ID card, at very low cost. Devices
   constructed using this method have been exploited for simultaneous
   detection of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and glucose in synthetic urine
   with colorimetric assays. Both BSA and glucose are detectable at
   clinically relevant concentrations, with the detection limit at 2.5 mu M
   for BSA and 0.5 mM for glucose.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of self-heating on graphene transistor characteristics are
   examined by self-consistently solving the coupled nonequilibrium Green's
   function transport equation with the thermal transport equation. The
   results indicate that the substrate and gate insulator have significant
   effects on the temperature rise, decrease of on-current, and lowering of
   transconductance through surface polar phonon scattering, which causes
   self-heating effects. For graphene transistors with the channel length
   of a few hundred nanometers, the temperature rise of about 110 K and
   on-current lowering of about 17\% are predicted because of self-heating.
   This indicates the importance of a coupled electro-thermal simulation
   for predicting graphene device characteristics and of thermal
   engineering on device performance. The dependence of the self-heating
   effects on the transistor channel length and phonon energy are also
   examined.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral radiographic views can be easily taken and have reveal
   considerable information about the patella. The purpose of this study
   was to obtain sagittal plane patellar kinematics data through the entire
   range of knee flexion under weight-bearing conditions.
   Patellar flexion angles relative to the femur and tibia and
   anterior-posterior and proximal-distal translations of the patella
   relative to the femur and tibia were measured from 0 to 165A degrees
   knee flexion in nine healthy knees using dynamic radiographic images.
   The patella flexed relative to the femur and tibia by two thirds times
   and one third times the knee flexion angle, respectively. The patella
   translated in an arc relative to the femur and tibia as the knee flexed.
   In early flexion, the superior and centroid points translated anteriorly
   and then the patella translated posteriorly relative to the femur. All
   three points of the patella translated posteriorly relative to the tibia
   during a full range of flexion. An average of four and three millimetres
   proximal patellar translation relative to the tibia was demonstrated
   from 0 to 20A degrees and 140 to 160A degrees knee flexion,
   respectively.
   Physiological sagittal plane patellar kinematics, including patellar
   flexion angles and translations relative to the femur and tibia, showed
   generally similar patterns for each subject. Measurements of dynamic
   radiographic images under weight-bearing activities may enhance the
   opportunity to identify patellar pathological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to relate structure to
   function mapped with high-temporal resolution electrophysiological
   recordings using metal electrodes. Additionally, MRI may be used to
   guide the placement of electrodes or conductive cannula in the brain.
   However, the magnetic susceptibility mismatch between implanted metals
   and surrounding brain tissue can severely distort MR images and spectra,
   particularly in high magnetic fields. In this study, we present a
   modified MR method of characterizing the magnetic susceptibility of
   materials that can be used to develop biocompatible, metal alloys that
   match the susceptibility of host tissue in order to eliminate MR
   distortions proximal to the implant. This method was applied at 4.7 T
   and 11.1 T to measure the susceptibility of a model solid-solution alloy
   of Cu and Sn, which is inexpensive but not biocompatible. MR-derived
   relative susceptibility values of four different compositions of Cu-Sn
   alloy deviated by less than 3.1\% from SQUID magnetometry absolute
   susceptibility measurements performed up to 7 T. These results
   demonstrate that the magnetic susceptibility varies linearly with atomic
   percentage in these solid-solution alloys, but are not simply the
   weighted average of Cu and Sn magnetic susceptibilities. Therefore
   susceptibility measurements are necessary when developing
   susceptibility-matched, solid-solution alloys for the elimination of
   susceptibility artifacts in MR. This MR method does not require any
   specialized equipment and is free of geometrical constraints, such as
   sample shape requirements associated with SQUID magnetometry, so the
   method can be used at all stages of fabrication to guide the development
   of a susceptibility matched, biocompatible device. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of magnetic field-induced particle chaining on the
   magnetorheology of commercial iron oxide-based ferrofluids was
   investigated by comparison of a ferrofluid with particles that resist
   chaining and a ferrofluid with particles that interact when a field is
   applied, forming chain-like aggregates. This difference between the two
   ferrofluids was confirmed by optical microscopy and dynamic light
   scattering in an applied magnetic field. Both fluids had similar
   magnetic particle fraction, but showed different magnetorheological
   behavior. Chaining resulted in a stronger magnetic field-dependent
   viscosity enhancement and the appearance of an elastic modulus. The
   magnetorheology of these two fluids was described using the Mason number
   (Mn), resulting in two distinct Mn power law slopes at intermediate and
   small Mn values for the ferrofluid with magnetic field-induced
   aggregation. The commonly used magnetic coupling parameter failed to
   distinguish the behavior of the two ferrofluids.}},

   bullets on the surface of sand/soil. After a 16-18-week incubation under
   high or low rainfall simulations, total Pb concentrations in sand were
   lower than that in soil. Total leachable Pb in sand (8.48 and 5.52 mu g
   kg(-1)) was also lower than that in soil (60.0 and 30.4 mu g kg(-1))
   when bullets were mixed with sand/soil; however, they were comparable
   when bullets were placed on the sand/soil surface. These results
   indicate that lower Pb concentration in the sand than in soil may be
   attributed to reduced weathering of bullets. Mechanical removal of Pb
   bullets in the field transferred Pb from large to finer particles,
   increasing total Pb in the soil (< 2 mm) from 2,170 to 5,000 mg kg(-1).
   In contrast, mechanical removal of Pb shot effectively reduced the shot
   in the soil by 86-92 \%. Thus, we concluded that, while replacing soil
   berm with sand berm can slow down Pb weathering, it may increase Pb
   leachability in the long term. Removal of Pb bullets and Pb shot can be
   effective, but caution needs to be exercised to minimize the adverse
   impacts, especially in pistol/rifle ranges because of increased total Pb
   content in the soil.}},

   18.3-mu m piston displacement is obtained by applying 5 V-dc to four
   symmetrical LSF (SLSF) actuators. For the rotation mode, the measured
   resonant frequency is 1650 Hz and an optical deflection angle of 4.2
   degrees is measured by applying 5 V-dc to one SLSF actuator. A 2-D

Abstract = {{Since multicore architectures are becoming more popular, recent
   multicore optimizations focus on energy consumption. In this paper, we
   focus on reducing the energy consumption in the data and instruction
   cache hierarchies in a multicore system. First, we present a level one
   data cache tuning heuristic for a heterogeneous multicore system, which
   classifies applications based on data sharing and cache behavior and
   uses this classification to guide cache tuning and reduce the number of
   cores that need to be tuned. Results reveal average energy savings of 25
   percent for 2, 4, 8, and 16-core systems while searching only 1 percent
   of the design space. Next, we present a level one instruction cache
   tuning heuristic that reduces energy consumption in the instruction
   cache hierarchy by an average of 53 percent for 2, 4, 8, and 16-core
   systems, while searching less than 1 percent of the design space.
   Finally, we develop a custom, global hardware cache tuner for a
   dual-core system and show that our cache tuner has low area, energy, and
   power overheads.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have documented the merits and problems of nighttime work
   for highway construction. Most of these studies have examined the safety
   of the construction site for workers or the traveling public.
   Illumination standards, sign requirements, and crash rate data have been
   studied to determine whether crash rates increase during nighttime
   hours, and the reasons for these crashes. Few studies have addressed
   either the effects on cost or productivity that nighttime construction
   has on a project. This study used hard bid unit prices to focus on the
   effect that performing certain construction activities at night has on
   cost and productivity. Specifically, the study assumes that a
   contractor's bid amount reflects expected relative project productivity
   and answers the question, What impact, if any, does night work have on
   construction productivity and therefore bid price? This is the first
   paper to answer both questions as related. Among the results was the
   fact that for the most part, the owner would have saved millions of
   dollars by allowing the contractor the option of working at night or
   during the day, though some items were bid lowest if the contract
   allowed for night work only. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{With increased urbanization, deep foundation (bridges, signage, walls,
   etc.) selection is moving toward the minimization of disturbance and
   installation time, as well as addressing quality control and assurance
   issues. Unfortunately, many types of deep foundations involve noise and
   vibration during installation (e.g., driven piles) or integrity and
   reduced resistance issues (e.g., drilled shafts, both conventional and
   post grouted tip, continuous flight auger piles). This paper presents a
   new foundation type, a jetted and grouted precast pile, which uses the
   advantages of several proven deep foundation installation techniques.
   The installation of the new pile is comprised of three distinct phases:
   (1) pressurized water-jetting of a precast pile into the ground; (2)
   side grouting of the pile; and (3) tip grouting. The pile has two
   separate side grouting zones, each with its own grout delivery system.
   Each grout zone is covered with a semirigid membrane, which results in
   radial expansion of the soil during side grouting and horizontal
   orientation of the major principal stress. Small-scale testing revealed
   excellent bonding between the pile and the grout, as well as improved
   mobilized pile-soil skin and tip resistance. Both experimental and FEM
   modeling of the grouting and axial loading were performed on various
   sized jetted and grouted precast piles in cohesionless soil. On the
   basis of this study, a methodology that predicts expected grout
   pressures during grouting, unit side and tip resistance, and the
   load-displacement response of a pile in cohesionless soil is proposed.
   Further testing and research is required to validate the proposed
   methodology before it can be implemented in practical situations.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum screen enclosures suffer from significant damage in hurricanes.
   In an attempt to identify ways to minimize the damage to screen
   enclosures, experimental investigations were conducted to study how
   screen enclosures perform when they are subjected to repeated loading
   cycles. The loading cycles mimic gradually increasing hurricane winds,
   while considering the fluctuating nature of the wind. Three types of
   specimens were constructed and tested. Their overall geometry was the
   same but their bracing strategies were different. Three damage indices
   were used to analyze the data. Qualitative assessment and comparison of
   damage was also conducted. Overall, K-type bracing was most effective
   followed by cable bracing. Lack of bracing resulted in sudden failure.
   Beam-to-host connections were very critical in preventing catastrophic
   failure. Suggestions on how to improve beam-to-host connections are
   provided along with other measures to mitigate the damage on screen
   enclosures. Where feasible, the most important measure to reduce damage
   would be the installation of a proper bracing system; however, other
   proposed measures would also strengthen the structure against hurricane
   winds.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a convenient method that has
   been used to characterize skin barrier function, which affects drug
   delivery into and through the skin. The objective of this study was to
   relate changes in skin barrier function arising from mechanical damage
   to changes in the impedance spectra. These observations are compared in
   a companion paper to changes in chemically damaged skin.
   Electrical impedance and the permeation of a non-polar compound were
   measured before and after human cadaver skin was damaged by needle
   puncture.
   The impedance responses of all skin samples were consistent with an
   equivalent circuit model with a resistor and constant phase element
   (CPE) in parallel. Pinhole-damaged skin exhibited a lower resistance
   pathway acting in parallel with the skin resistance without changing the
   CPE behavior. The characteristic frequency of the impedance scans
   determined after needle puncture increased by an amount that could be
   predicted. The flux of 4-cyanophenol increased by a small but
   significant amount that did not correlate with the hole resistance
   calculated under the assumption that the resistance of the surrounding
   skin did not change.
   Skin impedance measurements are sensitive to irreversible damage caused
   by exposure to puncture with a needle.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study on absorption characteristics of water vapor into
   a thin lithium bromide (LiBr) solution flow is presented. The LiBr
   solution flow is constrained between a superhydrophobic vapor permeable
   wall and a solid surface that removes the heat of absorption. As opposed
   to conventional falling film absorbers, in this configuration, the
   solution film thickness and velocity can be controlled independently to
   enhance the absorption rate. The effects of water vapor pressure,
   cooling surface temperature, solution film thickness, and solution flow
   velocity on the absorption rate are studied. An absorption rate of
   approximately 0.006 kg/m(2) s was measured at a LiBr solution channel
   thickness and flow velocity of 100 mu m and 5 mm/s, respectively. The
   absorption rate increased linearly with the water vapor driving
   potential at the test conditions of this study. It was demonstrated that
   decreasing the solution film thickness and increasing the solution
   velocity enhance the absorption rate. The high absorption rate and the
   inherently compact form of the proposed,absorber facilitate development
   of compact small-scale waste heat or solar-thermal driven cooling
   systems. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticle-based gene transfection has been shown to be an
   effective, non-viral technique for delivery of both plasmid DNA and
   siRNA into cells in culture. It has several advantages over other
   non-viral delivery techniques, such as short transfection times and high
   cell viability. These advantages have been demonstrated in a number of
   primary cells and cell lines. Here we report that oscillating magnet
   array-based nanomagnetic transfection significantly improves
   transfection efficiency in both human prenatal cardiac progenitor cells
   and adult cardiomyocytes when compared to static magnetofection,
   cationic lipid reagents and electroporation, while maintaining high cell
   viability. In addition, transfection of adult cardiomyocytes was
   improved further by seeding the cells onto Collagen I-coated plates,
   with transfection efficiencies of up to 49\% compared to 24\% with lipid
   reagents and 19\% with electroporation. These results demonstrate that
   oscillating nanomagnetic transfection far outperforms other non-viral
   transfection techniques in these important cells.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ passive reactive barriers containing carbonate minerals show
   potential for dissolved iron removal from groundwater at landfill sites.
   The removal of Fe(II) from synthetic groundwater using limestone and
   crushed concrete (7-10 mm) was evaluated using dynamic flow columns.
   Solutions of 50 mg/L Fe(II) were passed through duplicate columns of
   limestone and concrete until breakthrough (250-300 days); water quality
   was evaluated at distinct column depths throughout the study. Each
   material was successful in reducing the concentration of Fe(II), with
   both achieving an average of greater than 99.4\% iron removal (<0.3 mg/L
   effluent concentration) over 288 and 216 pore volumes, resulting in
   effective removal capacities of 4.06 and 3.80 g Fe/kg reactive material
   for limestone and crushed concrete, respectively. These values are less
   than removal capacities achieved from a sequencing batch test (32.9 and
   27.9 g Fe/kg limestone and crushed concrete, respectively), a possible
   result of preferential flow pathways, shorter equilibration time, and
   formation of surface films on the reactive materials in the columns. (C)

Abstract = {{A review of recent lightning channel corona sheath dynamics research is
   given. Current state of knowledge about corona sheath conductivity is
   presented and a brief discussion on the role of radially flowing corona
   current in longitudinal extension of the channel is given. It is shown
   that positive transferred charge inside the lightning channel core
   during the return-stroke stage dominates the total charge when the speed
   of the return stroke current wave is relatively low and the negative
   leader line charge density is less than typical values inferred from
   field measurements. As a result, the positive charge inside the channel
   during the return-stroke stage can be temporarily greater than the
   negative charge deposited by the preceding leader. This may explain
   significant positive overshoots in radial electric fields measured close
   to the lightning attachment point at ground. Consequences of adoption of
   corona current concept in the Lumped Current Source (LCS) type models
   are described, and duality between LCS type models and the Distributed
   Current Sources (DCS) type models is rigorously demonstrated.
   Additionally, we discuss the role of corona in making the return-stroke
   speed lower than the speed of light. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Detailed measurement of cell phenotype information from digital
   fluorescence images has the potential to greatly advance biomedicine in
   various disciplines such as patient diagnostics or drug screening. Yet,
   the complexity of cell conformations presents a major barrier preventing
   effective determination of cell boundaries, and introduces measurement
   error that propagates throughout subsequent assessment of cellular
   parameters and statistical analysis. State-of-the-art image segmentation
   techniques that require user-interaction, prolonged computation time and
   specialized training cannot adequately provide the support for high
   content platforms, which often sacrifice resolution to foster the speedy
   collection of massive amounts of cellular data. This work introduces a
   strategy that allows us to rapidly obtain accurate cell boundaries from
   digital fluorescent images in an automated format. Hence, this new
   method has broad applicability to promote biotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, inorganic nanostructures, such as fullerene-like MoS2
   and WS2 nanoparticles, have been shown to be promising candidates for
   friction and wear reduction in tribological applications. However, it
   has been demonstrated experimentally that the mechanical response of any
   given inorganic nanostructure varies depending on its individual
   structural characteristics such as size, shape, and crystallinity. Here,
   classical molecular dynamics simulations are performed that investigate
   the mechanical responses of different types of MoS2 nanostructures
   during uniaxial compression. The results illustrate the dependence of
   mechanical behavior on nanoparticle structure and, in particular,
   indicate that the mechanical properties of MoS2 nanostructures vary
   significantly with changes in the orientation of the MoS2 walls at the
   interface. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Band gap and structure of single crystal BiI3: Resolving discrepancies
   in literature}},

Abstract = {{Bismuth tri-iodide (BiI3) is an intermediate band gap semiconductor with
   potential for room temperature gamma-ray detection applications.
   Remarkably, very different band gap characteristics and values of BiI3
   have been reported in literature, which may be attributed to its
   complicated layered structure with strongly bound BiI6 octahedra held
   together by weak van der Waals interactions. Here, to resolve this
   discrepancy, the band gap of BiI3 was characterized through optical and
   computational methods and differences among previously reported values
   are discussed. Unpolarized transmittance and reflectance spectra in the
   visible to near ultraviolet (UV-Vis) range at room temperature yielded
   an indirect band gap of 1.67 +/- 0.09 eV, while spectroscopic
   ellipsometry detected a direct band gap at 1.96 +/- 0.05 eV and higher
   energy critical point features. The discrepancy between the UV-Vis and
   ellipsometry results originates from the low optical absorption
   coefficients (alpha similar to 10(2) cm(-1)) of BiI3 that renders
   reflection-based ellipsometry insensitive to the indirect gap for this
   material. Further, electronic-structure calculations of the band
   structure by density functional theory methods are also consistent with
   the presence of an indirect band gap of 1.55 eV in BiI3. Based on this,
   an indirect band gap with a value of 1.67 +/- 0.09 eV is considered to
   best represent the band gap structure and value for single crystal BiI3.

Abstract = {{A method is described for computing patient-specific absorbed dose rates
   to active marrow which accounts for spatial variation in bone volume
   fraction and marrow cellularity. A module has been added to the 3D Monte
   Carlo dosimetry program DPM to treat energy deposition in the components
   of bone spongiosa distinctly. Homogeneous voxels in regions containing
   bone spongiosa (as defined on CT images) are assumed to be comprised
   only of bone, active (red) marrow and inactive (yellow) marrow.
   Cellularities are determined from biopsy, and bone volume fractions are
   computed from cellularities and CT-derived voxel densities. Electrons
   are assumed to deposit energy locally in the three constituent
   components in proportions determined by electron energy absorption
   fractions which depend on energy, cellularity, and bone volume fraction,
   and which are either taken from the literature or are derived from Monte
   Carlo simulations using EGS5. Separate algorithms are used to model
   primary beta particles and secondary electrons generated after photon
   interactions. Treating energy deposition distinctly in bone spongiosa
   constituents leads to marrow dosimetry results which differ from
   homogeneous spongiosa dosimetry by up to 20\%. Dose rates in active
   marrow regions with cellularities of 20, 50, and 80\% can vary by up to
   20\%, and can differ by up to 10\% as a function of bone volume
   fraction. Dose to bone marrow exhibits a strong dependence on marrow
   cellularity and a potentially significant dependence on bone volume
   fraction.}},

Abstract = {{A four-node corotational quadrilateral elastoplastic shell element is
   presented. The local coordinate system of the element is defined by the
   two bisectors of the diagonal vectors generated from the four corner
   nodes and their cross product. This local coordinate system rotates
   rigidly with the element but does not deform with the element. As a
   result, the element rigid-body rotations are excluded in calculating the
   local nodal variables from the global nodal variables. The two smallest
   components of each nodal orientation vector are defined as rotational
   variables, leading to the desired additive property for all nodal
   variables in a nonlinear incremental solution procedure. Different from
   other existing corotational finite-element formulations, the resulting
   element tangent stiffness matrix is symmetric owing to the commutativity
   of the local nodal variables in calculating the second derivative of
   strains with respect to these variables. For elastoplastic analyses, the
   Maxwell-Huber-Hencky-von Mises yield criterion is employed, together
   with the backward-Euler return-mapping method, for the evaluation of the
   elastoplastic stress state; the consistent tangent modulus matrix is
   derived. To eliminate locking problems, we use the assumed strain
   method. Several elastic patch tests and elastoplastic plate/shell
   problems undergoing large deformation are solved to demonstrate the
   computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed formulation.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to understand the effects of friction and
   advection in the hydrodynamics of a two-inlet coastal lagoon, Santa
   Maria La Reforma, in Northwest Mexico. A vertically integrated numerical
   model is used to describe sea level variations and tidal currents, and
   to study the dynamics inside the system. Observed sea level and current
   measurements were used to calibrate the model. Results show a similar to
   90 min phase lag of the tidal signal in the center of the system with
   respect to both inlets. Tidal currents greater than 1.0 m s(-1) were
   recorded and modeled at both inlets. The sea level in the lagoon shows
   one-quarter of period of M-2 out of phase (similar to 3 h) with respect
   to the velocity. Bottom friction generated the greatest M-4 harmonic and
   largest tidal asymmetries at the narrowest section of the lagoon,
   similar to 35 km away from the inlets. The tidal momentum balance along
   the main axis of the lagoon was dominated by pressure gradient and
   friction, describing a quasi-standing tidal wave in currents and in
   amplitude. This behavior resulted from waves traveling in opposite
   directions from the two tidal inlets, causing constructive interference
   in elevation but destructive interference inflow. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by a number of motor and
   behavioral abnormalities that could be considered deficits of a ``no
   task{''} or ``resting{''} state, including resting motor findings and
   defects in emerging from a resting state (e.g., resting tremor, elevated
   resting tone, abulia, akinesia, apathy). PET imaging, and recently, the
   MRI technique of continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) have shown
   evidence of changes in metabolic patterns in individuals with PD. The
   purpose of this study was to learn if the presence of PD could be
   ``predicted{''} based on resting fluctuations of the BOLD signal.
   Participants were 15 healthy controls, 14 subjects with PD, and 1
   subject who presented as a control but later developed PD. The amplitude
   of the low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was used as an index of brain
   activity level in the resting state. Participants with PD using this
   index showed a reliable decrease in activity in a number of regions,
   including the supplementary motor cortex, the mesial prefrontal cortex,
   the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left cerebellum (lobule
   VII/VIII) as well as increased activity in the right cerebellum (lobule
   IV/V). Using a cross validation approach we term ``Reliability Mapping
   of Regional Differences{''} (RMRD) to analyze our sample, we were able
   to reliably distinguish participants with PD from controls with 92\%
   sensitivity and 87\% specificity. Our ``pre-diagnostic{''} subject
   segregated in our analysis with the PD group. These results suggest that
   resting fMRI should be considered for development as a biomarker and
   analytical tool for evaluation of PD. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfapyridine (SPY), two representative
   sulfonamide antibiotics, have attracted much attention recently because
   of their potential ecological risks. This work systematically
   investigated the adsorption characteristics of SMX and SPY on carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs), a newly introduced nano-adsorbent, under various
   physicochemical conditions. Laboratory batch adsorption experiments and
   mathematical models were used to determine the adsorption kinetics and
   isotherms of the two antibiotics to the CNTs. We found that SMX and SPY
   had very fast adsorption kinetics to the CNTs, which could be simulated
   with both the pseudo-second-order and the intraparticle diffusion
   models. These results suggest that the adsorption of the antibiotics to
   the CNTs were controlled by surface adsorption and intraparticle
   diffusion processes. Isotherm studies showed that sonication-aided
   dispersion slightly increased the adsorption of the antibiotics to the
   CNTs probably because the dispersion process might increase CNT surface
   area. When solution pH increased from 3.0 to 9.0, the Langmuir maximum
   sorption capacities of the antibiotics to the CNTs decreased from 98.0
   to 18.6mg/g (SMX) and from 108.6 to 83.2mg/g (SPY), indicating pH is a
   controlling factor of the removal of the two antibiotics in aqueous
   solutions. We also found that the Langmuir adsorption capacity of the
   CNTs decreased slightly for both SMX and SPY when more adsorbents were
   in the solution. The findings from this study suggest that CNTs can be
   used as a high efficiency adsorbent to removal antibiotics from aqueous

Abstract = {{An investigation of the recombination kinetics and the density of states
   distribution in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells was
   undertaken using impedance spectroscopy measurements under varying
   levels of illuminations. Three organic polymer solar cells were
   investigated which differed only by the p-type polymer used in the
   active layers while the device architecture and acceptor molecule
   (PC70BM) were kept the same. We found that the density of states
   profiles for the three cells are similar and can be superimposed by a
   horizontal shift due to a difference between the polymers' HOMO and the
   PC70BM's LUMO levels. The recombination mechanisms for the three cells
   showed the same behavior, suggesting an important role of the acceptor
   in this process however, large differences in the absolute value of
   carrier lifetime tau(eff) related to the choice of the polymer are
   evident, indicating that the recombination kinetics depends on a
   combination of the properties of both materials and the morphology of
   their blend.}},

Abstract = {{A Raman-pump frequency modulation scheme and an automated

   to the characterization of ultrafast energy transport in a copolymer
   comprised of polystyrene linked oligo(phenylene-ethynylene) donor and
   thio Phene benzothiadiazole acceptor chromophores. After photoexcitation
   of the donor, ultrafast energy transfer is monitored by the decay of
   donor vibrational modes and simultaneous growth of acceptor modes. The
   FM-FSRS method shows clear advantages in signal-to-noise noise levels,
   mitigation of artifact features, and ease of data processing over
   -ttheconventional FSRS technique.}},

Title = {{Development, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the simple SALUS
   crop model in DSSAT}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{260}},
Pages = {{62-76}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Simplified approaches to modeling crop growth and development have
   recently received more attention due to increased interest in applying
   crop models at large scales for various agricultural assessments. In
   this study, we integrated the simple version of SALUS (System Approach
   to Land Use Sustainability) crop model in the widely-used Decision
   Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to enhance the
   capability of DSSAT to simulate additional crops without requiring
   detailed parameterization. An uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was
   conducted using the integrated DSSAT-simple SALUS model to assess the
   variability in model outputs and crop parameter ranking in response to
   uncertainties associated with crop parameters required by the model. The
   influence of year, production level, and location on the effect of crop
   parameter uncertainty was also investigated.
   Parameter uncertainty resulted in a high variability in modeled outputs.
   Simulated potential above-ground biomass ranged from 1.2 t ha(-1) to 38
   t ha(-1) for maize and 4 t ha(-1) to 26.5 t ha(-1) for peanut and
   cotton, all locations and years considered. The degree of variability
   was dependent upon the production level, the location, the year, and the
   crop. Ranking of crop parameters was not significantly affected by the
   year of study but was strongly related to the production level,
   location, and crop. The model was not sensitive to parameters related to
   prediction of the timing of germination and emergence. The most
   influential parameters were related to leaf area index growth, crop
   duration, and thermal time accumulation. Findings from this study
   contributed to understanding the effects of crop parameter uncertainty
   on the model's outputs under different environmental conditions. (C)

Title = {{Is Granger Causality a Viable Technique for Analyzing fMRI Data?}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate neural data provide the basis for assessing interactions in
   brain networks. Among myriad connectivity measures, Granger causality
   (GC) has proven to be statistically intuitive, easy to implement, and
   generate meaningful results. Although its application to functional MRI
   (fMRI) data is increasing, several factors have been identified that
   appear to hinder its neural interpretability: (a) latency differences in
   hemodynamic response function (HRF) across different brain regions, (b)
   low-sampling rates, and (c) noise. Recognizing that in basic and
   clinical neuroscience, it is often the change of a dependent variable
   (e.g., GC) between experimental conditions and between normal and
   pathology that is of interest, we address the question of whether there
   exist systematic relationships between GC at the fMRI level and that at
   the neural level. Simulated neural signals were convolved with a
   canonical HRF, down-sampled, and noise-added to generate simulated fMRI
   data. As the coupling parameters in the model were varied, fMRI GC and
   neural GC were calculated, and their relationship examined. Three main
   results were found: (1) GC following HRF convolution is a monotonically
   increasing function of neural GC; (2) this monotonicity can be reliably
   detected as a positive correlation when realistic fMRI temporal
   resolution and noise level were used; and (3) although the detectability
   of monotonicity declined due to the presence of HRF latency differences,
   substantial recovery of detectability occurred after correcting for
   latency differences. These results suggest that Granger causality is a
   viable technique for analyzing fMRI data when the questions are
   appropriately formulated.}},

Abstract = {{Biological interactions are often uncertain events, that may or may not
   take place with some probability. This uncertainty leads to a massive
   number of alternative interaction topologies for each such network. The
   existing studies analyze the degree distribution of biological networks
   by assuming that all the given interactions take place under all
   circumstances. This strong and often incorrect assumption can lead to
   misleading results. In this paper, we address this problem and develop a
   sound mathematical basis to characterize networks in the presence of
   uncertain interactions. Using our mathematical representation, we
   develop a method that can accurately describe the degree distribution of
   such networks. We also take one more step and extend our method to
   accurately compute the joint-degree distributions of node pairs
   connected by edges. The number of possible network topologies grows
   exponentially with the number of uncertain interactions. However, the
   mathematical model we develop allows us to compute these degree
   distributions in polynomial time in the number of interactions. Our
   method works quickly even for entire protein-protein interaction (PPI)
   networks. It also helps us find an adequate mathematical model using
   MLE. We perform a comparative study of node-degree and joint-degree
   distributions in two types of biological networks: the classical
   deterministic networks and the more flexible probabilistic networks. Our
   results confirm that power-law and log-normal models best describe
   degree distributions for both probabilistic and deterministic networks.
   Moreover, the inverse correlation of degrees of neighboring nodes shows
   that, in probabilistic networks, nodes with large number of interactions
   prefer to interact with those with small number of interactions more
   frequently than expected. We also show that probabilistic networks are
   more robust for node-degree distribution computation than the
   deterministic ones. Availability: all the data sets used, the software
   implemented and the alignments found in this paper are available at

Abstract = {{This paper investigates freeway capacity before and during incidents.
   Data were obtained for approximately 1 year from five freeway facilities
   in North America. The data included flows, speeds, weather conditions,
   as well as incident information (location, duration, and lanes
   affected). Maximum throughput-related values were obtained to estimate
   capacity under non-incident conditions as well as under incident
   conditions. Under non-incident conditions, the data indicate that
   three-lane freeways are the most efficient in terms of per lane
   capacity. Measurements of capacity during incident conditions are
   provided by type of facility and number of lanes affected. These
   capacities are compared to values reported in previous research. Next,
   two sets of multiple linear regression models were developed to estimate
   the capacity under incident conditions and the capacity reduction (i.e.
   the difference between capacity under non-incident conditions and
   capacity under incident conditions) during incidents. Each of the two
   sets of models is developed for the three sites combined and for the
   Portland site on its own (because it has detailed information on the
   number of lanes blocked by incidents), based on factors such as the
   incident category, and the total number of lanes.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells based on low bandgap
   polymer:fullerene blends are promising for next generation low-cost
   photovoltaics. While these solution-processed solar cells are compatible
   with large-scale roll-to-roll processing, active layers used for typical
   laboratory-scale devices are too thin to ensure high manufacturing
   yields. Furthermore, due to the limited light absorption and optical
   interference within the thin active layer, the external quantum
   efficiencies (EQEs) of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells are
   severely limited. In order to produce polymer solar cells with high
   yields, efficient solar cells with a thick active layer must be
   demonstrated. In this work, the performance of thick-film solar cells
   employing the low-bandgap polymer
   poly(dithienogermole-thienopyrrolodione) (PDTG-TPD) was demonstrated.
   Power conversion efficiencies over 8.0\% were obtained for devices with
   an active layer thickness of 200 nm, illustrating the potential of this
   polymer for large-scale manufacturing. Although an average EQE > 65\%
   was obtained for devices with active layer thicknesses > 200 nm, the
   cell performance could not be maintained due to a reduction in fill
   factor. By comparing our results for PDTG-TPD solar cells with similar
   P3HT-based devices, we investigated the loss mechanisms associated with
   the limited device performance observed for thick-film low-bandgap
   polymer solar cells.}},

   instantaneous frequency]. This approach allows for detecting boat wakes

   strong broad-banded wind-wave background. Time-frequency methods also
   open a new direction for the statistical description of wakes, which are
   applicable to the characterization of the wake climate (e.g., for sites

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{As climate changes, temperatures will play an increasing role in
   determining crop yield. Both climate model error and lack of constrained
   physiological thresholds limit the predictability of yield. We used a
   perturbed-parameter climate model ensemble with two methods of
   bias-correction as input to a regional-scale wheat simulation model over
   India to examine future yields. This model configuration accounted for
   uncertainty in climate, planting date, optimization, temperature-induced
   changes in development rate and reproduction. It also accounts for
   lethal temperatures, which have been somewhat neglected to date. Using
   uncertainty decomposition, we found that fractional uncertainty due to
   temperature-driven processes in the crop model was on average larger
   than climate model uncertainty (0.56 versus 0.44), and that the crop
   model uncertainty is dominated by crop development. Simulations with the
   raw compared to the bias-corrected climate data did not agree on the
   impact on future wheat yield, nor its geographical distribution. However
   the method of bias-correction was not an important source of
   uncertainty. We conclude that bias-correction of climate model data and
   improved constraints on especially crop development are critical for
   robust impact predictions.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},

Abstract = {{Mobile sensor networks (MSNs) have been widely deployed to provide a
   ubiquitous solution to real-time monitoring applications such as traffic
   data collection in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), ocean data
   collection in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs), and biodata collection
   in wireless body area networks (WBANs). One major issue for designing
   MSNs is the energy-validity trade-off, that is, the trade-off between
   the energy efficiency for mobile sensors (MSs) and the validity of
   sensing reports. In this article, we propose a novel mechanism,
   Energy-Efficient Distributedly Controlled Reporting ((EDCR)-D-2), to
   mitigate the energy consumption for MSs in real-time monitoring
   applications while keeping the sensing report valid. In this mechanism,
   we design dynamic sleeping adjustment (DSA) algorithms to adjust an MS's
   sleeping period using a heuristic method to reduce energy consumption.
   We provide analytical models to evaluate the performance of (EDCR)-D-2
   in terms of the power savings and report validity. It has been shown
   that with (EDCR)-D-2, MSs can report with less energy consumption while
   satisfying delay constraints for real-time monitoring applications.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: We sought to describe the response of the polymer surface of
   drug-eluting stents (DES) to delivery balloon expansion, including
   quantitation of any resulting detached microparticles.
   Methods and results: We expanded the US Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA)-approved first- and second-generation DES in a vacuum filtration
   system and used optical and scanning electron microscopy to image the
   polymer surface, filters and delivery balloons. DES were expanded under
   a range of conditions, from in vitro conditions used for FDA regulatory
   submissions to human in vivo conditions. Dispersive Raman spectroscopy
   was used for definitive identification of microparticles. All polymer
   surfaces were topographically disturbed over an average of 4.6\%-100\%
   of the surface area imaged. Disturbances ranged from deformation
   (including peeling) to complete delamination. The dimensions of detached
   microparticles were 2-350 mu m. The extent and nature of surface
   disturbances and microparticles were primarily a function of polymer
   composition (p<0.001 for 8/10 disturbance types/locations) and were
   independent of expansion condition (p=0.100 to 0.989 for 9/10
   disturbance types/locations).
   Conclusions: Balloon expansion of first- and second-generation DES
   disturbs the polymer surface and can cause detachment of microparticles;
   each is functionally related to the specific polymer but not to
   expansion condition. Disturbance ``roughness{''} and detached
   microparticles may contribute to DES limitations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a method to impart spatially defined magnetic

   Differing from prior investigations on magnetic patterning, a single

   magnetizing heads. Arrays of 250-mu m-wide and 125-mu m-wide magnetic
   stripes with alternating out-of-plane polarity (perpendicular
   magnetization) are patterned in a 10-mu m-thick Co-rich Co-Pt alloy
   (Co80Pt20) film using three different microstructured, 2-mm-thick, Fe-Co
   magnetizing heads and pulsed magnetic fields ranging from 0.1 to 1 T. A
   magneto-optical imaging film is used to view the magnetization patterns
   at the surface of the Co-Pt film. Scanning Hall probe measurements of
   the resulting magnetic structures indicate a similar to 5 mT peak
   magnetic field 100 mu m above the surface which compares favorably with
   numerical simulations of the field patterns at the same height.}},

Abstract = {{As a final polishing step, photocatalytic oxidation of anaerobically and

   titanium dioxide (TiO2) coated reusable sheets (TiO2 loading similar to
   3 mg/cm(2)), activated by UV (180 nm) light, for simultaneous reduction
   of organics and decolorization. Experiments were performed to study the
   effect of initial soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), pH and depth of
   the wastewater treated in the photoreactor setup. Organic concentration
   of 3000 mg sCOD/L in anaerobically digested effluent was an obstacle for
   efficient photocatalytic treatment. Therefore, anaerobically digested
   stillage was further treated in an aerobic biological process to reduce
   sCOD to 1350 mg/L. There was very little decolorization (similar to
   25\%) at a pH of 9 or above. But on adjusting and maintaining the pH at
   neutral value the extent of color removal via photocatalysis was 91.3\%,
   91.5\% and 77\% after 22, 55 and 80.5 hours for 1, 3 and 5 mm depths of

Abstract = {{The longitudinal aerodynamics of micro aerial vehicles, although not
   fully understood, have been the subject of several studies in recent
   years; however, little work has been done to investigate the lateral
   loading. In this experiment, flat-plate wings with rectangular planforms
   of aspect ratios AR = 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 3 and tapered planforms of
   lambda = 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 were placed in the wind tunnel at a
   Reynolds numbers of 7.5 x 10(4). Angle-of-attack sweeps were performed
   at sideslip angles of beta = 0, -5, -10, -15, 20 and -35 deg, and the
   side force, yaw moment, and roll moment were measured. Although the side
   force and yaw moment coefficients (C-SF and C-n) were typically
   negligible, the roll moment coefficient C-l was found to increase
   linearly with angle of attack before stalling in a manner reminiscent of
   a lift curve. This ``roll stall{''}, which has not previously been
   observed for micro-aerial-vehicle-type wings, is attributed to the
   upstream tip vortex creating an additional lift component due to its
   impact on the spanwise variation of effective angle of attack in
   addition to the force generated by its own low-pressure core. As the
   downstream tip vortex is convected away from the wing, a net moment is
   created. Computations of the roll-stability derivative indicate that a
   micro aerial vehicle in equilibrium flight conditions may experience
   magnitudes of C-l,C-beta at the upper limit of, or even above, the range
   of -0.10 <= C-l,C-beta <= 0 considered to represent good handling
   qualities in aircraft.}},

   factorization for subsequent systems. Requiring MATLAB users to find the
   best factorization method on their own can lead to suboptimal choices;
   even MATLAB experts can make the wrong choice. Furthermore, naive MATLAB
   users have a tendency to translate mathematical expressions from linear
   algebra directly into MATLAB, so that x = A(-1)b becomes the inferior
   yet all-to-prevalent x=inv(A){*}b. To address these issues, an
   object-oriented FACTORIZE method is presented. Via simple-to-use
   operator overloading, solving two linear systems can be written as
   F=factorize(A); x=F\textbackslash{}b; y=F\textbackslash{}c, where A is
   factorized only once. The selection of the best factorization method
   (LU, Cholesky, LDLT, QR, or a complete orthogonal decomposition for
   rank-deficient matrices) is hidden from the user. The mathematical
   expression x = A(-1)b directly translates into the MATLAB expression
   x=inverse(A){*}b, which does not compute the inverse at all, but does
   the right thing by factorizing A and solving the corresponding
   triangular systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a game in which players can customize the behavior
   of their characters using their own movements while playing the game.
   Players' movements are recorded with a motion capture system. The player
   then labels the movements and uses them as input to a machine learning
   algorithm that generates a responsive behavior model. This interface
   supports a more embodied approach to character design that we call
   ``Customizing by Doing{''}. We present a user study which shows that
   using their own movements made the users feel more engaged with the game
   and the design process, due in large part to a feeling of personal
   ownership of the movement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of high energy proton irradiation dose on dc performance as

   high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were investigated to evaluate
   the feasibility of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs for space applications, which need to
   stand a variety of irradiations. The HEMTs were irradiated with protons
   at a fixed energy of 5 MeV and doses ranging from 10(9) to 2 X 10(14)
   cm(-2). For the dc characteristics, there was only minimal degradation
   of saturation drain current (I-DSS), transconductance (g(m)), electron
   mobility, and sheet carrier concentration at doses below 2 x 10(13)
   cm(-2), while the reduction of these parameters were 15\%, 9\%, 41\% and
   16.6\%, respectively, at a dose of 2 x 10(14) cm(-2). At this same dose
   condition, increases of 37\% in drain breakdown voltage (V-BR) and of
   45\% in critical voltage (V-cri) were observed. The improvements of
   drain breakdown voltage and critical voltage were attributed to the
   modification of the depletion region due to the introduction of a higher
   density of defects after irradiation at a higher dose. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{This paper describes the results of a study examining the flow field and
   acoustic characteristics of a Mach 1.5 ideally expanded supersonic jet
   impinging on a flat surface and its control using steady microjets.
   Emphasis is placed on two conditions of nozzle to plate distances (h/d),
   of which one corresponds to where the microjet based active flow control
   is very effective in reducing flow unsteadiness and near-field acoustics
   and the other has minimal effectiveness. Measurements include unsteady
   pressures, nearfield acoustics using microphone and particle image
   velocimetry. The nearfield noise and unsteady pressure spectra at both
   h/d show discrete high amplitude impinging tones, which in one case (h/d
   = 4) are significantly reduced with control but in the other case (h/d =
   4.5) remain unaffected. The particle image velocimetry measurements,
   both time-averaged and phase-averaged, were used to better understand
   the basic characteristics of the impinging jet flow field especially the
   role of coherent vortical structures in the noise generation and
   control. The results show that the flow field corresponding to the case
   of least control effectiveness comprise well defined, coherent, and
   symmetrical vortical structures and may require higher levels of
   microjet pressure supply for noise suppression when compared to the flow
   field more responsive to control (h/d = 4) which shows less organized,
   competing (symmetrical and helical) instabilities. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{Multistatic active sonar systems involve the transmission and reception
   of multiple probing sequences and can achieve significantly enhanced
   performance of target detection and localization through exploiting
   spatial diversity. This paper mainly focuses on two signal processing
   aspects of such systems, namely, enhanced range-Doppler imaging and
   improved target parameter estimation. The main contributions of this
   paper are (1) a hybrid dense-sparse method is proposed to generate
   range-Doppler images with both low sidelobe levels and high accuracy;
   (2) a generalized K-Means clustering (GKC) method for target association
   is developed to associate the range measurements from different
   transmitter-receiver pairs, which is actually a range fitting procedure;
   (3) the extended invariance principle-based weighted least-squares
   method is developed for accurate target position and velocity
   estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed multistatic active sonar
   signal processing techniques is verified using numerical examples. (C)

Abstract = {{Mobility model and network topology play important roles in mobile ad
   hoc networks (MANETs). Most existing trust and reputation management
   systems in a MANET do not address mobility issues adequately. In this
   paper, we study the trust management problem in a MANET with cyclic
   movement patterns. In a cyclic MANET (cMANET) where nodes periodically
   move, we formulate trust management problems and propose the cTrust
   scheme to handle trust establishment and aggregation issues. Unlike
   trust management in conventional schemes, trust management in cMANET
   involves not only neighbor trust relationships but location and time
   factors as well. We model trust relations as a trust graph in cMANET to
   enhance accuracy and efficiency of trust establishment among nodes.
   Leveraging the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm and stochastic Markov
   chain process for fast and lightweight aggregation of trust scores, the
   cTrust scheme is a decentralized and self-configurable trust aggregation
   scheme. To evaluate the performance, we implement the proposed cTrust
   scheme. We use the student contact patterns on the National University
   of Singapore (NUS) campus and Seattle metro bus traces as case studies
   for our cMANET communication model. The simulation results demonstrate
   the features of trust relationship dissemination in real environments
   and the efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and robustness of the cTrust
   scheme. With increasing scales of ad hoc networks and complexities of
   trust topologies, cTrust scales well with marginal overheads.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents microfabrication methods and performance analysis of
   bonded powder permanent magnets targeting dimensions ranging from 10 mu
   m to greater than 1 mm. For the structural definition and pattern
   transfer, a doctor blade technique is used to dry press magnetic powders
   into pre-etched cavities in a silicon substrate. The powders are secured
   in the cavities by one of the three methods: capping with a polyimide
   layer, thermal reflow of intermixed wax-binder particles, or conformal
   coating with a vapor-deposited parylene-C film. A systematic study of
   micromagnets fabricated using these methods is conducted using three
   different types of magnetic powders: 50 mu m Nd-Fe-B, 5 mu m Nd-Fe-B and
   1 mu m barium ferrite powder. The isotropic magnets are shown to exhibit
   intrinsic coercivities (H-ci) as high as 720 kA m(-1), remanences (B-r)
   up to 0.5 T and maximum energy products (BHmax) up to 30 kJ m(-3),
   depending on the magnetic powder used. Process compatibility experiments
   demonstrate the potential for the magnets to withstand typical
   microfabrication chemical exposure and thermal cycles, thereby
   facilitating their integration into more complex process flows. The
   remanences are also characterized at elevated temperatures to determine
   thermal sensitivities and maximum operating temperature ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of C-60 polyhydroxyfullerenes (PHF) prepared in
   alkaline media, preparation facilitated by phase-transfer catalyst,
   presents challenges in determining the chemical structure resulting from
   the possibility of multiple isomers or analogs with greater or fewer
   hydroxyl groups from a single reaction mixture. This paper presents the
   utilization of analytical methods employed in tandem, especially X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for semi-quantitative analysis
   on the number of hydroxyl groups present in PHF. Capillary
   Electrophoresis was used for purity estimation of the material. Multiple
   spectra and electropherograms were analyzed using a new simultaneous
   curve fitting method. The most accurate estimate of hydroxyl groups for
   C-60 polyhydroxy fullerenes obtained is between 16 and 18 allylic
   hydroxyl groups by combining analytical methods' results with 5 \%
   accuracy. High precision (reproducibility) of the experiments is
   observed. Purity of 98 \% is estimated by capillary electrophoresis. The
   size of PHF nanoparticles or aggregates has been determined by atomic
   force microscopy to be 7.4-14.2 nm. According to the elemental analysis
   the average probable empirical formula for the most pure PHF at pH 7.1
   is C60O17H12Na5(NaHCO3)(3)(H2O)(13) and the average formula weight is
   1,605.9 g/mol. This is the first thorough characterization of PHF in
   terms of purity.}},

Abstract = {{Pavement top-down cracking performance not only depends on pavement
   layer material characteristics, but also on layer interface conditions.
   Interface conditions involve both the shear resistance along the
   interface and the cracking resistance across the interface provided by
   the interface bonding agents. Regarding hot-mix asphalt (BMA), currently
   available tests are mainly focused on pavement layer material
   properties. When thick polymer modified asphalt emulsion (PMAE) was
   applied at the interface between an open-graded friction course (OGFC)
   and a dense graded structural layer, a bonded interface was formed by
   the migration of PMAE up into the OGFC air voids. Shear strength tests,
   which can well characterize the adhesive film effect of interface
   bonding agents, cannot fully capture the effect of bonded interface on
   pavement cracking performance. To simulate the crack initiation and
   propagation process and evaluate the effect of bonded interface
   conditions on top-down cracking performance, a composite specimen
   interface cracking (CSIC) test was developed. The developed system
   involves repeated tensile loading and monitoring of the rate of damage
   development (reduction in stiffness) on composite specimens specifically
   designed for this purpose. Number of loading cycles to failure and
   damage rate results from the proposed test on three different interface
   conditions clearly indicate that this test method can be used to
   optimize bonding agents and application rates for enhanced cracking
   performance. This method may also provide a suitable specification test
   for evaluation of interface conditions on reflective cracking
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Individual muscle activation patterns may be controlled by
   motor modules constructed by the central nervous system to simplify
   motor control. This study compared modular control of gait between
   persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) and neurologically-healthy older
   adults (HOA) and investigated relationships between modular organization
   and gait parameters in persons with PD.
   Methods: Fifteen persons with idiopathic PD and fourteen HOA
   participated. Electromyographic recordings were made from eight leg
   muscles bilaterally while participants walked at their preferred walking
   speed for 10 min on an instrumented treadmill. Non-negative matrix
   factorization techniques decomposed the electromyographic signals,
   identifying the number and nature of modules accounting for 95\% of
   variability in muscle activations during treadmill walking.
   Results: Generally, fewer modules were required to reconstruct muscle
   activation patterns during treadmill walking in PD compared to HOA (p <
   .05). Control of knee flexor and ankle plantar flexor musculature was
   simplified in PD. Activation timing was altered in PD while muscle
   weightings were unaffected. Simplified neuromuscular control was related
   to decreased walking speed in PD.
   Conclusion: Neuromuscular control of gait is simplified in PD and may
   contribute to gait deficits in this population.
   Significance: Future studies of locomotor rehabilitation in PD should
   consider neuromuscular complexity to maximize intervention
   effectiveness. (c) 2013 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{The precise control of spiking in a population of neurons via applied
   electrical stimulation is a challenge due to the sparseness of spiking
   responses and neural system plasticity. We pose neural stimulation as a
   system control problem where the system input is a multidimensional
   time-varying signal representing the stimulation, and the output is a
   set of spike trains; the goal is to drive the output such that the
   elicited population spiking activity is as close as possible to some
   desired activity, where closeness is defined by a cost function. If the
   neural system can be described by a time-invariant (homogeneous) model,
   then offline procedures can be used to derive the control procedure;
   however, for arbitrary neural systems this is not tractable.
   Furthermore, standard control methodologies are not suited to directly
   operate on spike trains that represent both the target and elicited
   system response. In this paper, we propose a multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) adaptive inverse control scheme that operates on
   spike trains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The control
   scheme uses an inverse controller to approximate the inverse of the
   neural circuit. The proposed control system takes advantage of the
   precise timing of the neural events by using a Schoenberg kernel defined
   directly in the space of spike trains. The Schoenberg kernel maps the
   spike train to an RKHS and allows linear algorithm to control the
   nonlinear neural system without the danger of converging to local
   minima. During operation, the adaptation of the controller minimizes a
   difference defined in the spike train RKHS between the system and the
   target response and keeps the inverse controller close to the inverse of
   the current neural circuit, which enables adapting to neural
   perturbations. The results on a realistic synthetic neural circuit show
   that the inverse controller based on the Schoenberg kernel outperforms
   the decoding accuracy of other models based on the conventional rate
   representation of neural signal (i.e., spikernel and generalized linear
   model). Moreover, after a significant perturbation of the neuron
   circuit, the control scheme can successfully drive the elicited
   responses close to the original target responses.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simplified model of corona discharge for the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computations has been applied to
   the analysis of transient voltages across insulators of a transmission
   line struck by lightning. In the simulation, three 60-m towers,
   separated by 200 m, with one overhead ground wire and three-phase
   conductors are employed. The progression of corona streamers from the
   ground wire is represented as the radial expansion of cylindrical
   conducting region around the wire. On the basis of the computed results,
   the effect of corona discharge at the ground wire on transient insulator
   voltages is examined. The insulator voltages are reduced by corona
   discharge on the ground wire. The reduction of insulator-voltage peak
   due to the ground-wire corona is not very significant: the upper-,
   middle-, and lower-phase-voltage peaks are reduced by 15, 14, and 13\%
   for a positive stroke with 50-kA-peak and 3-mu s-risetime current, and
   those for the negative stroke with the same current waveform parameters

   key result is that only a small percentage of homes are large

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy has the potential to significantly aid in the
   research and diagnosis of cancer. The information dense, complex spectra
   generate massive datasets in which subtle correlations may provide
   critical clues for biological analysis and pathological classification.
   Therefore, implementing advanced data mining techniques is imperative
   for complete, rapid and accurate spectral processing. Numerous recent
   studies have employed various data methods to Raman spectra for
   classification and biochemical analysis. Although, as Raman datasets
   from biological specimens are often characterized by high dimensionality
   and low sample numbers, many of these classification models are subject
   to overfitting. Furthermore, attempts to reduce dimensionality result in
   transformed feature spaces making the biological evaluation of
   significant and discriminative spectral features problematic. We have
   developed a novel data mining framework optimized for Raman datasets,
   called Fisher-based Feature Selection Support Vector Machines (FFS-SVM).
   This framework provides simultaneous supervised classification and
   user-defined Fisher criterion-based feature selection, reducing
   overfitting and directly yielding significant wavenumbers from the
   original feature space. Herein, we investigate five cancerous and
   non-cancerous breast cell lines using Raman microspectroscopy and our
   unique FFS-SVM framework. Our framework classification performance is
   then compared to several other frequently employed classification
   methods on four classification tasks. The four tasks were constructed by
   an unsupervised clustering method yielding the four different categories
   of cell line groupings (e.g. cancer vs non-cancer) studied. FFS-SVM
   achieves both high classification accuracies and the extraction of
   biologically significant features. The top ten most discriminative
   features are discussed in terms of cell-type specific biological
   relevance. Our framework provides comprehensive cellular level
   characterization and could potentially lead to the discovery of cancer
   biomarker-type information, which we have informally termed Raman-based
   spectral biomarkers'. The FFS-SVM framework along with Raman
   spectroscopy will be used in future studies to investigate in-situ
   dynamic biological phenomena. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{In this work, the potential of invasive plant species as feedstock for
   value-added products (biochar and bioenergy) through pyrolysis was
   investigated. The product yield rates of two major invasive species in
   the US, Brazilian Pepper (BP) and Air Potato (AP), were compared to that
   of two traditional feedstock materials, water oak and energy cane. Three
   pyrolysis temperatures (300, 450, and 600 degrees C) and four feedstock
   masses (10, 15, 20, and 25 g) were tested for a total of 12 experimental
   conditions. AP had high biochar and low oil yields, while BP had a high
   oil yield. At lower temperatures, the minimum feedstock residence time
   for biochar and bioenergy production increased at a faster rate as
   feedstock weight increased than it did at higher temperatures. A simple
   mathematical model was successfully developed to describe the
   relationship between feedstock weight and the minimum residence time.

Abstract = {{Tidal variability of lateral advection of momentum (vu(y), where u and v
   are along-estuary and lateral flows, respectively, and the subindex
   indicates differentiation with respect to the cross-estuary direction)
   was investigated in a coastal plain estuary with observations at Hampton
   Roads, which is the transition between the James River and Chesapeake
   Bay. Towed current velocity profiles and hydrographic profiles were
   captured during 9 expeditions in 2004 and 2005, to determine the
   intratidal and spatial changes in lateral advection of momentum and its
   contribution to along-channel flow. Curvature effects and lateral
   density gradients were important in driving lateral circulation and in
   modifying intratidal lateral advection of momentum. Lateral advection
   had the same order of magnitude as the baroclinic pressure gradient. Its
   contribution to the along-channel momentum balance was greatest during
   or just after peak flood and weakest at the end of ebb. During peak
   flood and peak ebb, the spatial distribution of vu(y) was seaward at the
   southern (left) side near surface and at the northern side (right) near
   bed (looking up-estuary), and landward in the rest of the channel.
   During slack periods the vu(y) structures were mostly landward.
   Observations were in good agreement with analytical model results during
   peak ebb and flood, but inconsistent during slack periods. The
   discrepancies between model results and field measurements can be
   attributed to bathymetry density gradient interactions, which enhanced
   ebb-to-flood asymmetries in the along-channel and lateral flow.

Abstract = {{In this letter, near-surface and root-zone soil moisture (RZSM), land
   surface temperature (LST), leaf area index, and vegetation water content
   were simulated at different spatial scales for three land cover types in
   North Central Florida under dynamic vegetation conditions. Insights into
   expected retrieval errors in soil moisture (SM) due to assumptions of
   static landscape were obtained from differences in the estimates using
   the static and dynamic land covers. Maximum differences of about 0.04
   m(3) / m(3) in near-surface SM and RZSM, and 5.1 K in LST were observed
   between estimates obtained over the vegetated and bare-soil regions
   during dry-soil conditions. During wet conditions, the maximum
   differences in near-surface SM and RZSM increased to about 0.05 m(3) /
   m(3), while those in LST decreased to 3.6 K. The RZSM simulations
   generated at the two resolutions of 200 m and 10 km were used to
   implement an upscaling algorithm based on averaging, to illustrate the
   use of the synthetic data set for upscaling studies. This letter
   highlights the importance of simulating land surface states at multiple

Pages = {{1659-1673}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to study metrics suitable for assessing
   uncertainty of power spectra when these are based on finite second-order
   statistics. The family of power spectra which is consistent with a given
   range of values for the estimated statistics represents the uncertainty
   set about the ``true{''} power spectrum. Our aim is to quantify the size
   of this uncertainty set using suitable notions of distance, and in
   particular, to compute the diameter of the set since this represents an
   upper bound on the distance between any choice of a nominal element in
   the set and the ``true{''} power spectrum. Since the uncertainty set may
   contain power spectra with lines and discontinuities, it is natural to
   quantify distances in the weak topology-the topology defined by
   continuity of moments. We provide examples of such weakly continuous
   metrics and focus on particular metrics for which we can explicitly
   quantify spectral uncertainty. We then consider certain high resolution
   techniques which utilize filter-banks for preprocessing, and compute
   worst case a priori uncertainty bounds solely on the basis of the filter
   dynamics. This allows the a priori tuning of the filter-banks for
   improved resolution over selected frequency bands.}},

   Priestley-Taylor, Hargreaves and Ritchie. The performances of the
   different SVM and ANFIS models were evaluated by comparing the
   corresponding values of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute
   error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (r). The drawn conclusions
   confirmed that the SVM and ANFIS models could provide more accurate ETC
   estimates than the empirical equations. Overall, the minimum RMSE (0.042
   mm/day) and MAE (0.031 mm/day) values and the maximum r value (0.98)
   were obtained using the SVM model with mean air temperature, relative
   humidity, solar radiation, sunshine hours and wind speed as inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Pain sometimes has a throbbing, pulsating quality, particularly when it
   is severe and disabling. We recently challenged the presumption that
   this throbbing quality is a sensory experience of arterial pulsations,
   but were unable to offer an alternative explanation for its rhythmic
   character. Here we report a case study of a woman with a history of
   daily headache consistent with the diagnosis of chronic migraine, but
   whose throbbing quality persisted long after the resolution of the
   headache. This chronic, daily, and persistent throbbing sensation, in
   the absence of headache pain, prompted closer examination for its
   neurophysiological correlate. By simultaneously recording the subjective
   report of the throbbing rhythm, arterial pulse, and high-density
   electroencephalogram, we found that the subjective throbbing rate (48
   +/- 1.7 beats per minute) and heart rate (68 +/- 2 beats per minute)
   were distinct, in accord with our previous observations that the 2 are
   unrelated. On spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram, we found
   that the overall amount of activity in the alpha range (8 to 12 Hz), or
   alpha power, increased in association with greater throbbing intensity.
   In addition, we also found that the rhythmic oscillations of overall
   alpha power, the so-called modulations of alpha power, coincided with
   the timing of the throbbing rhythm, and that this synchrony, or
   coherence, was proportional to the subjective intensity of the throbbing
   quality. This index case will motivate further studies whose aim is to
   determine whether modulations of alpha power could more generally
   represent a neurophysiological correlate of the throbbing quality of
   pain. (C) 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Abstract = {{Typically, aggregate gradation is selected to meet Superpave mix design
   specification; however, many Superpave mixtures have exhibited deficient
   field performance. The porosity of the dominant aggregate size range
   (DASR), which is the primary structural network of aggregates, has been
   extensively validated as a tool to evaluate coarse aggregate structure
   of laboratory and field asphalt mixtures. Mixtures identified by the
   system as having poor or marginal gradations resulted in poor rutting
   resistance. This study focused on how asphalt mixture performance is
   affected by changes in interstitial component (IC), which is the
   material between DASR particles. Laboratory testing clearly showed that
   IC characteristics may have a significant effect on rutting and cracking
   performance of mixtures. The disruption factor (DF) was developed to
   evaluate the potential of IC aggregates to disrupt the DASR structure.
   DF satisfactorily distinguished poor performing mixtures; therefore, it
   may eventually be used in combination with DASR porosity as a design
   parameter for rutting and cracking resistant asphalt mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Motion planning determines trajectories for vehicles that link an
   initial location and heading with a final location and heading.
   Techniques for motion planning have been developed for two-dimensional
   maneuvering; however, they are less mature for three-dimensional
   maneuvering. The concept of motion primitives is particularly attractive
   for motion planning that determines trajectories as a set of maneuvers
   that satisfy differential constraints. This paper furthers work on a
   higher-level abstraction of trajectory primitives that consider
   sequences of motion primitives. In this paper, trajectory primitives are
   developed that deal with airspace constraints of an environment. The
   motion planning is shown to be an optimization involving a pair of
   trajectory primitives that is related by an intermediate waypoint. The
   resulting path is completely parameterized by the waypoint location.}},

Abstract = {{Studies concerning the influence of fluidizing air on the gas-solid flow
   that occurs when a high-speed jet is injected into a fluidized bed have
   been limited to the measurement and analysis of mean velocity profiles.
   This study presents Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements and
   analysis of the change in the fluctuations of both gas and particle
   phase velocities inside the jet plume region with change in the
   fluidized state of the emulsion. It is observed that there is a small
   decrease in the fluctuating intensity in both phases upon increasing the
   fluidization velocity from 0 to 0.7 times minimum fluidization. However,
   increasing the fluidization rate (distributor gas flow rate) beyond
   minimum fluidization significantly increases the intensity of velocity
   fluctuations in both phases. A qualitative explanation based on the
   coupling that occurs between the two phases through the mean flow
   variables is proposed to explain the observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Prevalent three-dimensional scaffolds for bone tissue engineering are
   mineralized collagen-hydroxyapatite (Col/HA) composites. Conventional
   mineralization techniques are either to coat collagen scaffold surfaces
   with minerals or to simply mix collagen and mineral nanoparticles
   together. These conventional in vitro collagen mineralization methods
   are different from the in vivo bone formation process and often result
   in scaffolds that are not suitable for bone tissue engineering. In this
   study, a unique perfusion-flow (i.e., dynamic) in conjunction with a
   previously described polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) method was
   used to fabricate a porous Col/HA composite. The dynamic flow emulated
   the physiological extracellular fluid flow containing the mineralization
   ions, while the PILP method facilitated the deposition of the HA
   crystals within the collagen fibrils (i.e., intrafibrillar
   mineralization). By utilizing a dynamic PILP technique to mimic the in
   vivo bone formation process, the resultant Col/HA composite has a
   similar structure and compositions like human trabecular bone. A
   comparison of the dynamic and static mineralization methods revealed
   that the novel dynamic technique facilitates more efficient and
   homogenous mineral deposition throughout the Col/HA composite. The
   dynamic intrafibrillar mineralization method generated stiff Col/HA
   composites with excellent surface property for cell attachment and
   growth. The human mesenchymal stem cells cultured on the Col/HA
   composites quickly remodeled the scaffolds and resulted in constructs
   with an extensive cell-derived extracellular matrix network.}},

Abstract = {{The regeneration of functional, clinically viable, tissues from
   acellular ex vivo tissues has been problematic largely due to poor
   nutrient transport conditions that limit cell migration and integration.
   Compounding these issues are subcellular pore sizes that necessarily
   requires extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in order for cells to
   migrate and regenerate the tissue. The aim of the present work was to
   create a directed growth environment that allows cells to fully populate
   an ex vivo-derived vascular scaffold and maintain viability over
   extended periods. Three different culture conditions using single (one
   nutrient source) or dual perfusion bioreactor systems (two nutrients
   sources) were designed to assess the effect of pressure and nutrient
   gradients under either low (50/30mmHg) or high (120/80) relative
   pressure conditions. Human myofibroblasts were seeded to the ablumenal
   periphery of an ex vivo-derived vascular scaffold using a
   collagen/hydrogel cell delivery system. After 30 days culture, total
   cell density was consistent between groups; however, significant
   variation was noted in cell distribution and construct mechanics as a
   result of differing perfusion conditions. The most aggressive transport
   gradient was developed by the single perfusion low-pressure circuits and
   resulted in a higher proportion of cells migrating across the scaffold
   toward the vessel lumen (nutrient source). These investigations
   illustrate the influence of directed nutrient gradients where precisely
   controlled perfusion conditions significantly affects cell migration,
   distribution and function, resulting in pronounced effects on construct
   mechanics during early remodeling events. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110:

Abstract = {{In an eight-team single-elimination tournament without reseeding, teams
   are seeded from best (1) to worst (8). Teams 1/8, 4/5, 2/7 and 3/6 are
   paired in the first round, with the 1/8 winner facing the 4/5 winner in
   the second round and so on. However, such tournaments are potentially
   unfair in the sense that inferior teams can be more likely to advance to
   certain stages of the tournament than better teams. For instance, if the
   top five teams are comparable in strength and are markedly better than
   the bottom three teams, then seeds 2 and 3 may be more likely to advance
   to the finals than team 1. We assign each team a unique power value and
   assume that the victory probability in a match-up is proportional to the
   teams' powers. We investigate properties of fair tournaments and
   formulate a non-linear optimization model that prescribes a fair
   tournament given the relative strengths of the teams involved. Although
   the problem is highly non-convex, we demonstrate how to consistently
   obtain all fair tournaments for 8- and 16-team problems.}},

Abstract = {{When the eyelid blinks down over a soft hydrogel contact lens, the tear
   film is partitioned or even consumed by the contact lens, introducing
   relative sliding on both sides against the corneal epithelium and the
   eyelid wiper. This work presents a numerical fluid model of the
   resulting pressures and sliding speeds in both pairs of sliding. Between
   the eyelid wiper and front curve surface, contact pressures ranged 12-18
   kPa for initial eyelid wiper sliding speeds of 10-100 mm/s, with
   corresponding aqueous film thicknesses of 260-820 nm. Maximum contact
   lens deflection was 0.5\%. Sliding with those conditions points to a
   hydrodynamic regime, while the base curve/cornea sliding more likely
   falls in the boundary regime. A lubrication curve is presented for
   hydrated contacts under ocular sliding and loading conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Matlab-based tutorial for model-based prognostics,
   which combines a physical model with observed data to identify model
   parameters, from which the remaining useful life (RUL) can be predicted.
   Among many model-based prognostics algorithms, the particle filter is
   used in this tutorial for parameter estimation of damage or a
   degradation model. The tutorial is presented using a Matlab script with
   62 lines, including detailed explanations. As examples, a battery
   degradation model and a crack growth model are used to explain the
   updating process of model parameters, damage progression, and RUL
   prediction. In order to illustrate the results, the RUL at an arbitrary
   cycle are predicted in the form of distribution along with the median
   and 90\% prediction interval. This tutorial will be helpful for the
   beginners in prognostics to understand and use the prognostics method,
   and we hope it provides a standard of particle filter based prognostics.

Title = {{Phase and texture evolution in solution deposited lead zirconate

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},

Abstract = {{Solution deposition is widely used for the fabrication of lead zirconate
   titanate (PZT) thin films on platinized silicon substrates. However,
   phase and texture evolution during the crystallization process is not
   well understood, particularly due to the difficulty in tracking changes
   in the thin films in situ during heating. In this work, we characterized
   phase and texture evolution in situ during heating and crystallization
   of PZT thin films using high-energy X-ray diffraction. Films were
   pyrolyzed at either 300 degrees C or 400 degrees C and heated at various
   rates between 0.5 degrees C/s and similar to 150 degrees C/s. For films
   that were pyrolyzed at 300 degrees C, the most rapid heating rates first
   induced strong intensities from a transient Pt3Pb phase. The Pt3Pb phase
   inherited the texture of the pre-existing platinum layer. Combined with
   other observations, the results suggest the conversion of the platinum
   to the intermetallic phase near the interface due to the interdiffusion
   of lead. In all experimental variations, the pyrochlore phase was
   observed to form concurrently with the disappearance of the Pt3Pb phase
   after which the perovskite phase ultimately crystallized. For films that
   were pyrolyzed at 400 degrees C, the Pt3Pb phase was not observed at any
   of the heating rates; instead, the pyrochlore phase was first observed,
   followed by the perovskite phase. Independent of the pyrolysis
   temperature or observation of Pt3Pb, a 111-dominant crystallographic
   texture formed in the perovskite phase when crystallized using fast
   heating rates. These results demonstrate that 111 textures in
   solution-derived PZT thin films are not correlated with the observation
   of Pt3Pb or other intermetallic or transient phases. (C) 2013 AIP

   convection-dominated dissolution as another special case. The wavelength
   of the instability is bounded from below and lies in the range 1 mm to 1
   km for physically reasonable flow rates and reaction rates. We obtain a

Abstract = {{Here, we report a simple colloidal transfer technology that enables
   scalable fabrication of monolayer nonclose-packed silica colloidal
   crystals on a large variety of substrates. Two-dimensional colloidal
   crystals with an unusual nonclose-packed structure are first assembled
   on silicon wafers by a spin-coating technique. A poly(vinyl alcohol)
   (PVA) film cast upon the spin-coated colloidal crystal is used to
   transfer the nonclose-packed particle arrays onto various substrates.
   The lattice spacing of the transferred monolayer colloidal crystal can
   easily be adjusted by thermally treating the PVA-silica spheres
   composite film for varied durations. We also have demonstrated the
   templating fabrication of periodic arrays of gold nanodots using a
   transferred monolayer nonclose-packed colloidal crystal as a structural
   template. The resultant plasmonic array exhibits high surface-enhanced
   Raman scattering enhancement factor (similar to 3.8 x 10(7)) for
   adsorbed benzenethiol molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Mg-Al2O3 nanocomposite powders, with Al2O3 particles of 50 nm size, were
   synthesized by mechanical alloying starting from a mixture of 70 vol.\%
   pure Mg and 30 vol.\% Al2O3 powders. A steady-state condition was
   obtained on milling the powder mix for about 20 h, when the crystallite
   size of the Mg powder was about 10 nm. The structural evolution during
   milling was monitored using scanning electron microscopy, energy
   dispersive spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction methods. The results
   showed that a mixture of Mg, Al2O3, and MgO phases were obtained on
   mechanical alloying. On annealing the milled powders at 600 degrees C
   for 30 min, a displacement reaction occurred between the Mg and Al2O3
   phases, when the formation of a mixture of pure Al and MgO phases was
   observed. Also, a reaction occurred between the initial Mg powder and Al
   formed as a result of the displacement reaction, leading to the
   formation of Mg17Al12, Al0.58Mg0.42, and Al3Mg2 phases. Thus, the powder
   annealed after milling the Mg + Al2O3 powder mix for 25 h consisted of
   Al, MgO and Al3Mg2 phases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Z-ligustilide (LIG), an essential oil extract from Radix Angelica
   sinensis, has broad pharmaceutical applications in treating
   cardio-vascular diseases and ischemic brain injury. Recently, LIG has
   been connected to Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) because of its
   structural similarity to 3-n-alkyphthalide (NBP), which is specifically
   cytotoxic to GBM cells. Hence, we investigated LIG's effect on GBM T98G
   cells. The study shows that LIG can significantly reduce T98G cells'
   migration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the attenuation of
   cellular mobility can be linked to the activity of the Rho GTPases
   (RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42), the three critical molecular switches governing
   cytoskeleton remodeling; thus, regulating cell migration. LIG
   significantly reduces the expression of RhoA and affects in a milder
   manner the expression of Cdc42 and Rac1.}},

Abstract = {{The scaling behavior of carbon nanotube (CNT)-organic semiconductor
   heterojunction enabled vertical field effect transistors are
   comprehensively examined by two-dimensional consistent device
   simulations. Tunneling current is modeled by introducing tunneling
   induced carrier generation into the current continuity equation.
   Modulation of both the CNT-semiconductor Shottky barrier height and
   thickness are examined. The tunneling current and thermionic current
   dominate at on-state and off-state, respectively. Barrier height
   modulation plays an important role and improves the on-off current ratio
   and sub-threshold swing considerably. Small diameter CNT is preferred
   for enhancing the gate control on the CNT-channel barrier height.
   Reducing the effective gate oxide thickness by either a thin oxide or a
   high-kappa gate insulator gives improvement of device performance, but
   the former one works more efficiently. The channel length and CNT
   spacing should be carefully engineered due to the trade-off between
   device characteristics in the sub-threshold and above-threshold region.

Abstract = {{The detailed characterization of solution-derived nickel (II) oxide
   (NiO) hole-transporting layer (HTL) films and their application in high
   efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is reported. The NiO
   precursor solution is examined in situ to determine the chemical species
   present. Coordination complexes of monoethanolamine (MEA) with Ni in
   ethanol thermally decompose to form non-stoichiometric NiO.
   Specifically, the {[}Ni(MEA)2(OAc)]+ ion is found to be the most
   prevalent species in the precursor solution. The defect-induced Ni3+
   ion, which is present in non-stoichiometric NiO and signifies the p-type
   conduction of NiO, as well as the dipolar nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH)
   species are confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Bulk
   heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with a polymer/fullerene photoactive
   layer blend composed of poly-dithienogermole-thienopyrrolodione
   (pDTG-TPD) and {[}6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are
   fabricated using these solution-processed NiO films. The resulting
   devices show an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.8\%,
   which is a 15\% improvement over devices utilizing a
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL.
   The enhancement is due to the optical resonance in the solar cell and
   the hydrophobicity of NiO, which promotes a more homogeneous
   donor/acceptor morphology in the active layer at the NiO/BHJ interface.
   Finally, devices incorporating NiO as a HTL are more stable in air than
   devices using PEDOT:PSS.}},

Title = {{Portfolio Decision Analysis Framework for Value-Focused Ecosystem
   Management}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Management of natural resources in coastal ecosystems is a complex
   process that is made more challenging by the need for stakeholders to
   confront the prospect of sea level rise and a host of other
   environmental stressors. This situation is especially true for coastal
   military installations, where resource managers need to balance
   conflicting objectives of environmental conservation against military
   mission. The development of restoration plans will necessitate
   incorporating stakeholder preferences, and will, moreover, require
   compliance with applicable federal/state laws and regulations. To
   promote the efficient allocation of scarce resources in space and time,
   we develop a portfolio decision analytic (PDA) framework that integrates
   models yielding policy-dependent predictions for changes in land cover
   and species metapopulations in response to restoration plans, under
   different climate change scenarios. In a manner that is somewhat
   analogous to financial portfolios, infrastructure and natural resources
   are classified as human and natural assets requiring management. The
   predictions serve as inputs to a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis model
   (MCDA) that is used to measure the benefits of restoration plans, as
   well as to construct Pareto frontiers that represent optimal portfolio
   allocations of restoration actions and resources. Optimal plans allow
   managers to maintain or increase asset values by contrasting the overall
   degradation of the habitat and possible increased risk of species
   decline against the benefits of mission success. The optimal combination
   of restoration actions that emerge from the PDA framework allows
   decision-makers to achieve higher environmental benefits, with equal or
   lower costs, than those achievable by adopting the myopic prescriptions
   of the MCDA model. The analytic framework presented here is
   generalizable for the selection of optimal management plans in any
   ecosystem where human use of the environment conflicts with the needs of
   threatened and endangered species. The PDA approach demonstrates the
   advantages of integrated, top-down management, versus bottom-up
   management approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a biochar based composite material with AlOOH nano-flakes
   was fabricated from AlCl3 pre-treated biomass through slow pyrolysis in
   a N-2 environment at 600 degrees C. Physicochemical properties of the

   Laboratory batch sorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the
   sorption ability of the biochar/AlOOH nanocomposite to three
   representative aqueous contaminants: arsenic, methylene blue, and
   phosphate. The adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetics data
   suggested that the biochar/AlOOH nanocomposite is an excellent

Title = {{Effects of El Nino Southern Oscillation on the space-time variability of
   Agricultural Reference Index for Drought in midlatitudes}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{110-128}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Agriculture is an economic activity directly affected by drought. With
   the constant increase of food demand and the need for high efficiency in
   food production, drought effects gain attention. The Agricultural
   Reference Index for Drought (ARID) was developed to quantify drought and
   better understand its effect on agriculture. ARID values range from 0 to
   1 where zero is transpiration occurring at potential rate and one is
   full water deficit. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the main
   factor of climate variability around the world and affects the climate
   of two states located in midlatitudes, Florida, USA and Rio Grande do
   Sul, Brazil. An historical assessment of the relationship between ARID
   and ENSO will assist with establishing the role played by ENSO in the
   seasonal variation of soil moisture, which is critical to drought
   forecasting based on ENSO. The main objectives of this study were to
   investigate ARID's temporal and spatial variability in Florida and Rio
   Grande do Sul, and provide an assessment of ENSO-induced potential
   anomalies in ARID. Daily ARID values in Florida were calculated using
   data obtained from the National Weather Service COOP (Cooperative
   Observer Program) weather stations. In Rio Grande do Sul, ARID was
   calculated using daily weather data from the Instituto Nacional de
   Meteorologia (INMET) weather stations, Brazil. Daily ARID values were
   compiled into monthly averages and categorized according to ENSO phase
   based on the Multivariate ENSO Index (ME!). Results showed that typical
   ARID values for both regions vary throughout the year. The highest
   values were observed in the warm season due to increased
   evapotranspiration. During this period, ARID values varied from 0.3 to
   0.8 in Florida and 0.2 to 0.7 in Rio Grande do Sul. In the cold period,
   South Florida had the highest ARID values, varying from 0.3 to 0.7,
   while for the rest of state and Rio Grande do Sul the values varied from
   0 to 0.5. ENSO showed stronger influence from November to March in
   Florida, and November and May in Rio Grande do Sul. For both regions, El
   Nino caused ARID values below normal, indicating higher soil moisture
   while during La Nina the values were above normal. This study
   contributes to establish historical ARID records across the southeastern
   United States and southern Brazil, and can assist farmers to adjust
   management practices according to expected water stress conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{The chemical modification of amorphous polystyrene (PS) by the
   deposition of atomic S, SC, and SH with 25, 50, and 100 eV of incident
   kinetic energy is examined using classical molecular dynamics
   simulations. The forces are determined using the second-generation
   reactive empirical bond-order (REBO) potential that has been extended to
   include sulfur. In all cases, the S atoms or S-containing dimers are
   deposited randomly on the PS surface with a flux of about 0.4 x 10(24)
   ions/(cm(2) s), which is comparable to experimental values. The
   simulations predict the way in which the depth profiles vary as a
   function of the identity and kinetic energy of the incident atom or
   dimer. We also quantify the ways in which the surface is chemically
   modified and provide a profile of the chemical products formed on the
   surface, within the substrate, or in the material sputtered from the
   surface. The simulations predict that the maximum density of deposited
   atoms throughout the surface substrate, 3.32 X 10(18) / cm(3), occurs
   for S deposition with 50 eV of incident energy. We further predict that
   the highest molecular weight products are formed as a result of S
   deposition with 100 eV of energy. Additionally, the chemical reactions
   that occur during the deposition are found to depend on the beam energy
   for all the incident atoms or dimers considered. Negligible change in
   the surface roughness is predicted to occur as a result of these
   deposition processes.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric materials exhibit electromechanical coupling which has led
   to their widespread application for sensors, actuators, and energy
   harvesters. These materials possess anisotropic behavior with the shear
   coefficient, and have the largest electromechanical coupling
   coefficient. However, the shear mode is difficult to measure with
   existing techniques and thus has not been fully capitalized upon in
   recent devices. Better understanding of the full shear response with
   respect to the driving electric field would significantly help the
   design of optimized piezoelectric shear devices. Here, a simple and low
   cost direct measurement method based on digital image correlation is
   developed to characterize the shear response of piezoelectric materials
   and its nonlinear behavior as a function of external field. The
   piezoelectric shear coefficient (d(15)) of a commercial shear plate
   actuator is investigated in both bipolar and unipolar electric fields.
   Two different nonlinearities and hysteresis behaviors of the actuators
   were observed, and the relation between the driving field amplitude and
   the corresponding d(15) coefficient is determined. Moreover, the
   measured transverse displacement of the plate actuator in simple shear
   condition is validated through a laser interferometry technique. (C)

Abstract = {{We study the adhesion between smooth polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) rubber
   balls and smooth and rough poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surfaces,
   and between smooth silicon nitride balls and smooth PDMS surfaces. From
   the measured viscoelastic modulus of the PDMS rubber we calculate the
   viscoelastic contribution to the crack-opening propagation energy
   gamma(eff)(nu, T) for a wide range of crack tip velocities nu and for
   several temperatures T. The Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) contact
   mechanics theory is used to analyze the ball pull-off force data, and
   gamma(eff)(nu, T) is obtained for smooth and rough surfaces. We conclude
   that gamma(eff)(nu, T) has contributions of similar magnitude from both
   the bulk viscoelastic energy dissipation close to the crack tip, and
   from the bond-breaking process at the crack tip. The pull-off force on
   the rough surfaces is strongly reduced compared to that of the flat
   surface, which we attribute mainly to the decrease in the area of
   contact on the rough surfaces.}},

Title = {{Fundamental Roles of Nonevaporating Film and Ultrahigh Heat Flux
   Associated With Nanoscale Meniscus Evaporation in Nucleate Boiling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The three-phase moving contact line present at the base of a bubble in
   nucleate boiling has been a widely researched topic over the past few
   decades. It has been traditionally divided into three regions:
   nonevaporating film (order of nanometers), evaporating film (order of
   microns), and bulk meniscus (order of millimeters). This multiscale
   nature of the contact line has made it a challenging and complex
   problem, and led to an incomplete understanding of its dynamic behavior.
   The evaporating film and bulk meniscus regions have been investigated
   rigorously through analytical, numerical and experimental means;
   however, studies focused on the nonevaporating film region have been
   very sparse. The nanometer length scale and the fluidic nature of the
   nonevaporating film has limited the applicability of experimental
   techniques, while its numerical analysis has been questionable due to
   the presumed continuum behavior and lack of known input parameters, such
   as the Hamaker constant. Thus in order to gain fundamental insights and
   understanding, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to study the
   formation and characteristics of the nonevaporating film for the first
   time in published literature, and outlined a technique to obtain Hamaker
   constants from such simulations. Further, in this review, we have shown
   that the nonevaporating film can exist in a metastable state of
   reduced/negative liquid pressures. We have also performed molecular
   simulations of nanoscale meniscus evaporation, and shown that the
   associated ultrahigh heat flux is comparable to the maximum-achievable
   kinetic limit of evaporation. Thus, the nonevaporating film and its
   adjacent nanoscale regions have a significant impact on the overall
   macroscale dynamics and heat flux behavior of nucleate boiling, and
   hence should be included in greater details in nucleate boiling
   simulations and analysis.}},

Title = {{A Market Based Scheme to Integrate Distributed Wind Energy}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{976-984}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Efficiently integrating wind energy into the smart grid is gaining
   momentum under renewable portfolio standard (RPS) with deep wind
   penetration. Due to the randomness of wind energy production, ancillary
   service (AS) is needed in large amount to regulate wind power for system
   stability and reliability. As a result, the cost of wind power depends
   on the AS market and may be, quite higher than that of conventional
   power. Therefore, it is challenging to economically integrate wind
   energy with current power system to satisfy RPS. With the communication,
   sensing and advanced control features incorporated into the smart grid,
   the interactions among the grid components will facilitate solving this
   problem. In this paper, we consider the wind energy integration of
   small-scale utilities installed with wind turbines and acted as
   distributed energy resources (DERs). Since wind energy can be integrated
   to serve customer load or enter a separate green energy market, we
   propose a theoretical framework to dynamically determine the role of
   wind energy and provide long-term RPS guarantee. This approach results
   in a simple dynamic threshold control policy which maximizes the
   expectation of the profit for a green utility and is easily implemented
   online.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in colloidal inorganic nanocrystal synthesis and processing
   have led to the demonstration of organic-inorganic hybrid photovoltaic
   (PV) cells using low-cost solution processes from blends of conjugated
   polymer and colloidal nanocrystals. However, the performance of such
   hybrid PV cells has been limited due to the lack of control at the
   complex interfaces between the organic and inorganic hybrid active
   materials. Here we show that the efficiency of hybrid PV devices can be
   significantly enhanced by engineering the polymer-nanocrystal Interface
   with proper chemical treatment. Using two different conjugated polymers,
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and
   poly{[}2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta{[}2,1-b;3,4-b']-dithioph
   ene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), we show that treating
   the polymer:nanocrystal hybrid film In an ethanedithiol-containing
   acetonitrile solution can increase the efficiency of the hybrid PV
   devices by 30-90\%, and a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.2 +/-
   0.3\% was obtained in the PCPDTBT: CdSe devices at 0.2 sun (AM 1.5G),
   which was slightly reduced to 4.7 +/- 0.3\% at 1 sun. The ethanedithiol
   treatment did not result in significant changes in the morphology and
   UV-vis optical absorption of the hybrid thin films; however, infrared
   absorption, NMR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies revealed the
   effective removal of organic ligands, especially the charged phosphonic
   acid ligands, from the CdSe nanorod surface after the treatment,
   accompanied by the possible monolayer passivation of nanorod surfaces
   with Cd-thiolates. We attribute the hybrid PV cell efficiency Increase
   upon the ethanedithiol treatment to the reduction in charge and exciton
   recombination sites on the nanocrystal surface and the simultaneous
   increase in electron transport through the hybrid film.}},

Abstract = {{Lysosomal death pathways are being explored as alternatives of
   overcoming cancer tumor resistance to traditional forms of treatment.
   Nanotechnologles that can selectively target and induce permeabilization
   of lysosomal compartments in cells could become powerful medical tools.
   Here we demonstrate that iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)
   targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can selectively
   Induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in cancer cells
   overexpressing the EGFR under the action of an alternating magnetic
   field (AMF). LMP was observed to correlate with the production of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease in tumor cell viability.
   Confocal microscopy images showed an Increase in the cytosolic activity
   of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. These observations suggest the
   possibility of remotely triggering lysosomal death pathways In cancer
   cells through the administration of MNPs which target lysosomal
   internalization pathways and the application of AMFs.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their rigidity, microtubules in living cells bend significantly
   during polymerization resulting in greater curvature than can be
   explained by thermal forces alone. However, the source of the
   non-thermal forces that bend growing microtubules remains obscure. We
   analyzed the motion of microtubule tips in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts
   expressing EGFP-EB1, a fluorescent +TIP protein that specifically binds
   to the growing ends of microtubules. We found that dynein inhibition
   significantly reduced the deviation of the growing tip from its initial
   trajectory. Inhibiting myosin modestly reduced tip fluctuations, while
   simultaneous myosin and dynein inhibition caused no further decrease in
   fluctuations compared to dynein inhibition alone. Our results can be
   interpreted with a model in which dynein linkages play a key role in
   generating and transmitting fluctuating forces that bend growing
   microtubules.}},

Journal = {{CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{230-238}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The nucleus is mechanically coupled to the three cytoskeletal elements
   in the cell via linkages maintained by the LINC complex (for Linker of
   Nucleoskeleton to Cytoskeleton). It has been shown that mechanical
   forces from the extracellular matrix (ECM) can be transmitted through
   the cytoskeleton to the nuclear surface. Here we quantified nuclear
   shape in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts on polyacrylamide gels with a controlled
   degree of cross-linking. On soft substrates with a Young's modulus of
   0.4 kPa, the nucleus appeared rounded in its vertical cross-section,
   while on stiff substrates (308 kPa), the nucleus appears more flattened.
   Over-expression of dominant negative Klarsicht ANC-1 Syne Homology
   (KASH) domains, which disrupts the LINC complex, eliminated the
   sensitivity of nuclear shape to substrate rigidity; myosin inhibition
   had similar effects. GFP-KASH4 over-expression altered the rigidity
   dependence of cell motility and cell spreading. Taken together, our
   results suggest that nuclear shape is modulated by substrate
   rigidity-induced changes in actomyosin tension, and that a mechanically
   integrated nucleus-cytoskeleton is required for rigidity sensing. These
   results are significant because they suggest that substrate rigidity can
   potentially control nuclear function and hence cell function.}},

Title = {{Granular shear flows of flat disks and elongated rods without and with
   friction}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Granular shear flows of flat disks and elongated rods are simulated
   using the Discrete Element Method. The effects of particle shape,
   interparticle friction, coefficient of restitution, and Young's modulus
   on the flow behavior and solid phase stresses have been investigated.
   Without friction, the stresses decrease as the particles become flatter
   or more elongated due to the effect of particle shape on the motion and
   interaction of particles. In dense flows, the particles tend to have
   their largest dimension aligned in the flow direction and their smallest
   dimension aligned in the velocity gradient direction, such that the
   contacts between the particles are reduced. The particle alignment is
   more significant for flatter disks and more elongated rods. The
   interparticle friction has a crucial impact on the flow pattern,
   particle alignment, and stress. Unlike in the smooth layer flows with
   frictionless particles, frictional particles are entangled into large
   masses which rotate like solid bodies under shear. In dense flows with
   friction, a sharp stress increase is observed with a small increase in
   the solid volume fraction, and a space-spanning network of force chains
   is rapidly formed with the increase in stress. The stress surge can
   occur at a lower solid volume fraction for the flatter and more
   elongated particles. The particle Young's modulus has a negligible
   effect on dilute and moderately dense flows. However, in dense flows
   where the space-spanning network of force chains is formed, the stress
   depends strongly on the particle Young's modulus. In shear flows of
   non-spherical particles, the stress tensor is found to be symmetric, but
   anisotropic with the normal component in the flow direction greater than
   the other two normal components. The granular temperature for the
   non-spherical particle systems consists of translational and rotational
   temperatures. The translational temperature is not equally partitioned
   in the three directions with the component in the flow direction greater
   than the other two. The rotational temperature is less than the
   translational temperature at low solid volume fractions, but may become
   greater than the translational temperature at high solid volume
   fractions. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new second-order discrete-time Delta Sigma ADC using a
   noise-shaped two-step integrating quantizer is presented. The first
   quantization step (coarse) is utilized with a flash ADC. The second
   quantization step (fine) is implemented using a noise-shaped integrating
   quantizer. As a result, both high resolution and first-order noise
   shaping is achieved. High quantization resolution enhances the modulator
   stability whereas the extra order of noise-shaping improves the overall
   performance. The proposed Delta Sigma ADC incorporating the noise-shaped
   two-step integrating quantizer manifests a second-order noise-shaping
   with a first-order loop filter. To accommodate the large number of
   quantization levels of the feedback-DAC, a new feedback topology is
   presented which uses both analog and digital signals. The prototype ADC
   is implemented in 0.13 mu m CMOS and demonstrates peak SNDR of 70.7 dB
   while consuming 8.1 mW under a 1.2 V supply, with an OSR of 8 at 80 MHz

Abstract = {{Self-regulation and voluntary control of circumscribed brain regions
   using real-time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) allows the establishment of a
   causal functional link between localized brain activity and behavior and
   cognition. A long tradition of research has clearly shown the brain's
   ability to learn volitional control of its own activity and effects on
   behavior. Yet, the underlying neural mechanism of self-regulation is
   still not fully understood. Here, we propose that self-regulation of
   brain activity is akin to skill learning and thus may depend on an
   intact subcortical motor system. We elaborate on the critical role of
   the basal ganglia in skill learning and neurofeedback, and clarify that
   brain-self-regulation need not be an explicit and conscious process as
   often mistakenly held.}},

Abstract = {{Spreader classification is an online traffic measurement function that
   has many important applications. In order to keep up with ever-higher
   line speed, the recent research trend is to implement such functions in
   fast but small on-die SRAM. However, the mismatch between the huge
   amount of Internet traffic to be monitored and limited on-die memory
   space presents a significant technical challenge. In this paper, we
   propose an Efficient Spreader Classification (ESC) scheme based on
   dynamic bit sharing, a compact information storage method. We design a
   maximum likelihood estimation method to extract per-source information
   from the compact storage and determine the heavy spreaders. Our new
   scheme ensures that false positive/negative ratios are bounded.
   Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic
   approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the
   amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real
   Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed spreader
   classification scheme reduces memory consumption by 3-20 times when
   compared to the best existing work. We also investigate a new
   multi-objective spreader classification problem and extend our
   classification scheme to solve it.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of network vulnerability is of great importance in the
   presence of unexpected disruptive events or adversarial attacks
   targeting on critical network links and nodes. In this paper, we study
   Critical Link Disruptor (CLD) and Critical Node Disruptor (CND)
   optimization problems to identify critical links and nodes in a network
   whose removals maximally destroy the network's functions. We provide a
   comprehensive complexity analysis of CLD and CND on general graphs and
   show that they still remain NP-complete even on unit disk graphs and
   power-law graphs. Furthermore, the CND problem is shown NP-hard to be
   approximated within on general graphs with vertices and critical nodes.
   Despite the intractability of these problems, we propose HILPR, a novel
   LP-based rounding algorithm, for efficiently solving CLD and CND
   problems in a timely manner. The effectiveness of our solutions is
   validated on various synthetic and real-world networks.}},

Abstract = {{Using bilayer-graphene (BG), monolayer-graphene (MG), and

   different pseudospinvalve (PSV) junctions: (1) BG-BG, (2) MG-BG, and (3)
   hBG-BG, modulated by vertical electric-field. Although
   pseudomagnetoresistance (PMR) of nearly 100 \% at zero temperature could
   be obtained for the BG-BG structure, this PMR decreases rapidly as
   temperature increases, and the decrease is worsened with the increasing
   lateral distance between the required pairs of the electric gates. On
   the other hand, the decrease is suppressed by using a MG-BG structure,
   which is less sensitive to temperature and not affected by the
   electric-gate distance. Unlike our expectation, our results also show
   that the hBG-BG has the worst performance.}},

Abstract = {{In boron carbide (B4C), the loss of crystallinity (i.e. amorphization)
   during high-pressure loading is known to result in reduced hardness and
   inferior ballistic performance. In this investigation, a systematic
   procedure is developed to evaluate the size and shape of the amorphized
   zone as well as the spatial distribution of the amorphization intensity
   beneath a Vickers indentation. This is accomplished by successive
   metallographic polishing and material removal from the indented surface
   at submicron depth increments and then scanning of each surface using
   micro-Raman spectrometry to construct a three-dimensional map of the
   amorphized zone. The amorphized zone in B4C extends to a depth of almost
   seven times the indentation depth. The self-similarity in stress fields
   at various depths is also confirmed from quantitative description of the
   Raman peaks for various loads. Damage evolution in the form of a Mescall
   zone and initiation of radial cracking from the amorphized zone were
   also observed. It is inferred that the amorphization process initiates
   as soon as the indenter tip makes contact with the B4C surface and
   thereafter the indenter penetrates into the weakened amorphized
   material. The implications of this observation and the utility of the
   quantitative information on the size and shape of the measured
   amorphized zone for calibration of multiscale models on structural
   changes in B4C are discussed. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The paths of evolution of topological grain forms during grain growth
   are described in terms of number of faces, edges per face and face
   arrangements, as depicted by Schlegel diagrams and the topological
   events that change them. This ``Schlegel tree{''} describes transitions
   to higher face classes by grain encounters at corners and to lower face
   classes by grain-pair separation at three-edged faces. Transitions
   within face classes are described through rearrangements that occur to
   neighboring grains during these events. The process is further described
   by probabilities of the different paths in terms of numbers of edges,
   corners and three-edged faces at which face gain and loss events occur.
   Schlegel data from separated grains and three-dimensional Monte Carlo
   and front-tracking simulations show good comparison. Grain form
   frequencies increase with increasing number of transition paths into
   them from other forms. The highest frequency forms have few or no
   three-edged faces, while those with the most three-edged faces are
   present the least. These observations suggest that three-edged faces are
   catalysts for topological change, and forms with higher frequencies of
   these have shorter residence times before transitioning to lower
   classes. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An innovative method was developed to produce engineered biochar from
   magnesium (Mg) enriched tomato tissues through slow pyrolysis in a N-2
   environment. Tomato plants treated with 25 mM Mg accumulated much higher
   level of Mg in tissue, indicating Mg can be substantially enriched in
   tomato plants, and pyrolysis process further concentrated Mg in the
   engineered biochar (8.8\% Mg). The resulting Mg-biochar composites
   (MgEC) showed better sorption ability to phosphate (P) in aqueous
   solutions compared to the other four tomato leaves biochars. Statistical
   analysis showed a strong and significant correlation between P removal
   rate and biochar Mg content (R-2 = 0.78, and p < 0.001), indicating the
   enriched Mg in the engineered biochar is the main factor controlling its
   P removal ability. SEM-EDX, XRD and XPS analyses showed that nanoscale
   Mg(OH)(2) and MgO particles were presented on the surface of MgEC, which
   serve as the main adsorption sites for aqueous P. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Cloud-assisted mobile health (mHealth) monitoring, which applies the
   prevailing mobile communications and cloud computing technologies to
   provide feedback decision support, has been considered as a
   revolutionary approach to improving the quality of healthcare service
   while lowering the healthcare cost. Unfortunately, it also poses a
   serious risk on both clients' privacy and intellectual property of
   monitoring service providers, which could deter the wide adoption of
   mHealth technology. This paper is to address this important problem and
   design a cloud-assisted privacy preserving mobile health monitoring
   system to protect the privacy of the involved parties and their data.
   Moreover, the outsourcing decryption technique and a newly proposed key
   private proxy reencryption are adapted to shift the computational
   complexity of the involved parties to the cloud without compromising
   clients' privacy and service providers' intellectual property. Finally,
   our security and performance analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of
   our proposed design.}},

Abstract = {{A sensor with two active phrases means that active mode has two phases,
   the full-active phase and the semi-active phase, which require different
   energy consumptions. A full-active sensor can sense data packets,
   transmit, receive, and relay the data packets. A semi-active sensor
   cannot sense data packets, but it can transmit, receive, and relay data
   packets. Given a set of targets and a set of sensors with two active
   phrases, find a sleep/active schedule of sensors to maximize the time
   period during which active sensors form a connected coverage set. In
   this paper, this problem is showed to have polynomial-time
   -approximations for any when all targets and sensors lie in the
   Euclidean plane and all sensors have the same sensing radius R (s) and
   the same communication radius R (c) with R (c) a parts per thousand yen

Abstract = {{Surrogate-based optimization proceeds in cycles. Each cycle consists of
   analyzing a number of designs, fitting a surrogate, performing
   optimization based on the surrogate, and finally analyzing a candidate
   solution. Algorithms that use the surrogate uncertainty estimator to
   guide the selection of the next sampling candidate are readily
   available, e.g., the efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm.
   However, adding one single point at a time may not be efficient when the
   main concern is wall-clock time (rather than number of simulations) and
   simulations can run in parallel. Also, the need for uncertainty
   estimates limits EGO-like strategies to surrogates normally implemented
   with such estimates (e.g., kriging and polynomial response surface). We
   propose the multiple surrogate efficient global optimization (MSEGO)
   algorithm, which adds several points per optimization cycle with the
   help of multiple surrogates. We import uncertainty estimates from one
   surrogate to another to allow use of surrogates that do not provide
   them. The approach is tested on three analytic examples for nine basic
   surrogates including kriging, radial basis neural networks, linear
   Shepard, and six different instances of support vector regression. We
   found that MSEGO works well even with imported uncertainty estimates,
   delivering better results in a fraction of the optimization cycles
   needed by EGO.}},

   was estimated to be 0.5 nm/cycle at the temperature of 150 degrees C. It
   was identified that the interfacial layer of the treated thin film was
   disappeared at a certain temperature rise. Furthermore, we found that
   the crystalline structure of TiO2 film was varied depending on not only
   the growth temperature but also the post thermal treatment of the

Title = {{A study of IMRT planning parameters on planning efficiency, delivery
   efficiency, and plan quality}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To improve planning and delivery efficiency of head and neck
   IMRT without compromising planning quality through the evaluation of
   inverse planning parameters.
   Methods: Eleven head and neck patients with pre-existing IMRT treatment
   plans were selected for this retrospective study. The Pinnacle treatment
   planning system (TPS) was used to compute new treatment plans for each
   patient by varying the individual or the combined parameters of
   dose/fluence grid resolution, minimum MU per segment, and minimum
   segment area. Forty-five plans per patient were generated with the
   following variations: 4 dose/fluence grid resolution plans, 12 minimum
   segment area plans, 9 minimum MU plans, and 20 combined minimum segment
   area/minimum MU plans. Each plan was evaluated and compared to others
   based on dose volume histograms (DVHs) (i.e., plan quality), planning
   time, and delivery time. To evaluate delivery efficiency, a model was
   developed that estimated the delivery time of a treatment plan, and
   validated through measurements on an Elekta Synergy linear accelerator.
   Results: The uncertainty (i.e., variation) of the dose-volume index due
   to dose calculation grid variation was as high as 8.2\% (5.5 Gy in
   absolute dose) for planning target volumes (PTVs) and 13.3\% (2.1 Gy in
   absolute dose) for planning at risk volumes (PRVs). Comparison results
   of dose distributions indicated that smaller volumes were more
   susceptible to uncertainties. The grid resolution of a 4 mm dose grid
   with a 2 mm fluence grid was recommended, since it can reduce the final
   dose calculation time by 63\% compared to the accepted standard (2 mm
   dose grid with a 2 mm fluence grid resolution) while maintaining a
   similar level of dose-volume index variation. Threshold values that
   maintained adequate plan quality (DVH results of the PTVs and PRVs
   remained satisfied for their dose objectives) were 5 cm(2) for minimum
   segment area and 5 MU for minimum MU. As the minimum MU parameter was
   increased, the number of segments and delivery time were decreased.
   Increasing the minimum segment area parameter decreased the plan MU, but
   had less of an effect on the number of segments and delivery time. Our
   delivery time model predicted delivery time to within 1.8\%.
   Conclusions: Increasing the dose grid while maintaining a small fluence
   grid allows for improved planning efficiency without compromising plan
   quality. Delivery efficiency can be improved by increasing the minimum
   MU, but not the minimum segment area. However, increasing the respective
   minimum MU and/or the minimum segment area to any value greater than 5
   MU and 5 cm(2) is not recommended because it degrades plan quality. (c)

Abstract = {{Many networks, indifferent of their function and scope, converge to a
   scale-free architecture in which the degree distribution approximately
   follows a power law. Meanwhile, many of those scale-free networks are
   found to be naturally divided into communities of densely connected
   nodes, known as community structure. Finding this community structure is
   a fundamental but challenging topic in network science. Since Newman's
   suggestion of using modularity as a measure to qualify the strength of
   community structure, many efficient methods that find community
   structure based on maximizing modularity have been proposed. However,
   there is a lack of approximation algorithms that provide provable
   quality bounds for the problem. In this paper, we propose
   polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the modularity maximization
   problem together with their theoretical justifications in the context of
   scale-free networks. We prove that the solutions of the proposed
   algorithms, even in the worst-case, are optimal up to a constant factor
   for scale-free networks with either bidirectional or unidirectional
   links. Even though our focus in this work is not on designing another
   empirically good algorithms to detect community structure, experiments
   on real-world networks suggest that the proposed algorithm is
   competitive with the state-of-the-art modularity maximization algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and
   diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based
   animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that
   decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced
   vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based
   on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis
   that 13 d of spaceflight {[}Space Transportation System (STS)-135
   shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial
   wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of
   mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries
   (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro
   vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic
   vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater
   in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n = 7) relative to
   ground-based control group (GC) mice (n = 12). Basilar artery maximal
   diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236 +/- 9 mu m and GC: 215 +/- 5 mu
   m) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4 +/- 1.6 mu m;
   GC: 12.2 +/- 1.2 mu m). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via
   nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4 +/- 0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4 +/-
   0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic
   vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of
   cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur
   during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of
   perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an
   associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during
   spaceflight.-Taylor, C. R., Hanna, M., Behnke, B. J., Stabley, J. N.,

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) technology opens the licensed spectrum bands for
   opportunistic usage and initiates spectrum trading to improve the
   spectrum utilization. In this paper, we investigate the path selection
   problem in multihop cognitive radio networks (CRNs) under constraints on
   flow routing, link scheduling and CR source's budget. We extend the
   per-user-based spectrum trading in prior work to CR session-based
   spectrum trading, and effectively develop the spectrum trading
   mechanisms based on the cross-layer optimization in multihop CRNs. We
   introduce a new service provider, called secondary service provider
   (SSP), to help CR sessions to select the paths for packet delivery.
   Considering the price of bands and the potential returning of primary
   services at different CR links, the SSP purchases the licensed spectrum
   and jointly conducts flow routing and link scheduling under the budget
   constraints. We also propose a 4D conflict graph to characterize the
   conflict relationship among CR links and mathematically formulate the
   path selection problem under multiple constraints into an optimization
   problem with the objective of maximizing the end-to-end throughput. Due
   to the NP-hardness of the problem, we have also developed a heuristic
   algorithm to find the approximate solution.}},

Abstract = {{With emerging Internet-scale open content and resource sharing, social
   networks, and complex cyber-physical systems, trust issues become
   prominent. Conventional trust mechanisms are inadequate at addressing
   trust issues in decentralized open environments. In this paper, we
   propose a trust vector based trust management scheme called VectorTrust
   for aggregation of distributed trust scores. Leveraging a Bellman-Ford
   based algorithm for fast and lightweight trust score aggregation,
   VectorTrust features localized and distributed concurrent communication.
   Built on a trust overlay network in a peer-to-peer network, a
   VectorTrust-enabled system is decentralized by nature and does not rely
   on any centralized server or centralized trust aggregation. We design,
   implement, and analyze trust rating, trust aggregation, and trust
   management strategies. To evaluate the performance, we design and
   implement a VectorTrust simulator (VTSim) in an unstructured P2P
   network. The analysis and simulation results demonstrate the efficiency,
   accuracy, scalability, and robustness of VectorTrust scheme. On average,
   VectorTrust converges faster and involves less complexity than most
   existing trust schemes. VectorTrust remains robust and tolerant to
   malicious peers and malicious behaviors. With dynamic growth of P2P
   network scales and topology complexities, VectorTrust scales well with
   reasonable overheads (about O(lg N) communication overheads) and fast
   convergence speed (about O(log (D) N) iterations).}},

Abstract = {{This investigation addresses an issue with the lateral stability and
   control of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) which is created by the presence
   of roll stall' and its effects on the aircraft's stability derivatives.
   This behavior is a result of the developing tip vortex asymmetry of a
   low aspect ratio (LAR) wing in sideslip which creates an asymmetric
   spanwise load and a resulting roll moment. Experimental wind tunnel
   results indicate that roll stall produces a roll stability derivative, ,
   for both the MAV models tested as well as canonical tapered flat wing
   cases; furthermore, even at small sideslip angles, the cross-coupled
   derivative links the longitudinal aerodynamics and the lateral loads of
   LAR wings, effects which are not present for large aircraft. The roll
   stall creates nonlinearites in lateral loads in an angle of attack
   regime in which the lift variation is linear; thus, control techniques
   for MAVs must consider the fact that lateral and longitudinal equations
   of motion can not necessarily be linearized about the same equilibrium
   flight conditions. Finally, the addition of winglets below the plane of
   the wing is seen to reduce by at least 50\% in some cases, as well as
   essentially eliminating the derivative for a taper ratio of . This
   provides a passive control technique which can potentially be employed
   to significantly reduce the lateral instabilities of MAVs.}},

Abstract = {{Activity recognition has received increasing attention from the machine
   learning community. Of particular interest is the ability to recognize
   activities in real time from streaming data, but this presents a number
   of challenges not faced by traditional offline approaches. Among these
   challenges is handling the large amount of data that does not belong to
   a predefined class. In this paper, we describe a method by which
   activity discovery can be used to identify behavioral patterns in
   observational data. Discovering patterns in the data that does not
   belong to a predefined class aids in understanding this data and
   segmenting it into learnable classes. We demonstrate that activity
   discovery not only sheds light on behavioral patterns, but it can also
   boost the performance of recognition algorithms. We introduce this
   partnership between activity discovery and online activity recognition
   in the context of the CASAS smart home project and validate our approach
   using CASAS data sets.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines frictional heating and the associated temperature
   rise for a sliding circular contact using an in situ thermal
   micro-tribometer. Observation of the contact temperature used a
   radiometric approach to measure local temperature at the sliding

   Filled natural rubber samples were slid against optically smooth CaF2
   counter-samples. Temperature rise was measured for externally applied
   normal forces ranging from similar to 100 to 1000 mN and sliding
   velocities ranging from similar to 250 to 1000 mm/s, producing
   temperature rises between similar to 3 and 26 degrees C. Measured
   temperature rise was compared to the analytical models of Jaeger,
   Archard, and Tian and Kennedy for the average temperature rise in
   sliding contacts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanometerscale multilayer CrN/AlN thin films were deposited by pulsed DC
   magnetron sputtering. Nanoscale resolution chemistry and microstructure
   of CrN/AlN films with modulation periods (Lambda) of 4 nm and 18 nm were

   level, the interface between the CrN and AlN nanolayers contains a
   concentration gradient of Al and Cr. Interdiffusion of Cr and Al atoms
   into the AlN and CrN layers was identified. Microstructural
   characterization revealed the CrN nanolayers epitaxially stabilize the
   AlN layers (2 nm) to a cubic structure for the Lambda = 4 nm film. The
   rapid repetition of the interfacial energy across the AlN nanolayers is
   critical for the coherent epitaxial growth. The film at Lambda = 4 nm
   exhibited a superhardness of 42 GPa. In contrast, the AlN layers (12.5
   nm) exhibited a hexagonal structure in the Lambda= 18 nm film as the
   bulk energy becomes dominating, in which misorientated and incoherent
   interfaces were found. The hardness of the film dropped down to 23 GPa.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity expenditure comprises a significant fraction of the total
   operating cost in data centers. Hence, cloud service providers are
   required to reduce electricity cost as much as possible. In this paper,
   we consider utilizing existing energy storage capabilities in data
   centers to reduce electricity cost under wholesale electricity markets,
   where the electricity price exhibits both temporal and spatial
   variations. A stochastic program is formulated by integrating the
   center-level load balancing, the server-level configuration, and the
   battery management while at the same time guaranteeing the
   quality-of-service experience by end users. We use the Lyapunov
   optimization technique to design an online algorithm that achieves an
   explicit tradeoff between cost saving and energy storage capacity. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm through
   extensive numerical evaluations based on real-world workload and
   electricity price data sets. As far as we know, our work is the first to
   explore the problem of electricity cost saving using energy storage in
   multiple data centers by considering both the spatial and temporal
   variations in wholesale electricity prices and workload arrival
   processes.}},

   Young's modulus, energy to failure, glass transition temperature T-g and
   storage modulus E' were assessed. The first three were selected in a
   design of experiment optimisation study. The results indicated that as
   the sonication intensity and the duration of sonication were increased,
   the material response of the MWNT/epoxy composite, specifically Young's
   modulus, energy and Tg, was enhanced. The fracture surfaces of the
   composites were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Improved
   dispersion was observed in samples fabricated with increased sonication
   intensities. The Mori-Tanaka model was used to predict the mechanical
   properties of the MWNT/epoxy composites and was found to be in
   reasonable agreement with experimental data. Nonetheless, the
   experimental results yielded slightly inferior properties to those from
   the model prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advancements in embedded systems due to Moore's law have
   led to the proliferation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in different
   application domains (e.g., defense, health care, surveillance systems)
   with different application requirements (e.g., lifetime, reliability).
   Many commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensor nodes can be specialized to
   meet these requirements using tunable parameters (e.g., processor
   voltage and frequency) to specialize the operating state. Since a sensor
   node's performance depends greatly on environmental stimuli, dynamic
   optimizations enable sensor nodes to automatically determine their
   operating state in situ. However, dynamic optimization methodology
   development given a large design space and resource constraints (memory
   and computational) is an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we
   propose a lightweight dynamic optimization methodology that
   intelligently selects initial tunable parameter values to produce a
   high-quality initial operating state in one-shot for time-critical or
   highly constrained applications. Further operating state improvements
   are made using an efficient greedy exploration algorithm, achieving
   optimal or near-optimal operating states while exploring only 0.04\% of
   the design space on average. We also propose an application metrics
   estimation model, which is leveraged by our dynamic optimization
   methodology, to estimate high-level application metrics (e.g., lifetime,
   throughput) from sensor node tunable parameters and hardware specific
   internals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of secondary electrons on emission is studied by modelling
   the electrons behaviours in multi-layers, including electron injection,
   transportation, multiplication, and emission. The dielectric constant
   model and carrier mobility model are presented to describe the voltage
   distribution in multi-layers for the non-current injection and current
   injection respectively. After injection, the electrons are accelerated
   in SiO2, where they collide with the electrons, generating secondary
   electrons, consequently contributing to emission. A multiplying factor M
   is introduced to describe the secondary electrons multiplication in
   certain electrical field strength. The prediction was further proved by
   comparing two groups of devices with and without the accelerating layer:
   ITO/MEH-PPV/SiO2/Al and ITO/MEH-PPV/BCP/Al. The current avalanche
   observed in current-illumination experiment is a proof of the existence

Abstract = {{PraderWilli syndrome (PWS) is a genetic imprinting disorder
   characterized mainly by hyperphagia and early childhood obesity.
   Previous functional neuroimaging studies used visual stimuli to examine
   abnormal activities in the eating-related neural circuitry of patients
   with PWS. It was found that patients with PWS exhibited both excessive
   hunger and hyperphagia consistently, even in situations without any food
   stimulation. In the present study, we employed resting-state functional
   MRI techniques to investigate abnormal brain networks related to eating
   disorders in children with PWS. First, we applied amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuation analysis to define the regions of interest
   that showed significant alterations in resting-state brain activity
   levels in patients compared with their sibling control group. We then
   applied a functional connectivity (FC) analysis to these regions of
   interest in order to characterize interactions among the brain regions.
   Our results demonstrated that patients with PWS showed decreased FC
   strength in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)/inferior parietal lobe
   (IPL), MPFC/precuneus, IPL/precuneus and IPL/hippocampus in the default
   mode network; decreased FC strength in the pre-/postcentral gyri and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in the
   motor sensory network and prefrontal cortex network, respectively; and
   increased FC strength in the anterior cingulate cortex/insula,
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)/OFC and DLPFC/VLPFC in the core
   network and prefrontal cortex network, respectively. These findings
   indicate that there are FC alterations among the brain regions
   implicated in eating as well as rewarding, even during the resting
   state, which may provide further evidence supporting the use of PWS as a
   model to study obesity and to provide information on potential neural
   targets for the medical treatment of overeating. Copyright (c) 2013 John

   Complexity vs. performance}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{209-221}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We propose several control algorithms and compare their performance and
   complexity through simulations; the control algorithms regulate the
   indoor climate of commercial buildings. The goal of these control
   algorithms is to use occupancy information to reduce energy use-over
   conventional control algorithms-while maintaining thermal comfort and
   indoor air quality. Three novel control algorithms are proposed, one
   that uses feedback from occupancy and temperature sensors, while the
   other two compute optimal control actions based on predictions of a
   dynamic model to reduce energy use. Both the optimal control based
   schemes use a model predictive control (MPC) methodology; the difference
   between the two is that one is allowed occupancy measurements while the
   other is allowed occupancy predictions. Simulation results show that
   each of the proposed controllers lead to significant amount of energy
   savings over a baseline conventional controller without sacrificing
   occupant health and comfort. Another key finding is that the feedback
   controller performs almost as well as the more complex MPC-based
   controllers. In light of the complexity of the MPC algorithms compared
   to the feedback control algorithm, we conclude that feedback control is
   the more suitable one for occupancy based zone-climate control. A
   related conclusion is that the difficulty of obtaining occupancy
   predictions does not commensurate with the resulting benefits; though
   these benefits are a strong function of ventilation standards. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Mechanical loading is believed to be a critical factor in the
   development and treatment of knee osteoarthritis. However, the contact
   forces to which the knee articular surfaces are subjected during daily
   activities cannot be measured clinically. Thus, the ability to predict
   internal knee contact forces accurately using external measures (i.e.,
   external knee loads and muscle electromyographic {[}EMG] signals) would
   be clinically valuable. We quantified how well external knee load and
   EMG measures predict internal knee contact forces during gait. A single
   subject with a force-measuring tibial prosthesis and post-operative
   valgus alignment performed four gait patterns (normal, medial thrust,
   walking pole, and trunk sway) to induce a wide range of external and
   internal knee joint loads. Linear regression analyses were performed to
   assess how much of the variability in internal contact forces was
   accounted for by variability in the external measures. Though the
   different gait patterns successfully induced significant changes in the
   external and internal quantities, changes in external measures were
   generally weak indicators of changes in total, medial, and lateral
   contact force. Our results suggest that when total contact force may be
   changing, caution should be exercised when inferring changes in knee
   contact forces based on observed changes in external knee load and EMG
   measures. Advances in musculoskeletal modeling methods may be needed for
   accurate estimation of in vivo knee contact forces. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic

Abstract = {{Background: How accurately do people perceive extreme water speeds and
   how does their perception affect perceived risk? Prior research has
   focused on the characteristics of moving water that can reduce human
   stability or balance. The current research presents the first experiment
   on people's perceptions of risk and moving water at different speeds and
   depths.
   Methods: Using a randomized within-person 2 (water depth: 0.45, 0.90 m)
   x3 (water speed: 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 m/s) experiment, we immersed 76 people in
   moving water and asked them to estimate water speed and the risk they
   felt.
   Results: Multilevel modeling showed that people increasingly
   overestimated water speeds as actual water speeds increased or as water
   depth increased. Water speed perceptions mediated the direct positive
   relationship between actual water speeds and perceptions of risk; the
   faster the moving water, the greater the perceived risk. Participants'
   prior experience with rip currents and tropical cyclones moderated the
   strength of the actual-perceived water speed relationship; consequently,
   mediation was stronger for people who had experienced no rip currents or
   fewer storms.
   Conclusions: These findings provide a clearer understanding of water
   speed and risk perception, which may help communicate the risks
   associated with anticipated floods and tropical cyclones.}},

Abstract = {{High-frequency cross-modulation is employed to probe the D region
   ionosphere during HF heating experiments at the High-frequency Active
   Auroral Research Program (HAARP) observatory. We have adapted Fejer's
   well-known cross-modulation probing method to determine the extent of
   ionospheric conductivity modification in the D region ionosphere with
   high (5 sec) time resolution. We demonstrate that the method can be used
   to analyze D region conductivity changes produced by HF heating both
   during the initial stages of heating and under steady state conditions.
   The sequence of CW probe pulses used allow the separation of
   cross-modulation effects that occur as the probe pulse propagates upward
   and downward through the heated region. We discuss how this probing
   technique can be applied to benefit ELF/VLF wave generation experiments
   and ionospheric irregularities experiments at higher altitudes. We
   demonstrate that large phase changes equivalent to Doppler shift
   velocities >60km/s can be imposed on HF waves propagating through the
   heated D region ionosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Hurricane Sandy drove storm surges throughout the eastern seaboard of
   the United States, from Miami to Maine, at the end of October 2012. The
   surge was particularly high (>3 m) in coastal New York. In the
   southeastern United States, the surge was <1 m but had striking
   semidiurnal perturbations that reached a range of similar to 0.5 m in
   northern Florida and southern Georgia. These oscillations are typically
   not considered in surge forecasts and their origin needs to be
   understood for future forecasts. Analytical and numerical approaches
   indicated that semidiurnal perturbations arose from an interaction
   between astronomical tide and wind forcing. This combination of forcing
   caused phase shifts between incident and reflected tidal waves that
   customarily produce quasi-standing tidal conditions in the area.
   Atmospheric forcing of sufficient strength, which threshold remains to
   be established, disrupted such quasi-standing tidal behavior through
   Coriolis accelerations and triggered the semidiurnal perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Using a three-station wideband electric and magnetic field measuring
   network in conjunction with VHF receivers, we recorded the so-called
   compact intracloud discharges (CIDs) in the Greater Khingan Range (51
   degrees N) in Northeast China. This type of lightning discharge had
   never been observed in such high-latitude regions before. During the
   summer seasons of 2009 and 2010, a total of 493 CIDs with positive
   electric field pulses (negative charge moving up) occurring in 31
   thunderstorms was recorded, with 87\% (27/31) of CID-producing storms
   generating less than 20 CIDs. The CID occurrence observed at 51 degrees
   N appears to differ significantly from that in most lower latitude
   regions. Specifically, CIDs accounted only for 0.034\% of the total of
   1.4 million recorded lightning events, and no CIDs with negative
   electric field pulses (positive charge moving up) were observed. A total
   of 202 CIDs was located and they clustered at altitudes ranging from 5
   to 12 km above ground level (agl), with a median height of 7.9 km agl.
   The effective ionosphere heights ranged from 75 to 95 km during the time
   period of 15:00-06:00 (local time). The median maximum heights of the 30
   dBZ radar echo for convective cells with CIDs and without CIDs were 10.8
   and 9.4 km, respectively. We infer that a relatively small vertical
   extent of thunderclouds, limited by the height of the tropopause, and a
   lack of vigorous convective surges in higher-latitude regions might be
   responsible for the paucity or absence of CIDs in general and apparent
   suppression of those with negative electric field pulses in particular.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of discrete breathers (DBs) has already been described in
   nonlinear photonic materials, such as ferroelectrics and metamaterials
   (MMs) by the Klein-Gordon (K-G) approach. Rectification of energy
   transport in MMs in the presence of an appropriate external field is
   studied via symmetry breaking leading to directed energy transport or
   ratchet behaviour. Based on the earlier development of the K-G equation
   in a MM system with a split-ring resonator for antenna applications, a
   theoretical model for current density is worked out by symmetry analysis
   and its violation to characterize the ratchet effect. The time-averaged
   current shows interesting results against phase shift in the ac driver.
   These data are further related to various parameters, such as coupling
   and damping in the system. For MMs, this opens a new application for
   rectification using ratchets.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a simple and reproducible method for fabricating InGaN/GaN

   Focused-ion-beam (FIB)-deposited Pt was contacted to both ends of the
   nanorod LEDs, producing bright electroluminescence from the LEDs under
   forward bias conditions. The turn-on voltage in these nanorod LEDs was
   higher (13 V) than in companion thin film devices (3 V) and this can be
   attributed to the high contact resistance between the FIB-deposited Pt
   and nanorod LEDs and the damage induced by inductively-coupled plasma
   and Ga+ -ions. Our method to obtain uniform MQW nanorod LEDs shows
   promise for improving the reproducibility of nano-optoelectronics. (C)

Volume = {{232}},

Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Harmony Search (HS), inspired by the music improvisation process, is a
   new meta-heuristic optimization method and has been successfully used to
   tackle the optimization problems in discrete or continuous space.
   Although the standard HS algorithm is able to solve binary-coded
   optimization problems, the pitch adjustment operator of HS is
   degenerated in the binary space, which spoils the performance of the
   algorithm. Based on the analysis of the drawback of the standard HS, an
   improved adaptive binary Harmony Search (ABHS) algorithm is proposed in
   this paper to solve the binary-coded problems more effectively. Various
   adaptive mechanisms are examined and investigated, and a scalable
   adaptive strategy is developed for ABHS to enhance its search ability
   and robustness. The experimental results on the benchmark functions and
   0-1 knapsack problems demonstrate that the proposed ABHS is efficient
   and effective, which outperforms the binary Harmony Search, the novel
   global Harmony Search algorithm and the discrete binary Particle Swarm
   Optimization in terms of the search accuracy and convergence speed. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigate non-Brownian particles suspended in a periodic shear-flow
   using simulations. Following Metzger and Butler {[}Phys. Rev. E 82,
   051406 (2010)], we show that the chaotic dynamics arising from
   lubrication interactions are too weak to generate an observable particle
   dispersion. The irreversibility observed in periodic flow is dominated
   by contact interactions. Nonetheless, we show that lubrication
   interactions must be included in the calculation to obtain results that
   agree with experiments. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.052304}},

Abstract = {{Emerging contaminant ciprofloxacin (CIP) has been frequently detected in
   soils. Its interactions with metals in soils remain largely unknown. We
   examined the effects of metal cations Cu and Ca and surface Fe/Al
   coating on CIP sorption by preloading Cu and Ca onto sand surface or
   mixing them with CIP in solution. Batch experiments with sand before and
   after removing Fe/Al coating on surface (coated and clean sand) were
   used. Based on Langmuir model and compared to clean sand, coated sand
   not only sorbed 10 times more CIP (50 mg kg(-1)) but also with 6 times
   stronger binding strength (1.95 L/mu g). Though coated sand had limited
   Fe and Al on surface (157 and 904 mg kg(-1)), they were the major sites
   for CIP sorption probably via complexation with CIP's carboxyl group.
   Surface Fe/Al also played an important role in CIP sorption via Cu and
   Ca cation bridging as evidenced by increased CIP sorption with
   increasing Cu and Ca concentration preloaded onto sand surface.
   Different from Cu and Ca on the sand surface, Cu and Ca in solution
   decreased CIP sorption. Our results suggested that cations in soils
   could either facilitate or impede CIP sorption depending on they are on
   solid or solution phase. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Four major types of silicone hydrogel contact lens material have been
   investigated following treatments in aqueous solutions containing
   poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(butylenes oxide) block copolymer (EO-BO).
   The extent of lens surface modification by EO-BO and the degree of bulk
   uptake were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
   ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), respectively. The
   experimental results suggest that different interaction models exist for
   the lenses, highlighting the influence of both surface and bulk
   composition, which greatly differs between the lenses examined.
   Specifically, lenses with hydrophilic surface treatments, i.e.,
   PureVision (R) (balafilcon A) and O2OPTIX (lotrafilcon B), demonstrated
   strong evidence of preferential surface adsorption within the
   near-surface region. In comparison, surface adsorption on ACUVUE (R)
   Oasys (R) (senofilcon A) and Biofinity (R) (comfilcon A) was limited. As
   for bulk absorption, the amount of EO-BO uptake was the greatest for
   balafilcon A and comfilcon A, and least for lotrafilcon B. These
   findings confirm the presence of molecular concentration gradients
   within the silicone hydrogel lenses following exposure to EO-BO
   solutions, with the nature of such concentration gradients found to be
   lens-specific. Together, the results suggest opportunities for
   compositional modifications of lenses for improved performance via
   solution treatments containing surface-active agents. Published by

Abstract = {{Dynamic structural changes during the first electrochemical charge and
   discharge cycle in the Li-excess layered oxide compound,
   Li{[}Li1/5Ni1/5Mn3/5]O-2, are studied with synchrotron X-ray diffraction
   (SXRD), aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy
   (a-S/TEM), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). At different
   states of charge, we carefully examined the crystal structures and
   electronic structures within the bulk and have found that increased
   microstrain is accompanied with the cation migration and a second phase
   formation which occurs during the first cycle voltage plateau as well as
   into the beginning of the discharge cycle. The evidence indicates that
   the oxygen vacancy formation and activation may facilitate cation
   migration and results in the formation of a second phase. The EELS
   results reveal a Mn valence change from 4+ to 3+ upon oxygen vacancy
   formation and recovers back to 4+ at the discharge. The oxygen vacancy
   formation and activation at the partially delithiated state leads to the
   generation of several crystal defects which are observed in TEM.
   Identification of the correlation between microstrain and oxygen vacancy
   formation during the first electrochemical cycle clarifies the complex
   intercalation mechanisms that accounts for the anomalous capacities
   exceeding 200 mAh/g in the Li-excess layered oxide compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The radiation-induced defects formed in nuclear structure materials in
   the initial stage of displacement cascade and the subsequent changes in
   their microstructures and mechanical properties are the primary causes
   of their failure. Unfortunately the formation and aggregation of point
   defects are hard to be found only by probed experiments. In this work,
   the displacement cascade occurring in hcp-Ti system has been
   investigated by using molecular dynamics. After building the atomic
   model, by setting different PKA (primary knock-on atom) directions and
   PKA energies respectively, the evolution of simulated radiation-induced
   point defects in displacement cascade was studied and its two major
   characteristics, displacement and thermal spikes, have been given. The
   transient temperature distribution, local melting region variation in
   the damage zone caused by radiation as well as the peak and surviving
   numbers of Frenkel pairs were quantitatively estimated. For hcp-Ti, in
   the PKA energy region of 0.5-9.0 keV, the effect of PKA velocity
   direction on survival defect number is very small. Both the defect
   number at stable state and its maximum value have approximately linear
   relationship with the PKA energy. In the radiation evolution stage, the
   defects about 95 percent have recovered, the defect and temperature
   distribution caused by displacement cascade are asymmetric. The
   simulation method used in this paper would provide an effective way for
   the study on the evolution and micromechanism of radiation-induced point
   defects in displacement cascade.}},

Abstract = {{Large scale climate phenomena can provide valuable information for
   regional climate and streamflow in many parts of the world. Several
   climate phenomena may impact a given area and their value for providing
   information on streamflow is dependent on first establishing the local
   relationship. This study was conducted to establish the individual and
   coupled impacts of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)
   on streamflow in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river basin.
   Differences in annual and seasonal streamflow using two unimpaired
   streamflow datasets based on the phase(s) of ENSO, the PDO, and the AMO
   were evaluated using the nonparametric rank-sum test. Few statistical
   differences were found for the individual impacts of ENSO and the PDO on
   annual and seasonal streamflow; differences based on ENSO were largely
   confined to the southern portion of the basin. Significant differences
   in annual streamflow based on the AMO were largely confined to the
   northern half of the basin. Differences in seasonal streamflow based on
   the AMO were found for much of the year in the northern portion of the
   basin but were confined to the winter season in the southern portion.
   Significant differences in annual and seasonal streamflow were found
   between the La Nina/positive AMO phase and the El Nino/negative AMO
   phase, between the positive AMO/negative PDO phase and the negative
   AMO/negative PDO phase, and there appears to be a modulation of the
   impacts of La Nina by the phase of the AMO. A greater number of stations
   and a greater magnitude of significant differences were found for the
   coupled impacts than for the individual impacts of ENSO, the PDO, and
   the AMO; indicating the importance of the coupled impacts on regional
   streamflow when establishing the role of annual, decadal, and
   multidecadal climate variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   anti-angiogenesis by photoacoustic (PA) imaging. scAAV2 vector
   containing 7 surface exposed tyrosine to phenylanine capsid mutations
   was able to transduce microvascular endothelial cells with high
   efficiency. siRNAs against UPR (unfolded protein response)-IRE1 alpha,
   XBP-1, ATF6 significantly inhibited breast cancer-induced angiogenesis
   in vitro by inhibiting endothelial cell survival. PA imaging showed that
   knockdown of UPR proteins greatly reduced tumor angiogenesis in vivo in
   breast cancer models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

   Many brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), may alter the
   influence strength, activity levels, or both. Whether the relationship
   or prediction between these two will be affected under disease condition
   is unknown. In this study, the spontaneous brain activity, and
   inter-regional Granger causality connection were investigated over eight
   core DMN regions in AD patients in contrast to that in normal controls.
   Compared to normal control (NC), AD patients had both decreased BOLD
   activity level and Granger causal influence in medial prefrontal cortex
   and decreased activity level in inferior parietal cortex showed.
   However, the positive correlation between the BOLD activity level and
   the degree of the Granger causal modeling defined influence was found
   not altered by AD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report the photophysics and fluorescence quenching of a series of
   monodisperse, anionic pi-conjugated oligomers that are molecularly
   dissolved in aqueous solution. These structurally well-defined oligomers
   feature oligo(phenylene ethynylene) backbones with two -CH2COO- units on
   each repeat unit, with overall lengths of 5, 7, and 9 repeats. The ionic
   oligomers display a structured fluorescence band with high quantum
   efficiency in water, in contrast to the low fluorescence quantum
   efficiency and pronounced aggregation displayed by structurally, similar
   oligomeric and polymeric (phenylene ethynylene) conjugated
   polyelectrolytes studied previously. Stern-Volmer (SV) fluorescence
   quenching studies using cationic charge- and energy-transfer quenchers
   reveal that all of the oligomers give rise to SV quenching constants
   (K-sv) in excess of 10(6) M-1, with values increasing with oligomer
   length, consistent with the amplified quenching effect The amplified
   quenching effect is proposed to occur due to the formation of
   comparatively small oligomer aggregates. SECTION: Spectroscopy,

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the kinematic analysis of a three-degree of freedom
   (DOF) compliant platform able to move in three dimensional space. The
   device is formed by the actuators, a central moving platform, and
   compliant joints. The actuators are three binary links. The moving
   platform is an equilateral plate. Springs connect the free end of each
   actuator with each vertex of the central platform. In this way, the
   motion of the actuators is transmitted to the moving platform. Compliant
   joints increase the complexity of the motion of the central platform and
   few studies have been carried out. This paper focuses on the forward and
   reverse analyses for the platform and the derivation of equations that

   The solar dryer was constructed and operated in Gainesville, Florida,
   during the summer of 2011. Performance evaluation revealed cabinet
   temperatures between 37.0 degrees C and 43.7 degrees C during sunlight
   hours depending on airflow and loading conditions. Damper restriction
   was shown to effectively control flow rates to adjust temperatures
   within the dryer Operating capacity of the dryer was 9.5 kg of fresh
   mango slices per 36 h, lowering the moisture content from 84.5\% (w.b.)

Abstract = {{The role of asymmetric tidal mixing (ATM) in subtidal estuarine dynamics
   is investigated using a series of generic numerical experiments that
   simulate narrow estuaries under different stratification and external
   forcing conditions. The focus is on quantifying the characteristics of
   ATM-induced flow and its contributions to stratification and salt
   transport. The flow induced by ATM has a two-layer vertical structure in
   periodically stratified estuaries, similar to that of the density-driven
   flow. It has a three-layer vertical structure in the central regime of
   weakly stratified estuaries, and a reverse two-layer structure in highly
   stratified estuaries. The changes in vertical distribution of
   ATM-induced flows result from the influence of stratification on the
   covariance of eddy viscosity and vertical shear. Such covariance
   represents the driving force of ATM-induced flow in the tidally averaged
   momentum equation. Compared to density-driven flow, ATM-induced flow
   dominates in periodically stratified estuaries with strong tides, has
   the same order of magnitude in weakly stratified estuaries with moderate
   tides, and is less important in highly stratified estuaries with weak
   tides. In contrast to density-driven flow that always increases
   estuarine stratification and transports salt landward, the ATM-induced
   flow exhibits different behaviors because of its varying vertical
   structure. In estuaries with strong tides, ATM-induced flow tends to
   enhance stratification and to transport salt landward, similar to
   density-driven flow. In estuaries with weak tides, ATM-induced flow
   tends to reduce stratification and to transport salt seaward.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments at the ionospheric heating facility of the High Frequency
   Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) are performed employing dual HF
   beams amplitude modulated at ELF/VLF with a phase offset between the two
   modulation waveforms. The amplitude of the observed ELF/VLF waves is
   strongly dependent on the imposed ELF/VLF phase offset, the modulation
   waveform, and the orientation of the HF beams. Data from two ground
   stations are interpreted using simulations of modulated heating power
   envelopes as well as a comprehensive model of ionospheric ELF/VLF
   generation. It is found that two colocated vertical beams HF beams
   excite a single ionospheric ELF/VLF source, but independent ELF/VLF
   sources can be induced in the ionospheric region above the heater if the
   HF beams are offset from zenith to intersect at their 3dB points.
   Furthermore, the use of two vertical HF beams with ELF phase offset is
   found to be a potential diagnostic method for the ionospheric D region.}},

Title = {{General and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Face-Space Approach to Emotion
   Recognition}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Facial expressions of a person representing similar emotion are not
   always unique. Naturally, the facial features of a subject taken from
   different instances of the same emotion have wide variations. In the
   presence of two or more facial features, the variation of the attributes
   together makes the emotion recognition problem more complicated. This
   variation is the main source of uncertainty in the emotion recognition
   problem, which has been addressed here in two steps using type-2 fuzzy
   sets. First a type-2 fuzzy face space is constructed with the background
   knowledge of facial features of different subjects for different
   emotions. Second, the emotion of an unknown facial expression is
   determined based on the consensus of the measured facial features with
   the fuzzy face space. Both interval and general type-2 fuzzy sets
   (GT2FS) have been used separately to model the fuzzy face space. The
   interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) involves primary membership functions
   for m facial features obtained from n-subjects, each having l-instances
   of facial expressions for a given emotion. The GT2FS in addition to
   employing the primary membership functions mentioned above also involves
   the secondary memberships for individual primary membership curve, which
   has been obtained here by formulating and solving an optimization
   problem. The optimization problem here attempts to minimize the
   difference between two decoded signals: the first one being the type-1
   defuzzification of the average primary membership functions obtained
   from the n-subjects, while the second one refers to the type-2
   defuzzified signal for a given primary membership function with
   secondary memberships as unknown. The uncertainty management policy
   adopted using GT2FS has resulted in a classification accuracy of
   98.333\% in comparison to 91.667\% obtained by its interval type-2
   counterpart. A small improvement (approximately 2.5\%) in classification
   accuracy by IT2FS has been attained by pre-processing measurements using
   the well-known interval approach.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to better characterize parameters influencing
   the exchange of surface water in south Florida's C-111 canal and
   Biscayne aquifer using the analytical model STWT1. A three-step model
   evaluation framework was implemented as follows: (1) qualitative
   parameter ranking by comparing two Morris method sampling strategies,
   (2) quantitative variance-based sensitivity analysis using Sobol's
   method, and (3) estimation of parameter posterior probability
   distributions and statistics using the Generalized Likelihood
   Uncertainty Estimator (GLUE) methodology. Results indicated that the
   original Morris random sampling method underestimated total parameter
   effects compared to the improved global Morris sampling strategy.
   However, parameter rankings from the two sampling methods were similar.
   For the STWT1 model, only four out of the six parameters analyzed were
   important for predicting water table response to canal stage and
   recharge fluctuations. Morris ranking in order of decreasing importance
   resulted in specific yield (ASY), aquifer saturated thickness (AB),
   horizontal hydraulic conductivity (AKA), canal leakance (XAA), vertical
   hydraulic conductivity (AKZ), and half-width of canal (XZERO). Sobol's
   sensitivity indices for the four most critical parameters revealed that
   summation of first-order parameter effects was 1.0, indicating that
   STWT1 behaved as an additive model or negligible parameter interactions.
   We estimated parameter values of 0.07 to 0.14 for ASY, 11,000 to 14,300
   m d(-1) for AKX; 13.4 to 18.3 m for AB, and 99.8 to 279 m for XAA. The
   estimated values were within the range of values estimated using more
   complex methods at nearby sites. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of
   efficiency and root mean square error for estimated parameters ranged
   from 0.66 to 0.95 and from 4 to 7 cm, respectively This study
   demonstrates a simple and inexpensive way to characterize
   hydrogeological parameters controlling groundwater-surface interactions
   in any region with aquifers that are highly permeable without using
   standard pumping tests or canal drawdown experiments. Hydrogeological
   parameters estimated using this approach could be used as starting
   values in large-scale numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The Florida Everglades is a P limited, freshwater wetland ecosystem. In
   many cases, soil P concentrations in tree islands in the Everglades
   greatly exceed concentrations in the surrounding marsh; however, little
   information is available regarding the characteristics of P in tree
   island soil. Surface soil samples from 26 tree islands were analyzed for
   total elements, distribution of soil P forms, and soil mineralogy. Total
   phosphorus (TP) concentrations of soil ranged from 0.764 to 88.1 g
   kg(-1). Most (>80\%) of the TP in high P hammock soils was bound in an
   inorganic form (HCl-extractable), while organic P accounted for a
   relatively small (similar to 10\%) proportion. Total P was positively
   correlated with non-carbonate inorganic soil matter (i.e., non-carbon
   matter, r = 0.98, p < 0.001), non-carbonate calcium (NCCa, r = 0.98, p <
   0.001), and HCl-extractable phosphorus (HCl-P, r = 0.997, p < 0.001).
   Apatite was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in soils with elevated
   P concentration. These soils also contained bone fragments. The high
   proportion of HCl-P observed in tree island soil coupled with a positive
   relationship between NCCa and P concentration is evidence for an
   exogenous P source. The presence of apatite and bone fragments in tree
   island soils indicates that deposition of biogenic apatite contributes
   to the soil P pool.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{556-562}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Porous core-shell microcapsules were obtained by assembling graphene
   layers on zeolite surfaces during amorphization process. When fused onto
   the surface, the self-assembled graphene layers played a role as
   `isolation bubbles' that prevented the vapor releasing from bulk
   zeolites. The self-steaming of vapor served as the foaming agent of
   bringing the porous structure inside zeolites but also created an
   expansive force to form microcapsules. Due to their porous structures,
   the as-produced microcapsules showed excellent slow-release
   characteristics. The release of potassium from the microcapsules reaches
   equilibrium after 27 days, much slower than that from zeolites (2 days).
   We believe that the new microcapsules can be used as controlled-release
   agent for delivery of chemical compounds (e.g., fertilizers) as well as
   be used as microreactors, micro-devices, sensors, and catalysts. In
   addition, it is anticipated that the new synthesis route, especially
   using graphene layers to mediate amorphization, may be extended to other
   reactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   namely, for axisymmetric loadings and plane strain conditions, the

Title = {{Development and application of an instrument for spatially resolved
   Seebeck coefficient measurements}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The Seebeck coefficient is a key indicator of the majority carrier type
   (electrons or holes) in a material. The recent trend toward the
   development of combinatorial materials research methods has necessitated
   the development of a new high-throughput approach to measuring the
   Seebeck coefficient at spatially distinct points across any sample. The
   overall strategy of the high-throughput experiments is to quickly
   identify the region of interest on the sample at some expense of
   accuracy, and then study this region by more conventional techniques.
   The instrument for spatially resolved Seebeck coefficient measurements
   reported here relies on establishing a temperature difference across the
   entire compositionally graded thin-film and consecutive mapping of the
   resulting voltage as a function of position, which facilitates the
   temperature-dependent measurements up to 400 degrees C. The results of
   the designed instrument are verified at ambient temperature to be
   repeatable over 10 identical samples and accurate to within 10\% versus
   conventional Seebeck coefficient measurements over the -100 to +150 mu
   V/K range using both n-type and p-type conductive oxides as test cases.
   The developed instrument was used to determine the sign of electrical
   carriers of compositionally graded Zn-Co-O and Ni-Co-O libraries
   prepared by combinatorial sputtering. As a result of this study, both
   cobalt-based materials were determined to have p-type conduction over a
   broad single-phase region of chemical compositions and small variation
   of the Seebeck coefficient over the entire investigated range of
   compositions and temperature. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{The use of a metric to assess distance between probability densities is
   an important practical problem. In this work, a particular metric
   induced by an a-divergence is studied. The Hellinger metric can be
   interpreted as a particular case within the framework of generalized
   Tsallis divergences and entropies. The nonparametric Parzen's density
   estimator emerges as a natural candidate to estimate the underlying
   probability density function, since it may account for data from
   different groups, or experiments with distinct instrumental precisions,
   i.e., non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data.
   However, the information theoretic derived metric of the nonparametric
   Parzen's density estimator displays infinite variance, limiting the
   direct use of resampling estimators. Based on measure theory, we present
   a change of measure to build a finite variance density allowing the use
   of resampling estimators. In order to counteract the poor scaling with
   dimension, we propose a new nonparametric two-stage robust resampling
   estimator of Hellinger's metric error bounds for heterocedastic data.
   The approach presents very promising results allowing the use of
   different covariances for different clusters with impact on the distance
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Cranial irradiation for the treatment of brain tumors causes a delayed
   and progressive cognitive decline that is pronounced in young patients.
   Dysregulation of neural stem and progenitor cells is thought to
   contribute to these effects by altering early childhood brain
   development. Earlier work has shown that irradiation creates a chronic
   neuroinflammatory state that severely and selectively impairs postnatal
   and adult neurogenesis. Here we show that irradiation induces a
   transient non-classical cytokine response with selective upregulation of
   CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Absence of CCL2
   signaling in the hours after irradiation is alone sufficient to
   attenuate chronic microglia activation and allow the recovery of
   neurogenesis in the weeks following irradiation. This identifies CCL2
   signaling as a potential clinical target for moderating the long-term
   defects in neural stem cell function following cranial radiation in
   children. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   applications of Doppler radar that remotely detects heartbeat and
   respiration of a human subject. In the last decade, new front-end
   architectures, baseband signal processing methods, and system-level
   integrations have been proposed by many researchers in this field to
   improve the detection accuracy and robustness. The advantages of
   noncontact detection have drawn interests in various applications, such
   as energy smart home, baby monitor, cardiopulmonary activity assessment,
   and tumor tracking. While many of the reported systems were bench-top
   prototypes for concept verification, several portable systems and
   integrated radar chips have been demonstrated. This paper reviews
   different architectures, baseband signal processing, and system
   implementations. Validations of this technology in a clinical
   environment will also be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study characterized dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) that is
   discharged from the Everglades Agricultural Area as part of the larger
   pool of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM). Whole water samples
   collected at the Everglades stormwater treat area 1 West (STA-1 W) were
   fractionated using a batch ultrafiltration method to separate organic
   compounds based on apparent molecular weight (AMW). Each AMW fraction of
   DOM was characterized for phosphorus, carbon, nitrogen, UV absorbance,
   and fluorescence. The DOP content of the Everglades water matrix was
   characteristically variable constituting 4-56\% of total phosphorus (TP)
   and demonstrated no correlation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
   Measured values for DOP exceeded 14 mu g L-1 in four out of five
   sampling dates making phosphorus load reductions problematic for the
   stormwater treatment areas (STAs), which target inorganic phosphorus and
   have a goal of 10 mu g L-1 as TP. The molecular weight distributions
   revealed 40\% of DOP is high molecular weight, aromatic-rich DOM. The
   results of this research are expected to be of interest to environmental
   chemists, environmental engineers, and water resources managers because
   DOP presents a major obstacle to achieving TP levels <10 mu g L-1. (C)

Abstract = {{Jet-induced catering in a granular bed is an interesting phenomenon
   observed in nature and in many industries. This paper presents a
   numerical study of this process by the combined approach of
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for gas phase and discrete element
   method (DEM) for solid phase. The applicability of the model is verified
   by comparing the numerical results with experimental measurements of
   crater depth and crater shape in the cratering regime of Diffusion
   Driven Flow. The sensitivity of numerical results to model parameters
   such as restitution coefficient, sliding friction coefficient and
   Young's modulus is also examined. Then, the effect of jet velocity is
   quantified, followed by a detailed analysis of flow characteristics and
   forces between particles, as well as between particles and fluid, to
   understand the underlying mechanisms. Based on the simulated results,
   two equations are respectively formulated to estimate the asymptotic
   crater depth and crater width. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Western Australian wheat-belt has experienced more rainfall decline
   than any other wheat-cropping region in Australia. Future climate change
   scenarios suggest that the Western Australian wheat-belt is likely to
   see greater future reductions in rainfall than other regions, together
   with a further increase in temperatures. While these changes appear
   adverse for water-limited rain-fed agriculture, a close analysis of the
   changes and their impacts reveals a more complex story. Twentieth
   century changes in rainfall, temperature and atmospheric CO2
   concentration have had little or no overall impact on wheat yields.
   Changes in agricultural technology and farming systems have had much
   larger impacts. Contrary to some claims, there is no scientific or
   economic justification for any immediate actions by farmers to adapt to
   long-term climate change in the Western Australian wheat-belt, beyond
   normal responses to short-term variations in weather. Rather than
   promoting current change, the most important policy response is research
   and development to enable farmers to facilitate future adaptation to
   climate change. Research priorities are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio technology enables secondary users (SUs) to
   opportunistically use the vacant licensed spectrum and significantly
   improves the utilization of spectrum resource. Traditional architectures
   for cognitive radio networks (CRNs), such as cognitive cellular networks
   and cognitive ad hoc networks, impose energy-consuming cognitive radios
   to SUs' devices for communication and cannot efficiently utilize the
   spectrum harvested from the primary users (PUs). To enhance the spectrum
   and energy efficiencies of CRNs, we have designed a new architecture,
   which is called the Cognitive Capacity Harvesting network (CCH). In CCH,
   a collection of relay stations (RSs) with cognitive capability are
   deployed to facilitate the accessing of SUs. In this way, the
   architecture not only removes the requirement of cognitive radios from
   SUs and reduces their energy consumption, but also increases frequency
   reuse and enhances spectrum efficiency. In view of the importance of the
   RSs on the improvement of spectrum and energy efficiencies, in this
   paper, we study the RS placement strategy in CCH. A cost minimization
   problem is mathematically formulated under the spectrum and energy
   efficiency constraints. Considering the NP-hardness of the problem, we
   design a framework of heuristic algorithms to compute the near-optimal
   solutions. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms
   outperform the random placement strategy and the number of required RSs
   obtained by our algorithms is always within 2 times of that in the
   optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{MREIT is a new imaging modality that can be used to reconstruct
   high-resolution conductivity images of the human body. Since
   conductivity values of cancerous tissues in the breast are significantly
   higher than those of surrounding normal tissues, breast imaging using
   MREIT may provide a new noninvasive way of detecting early stage of
   cancer. In this paper, we present results of experimental and numerical
   simulation studies of breast MREIT. We built a realistic
   three-dimensional model of the human breast connected to a simplified
   model of the chest including the heart and evaluated the ability of
   MREIT to detect cancerous anomalies in a background material with
   similar electrical properties to breast tissue. We performed numerical
   simulations of various scenarios in breast MREIT including assessment of
   the effects of fat inclusions and effects related to noise levels, such
   as changing the amplitude of injected currents, effect of added noise
   and number of averages. Phantom results showed straightforward detection
   of cancerous anomalies in a background was possible with low currents
   and few averages. The simulation results showed it should be possible to
   detect a cancerous anomaly in the breast, while restricting the maximal
   current density in the heart below published levels for nerve
   excitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model for the elastic contact between a rigid sphere and an ideal
   elastic foundation with adhesion has been developed. The model was
   derived by integrating the full Lennard-Jones potential to arrive at a
   closed-form equilibrium condition that balances surface energy with
   strain energy. It was found that the separation height is not a function
   of the penetration. Using this energy criterion for separation of
   contact in an elastic foundation, a model for the force displacement
   relationship was then developed. In this derivation there exists a
   tensile zone of deformation along the perimeter of the contact. The
   model also reveals a number of unique aspects of the adhesive contact,
   including: the maximum adhesion occurs when the apex of the sphere is
   tangent to the plane of the undeformed surface, the maximum adhesion
   force , and the contact area is linearly dependent on penetration. The
   ability to fit high fidelity indentation data from finite-element
   analysis and molecular dynamics simulation for thin films was
   demonstrated. Additionally, experiments were performed on thin films
   (similar to 40 mu m) of PDMS using a custom-built microtribometer with
   in situ optical interferometry that enabled simultaneous measurements of
   contact area, penetration depths, externally applied force, and the
   detailed measurements of the free-surface deformations, which include
   the predicted tensile zone along the perimeter of contact.}},

Abstract = {{In-memory nearest neighbor computation is a typical collaborative
   filtering approach for high recommendation accuracy. However, this
   approach is not scalable given the huge number of customers and items in
   typical commercial applications. Cluster-based collaborative filtering
   techniques can be a remedy for the efficiency problem, but they usually
   provide relatively lower accuracy figures, since they may become
   over-generalized and produce less-personalized recommendations. Our
   research explores an individualistic strategy which initially clusters
   the users and then exploits the members within clusters, but not just
   the cluster representatives, during the recommendation generation stage.
   We provide an efficient implementation of this strategy by adapting a
   specifically tailored cluster-skipping inverted index structure.
   Experimental results reveal that the individualistic strategy with the
   cluster-skipping index is a good compromise that yields high accuracy
   and reasonable scalability figures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{36-43}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Warm-season turfgrasses may be subjected to increasing drought as future
   urban irrigation regulations become more restrictive. Species
   differences in water use and transpiration response to drying soil may
   be exploited in the future to increase survival and maintain green color
   under drying soil conditions. This study was undertaken to provide
   background documentation on the sensitivity to soil-water deficit of
   three warm-season grasses: `Argentine' bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum);
   `Floratam' St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum), and `Empire'
   zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica). Each of these turfgrasses demonstrated a
   two-phased linear transpiration response to gradually drying soil as
   expressed by a normalized ratio between the transpiration rates of
   drought stressed to well-watered plants (NTR). In this study,
   well-watered bahiagrass used 30\% more water on a daily basis than did
   well-watered St. Augustinegrass or zoysiagrass. However, under drought,
   the three grass species transpired the same amount of water during the
   soil drying period up until NTR to 0.1. Since bahiagrass reached an NTR
   of 0.1 at 10.3 days versus 12.7 and 13.0 days for St. Augustinegrass and
   zoysiagrass, respectively, bahiagrass demonstrated a more rapid water
   loss rate during the drying period. The fraction of transpirable soil
   water (FTSW) remaining in the soil at the breakpoints for bahiagrass,
   St. Augustinegrass and zoysiagrass were 0.13, 0.16, and 0.19,
   respectively, in 2010, but were 0.18, 0.30, and 0.22, respectively,
   under slightly warmer conditions in 2011. The consistently low FTSW
   breakpoint for bahiagrass means that compared to the other species,
   bahiagrass continues to use water at a high rate late into the soil
   drying cycle before conserving soil water by decreasing stomatal
   conductance. That is, bahiagrass is likely to be subjected to greater
   soil-water deficits in lengthy droughts and needs mechanisms to better
   survive these droughts. The differences in breakpoints by year may be
   due to a combination of soil factors and temperature differences in the
   greenhouse. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Use of literature crop coefficient (K (c)) values for quantifying
   evapotranspiration (ETc) under non-standard conditions such as plastic
   mulch, shallow water table, and sub-tropical conditions can lead to

   crop growing seasons in south Florida to quantity bi-weekly ETc and K
   (c) for bell pepper grown under shallow water table and plastic mulch
   environments using large drainage lysimeters. The ETc values varied from
   205 to 320 mm with a seasonal average of 267 mm. Average K (c) values
   for bell pepper for development, mid-season, and late stages were 1.05,
   1.21, and 1.28, respectively. Higher than literature initial K (c)
   values were due to rainfall and use of sub-irrigation system to maintain
   artificially high water table which results in high soil moisture in the
   bare soil area-such high moisture results in high evaporation. The K (c)
   values from this study were statistically higher than literature values.
   Use of literature K (c) values resulted in underestimating ETc by
   27-37\%. The K (c) values would provide improved estimates of
   sub-irrigated pepper ETc in subtropical Florida and elsewhere with

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method to maximize the throughput of a single-lane
   approach with a branched configuration (one-lane arterial with multiple
   turn bays at the intersection approach). Field observations determined
   that, for such an intersection approach, turn bays can be efficiently
   used only for a limited amount of time after the start of green, and
   setting the maximum green too high will result in loss of efficiency.
   The proposed method provides equations for estimating the maximum green
   that would maximize throughput and suggests repeating the phase twice in
   the cycle, such that the multilane section can be filled up each time
   before the green is given. After the new approach is presented and
   discussed, it is applied to modify the signalization pattern of an
   existing signalized intersection. This study site is along a single-lane
   arterial with three lanes at the stop bar: left turn, through and right
   turn. The new signalization pattern is applied at the study site, and
   the field evaluation of the before and after conditions are reported. It
   was concluded that the new scheme increased the throughput of the

Abstract = {{Nixtamalization, a key production step for masa flour used for tacos,

   W/g for 1 h during cooking followed by brief steeping for 1 h. The
   cooked kernels (nixtamal) were evaluated for texture and color, while

Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{611}},
Pages = {{40-48}},

Abstract = {{We used temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) to
   investigate the adsorption and complete oxidation of propane on various
   surface oxygen phases which evolve during the growth and reduction of
   PdO(101) films on Pd(111). Desorption spectra reveal clear differences
   in the binding of molecular propane on the different oxygen phases
   investigated, including the p(2 x 2)-O chemisorbed phase on Pd(111),
   two-dimensional (2D) oxide(s) and multilayer PdO(101) thin films. We
   find that propane reacts to an immeasurable extent on the p(2 x 2)-O and
   2D oxide phases during TPRS, while reaction is facile on the PdO(101)
   surface. For the partially oxidized and reduced surfaces, we find that
   the CO2 product yield obtained from propane-saturated surfaces increases
   continuously with increasing oxygen coverage above about 1 ML
   (monolayer), and observe a hysteresis in the surface reactivity such
   that more CO2 is produced when a given oxygen coverage is generated
   during the growth vs. reduction of a thin PdO(101) film. We show that
   the fractional areas of coexisting oxygen phases can be estimated by
   fitting propane TPD spectra obtained from partially oxidized surfaces
   with propane TPD spectra obtained from well-defined reference surfaces.
   Based on the estimated surface area fractions, we find that the CO2
   product yields scale linearly with the amount of PdO(101) at the
   surface, irrespective of the types and amounts of coexisting phases, and
   show that the observed hysteresis arises from differences in the
   PdO(101) surface fractions obtained at a given coverage during growth
   and reduction of PdO(101) films. The estimated surface fractions also
   reveal that 2D oxide domains develop during the first stage of PdO(101)
   reduction, while metallic surface domains become prevalent only during
   the latter half of the oxide reduction process. A key finding is that
   the activation of propane on partially oxidized Pd(111) is relatively
   insensitive to the complexity of the surface phase distribution, and
   depends almost exclusively on the amount of PdO(101) domains that are
   present. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Experimental study on the performance of hydrogen production from
   miniature methanol-steam reformer integrated with Swiss-roll type
   combustor for PEMFC}},

Abstract = {{A miniature plate-type hydrogen production reactor using methanol as
   fuel was designed and tested. This reactor is composed of a catalytic
   combustor, vaporizer, reformer, and methanator. All components were
   fabricated on one piece of rectangular quartz glass plate 50 mm x 44 mm
   x 7 mm in size. The combustor was fabricated on one side of the glass
   plate with a Swiss-roll type channel in which the Pt/Al2O3 particles
   were loaded in segmented form to catalyze the combustion. A spiral
   channel was fabricated on the other side of the plate and divided into
   three sections: a vaporizer for liquid methanol-water mixture
   vaporization, a reformer for methanol-steam reforming catalyzed by
   CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 particles and a methanator for carbon monoxide (CO)
   removal catalyzed by Ru/Al2O3 particles.
   The test results indicated that this reactor successfully produced H-2
   and had thermal efficiency ranging from 13\% to 35\%. The reactor
   performance depends on the feed rates to the combustor and reformer,
   respectively. High methanol conversion can be obtained from either a low
   feed rate to the reformer or a high feed rate to the combustor. However,
   both cases also produce high CO concentrations. The CO methanation
   reaction was used to reduce the CO concentration. It was found that the
   methanation reaction depends greatly on the reactor temperature with
   high temperature not being favorable to this reaction. High CO
   conversion and low H-2 consumption with low methanol conversion result
   when the reaction temperature is low. Thermal management for producing
   suitable temperature and catalyst activity improvement in high reaction
   temperature for the methanator are both needed in the integrated reactor
   design to reduce the CO concentration down to acceptable levels for fuel
   cell operation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical resistance properties of a sandwich panel comprised of
   fiber reinforced plastic face sheets and a polyol-isocyanate foam core
   were investigated for use as a structural building component or cladding
   system. Foam density and thickness were varied to determine the effect
   on the sandwich panel behavior. The foam materials were tested in direct
   uniaxial compression and tension. Panel strips were tested under
   four-point bending. A full-size panel was subjected to uniform
   out-of-plane loading in a pressure loading actuator to simulate service
   conditions. Measured strains and displacements closely match results
   from finite element modeling using the constitutive properties of the
   polyol-isocyanate foam obtained from the uniaxial compression and
   tension tests as inputs. The findings indicate that the sandwich
   structure is suitable for lightweight building cladding systems used in
   high wind areas. Deflection is the controlling design factor for
   out-of-plane loading. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a new approach using the Bayesian framework for the
   reconstruction of sparse Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The
   algorithm, named SLIM, can be thought of as a sparse signal recovery
   algorithm with excellent sidelobe suppression and high resolution
   properties. For a given sparsity promoting prior, SLIM cyclically
   minimizes a regularized least square cost function. We show how SLIM can
   be used for SAR image reconstruction as well as SAR image enhancement.
   We evaluate the performance of SLIM by using realistically simulated
   complex-valued backscattered data from a backhoe vehicle. The numerical
   results show that SLIM can satisfactorily suppress the sidelobes and
   yield higher resolution than the conventional matched filter or
   delay-and-sum (DAS) approach. SLIM outperforms the widely used
   compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm, which requires
   the delicate choice of user parameters. Compared with the recently
   developed iterative adaptive approach (IAA), which iteratively solves a
   weighted least squares problem, SLIM is much faster. Due to the
   computational complexity involved with SAR imaging, we show how SLIM can
   be made even more computationally efficient by utilizing the fast
   Fourier transform (FFT) and conjugate gradient (CG) method to carry out
   its computations. Furthermore, since SLIM is derived under the Bayesian
   model, the a posteriori distribution given by the algorithm provides us
   with a confident measure regarding the statistical properties of the SAR
   image pixels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial judgments are important for many real-world tasks in engineering
   and scientific visualization. While existing research provides evidence
   that higher levels of display and interaction fidelity in virtual
   reality systems offer advantages for spatial understanding, few
   investigations have focused on small-scale spatial judgments or employed
   experimental tasks similar to those used in real-world applications.
   After an earlier study that considered a broad analysis of various
   spatial understanding tasks, we present the results of a follow-up study
   focusing on small-scale spatial judgments. In this research, we
   independently controlled field of regard, stereoscopy, and head-tracked
   rendering to study their effects on the performance of a task involving
   precise spatial inspections of complex 3D structures. Measuring time and
   errors, we asked participants to distinguish between structural gaps and
   intersections between components of 3D models designed to be similar to
   real underground cave systems. The overall results suggest that the
   addition of the higher fidelity system features support performance
   improvements in making small-scale spatial judgments. Through analyses
   of the effects of individual system components, the experiment shows
   that participants made significantly fewer errors with either an
   increased field of regard or with the addition of head-tracked
   rendering. The results also indicate that participants performed
   significantly faster when the system provided the combination of stereo
   and head-tracked rendering.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent pain is an important cause of patient dissatisfaction after
   unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) and has been correlated with
   localized tibial strain. However, the factors that influence these
   strains are not well understood. To address this issue, we created
   finite element models to examine the effect on tibial strain of: (1)
   muscle forces (estimated using instrumented knee data) acting on
   attachment sites on the proximal tibia, (2) UKR implantation, (3)
   loading position, and (4) changes in gait pattern. Muscle forces acting
   on the tibia had no significant influence on strains within the
   periprosthetic region, but UKR implantation increased strain by 20\%.
   Strain also significantly increased if the region of load application
   was moved >3mm medially. The strain within the periprosthetic region was
   found to be dependent on gait pattern and was influenced by both medial
   and lateral loads, with the medial load having a greater effect
   (regression coefficients: medial=0.74, lateral=0.30). These findings
   suggest that tibial strain is increased after UKR and may be a cause of
   pain. It may be possible to reduce pain through modification of surgical
   factors or through altered gait patterns. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research

Abstract = {{A high speed framing camera and a particle image velocimetry instrument
   were used to determine the properties of explosively driven particle
   fields in early microsecond and later millisecond times. Test items were
   configured in a two inch long cylindrical shape with a half inch
   diameter core of organic explosive. The core was surrounded by a
   particle bed of aluminum or tungsten powder of a specific particle size
   distribution. Position data from the leading edge of the particle fronts
   for each charge was recorded with a high speed framing camera at early
   time and with a particle image velocimetry (PIV) instrument at later
   time to determine particle velocity. Using a PIV image, a velocity
   gradient along the length of the particle field was established by using
   the mean particle velocity value determined from three separate
   horizontal bands that transverse the particle field. The results showed
   slower particles at the beginning of the particle field closest to the
   source and faster ones at the end. Differences in particle dispersal,
   luminescence, and agglomeration were seen when changes in the initial
   particle size and material type were made. The aluminum powders showed
   extensive luminescence with agglomeration forming large particle
   structures while the tungsten powder showed little luminescence,
   agglomeration and no particle structures. Combining velocity data from
   the high speed framing camera and PIV, the average drag coefficient for
   each powder type was determined. The particle field velocities and drag
   coefficients at one meter showed good agreement with the numerical data
   produced from a computational fluid dynamics code that takes advantage
   of both Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers to track individual particles
   after a set post detonation time interval. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Dynamic factor analysis of surface water management impacts on soil and
   bedrock water contents in Southern Florida Lowlands}},

Abstract = {{As part of the C111 spreader canal project, structural and operational
   modifications involving incremental raises in canal stage are planned
   along one of the major canals (i.e., C111) separating Everglades
   National Park and agricultural production areas to the east of the park.
   This study used Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) as an alternative tool to
   physically based models to explore the relationship between different
   hydrologic variables and the effect of proposed changes in surface water
   management on soil and bedrock water contents in south Florida. To
   achieve the goal, objectives were to: (1) use DFA to identify the most
   important factors affecting temporal variation in soil and bedrock water
   contents, (2) develop a simplified DFA based regression model for
   predicting soil and bedrock water contents as a function of canal stage
   and (3) assess the effect of the proposed incremental raises in canal
   stage on soil and bedrock water contents. DFA revealed that five common
   trends were the minimum required to describe unexplained variation in
   the 11 time series studied. Introducing canal stage, water table
   evaporation and net recharge resulted in lower Akaike information
   criterion (AIC) and higher Nash-Sutcliffe (C-eff) values. Results
   indicated that canal stage significantly (t>2) drives temporal variation
   in soil and bedrock water contents, which was represented as scaled
   frequency while net surface recharge was significant in seven out of the
   11 time series analyzed. The effect of water table evaporation was not
   significant at all sites. Results also indicated that the most important
   factor influencing temporal variation in soil and bedrock water contents
   in terms of regression coefficient magnitude was canal stage. Based on
   DFA results, a simple regression model was developed to predict soil and
   bedrock water contents at various elevations as a function of canal
   stage and net recharge. The performance of the simple model ranged from
   good (C-eff ranging from 0.56 to 0.74) to poor (C-eff ranging from 0.10
   to 0.15), performance was better at sites with smaller depths to water
   table (<1 m) highlighting the effect of micro-topography on soil and
   bedrock water content dynamics. Assessment of the effect of 6, 9 and 12
   cm increases in canal stage using the simple regression model indicated
   that changes in temporal variation in soil and bedrock water contents
   were negligible (average < 1.0\% average change) at 500-2000 m from C111
   (or low elevations) which may be attributed to the near saturation
   conditions already occurring at these sites. This study used DFA to
   explore the relationship between soil and bedrock water dynamics and
   surface water stage in shallow water table environments. This approach
   can be applied to any system in which detailed physical modeling would
   be limited by inadequate information on parameters or processes
   governing the physical system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Bathymetric influences on tidal currents at the entrance to a highly
   stratified, shallow estuary}},
Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Bathymetric effects on tidal currents are investigated at Main Pass,
   which is the primary inlet of Mobile Bay, Alabama. A 12-h ship-mounted
   ADCP survey, which covered nearly one-half of the diurnal tide during
   flood conditions, included 24 repetitions. The resulting velocity data
   demonstrate significant tidal variability in the horizontal and vertical
   current structure between the ship channel and the shoals. The diurnal
   tidal flows, the dominant tidal forcing, are 72 degrees (4.8 h) ahead of
   the water level throughout shallower areas of Main Pass, indicating
   near-standing wave conditions. Moving across the mouth, a phase lag
   (5.37 degrees or 20 min) develops with the deep channel tidal currents
   lagging the shoal region. The vertical tidal structure is also modified
   across the mouth where near-bottom flows change their direction first in
   the ship channel, while near-surface flows change their direction first
   over the western shoal. This may be related to the seaward pressure
   gradient associated with the relatively large (similar to 1715 m(3)/s)
   freshwater discharge or the discharge interaction with a nearby opening,
   Pass-aux-Herons. Current magnitudes over the shoals and in the ship
   channel vary by as much as 1 m/s. Flows at the east side of Main Pass,
   close to Mobile Point, behave oppositely to those in the rest of the
   transect during the survey. This inconsistent flow pattern is caused by
   an anticyclonic eddy that is triggered by flow separation at Mobile
   Point. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We use frequency dependent capacitance measurements to probe carrier
   mobilities and transport parameters of six representative semiconducting
   polymers and some of their bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends. With a
   suitable choice of a hole injection layer, well-defined signals for hole
   transport characterization can be obtained for the pristine polymers
   {[}J. Appl. Phys. 99, 013706 (2006)]. However, ill-defined signals with
   negative capacitances, arising from undesirable electron leakages, are
   obtained for the BHJ blends. The problem of electron leakage can be
   circumvented by inserting an electron blocking and trapping layer under
   the cathode. As a result, hole transport properties of BHJ blends can be
   obtained. For the BHJ of poly(3-hexylthiophene) blended with
   {[}6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM), the hole
   mobilities seem to be insensitive to the composition of the BHJ,
   indicating the P3HT component in the BHJ is well connected. On the other
   hand, for
   poly{[}N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-b
   enzothiadia zole)] doped with {[}6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl
   ester (PCDTBT:PC71BM), a clear reduction of the hole mobility is
   observed as the polymer composition is reduced. Temperature dependent
   experiments were performed. The data are analyzed by the Gaussian
   Disorder Model. We found that the energetic disorder is independent of
   the composition of the BHJ. Organic photovoltaic performances of BHJ
   blends are also measured in this contribution. The correlation between
   device performance and energetic disorder of the BHJ will be discussed.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, fabrication and characterization of a
   tip-tilt-piston (UP) piezoelectric micromirror. A unique double S-shaped
   unimorph piezoelectric (dSUP) actuator design is employed. The dSUP
   actuator design can generate large vertical displacement. With four such
   actuators symmetrically located on the four sides of the mirror plate,
   both tip and tilt as well as piston motion can be realized. Lead
   zirconate titanate (PZT) is used due to its high piezoelectric
   coefficient and it is fabricated with a sol-gel method. The Zr/Ti ratio
   of the PZT material is 53/47. The dSUP actuators consist of
   Pt/Ti/PZT/Pt/Ti/SiO2 multilayers. The thickness of the PZT layer is 0.7
   mu m. The 1.1 mm x 1.1 mm mirror plate is backed by a 50 mu m-thick
   single-crystal silicon layer to ensure the flatness. Backside deep
   silicon etching and front-side isotropic silicon undercut are used to
   release the device. Experiments show that the resonant frequency of the
   tip-tilt scan modes is 3.5 kHz. 27 mu m vertical displacement was
   observed under 5 V DC driving of one pair of opposite actuator and the
   scan angle can achieve 9.65 under sine wave resonant driving at 2 V
   amplitude on one pair of opposite actuator. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated. AFLs with
   various Ni-GDC compositions (50-80 wt\% NiO in AFL before reduction)
   were quantified by a 3D reconstruction technique using a focused ion
   beam (FIB)/scanning electron microscope (SEM) dual beam system. Each AFL
   sample was sectioned into 150 slices with 60 nm intervals. Amira
   software allowed for alignment, segmentation, and reconstruction of the
   2D SEM images into a 3D image. From these reconstructions, volume
   fractions, effective particle size, phase gradient, and surface area for
   Ni, GDC, and pore phases were quantified. The estimated phase volume
   fraction was well matched with the theoretical value. The optimal
   effective particle size and highest surface area was observed at 49
   vol\% Ni AFL The active triple phase boundaries were calculated based on
   the connectivity of voxels for each phase. The highest TPB density was
   also achieved at 49 vol\% Ni AFL which is a 1:1 volume ratio of Ni to
   GDC phase. The TPB density shows an inverse proportionality to the
   electrode ASR measured from SOFC operation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Dorsal anterior cingulate and bilateral anterior insula form a task
   control network (TCN) whose primary function includes initiating and
   maintaining task-level cognitive set and exerting top-down regulation of
   sensorimotor processing. The default mode network (DMN), comprising an
   anatomically distinct set of cortical areas, mediates introspection and
   self-referential processes. Resting-state data show that TCN and DMN
   interact. The functional ramifications of their interaction remain
   elusive. Recording fMRI data from human subjects performing a visual
   spatial attention task and correlating Granger causal influences with
   behavioral performance and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity
   we report three main findings. First, causal influences from TCN to DMN,
   i.e., TCN -> DMN, are positively correlated with behavioral performance.
   Second, causal influences from DMN to TCN, i.e., DMN -> TCN, are
   negatively correlated with behavioral performance. Third, stronger DMN
   -> TCN are associated with less elevated BOLD activity in TCN, whereas
   the relationship between TCN -> DMN and DMN BOLD activity is
   unsystematic. These results suggest that, during visual spatial
   attention, top-down signals from TCN to DMN regulate the activity in DMN
   to enhance behavioral performance, whereas signals from DMN to TCN,
   acting possibly as internal noise, interfere with task control, leading
   to degraded behavioral performance.}},

Abstract = {{The use of opioids, which achieve therapeutic analgesia through
   activation of mu-opioid receptors, are limited in the management of
   chronic pain by adverse effects including tolerance and addiction.
   Optogenetics is an emerging approach of designing molecular targets that
   can produce cell-specific receptor-mediated analgesia with minimal side
   effects. Here we report the design and functional characterization of a
   chimeric mu-opioid receptor that could be photoactivated to trigger
   intracellular signaling. A prototype optoactive mu-opioid receptor
   (optoMOR) was designed by replacing the intracellular domains from
   rhodopsin with those of the native mu-opioid receptor and was
   transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells.
   Expression and distribution of the protein were confirmed by
   immunocytochemistry. The signal-transduction mechanisms induced by
   photoactivation of the optoMOR were evaluated and compared with the
   native mu-opioid receptor stimulation by an agonist, D-Ala(2),
   N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol-enkephalin (DAMGO). Cells were depolarized by
   extracellular potassium and the depolarization-induced calcium (Ca2+)
   influx was quantified by using Fura-2 imaging. The forskolin-stimulated
   adenylate cyclase/cAMP cascade was evaluated by ELISA or western
   blotting of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the
   phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). The
   optoMOR protein distribution was observed intracellularly and on the
   plasma membrane similar to the native mu-opioid receptor in HEK293
   cells. Photoactivation of optoMOR decreased the Ca2+ influx and
   inhibited the forskolin-induced cAMP generation, activation of CREB, and
   BDNF levels in optoMOR-expressing cells similar to the activation of
   native mu-opioid receptor by DAMGO. Thus the current study has
   accomplished the design of a prototype optoMOR and characterized the
   cellular signaling mechanisms activated by light stimulation of this
   receptor. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient utilization of cellulose in polymer blends is limited because
   of its high crystallinity. In this work, an attempt to change the
   inherent crystallinity of cellulose was performed by exposing it to two
   systems viz. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-supercritical CO2 and
   DMSO-urea-supercritical CO2. The cellulose samples processed in
   DMSO-supercritical CO2 system at 2500 psi, 3500 psi, and 4500 psi showed
   a reducing trend of the relative crystallinity with increasing pressure.
   The reduction in the relative crystallinity occurred due to weakening of
   inter-chain hydrogen bonds in cellulose. The cellulose samples were
   processed in DMSO-urea-supercritical system at 2500 psi and 4500 psi. A
   maximum 55\% reduction in relative crystallinity was found in the sample
   that contained 1.80 mol fractions of urea and processed at 2500 psi.
   This reduction in crystallinity was due to the presence of a DMSO-urea
   complex, which caused weakening of intermolecular hydrogen bond and an
   intramolecular hydrogen bond. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Prediction of brain-computer interface aptitude from individual brain

Abstract = {{Objective: Brain-computer interface (BCI) provide a non-muscular
   communication channel for patients with impairments of the motor system.
   A significant number of BCI users is unable to obtain voluntary control
   of a BCI-system in proper time. This makes methods that can be used to
   determine the aptitude of a user necessary.
   Methods: We hypothesized that integrity and connectivity of involved
   white matter connections may serve as a predictor of individual
   BCI-performance. Therefore, we analyzed structural data from anatomical
   scans and DTI of motor imagery BCI-users differentiated into high and
   low BCI-aptitude groups based on their over all performance.
   Results: Using a machine learning classification method we identified
   discriminating structural brain trait features and correlated the best
   features with a continuous measure of individual BCI-performance.
   Prediction of the aptitude group of each participant was possible withn
   ear perfect accuracy (one error).
   Conclusions: Tissue volumetric analysis yielded only poor classification
   results. In contrast, the structural integrity and my elination quality
   of deep white matter structures such as the Corpus Callosum, Cingulum,
   and Superior Fronto-Occipital Fascicle were positively correlated with
   individual BCI performance.
   Significance: This confirms that structural brain traits contribute to
   individual performance in BCI use.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Evaporation of a nanoscale meniscus on a nanostructured heater surface
   is simulated using molecular dynamics. The nanostructures, evenly spaced
   on the surface, are ridges with a width and height of 0.55 nm and
   0.96nm, respectively. The simulation results show that the film breaks
   during the early stages of evaporation due to the presence of
   nanostructures and no nonevaporating film forms (unlike a previous
   simulation performed in the absence of nanostructures where
   nonevaporating film forms on the smooth surface). High heat transfer and
   evaporation rates are obtained. We conclude that heat transfer rates can
   be significantly increased during bubble nucleation and growth by the
   presence of nanostructure ridges on the surface as it can break the
   formation of nonevaporating film. This causes additional chaos and
   allows the surrounding cooler liquid to come in contact with the surface
   providing heat transfer enhancements.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of an appropriate conceptual model for data warehouses and OLAP
   systems has led to the tendency to deploy logical models (for example,
   star, snowflake, and constellation schemas) for them as conceptual
   models. ER model extensions, UML extensions, special graphical user
   interfaces, and dashboards have been proposed as conceptual approaches.
   However, they introduce their own problems, are somehow complex and
   difficult to understand, and are not always user-friendly. They also
   require a high learning curve, and most of them address only structural
   design, not considering associated operations. Therefore, they are not
   really an improvement and, in the end, only represent a reflection of
   the logical model. The essential drawback of offering this
   system-centric view as a user concept is that knowledge workers are
   confronted with the full and overwhelming complexity of these systems as
   well as complicated and user-unfriendly query languages such as SQL OLAP
   and MDX. In this article, the authors propose a user-centric conceptual
   model for data warehouses and OLAP systems, called the Cube Algebra. It
   takes the cube metaphor literally and provides the knowledge worker with
   high-level cube objects and related concepts. A novel query language
   leverages well known high-level operations such as roll-up, drill-down,
   slice, and drill-across. As a result, the logical and physical levels
   are hidden from the unskilled end user.}},

Abstract = {{This paper formulates a bi-objective optimization model to determine
   timing plans for coordinated traffic signals along arterials to minimize
   traffic delay and the risk associated with human exposure to traffic
   emissions. Based on a cell-transmission representation of traffic
   dynamics, a modal sensitive emission approach is used to estimate the
   tailpipe emission rate for each cell of a signalized arterial. A
   cell-based Gaussian plume air dispersion model is then employed to
   capture the dispersion of air pollutants and compute the roadside
   pollutant concentrations. A measure of mean excess exposure is further
   defined to represent the risk associated with human exposure to traffic
   pollutants under the wind uncertainty. A signal timing optimization
   model is formulated to optimize the cycle length, offsets, green splits
   and phase sequences to minimize the total system delay and the mean
   excess exposure simultaneously. The hi-objective optimization model is
   solved via a simulation-based genetic algorithm to find a set of Pareto
   optimal solutions. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the
   model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of bathymetry on an estuary plume at an estuary-shelf
   transition is studied with a three-dimensional ocean circulation model.
   To understand the response of the plume to bathymetry, several types of
   estuarine shapes and shelf geometries were adopted in this numerical
   study. The channel's shape and its width-to-depth aspect ratio affected
   the fate of the plume by determining flow characteristics inside the
   estuary. Moreover, the bathymetry of the shelf such as the shelf slope
   and the direction of a submarine channel defined the plume
   characteristics on the shelf. An estuarine channel with a triangular
   cross section generated relatively stronger exchange flows at midestuary
   than a rectangular cross section, which resulted in a larger surface
   plume over the shelf. The extension of the submarine channel onto the
   shelf favored increased plume water transport out to the shelf, a result
   of reduced frictional effects on the shelf. The orientation of the
   submarine channel changed the direction of the plume over the shelf,
   with no additional external forces. Two fronts developed at the edges of
   the submarine channel because of enhanced lateral shears in the flow.
   When the estuary was relatively wide compared to the internal Rossby
   radius (Kelvin number Ke 5), or when the relative strength of the
   freshwater discharge compared to the estuary width was weak (Rossby
   number Ro 0.05), the coastal plume did not expand up-shelf. In fact,
   results indicated that freshwater up-shelf transport in a coastal
   current, moving against Coriolis' accelerations, was proportional to Ro.}},

Abstract = {{The performances of the soil moisture retrieval and assimilation
   algorithms using microwave observations rely on realistic estimates of
   brightness temperatures (T-B) from microwave emission models. This study
   identifies circumstances when current models fail to reliably relate
   near-surface soil moisture to an observed T-B at L-band; offers a
   plausible explanation of the physical cause of these failures; and
   recommends improvements needed so that L-band observations can provide
   reliable estimates of soil moisture, more universally. Physically
   consistent soil parameters and moisture at the surface were estimated by
   using dual-polarized C-band observations during an intensive field
   experiment, for an irrigation event and subsequent drydown. These
   derived parameters were used in conjunction with the in situ moisture in
   deeper layers and different moisture profiles within the moisture
   sensing depth to obtain estimates of H-pol T-B at L-band, that provided
   best matches with the observed T-B. The general assumptions of linear
   moisture distribution, with uniform or exponentially decaying weighting
   functions provided realistic T-B during the later stages of the drydown.
   However, the RMSDs of the T(B)s were upto 10.37 K during the wet period.
   In addition, the use of one value of moisture representing the entire
   moisture sensing depth during this highly dynamic stage of the drydown
   provides unrealistic estimates of emissivity, and hence, T-B at L-band.
   This study recommends use of a hydrological model to provide dynamic,
   realistic soil moisture profiles within the sensing depth and also an
   improved emissivity model that utilizes these detailed profiles for

Title = {{A continuous process to align electrospun nanofibers into parallel and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of nanofibers are
   strongly affected by their orientation. Electrospinning is a nanofiber
   processing technique that typically produces nonwoven meshes of randomly
   oriented fibers. While several alignment techniques exist, they are only
   able to produce either a very thin layer of aligned fibers or larger
   quantities of fibers with less control over their alignment and
   orientation. The technique presented herein fills the gap between these
   two methods allowing one to produce thick meshes of highly oriented
   nanofibers. In addition, this technique is not limited to collection of
   fibers along a single axis. Modifications to the basic setup allow
   collection of crossed fibers without stopping and repositioning the
   apparatus. The technique works for a range of fiber sizes. In this
   study, fiber diameters ranged from 100 nm to 1 micron. This allows a few
   fibers at a time to rapidly deposit in alternating directions creating
   an almost woven structure. These aligned nanofibers have the potential
   to improve the performance of energy storage and thermoelectric devices
   and hold great promise for directed cell growth applications.}},

Abstract = {{Characteristics of magnetic-levitation systems are studied using dynamic
   models that include motion-dependent lift, drag, slip, and roll motions.
   The contact constraint between the vehicle and the track is modeled
   using a compliant contact model, and inelastic restitution is modeled
   using damping. Unknown numerical parameters are identified using an
   optimization technique and experimental data. The numerical tests are
   focused on the damping characteristics, stability in lifting and slip
   motions, the lifting efficiency, and the contact behavior with the
   track. It turns out that the suspension system does not have any
   inherent damping in the lifting direction. However, a stable behavior is
   observed in the traveling direction. The model also shows that the
   system has a strong concentric force that stabilizes the vehicle in the
   slip motion as well as in the rolling motion.}},

Abstract = {{Reflective cracking is a distress mode that is of particular concern for
   pavements with thin hot-mix asphalt (HMA) overlay as a maintenance
   and/or rehabilitation method. Traditionally, efforts have been made to
   mitigate reflective cracking by increasing overlay thickness, using
   anti-reflective cracking interlayer systems and special treatments on
   existing pavements and cracks. A new way to improve HMA overlay
   reflective cracking resistance is to use highly polymer-modified asphalt
   emulsion (PMAE) interface. Tests currently available are not appropriate
   to evaluate the effects of interface conditions on reflective cracking.
   This paper presents the second phase of a study devoted to develop a
   mechanistic test to study effects of interface conditions on pavement
   cracking performance. A new approach to represent reflective cracking (a
   teflon spacer introduced in an existing pavement layer) instead of the
   traditional notch method was introduced to the composite specimen
   interface cracking test developed for top-down cracking. In this study,
   effects of two types of interface conditions, conventional tack coat and
   PMAE, on reflective cracking were evaluated. HMA fracture mechanics was
   employed to identify the reflective cracking mechanism when the teflon
   spacer was installed in the composite specimen. Test results clearly
   indicated that the proposed test method with the teflon spacer was able
   to simulate reflective cracking mechanism and evaluate effects of
   interface conditions on reflective cracking.}},

   Functions in MATLAB}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{An object-oriented method is presented that computes without truncation
   the error derivatives of functions defined by MATLAB computer codes. The
   method implements forward-mode automatic differentiation via operator
   overloading in a manner that produces a new MATLAB code that computes
   the derivatives of the outputs of the original function with respect to
   the differentiation variables. Because the derivative code has the same
   input as the original function code, the method can be used recursively
   to generate derivatives of any order desired. In addition, the approach
   developed in this article has the feature that the derivatives are
   generated by simply evaluating the function on an instance of the class,
   thus making the method straightforward to use while simultaneously
   enabling differentiation of highly complex functions. A detailed
   description of the method is presented and the approach is illustrated
   and shown to be efficient on four examples.}},

Abstract = {{Electrode properties are key to the quality of measured biopotential
   signals. Ubiquitous health care systems require long-term monitoring of
   biopotential signals from normal volunteers and patients in home or
   hospital environments. In these settings it is appropriate to use dry
   textile electrode networks for monitoring purposes, rather than the gel
   or saline-sponge skin interfaces used with Ag/AgCl electrodes. In this
   study, we report performance test results of two different electrospun
   conductive nanofiber webs, and three metal plated fabrics. We evaluated
   contact impedance, step response, noise and signal fidelity performance
   indices for all five dry electrodes, and compared them to those of
   conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. Overall, we found nanofiber web
   electrodes matched Ag/AgCl electrode performance more closely than metal
   plated fabric electrodes, with the contact resistance and capacitance of
   Ag plated PVDF nanofiber web electrodes being most similar to Ag/AgCl
   over the 10 Hz to 500 kHz frequency range. We also observed that step
   responses of all three metal-plated fabrics were poorer than those for
   nanofiber web electrodes and Ag/AgCl. Further, noise standard deviation
   and noise power spectral densities were generally lower in nanofiber web
   electrodes than metal plated fabrics; and waveform fidelity of ECG-like
   traces recorded from nanofiber web electrodes was higher than for metal
   plated fabrics. We recommend textile nanofiber web electrodes in
   applications where flexibility, comfort and durability are required in
   addition to good electrical characteristics.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The capacity of an organism to respond to its environment is facilitated
   by the environmentally induced alteration of gene and protein
   expression, i.e. expression plasticity. The reconstruction of gene
   regulatory networks based on expression plasticity can gain not only new
   insights into the causality of transcriptional and cellular processes
   but also the complex regulatory mechanisms that underlie biological
   function and adaptation. We describe an approach for network inference
   by integrating expression plasticity into Shannon's mutual information.
   Beyond Pearson correlation, mutual information can capture non-linear
   dependencies and topology sparseness. The approach measures the network
   of dependencies of genes expressed in different environments, allowing
   the environment-induced plasticity of gene dependencies to be tested in
   unprecedented details. The approach is also able to characterize the
   extent to which the same genes trigger different amounts of expression
   in response to environmental changes. We demonstrated the usefulness of
   this approach through analysing gene expression data from a rabbit vein
   graft study that includes two distinct blood flow environments. The
   proposed approach provides a powerful tool for the modelling and
   analysis of dynamic regulatory networks using gene expression data from
   distinct environments.}},

Abstract = {{An immersed boundary method (IBM) has been developed and incorporated
   into the coupled discrete element method and computational fluid
   dynamics (DEM-CFD) approach to model particulate systems consisting of a
   compressible gas and solid particles with complex and/or moving
   boundaries. The IBM is used to deal with the interaction between gas and
   complex and moving boundaries by using simple rectangular grids to
   discretize the fluid field. The developed method has been applied to
   simulate some typical powder handling processes (e.g., gas fluidization
   with an immersed tube, segregation in a vertically vibrated bed, and
   pneumatic conveying). Good agreement is achieved between the present
   simulation results and the experimental ones reported in the literature.
   It has been demonstrated that the capacity of DEM-CFD is enhanced with
   the incorporation of IBM, which can be used to simulate a wide range of
   problems that could not be handled with the conventional DEM-CFD method.

   imaging. Typically, data-independent techniques are exploited to form
   the SAR images, although such approaches will suffer from limited
   resolution and high sidelobe levels. Recent work on data-adaptive
   approaches have shown that both the iterative adaptive approach (IAA)
   and the sparse learning via iterative minimization (SLIM) algorithm
   offer excellent performance with high-resolution and low side lobe
   levels for both complete and incomplete data sets. Regrettably, both
   algorithms are computationally intensive if applied directly to the
   phase history data to form the SAR images. To help alleviate this,
   efficient implementations have also been proposed. In this paper, we
   further this work, proposing yet further improved implementation
   strategies, including approaches using the segmented IAA approach and
   the approximative quasi-Newton technique. Furthermore, we introduce a
   combined IAA-MAP algorithm as well as a hybrid IAA- and SLIM-based
   estimation scheme for SAR imaging. The effectiveness of the SAR imaging
   algorithms and the computational complexities of their fast
   implementations are demonstrated using the simulated Slicy data set and
   the experimentally measured GOTCHA data set.}},

Abstract = {{In the LISA Pathfinder mission, the grabbing positioning and release
   mechanism will perform a critical phase, which is the injection of a
   test mass into a perfect free-fall condition (also called geodesic
   trajectory). A possible failure is the test mass remaining adhered to
   the mechanism or released with an excessive velocity, which would hinder
   the subsequent capacitive control to the desired geodesic status.
   In space engineering it is recognized that mechanisms constitute
   critical subsystems, because they may have single point failures which
   can seriously affect the mission. In order to limit the risk, a good
   practice is to test the mechanism critical phases in an environment
   which simulates the conditions that will be experienced in operation. In
   the LISA Pathfinder ground testing plan a combined
   experimental-analytical strategy has been conceived to test this
   critical phase.
   The momentum transfer from an actuator to an adhered test mass upon
   quick separation is measured by means of a dedicated experiment,
   characterizing the behavior of adhesion under dynamic failure. In
   parallel, a mathematical model of the release mechanism
   electro-mechanical dynamics is experimentally validated. The
   mathematical model of the test mass in-flight injection into geodesic is
   built, combining the adhesion model with the identified model of the
   release mechanism. The compliance of the resulting injection with the
   requirements is presented and discussed. (c) 2012 COSPAR. Published by

Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper Analyzes a new tradable credit scheme (TCS) for managing
   commuters' travel choices, which seeks to persuade commuters to spread
   evenly within the rush hour and between primary and alternative routes
   so that excessive traffic congestion can be alleviated. The scheme
   defines a peak time window and charges those who use the primary route
   within that window in the form of mobility credits. Those who avoid the
   peak-time window, by either traveling outside the peak time window or
   switching to the alternative route, may be rewarded credits. A market is
   created such that those who need to pay credits can purchase them from
   those who acquire them from their rewarding travel choices. A general
   analytical framework is proposed for a system of two parallel routes.
   The framework (1) considers a variety of assumptions about commuters'
   behavior in response to the discontinuous credit charge introduced at
   the-boundary of the peak-time window, (2) allows modeling congestion
   effects (or demand elasticity) on the alternative route, and (3) enables
   both the design of system optimal TCS and the analysis of the efficiency
   of any given TCS. Our analyses indicate that the proposed TCS not only
   achieves up to 33\% efficiency gains in the base scenario, but also
   distributes the benefits among all the commuters directly through the
   credit trading. The results also suggest that very simple TCS schemes
   could provide substantial efficiency gains for a wide range of
   scenarios. Such simplicity and robustness are important to
   practicability of the proposed scheme. Numerical experiments are
   conducted to examine the sensitivity of TCS designs to various system
   parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Nanocomposite Capacitors}},

Abstract = {{High energy density capacitors are critically important in advanced
   electronic devices and power systems since they can reduce the weight,
   size and cost required to meet a desired application. Nanocomposites
   hold strong potential for increasing the performance of high power
   energy sources; however, the energy density of most nanocomposites is
   still low compared to commercial capacitors and neat polymers. Here, we
   develop a new synthesis method for the growth of high aspect ratio
   barium titanate nanowires (BaTiO3) nanowires (NWs) with high yield. High
   energy density nanocomposite capacitors are fabricated using
   surface-functionalized high aspect ratio BaTiO3 NWs in a poly(vinylidene
   fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE-CFE))
   matrix. At a 17.5\% volume fraction, the nanocomposites show more than
   45.3\% increase in energy density above that of the pure P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)
   polymer (10.48 J/cc compared to 7.21 J/cc) at electric field 300 MV/m.
   This value is significant and exceeds those reported for the
   conventional polymer-ceramic nanocomposites; it is also more than seven
   times larger than high performance commercial polypropylene capacitor
   (1.2 J/cc at 640 MV/m). In addition, our nanocomposite capacitor has a
   maximum power density as high as 1.2 MW/cc occurring only 1.52 s after
   the start of discharge. The findings of this research could lead to
   enhanced interest in nanowires based nanocomposites due to their
   potential for achieving next generation energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{An 83-GHz two-stage cascode power amplifier (PA) implemented in a
   low-cost 200/180-GHz f(T)/f(max) 0.18-mu m SiGe BiCMOS technology is
   presented. The power-combining technique based upon a low-loss two-way
   transmission-line current combiner has been employed that simultaneously
   addresses the gain requirement at millimeter wave while delivering a
   high linear output power, making it a potential contender for
   multigigabit/second point-to-point data links. The combiner efficiency
   and large-signal power bandwidth (BW) are improved by the compact output
   matching network synthesized and excellent amplitude/phase balance of
   the proposed current combiner, which also considers the reliability
   issues such as electromigration and built-in redundancy during power
   device failure.
   At 83 GHz, the PA achieves a measured saturated power (P-sat) of 14.7
   dBm, output-referred 1-dB compression point (OP1dB) of 12.5 dBm, peak
   power-added efficiency of 8.1\%, and 1-dB large-signal power BW from 75
   to 88 GHz. The measured peak power gain (S-21) is 25 dB with a 3-dB
   small-signal BW from 76.8 to 86.4 GHz while consuming a total dc power
   of 348 mW from a 4-V supply. The overall chip area is 610 mu m x 560 mu

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first flip-chip-packaged and fully integrated
   Doppler micro-radar in 90-nm CMOS for noncontact vital-sign and
   vibration detection. The use of a smaller wavelength compared with
   previous works achieves the highly compact system for portable devices,
   and the radar design considerations at 60 GHz are discussed from both
   system and circuits points of view. The compact 60-GHz core (0.73 mm(2))
   provides a 36-dB peak down-conversion gain and transmits a radar signal
   around 0 dBm at 55 GHz. Quadrature generation at the intermediate
   frequency stage of the heterodyne receiver gives a power-and
   area-efficient solution to the null detection point issue, ensuring
   robust detection. By using single-patch antennas and without a
   high-power amplifier, the system demonstrates the first-pass success of
   human vital-sign detection at 0.3 m. The small mechanical vibration with
   a displacement of 0.2 mm can be detected up to 2 m away. At 60 GHz,
   target displacement comparable to wavelength results in strong nonlinear
   phase modulation and increases detection difficulties. A signal-recovery
   algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of vital-sign detection.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Accounting for waterway vessel collision is required in the structural
   design of bridges spanning navigable waterways. During collision events,
   massive waterway vessel groups such as barge flotillas are capable of
   dynamically transmitting horizontal forces to impacted bridge
   components. Furthermore, collision-induced forces can be sufficient to
   collapse piers or roadway spans in the vicinity of the impact location.
   If collapse takes place, economic loss is suffered because of subsequent
   traffic rerouting and bridge replacement costs. Additionally, fatalities
   may occur if the roadway is occupied during or shortly after collapse.
   This paper focuses on the development of a probability of collapse
   expression for bridge piers subject to barge impact loading, where the
   relationship can be readily integrated into existing bridge design
   methodologies. The expression is developed by employing probabilistic
   descriptions for a multitude of random variables related to barge
   traffic characteristics and bridge structures in conjunction with
   nonlinear dynamic finite-element analyses of barge-bridge collisions.
   Highly efficient, advanced probabilistic simulation techniques are
   necessarily incorporated into the barge-bridge collision analysis
   framework to allow feasible estimation of structural reliability
   parameters. These parameters facilitate the formation of an expression
   that, in turn, bridge designers can use to estimate probabilities of
   structural collapse attributable to barge collision, without performing
   probabilistic analyses. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000376. (C)

   2205-2215, 2013. First published January 30, 2013;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00969.2012.-When subjects perform a learned motor task
   with increased visual gain, error and variability are reduced.
   Neuroimaging studies have identified a corresponding increase in
   activity in parietal cortex, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, and
   extrastriate visual cortex. Much less is understood about the neural
   processes that underlie the immediate transition from low to high visual
   gain within a trial. This study used 128-channel electro-encephalography
   to measure cortical activity during a visually guided precision grip
   task, in which the gain of the visual display was changed during the
   task. Force variability during the transition from low to high visual
   gain was characterized by an inverted U-shape, whereas force error
   decreased from low to high gain. Source analysis identified cortical
   activity in the same structures previously identified using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Source analysis also identified a
   time-varying shift in the strongest source activity. Superior regions of
   the motor and parietal cortex had stronger source activity from 300 to
   600 ms after the transition, whereas inferior regions of the
   extrastriate visual cortex had stronger source activity from 500 to 700
   ms after the transition. Force variability and electrical activity were
   linearly related, with a positive relation in the parietal cortex and a
   negative relation in the frontal cortex. Force error was nonlinearly
   related to electrical activity in the parietal cortex and frontal cortex
   by a quadratic function. This is the first evidence that force
   variability and force error are systematically related to a time-varying
   shift in cortical activity in frontal and parietal cortex in response to
   enhanced visual gain.}},

Abstract = {{The perovskite, BiNb3O9, is a metastable phase in the Bi2O3:Nb2O5 system
   that forms only when cooled from a liquid phase. Crystals of BiNb3O9
   prepared in this way display pseudocubic 2a x 2a x 2a diffraction
   patterns, due to non-merohedral twinning of a tetragonal a x a x 2a
   cell, with the doubled axis oriented along all three pseudocubic axes.
   The structure was refined using data collected on a twinned crystal to
   R-1=0.034 for 318 observed reflections. BiNb3O9 has tetragonal symmetry,
   P4/mmm with a=3.9459(3) angstrom, c=7.8919(6) angstrom. Partial ordering
   of Bi atoms and vacancies occurs, with alternate (0 0 1) planes having
   28\% and 42\% Bi occupancies. The Bi atoms are displaced from the A-site
   special positions by up to 0.4 angstrom. The compound exhibits a
   relatively high permittivity value of similar to 230 at room

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites combining a high breakdown strength polymer and high
   dielectric permittivity ceramic filler have shown great potential for
   pulsed power applications. However, while current nanocomposites improve
   the dielectric permittivity of the capacitor, the gains come at the
   expense of the breakdown strength, which limits the ultimate performance
   of the capacitor. Here, we develop a new synthesis method for the growth
   of barium strontium titanate nanowires and demonstrate their use in
   ultra high energy density nanocomposites. This new synthesis process
   provides a facile approach to the growth of high aspect ratio nanowires
   with high yield and control over the stoichiometry of the solid
   solution. The nanowires are grown in the cubic phase with a
   Ba0.2Sr0.8TiO3 composition and have not been demonstrated prior to this
   report. The poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanocomposites resulting from this
   approach have high breakdown strength and high dielectric permittivity
   which results from the use of high aspect ratio fillers rather than
   equiaxial particles. The nanocomposites are shown to have an ultra high
   energy density of 14.86 J/cc at 450 MV/m and provide microsecond
   discharge time quicker than commercial biaxial oriented polypropylene
   capacitors. The energy density of our nanocomposites exceeds those
   reported in the literature for ceramic/polymer composites and is 1138\%
   greater than the reported commercial capacitor with energy density of
   1.2 J/cc at 640 MV/m for the current state of the art biaxial oriented

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{539-564}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   is sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and suffers from a high
   peak-to-average ratio. In addition, the performance of OFDM is severely
   affected by strong co-channel interference and strong narrowband
   interference. To mitigate the limitations of OFDM, we propose a new
   multi-carrier transceiver based on frequency-shift filter. A
   frequency-shift filter can separate spectrally overlapping sub-carrier
   signals by exploiting the spectral correlation inherent in the
   cyclostationary modulated signals. To increase spectral efficiency, we
   increase the percentage of spectral overlap between two adjacent
   sub-channels. We derive an upper bound and a lower bound on the bit
   error rate performance of the proposed multi-carrier transceiver in
   additive white Gaussian noise channel and frequency-nonselective
   Rayleigh fading channel, respectively. Compared with OFDM, our
   simulation results show that the proposed multi-carrier transceiver is
   much less sensitive to CFO and has a lower peak-to-average ratio;
   moreover, without any additional interference suppression technique, the
   proposed transceiver has the advantage of being able to mitigate strong
   co-channel interference with CFO from the intended multi-carrier signal
   and mitigate strong narrowband interference in additive white Gaussian
   noise channel and in Rayleigh fading channel in which a large CFO
   between the transmitted signal and the received signal often occurs.

Abstract = {{There is great interest for developing poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)
   based particles for targeted delivery and controlled release of
   encapsulated biological molecules. These PLGA particles can be used to
   deliver proteins, small molecule drugs and nucleotides. Furthermore, it
   has been shown that the co-encapsulation of multiple factors in PLGA
   particles can generate synergistic responses, and can also provide
   theranostic capability. However, the number of possible unique particle
   formulations that may be generated by the combination of different
   components in a particle increases dramatically with each new component,
   and currently, there is no method to generate large libraries of unique
   PLGA particles. In order to address this gap, we have developed a
   high-throughput methodology to produce hundreds of small batches of
   particles. The particles are generated in multi-well plate wells by a
   modified oil-in-water emulsion technique. In order to demonstrate the
   versatility of this technique, combinatorial formulations of six
   different loading concentrations of three fluorescent dyes were
   fabricated giving rise to 216 unique PLGA particle formulations. We
   demonstrate systematic and well-controlled combinatorial loading of
   hydrophobic molecules into the particles. This parallel particle
   production (PPP) methodology potentiates the generation of hundreds of
   different combinatorial particle formulations with multiple
   co-encapsulates in less than 24 h in standard polystyrene multi-well
   plates, thus providing rapid, low cost, high-throughput production. We
   envision that such a PPP library of particles encapsulating combinations
   of drugs and imaging modalities can subsequently be tested on small
   populations of cells in a high-throughput fashion, and represents a step
   toward personalized medicine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Lightweight design of vehicle structures parameters under
   crashworthiness is hard to accomplish because of the complexity of
   simulations required in crash analysis. To reduce the computation
   demand, surrogates (metamodels) are often used in place of the actual
   simulation models in design optimization to fit the mathematical
   relationship between design variables and responses. Each optimization
   cycle consists of analyzing a number of designs, fitting surrogates for
   the responses, performing optimization based on the surrogates for a
   candidate optimum, and finally analyzing that candidate. Even so,
   optimization using crash analysis codes is often allowed to run only for
   very few cycles. While traditional surrogate is unbiased which means
   prediction values at half region is lower than actual values, predicted
   candidate optimum usually is not feasible after validating by crash
   simulation. This paper explores the use of conservative surrogates for
   safe estimations of crashworthiness responses (e.g., intrusion and peak
   acceleration). We use safety margins to conservatively compensate for
   fitting errors associated with surrogates. Conservative surrogates
   minimize the risks associated with underestimation of the responses,
   which helps push optimization toward the feasible region of the design.
   We also propose an approach for sequential relaxation of the safety
   margins allowing for further weight minimization. The approach was
   tested on the lightweight design of a vehicle subjected to the
   full-overlap frontal crash. We compare this approach with the
   traditional use of unbiased surrogates (that is, without adding any
   safety margin). We find that conservative surrogates successfully drive
   optimization toward the feasible region of a design space, while that is
   not always the case with unbiased surrogates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation is one of the most important and expensive tasks
   in modern integrated circuit design methodology. The primary problem
   governing post-silicon validation is the limited observability due to
   storage of a small number of signals in a trace buffer. The signals to
   be traced should be carefully selected in order to maximize restoration
   of the remaining signals. Existing approaches have two major drawbacks.
   They depend on partial restorability computations that are not effective
   in restoring maximum signal states. They also require long signal
   selection time due to inefficient computation as well as operating on
   gate-level netlist. We have proposed a signal selection approach based
   on total restorability at gate-level, which is computationally more
   efficient (10 times faster) and can restore up to three times more
   signals compared to existing methods. We have also developed a register
   transfer level signal selection approach, which reduces both memory
   requirements and signal selection time by several orders-of-magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have compared functional kinematics in knees using identical
   prostheses with or without the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). This
   study contrasted in vivo knee kinematics with an anterior cruciate
   ligament-substituting arthroplasty with and without PCL retention. We
   hypothesized that knees without PCLs would exhibit less femoral
   posterior translation, and consequently less maximum knee flexion.
   Fifty-six knees were studied using dynamic radiography at least one year
   post-surgery, with twenty-seven knees retaining the PCL and twenty-nine
   knees having the PCL sacrificed. Consistent with our hypothesis,
   PCL-sacrificing knees showed more anterior femoral condylar positions.
   Contrary to our hypothesis, PCL-sacrificing knees demonstrated greater
   knee flexion during kneeling (122 degrees versus 115 degrees).
   Contracted PCLs in severely deformed knees likely were the cause of
   limited flexion in some retaining knees. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper considers a special but broad class of convex programming
   problems whose feasible region is a simple compact convex set
   intersected with the inverse image of a closed convex cone under an
   affine transformation. It studies the computational complexity of
   quadratic penalty based methods for solving the above class of problems.
   An iteration of these methods, which is simply an iteration of
   Nesterov's optimal method (or one of its variants) for approximately
   solving a smooth penalization subproblem, consists of one or two
   projections onto the simple convex set. Iteration-complexity bounds
   expressed in terms of the latter type of iterations are derived for two
   quadratic penalty based variants, namely: one which applies the
   quadratic penalty method directly to the original problem and another
   one which applies the latter method to a perturbation of the original
   problem obtained by adding a small quadratic term to its objective
   function.}},

Journal = {{MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1304-1323}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{State-of-the-art coupled hydrodynamic and wave models can predict the
   inundation threat from an approaching hurricane with high resolution and
   accuracy. However, these models are not highly efficient and often
   cannot be run sufficiently fast to provide results 2 h prior to advisory
   issuance within a 6-h forecast cycle. Therefore, to produce a timely
   inundation forecast, coarser grid models, without wave setup
   contributions, are typically used, which sacrifices resolution and
   physics. This paper introduces an efficient forecast method by applying
   a multidimensional interpolation technique to a predefined optimal storm
   database to generate the surge response for any storm based on its
   landfall characteristics. This technique, which provides a ``digital
   lookup table{''} to predict the inundation throughout the region, is
   applied to the southwest Florida coast for Hurricanes Charley (2004) and
   Wilma (2005) and compares well with deterministic results but is
   obtained in a fraction of the time. Because of the quick generation of
   the inundation response for a single storm, the response of thousands of
   possible storm parameter combinations can be determined within a
   forecast cycle. The thousands of parameter combinations are assigned a
   probability based on historic forecast errors to give a probabilistic
   estimate of the inundation forecast, which compare well with
   observations.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{One way to achieve reliability with low-latency is through multi-path
   routing and transport protocols that build redundant delivery channels
   (or data paths) to reduce end-to-end packet losses and retransmissions.
   However, the applicability and effectiveness of such protocols are
   limited by the topological constraints of the underlying communication
   infrastructure. Multiple data delivery paths can only be constructed
   over networks that are capable of supporting multiple paths. In
   mission-critical wireless networks, the underlying network topology is
   directly affected by the terrain, location and environmental
   interferences, however the settings of the wireless radios at each node
   can be properly configured to compensate for these effects for
   multi-path support. In this work we investigate optimization models for
   topology designs that enable end-to-end dual-path support on a
   distributed wireless sensor network. We consider the case of a fixed
   sensor network with isotropic antennas, where the control variable for
   topology management is the transmission power on network nodes. For
   optimization modeling, the network metrics of relevance are coverage,
   robustness and power utilization. The optimization models proposed in
   this work eliminate some of the typical assumptions made in the
   pertinent network design literature that are too strong in this
   application context.}},

Abstract = {{Online social network is emerging as a promising alternative for users
   to directly access video contents. By allowing users to import videos
   and re-share them through the social connections, a large number of
   videos are available to users in the online social network. The rapid
   growth of the user-generated videos provides enormous potential for
   users to find the ones that interest them; while the convergence of
   online social network service and online video sharing service makes it
   possible to perform recommendation using social factors and content
   factors jointly. In this paper, we design a joint social-content
   recommendation framework to suggest users which videos to import or
   re-share in the online social network. In this framework, we first
   propose a user-content matrix update approach which updates and fills in
   cold user-video entries to provide the foundations for the
   recommendation. Then, based on the updated user-content matrix, we
   construct a joint social-content space to measure the relevance between
   users and videos, which can provide a high accuracy for video importing
   and re-sharing recommendation. We conduct experiments using real traces
   from Tencent Weibo and Youku to verify our algorithm and evaluate its
   performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
   and show that our approach can substantially improve the recommendation
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Healthcare professionals use race, gender, and age cues when making pain
   management decisions. Use of these demographic cues, therefore, is an
   important topic in the study of healthcare disparities. This study used
   virtual human (VH) technology to investigate the effects of VH patients'
   demographic cues on dentists' pain management decisions. Eighty-nine
   dentists viewed patients with different demographic cues. Analyses
   revealed that dentists rated pain intensity higher and were more willing
   to prescribe opioids to female, African-American, and younger patients
   than to their demographic counterparts. Results also found significant
   2-way interactions between race and age for both pain assessment and
   treatment decisions. The interaction results suggest that the race
   difference (Caucasian < African American) was more pronounced for
   younger than for older patients. This is the first study to examine
   demographic cue use in dentists' decision-making for pain. The study
   found that dentists used demographic cues when making pain management
   decisions. Currently, there are no guidelines for decision-making
   practices for gender-, race-, or age-related pain. Since dentists see
   thousands of patients during their careers, the use of demographic cues
   could affect a substantial portion of the population. The findings could
   improve future training programs for dentists and dental students.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless microvalve system was fabricated based on induction heating
   for flow control in microfluidics by sequential valve opening. In this
   approach, we used paraffin wax as a flow plug, which can be changed from
   solid to liquid with adjacent heating elements operated by induction
   heating. Programmable opening of valves was devised by using different
   thermal responses of metal discs to a magnetic field. Copper and nickel
   discs with a diameter of 2.5 mm and various thicknesses (50, 100 and 200
   mu m) were prepared as heating elements by a laser cutting method, and
   they were integrated in the microfluidic channel as part of the
   microvalve. A calorimetric test was used to measure the thermal
   properties of the discs in terms of kinds of metal and disc thickness.
   Sequential openings of the microvalves were performed using the
   difference in the thermal response of 100 mu m thick copper disc and 50
   mu m thick nickel disc for short-interval openings and 200 mu m thick
   copper disc and 100-mu m-thick nickel disc for long-interval openings.
   The thermal effect on fluid samples as a result of induction heating of
   the discs was studied by investigating lysozyme denaturation. More heat
   was generated in heating elements made of copper than in those made of
   nickel, implying differences in the thermal response of heating elements
   made of copper and nickel. Also, the thickness of the heating elements
   affected the thermal response in the elements. Valve openings for short
   intervals of 1-5 s and long intervals of 15-23 s were achieved by using
   two sets of heating elements. There was no significant change in
   lysozyme activity by increasing the temperature of the heating discs.
   This study demonstrates that a wireless sequentially actuated microvalve
   system can provide programmed valve opening, portability, ease of
   fabrication and operation, disposability, and low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Drug eluding contact lenses can be very effective vehicles for
   ophthalmic drug delivery, but are incapable of releasing drug for more
   than a few hours. We propose to optimize the interactions of the polymer
   matrix of the contact lens with the hydrophobic tails of ionic
   surfactants to adsorb the surfactant molecules on the polymer with high
   packing and thus create a high surface charge. Ionic drugs can then
   adsorb on the charged surfactant coated surfaces with high affinity to
   reduce the transport rates, leading to extended release. Specifically,
   we show control release of an anionic drug dexamethasone 21-disodium
   phosphate from poly-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (p-HEMA) contact lenses by
   utilizing cationic surfactant (cetalkonium chloride). The partition
   coefficient of the drug increase exponentially with surfactant loading
   in the gel in at least qualitative agreement with the Debye-Huckel
   theory. The drug adsorbs on the surfactant covered polymer, and can also
   diffuse along the surface with diffusivity lower than that for the free
   drug, leading to a reduction in the effective diffusivity, which is the
   weighted combination of the free and surface diffusivities. The addition
   of surfactant did not impact transparency of lenses, and had additional
   benefits of increase in wettability and significant reduction in protein
   absorption. With a surfactant loading of about 10\%, the drug release
   duration was increased from about 2 h to 50 h in 1-day ACUVUE (R)
   contact lenses, proving the viability of using surfactant for increasing
   drug release durations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   With Posterior-stabilized Prostheses}},

Abstract = {{Joint gaps and mediolateral (ML) soft tissue balance have long been
   known to affect clinical scores and patient function after TKA, but the
   relationship between gaps and soft tissue balance remain poorly defined.
   If specific relationships exist between soft tissue tension and patient
   function, then objective targets could be established to assist surgeons
   in achieving more consistent postoperative knee function.
   By performing instrumented gap measurements during TKA, we sought to
   quantify the relationships between intraoperative soft tissue tension
   and clinical scores and patient function.
   We prospectively followed 57 patients with 63 primary TKAs with
   posterior-stabilized prostheses. Joint gaps and ML soft tissue balance
   were measured intraoperatively from 0A degrees to 135A degrees with the
   patella reduced after independent bone cuts and soft tissue releases. We
   determined the relationships between these intraoperative measurements
   and postoperative ROM and Knee Society scores at minimum 2-year
   followup.
   Larger joint gaps at 120A degrees and 135A degrees flexion predicted
   larger postoperative knee flexion (r = 0.296 and r = 0.393,
   respectively), whereas larger gaps at 10A degrees flexion predicted
   greater postoperative knee extension (r = 0.285). Knees with rectangular
   joint gaps did not show better ROM or Knee Society scores compared with
   knees with trapezoidal joint gaps. In the range of normal surgical
   variation, neither joint gaps nor gap asymmetry affected the incidence
   of postoperative instability.
   Avoiding small joint gaps in extension and in deep flexion should allow
   patients who undergo TKAs to obtain maximum ROM.

Title = {{Bayesian Identification of Elastic Constants in Multi-Directional
   Laminate from Moire Interferometry Displacement Fields}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{635-648}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The ply elastic constants needed for classical lamination theory
   analysis of multi-directional laminates may differ from those obtained
   from unidirectional laminates because of three dimensional effects. In
   addition, the unidirectional laminates may not be available for testing.
   In such cases, full-field displacement measurements offer the potential
   of identifying several material properties simultaneously. For that, it
   is desirable to create complex displacement fields that are strongly
   influenced by all the elastic constants. In this work, we explore the
   potential of using a laminated plate with an open-hole under traction
   loading to achieve that and identify all four ply elastic constants (E
   (1) , E (2) , nu (12) , G (12) ) at once. However, the accuracy of the
   identified properties may not be as good as properties measured from
   individual tests due to the complexity of the experiment, the relative
   insensitivity of the measured quantities to some of the properties and
   the various possible sources of uncertainty. It is thus important to
   quantify the uncertainty (or confidence) with which these properties are
   identified. Here, Bayesian identification is used for this purpose,
   because it can readily model all the uncertainties in the analysis and
   measurements, and because it provides the full coupled probability
   distribution of the identified material properties. In addition, it
   offers the potential to combine properties identified based on
   substantially different experiments. The full-field measurement is
   obtained by moir, interferometry. For computational efficiency the
   Bayesian approach was applied to a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
   of the displacement fields. The analysis showed that the four
   orthotropic elastic constants are determined with quite different
   confidence levels as well as with significant correlation. Comparison
   with manufacturing specifications showed substantial difference in one
   constant, and this conclusion agreed with earlier measurement of that
   constant by a traditional four-point bending test. It is possible that
   the POD approach did not take full advantage of the copious data
   provided by the full field measurements, and for that reason that data
   is provided for others to use (as on line material attached to the
   article).}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{181-189}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent work on multifunctional materials has shown that a functionally
   graded interface between the fiber and matrix of a composite material
   can lead to improved strength and stiffness while simultaneously
   affording piezoelectric properties to the composite. However the
   modeling of this functional gradient is difficult through micromechanics
   models without discretizing the gradient into numerous layers of varying
   properties. In order to facilitate the design of these multiphase
   piezoelectric composites, accurate models are required. In this work,
   Multi-Inclusion models are extended to predict the effective
   electroelastic properties of multiphase piezoelectric composites. To
   evaluate the micromechanics modeling results, a three dimensional finite
   element model of a four-phase piezoelectric composite was created in the
   commercial finite element software ABAQUS with different volume
   fractions and aspect ratios. The simulations showed excellent agreement
   for multiphase piezoelectric composites, and thus the modeling approach
   has been applied to study the overall electroelastic properties of a
   composite with zinc oxide nanowires grown on carbon fibers embedded in
   the polymer. The results of this case study demonstrate the importance
   of the approach and show the system cannot be accurately modeled with a
   homogenized interphase. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a very simple and elegant patch-based, machine
   learning technique for image denoising using the higher order singular
   value decomposition (HOSVD). The technique simply groups together
   similar patches from a noisy image (with similarity defined by a
   statistically motivated criterion) into a 3D stack, computes the HOSVD
   coefficients of this stack, manipulates these coefficients by hard
   thresholding, and inverts the HOSVD transform to produce the final
   filtered image. Our technique chooses all required parameters in a
   principled way, relating them to the noise model. We also discuss our
   motivation for adopting the HOSVD as an appropriate transform for image
   denoising. We experimentally demonstrate the excellent performance of
   the technique on grayscale as well as color images. On color images, our
   method produces state-of-the-art results, outperforming other color
   image denoising algorithms at moderately high noise levels. A criterion
   for optimal patch-size selection and noise variance estimation from the
   residual images (after denoising) is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study has developed a new material for indoor formaldehyde control,
   room-temperature catalytic oxidation (RCO) and RCO-coated media. In
   order to optimize the adsorption capacity of RCO material on indoor
   formaldehyde, four impacting factors, including active/assistant
   component ratio, ingredient ratio (KMnO4/MnSO4), RCO/GAC ratio, and pH,
   are investigated for both preparation procedure and performance testing
   of RCO material and RCO coated media. Results show that the RCO material
   gets the best mechanical strength (level 5) when the molar ratio of two
   main ingredients (MnSO4/KMnO4) is 3:2, and the pH in the solution is 7.
   Results also indicate that with the ratio of 3:7 between RCO material
   and active carbon appears to get the best adsorption capacity for indoor
   formaldehyde. RCO-coated media with impregnated 1\% of Pt and 5\% of Ce
   is the best regarding the removal efficiency and breakthrough time for

Title = {{Fuzzy-Clustering-Based Decision Tree Approach for Large Population
   Speaker Identification}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of large population speaker
   identification under noisy conditions. Major techniques for speaker
   identification is based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC),
   Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Universal Background Model (UBM) which
   we call MFCC GMM and MFCC GMM UBM. The approaches are known to perform
   very well for small population identification under low-noise
   conditions. However, the increase of population size can cause
   performance degradation of these schemes under noisy conditions. To
   mitigate this limitation, we propose a fuzzy-clustering-based decision
   tree approach. The key idea of our approach is to 1) use a decision tree
   to hierarchically partition the whole population into groups of small
   size, and determine which speaker group at the leaf node a speaker under
   test belongs to, and 2) apply MFCC+GMM to the selected speaker group for
   speaker identification. The advantage of our approach is that we use
   features that are independent from MFCC to partition speakers into
   groups and only apply MFCC GMM to speaker groups at the leaf level. The
   key challenge in our design is how to achieve a low error probability of
   decision-tree-based classification. To address this, we adopt fuzzy
   clustering in constructing the tree for population partitioning, i.e.,
   at each level, a speaker may belong to multiple groups. Such redundancy
   increases the probability of classifying a speaker under test into a
   correct group/node on the tree. Another novelty of this paper is that we
   use pitch and five vocal source features to construct a six-level
   decision tree. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
   outperforms MFCC GMM and MFCC GMM UBM with higher accuracy and lower
   complexity for large population identification under additive white
   Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In Robust Parameter Design (RPD) the means and the covariances of noise
   variables, commonly assumed as known, are estimated from operating or
   historical data and hence can involve considerable sampling variability.
   In addition, for cases where there are noise factors that are measurable
   or with strong autocorrelation a more effective control strategy is to
   update the estimates of noise factor as the production takes place. This
   article presents a Bayesian approach to online RPD that accounts for
   uncertainty in noise factor and response models and allows the user to
   update the model estimates with production data and achieve more
   effective control performance. The proposed method is compared to
   existing dual response and certainty equivalence control approaches from
   the literature. Simulation examples and a case study that uses real
   manufacturing data from an injection molding process are used to
   demonstrate the proposed method.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{213-230}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The traditional statistical assumption for interpreting histograms and
   justifying approximate query processing methods based on them is that
   all elements in a bucket have the same frequency-this is called uniform
   distribution assumption. In this paper, we analyze histograms from a
   statistical point of view. We show that a significantly less restrictive
   statistical assumption - the elements within a bucket are randomly
   arranged even though they might have different frequencies - leads to
   identical formulas for approximating aggregate queries using histograms.
   Under this assumption, we analyze the behavior of both unidimensional
   and multidimensional histograms and provide tight error guarantees for
   the quality of approximations. We conclude that histograms are the best
   estimators if the assumption holds; sampling and sketching are
   significantly worse. As an example of how the statistical theory of
   histograms can be extended, we show how XSketches - an approximation
   technique for XML queries that uses histograms as building blocks - can
   be statistically analyzed. The combination of the random shuffling
   assumption and the other statistical assumptions associated with XSketch
   estimators ensures a complete statistical model and error analysis for
   XSketches. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Analysis of boundary slip in a flow with an oscillating wall}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to study slip at the
   fluid-solid boundary in an unsteady flow based on the Stokes' second
   problem. An increase in slip is observed in comparison to the steady
   flow for shear rates below the critical shear rate of the corresponding
   steady flow. This increased slip is attributed to fluid inertial forces
   not represented in a steady flow. An unsteady mathematical model for
   slip is established, which estimates the increment in slip at the
   boundary. The model shows that slip is also dependent on acceleration in
   addition to the shear rate of fluid at the wall. By writing acceleration
   in terms of shear rate, it is shown that slip at the wall in unsteady
   flows is governed by the gradient of shear rate and shear rate of the
   fluid. Nondimensionalizing the model gives a time dependent yet
   universal curve, independent of wall-fluid properties, which can be used
   to find the slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface based
   on the information of shear rate, gradient of shear rate of the fluid,
   and the instant of time during the cycle. A governing nondimensional
   number, defined as the ratio of phase speed to speed of sound, is
   identified to help in explaining the mechanism responsible for the
   transition of slip boundary condition from finite to a perfect slip and
   determining when this would occur. Phase lag in fluid velocity relative
   to wall is observed. The lag increases with decreasing time period of
   wall oscillation and increasing wall hydrophobicity. The phenomenon of
   hysteresis is seen when looking into the variation of slip velocity as a
   function of wall velocity and slip velocity as a function of fluid shear
   rate. The cause for hysteresis is attributed to the unsteady inertial
   forces of the fluid. The rate of heat generated by viscous shear is
   compared for an unsteady Stokes' second problem and simple Couette flow
   and is shown to be higher for the unsteady flow. DOI:

   Pb0.98Ba0.01(Zr1-x Ti-x)(0.98)Nb0.02O3, 0.40 <= x <= 0.60, compositions
   was characterized between 25 and 400 degrees C to determine the
   influence of crystal structure on ferroelasticity. The ferroelastic
   response was found to depend significantly on the crystal phase as well
   as the spontaneous strain, both of which varied with temperature. The
   remanent strain for rhombohedral materials was shown to be above the
   theoretical maximum allowed by the crystal spontaneous strain. This
   observed behavior indicates the presence of hysteretic processes in
   addition to ferroelasticity during mechanical compression. A
   phenomenological free energy analysis was used to predict the effects of
   stress on the stable phase in ferroelectrics and indicates the
   susceptibility of the rhombohedral and tetragonal structure to a
   stress-induced phase transition. Modeling results indicate the relative
   importance of such phase transitions on macroscopic stress-strain
   behavior, giving an indirect method to observe field-induced phase
   transitions in polycrystalline ferroelectrics. DOI:

Abstract = {{The crystal structure of sodium bismuth titanate (NBT) and related
   compounds is of great interest, as these may form part of a new
   generation of ferroelectric materials used in a multitude of
   piezoelectric applications. This work examines the short-and long-range
   structure of sodium bismuth titanate in different states of synthesis
   using x-ray and neutron pair distribution function studies. The average
   structure of NBT was modeled using the monoclinic Cc space group through
   a combined structural refinement of x-ray and neutron diffraction data
   via the Rietveld method. A small box approach was used to model the
   local structure based on the average structure of the material, as
   determined from the Rietveld structural refinement, and rule out the
   presence of local A-site ordering in NBT. A ``box-car fitting{''} method
   used to analyze the neutron pair distribution function showed that bond
   environments change when averaged over different length scales and the
   calculated bond valence of Bi3+, in particular, is different locally
   from its average value. A model calculated using the reverse Monte Carlo
   method allowed the positions of Na+ and Bi3+ to move independently,
   allowing the determination of their distinctive bonding environments
   with O2-. This method revealed that Na+ and Bi3+ have slightly different
   atomic positions, an effect that may be the origin of the large atomic
   displacement parameters calculated for the A site from the average
   structure model. The local structure described here is discussed in
   comparison with published long-range structure models. DOI:

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the interaction between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and planar
   surfaces is essential to optimizing CNT applications as well as reducing
   their environmental impact. In this work, the surface element
   integration (SEI) technique was coupled with the DLVO theory to
   determine the orientation-dependent interaction energy between a
   single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and an infinite isotropic planar
   surface. For the first time, an analytical formula was developed to
   describe accurately the interaction between not only pristine but also
   surface-charged CNTs and planar surfaces with arbitrary rotational
   angles. Compared to other methods, the new analytical formulas were
   either more convenient or more accurate in describing the interaction
   between CNTs and planar surfaces, especially with respect to arbitrary
   angles. The results revealed the complex dependences of both force and
   torque between SWNTs and planar surfaces on the separation distances and
   rotational angles. With minor modifications, the analytical formulas
   derived for SWNTs can also be applied to multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWNTs). The new analytical expressions presented in this work can be
   used as a robust tool to describe the DLVO interaction between CNTs and
   planar surfaces under various conditions and thus to assist in the
   design and application of CNT-based products.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic-covalent macromolecular stars were prepared by cross-linking
   block copolymers containing reactive maleic anhydride units with a
   disulfide-containing diamine. Here we report the synthesis of
   disulfide-cross-linked star polymers obtained by the arm-first process.
   Well-defined block copolymers containing a reactive
   poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) (P(S-alt-MAn)) segment and an inert
   polystyrene or poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) segment were obtained by
   reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.
   Facile ring-opening of the pendant anhydride groups in the block
   copolymers by a disulfide-linked diamine cross-linker led to
   core-cross-linked stars with redox-responsive cores. The reductive
   cleavage of the disulfide linkages in the cross-linked cores resulted in
   star dissociation into linear arms with pendant thiol groups. Oxidation
   of the pendant thiol units of the resulting unimers in the presence of
   air led to reassembly or self-healing of the stars without the need for
   an externally added oxidizing agent.}},

Title = {{Rule-Based Model of Vein Graft Remodeling}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{When vein segments are implanted into the arterial system for use in
   arterial bypass grafting, adaptation to the higher pressure and flow of
   the arterial system is accomplished thorough wall thickening and
   expansion. These early remodeling events have been found to be closely
   coupled to the local hemodynamic forces, such as shear stress and wall
   tension, and are believed to be the foundation for later vein graft
   failure. To further our mechanistic understanding of the cellular and
   extracellular interactions that lead to global changes in tissue
   architecture, a rule-based modeling method is developed through the
   application of basic rules of behaviors for these molecular and cellular
   activities. In the current method, smooth muscle cell (SMC),
   extracellular matrix (ECM), and monocytes are selected as the three
   components that occupy the elements of a grid system that comprise the
   developing vein graft intima. The probabilities of the cellular
   behaviors are developed based on data extracted from in vivo
   experiments. At each time step, the various probabilities are computed
   and applied to the SMC and ECM elements to determine their next physical
   state and behavior. One- and two-dimensional models are developed to
   test and validate the computational approach. The importance of monocyte
   infiltration, and the associated effect in augmenting extracellular
   matrix deposition, was evaluated and found to be an important component
   in model development. Final model validation is performed using an
   independent set of experiments, where model predictions of intimal
   growth are evaluated against experimental data obtained from the complex
   geometry and shear stress patterns offered by a mid-graft focal
   stenosis, where simulation results show good agreements with the
   experimental data.}},

Title = {{Optimizing triticale sowing densities across the Mediterranean Basin}},
Journal = {{FIELD CROPS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{167-178}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Triticale and wheat are similar crops, but triticale represents a
   valuable alternative to wheat due to its greater biomass production and
   grain yield in Mediterranean-type growing conditions. However, despite
   the higher yield potential and increasing importance of this crop, there
   are no dynamic crop models available to assist triticale adaptation via
   simulation experiments. In a previous study, the APSIM-Nwheat model was
   parameterized for triticale resulting in a new APSIM-Triticale model but
   the new model was never compared with detailed experimental triticale
   data in a one-to-one comparison. Here, the new model was tested with
   detailed field experimental observations. APSIM-Triticale was able to
   reproduce phenology, biomass, grain yields and soil water dynamics. The
   model performed well over several years and management options that
   included different sowing densities, sowing dates and a short and tall
   cultivar. The tested model was then used to explore management options
   to maximize triticale yield across the Mediterranean Basin. The response
   to sowing density was cultivar and rainfall-environment dependent. The
   simulation analysis indicated that there was no yield advantage with
   higher sowing densities with a tall cultivar type in high yielding
   environments, despite its higher biomass growth rates. The highest
   yields were achieved at the early sowing date at the sowing densities
   between 100 and 300 plants/m(2) in the high rainfall regions for both
   short and the tall cultivars. The simulation study suggests that sowing
   a short cultivar with a reduced radiation use efficiency but early
   vigour growth could increase current yields across different regions,
   seasons and management options in the Mediterranean climate. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Measurements of velocity profiles and near-bottom temperature and
   pressure were used to determine turbulence properties at a point-source
   submarine groundwater discharge (brackish) in a tropical estuary. The

   energy production, and vertical eddy viscosity. Results showed a
   dominance of the zonal Reynolds stress component with maximum of
   0.0025m2s2 (2.5Pa) at low tide. Turbulent kinetic energy production and
   vertical eddy viscosity values also reached maxima (0.98W m3 and similar
   to 101 m2s1, respectively) at low tides. Discharge of brackish water
   increased at low tides, relative to high tides, as indicated by vertical
   mean velocity and by mean velocity shear. These maxima were caused by
   decreasing hydrostatic pressure and likely increasing hydraulic head at
   the site of discharge. Increased turbulence at low tides was one order
   of magnitude larger than the turbulence caused elsewhere by tidal flows
   up to similar to 2.5ms1.}},

Abstract = {{Being the shortest unsaturated hydrocarbon, ethylene is a valuable
   feedstock gas for synthesizing longer chain hydrocarbon products. Using
   the oxidative coupling of methane to produce ethylene and ethane (C-2
   products) has been studied extensively over the past few decades. In
   this work, samaria nanoparticles (NPs) and alumina-supported samaria
   catalysts were prepared using different methods (water/toluene reverse
   microemulsion, metal-oleate high temperature decomposition, and
   incipient-wetness impregnation followed by calcination) and various
   types of alumina supports (high and low surface area nanoparticle
   alumina {[}n-Al2O3(+), n-Al2O3(-)] and a porous gamma alumina support
   {[}p-Al2O3]). The highest product yields were obtained over Sm2O3 NPs
   synthesized using the metal-oleate high temperature decomposition and a
   nitrate precursor. Using a chloride precursor in the preparation of the
   Sm2O3 NPs resulted in less active and selective catalysts, and should be
   avoided. While the C-2 selectivities were lower over the Sm2O3/Al2O3
   catalysts, the yield per gram of Sm2O3 were higher compared with the
   Sm2O3 NPs. The best supported catalyst was the Sm2O3/n-Al2O3(-) prepared
   using incipient wetness impregnation of a nitrate precursor, since this
   leads to the smallest Sm2O3 particles as well as the largest coverage of
   the acidic Al2O3 support. XRD analysis revealed that high-temperature
   calcinations form SmAlO3 on the Al2O3-supported catalysts. While this
   reduced the near surface Sm2O3 concentration, it had beneficial effects
   as it also lowered the Al2O3 content. Therefore, Al2O3-supported Sm2O3
   warrants further investigation, as surface modifications of the Al2O3
   can reduce its acidity and lead to higher C-2 selectivities in the
   oxidative coupling of methane over these catalysts. Published by

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor containing a
   commercial SCR catalyst sample to investigate the kinetics of mercury
   oxidation in the presence of HCl and O-2 at temperatures ranging from 26
   degrees C to 400 degrees C. The results showed that the rate of Hg-0
   oxidation over SCR catalyst was zeroth order with respect to O-2 and
   nearly first order with respect to Hg-0. Mercury oxidation followed the
   Eley-Rideal mechanism involving chlorine compounds as the intermediates
   that subsequently oxidize mercury. Formation of oxidized mercury (Hg2+)
   from Hg-0 was likely the rate limiting step. The method for predicting
   mercury oxidation efficiency in a kinetic framework was also proposed,
   which used the reaction rate of mercury oxidation per catalyst mass to
   calculate oxidation efficiency. In agreement with the experimental
   results, the kinetic model well described the rate of Hg-0 oxidation in
   the presence of HCl and O-2 at different conditions. The apparent
   activation energy for Hg-0 oxidation over the SCR catalyst was 37.73
   kj/mol according to the kinetic model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Widespread applications of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) have raised
   concerns over their occurrences in the environment. In this work,
   laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling were conducted to
   determine whether carbon materials could be used to remove 3 ENPs:
   silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and titanium
   dioxide (NTiO2) from water. Hickory chips biochar (HC) and activated
   carbon (AC) were used and the two carbons were modified with iron
   impregnation to enhance their affiliation to the ENPs. Results from
   batch sorption experiments showed that all the carbon sorbents could
   sorb the ENPs in aqueous solutions and the iron modification improved
   their sorption ability. When the carbons were packed in sand columns,
   however, the unmodified carbon showed little removal efficiency to the
   ENPs, no better than the sand media. Similarly, the columns enabled with
   iron-modified carbons had better filtration ability to the ENPs,
   particularly to NTiO2 and AgNP. Among all the carbons, the iron-modified
   biochar was the best in filtering all the ENPs. Simulations from a model
   based on the advection-dispersion equation matched the filtration and
   transport of ENPs in the columns well. The DLVO theory also accurately
   described the interaction between the ENPs and the carbon materials.
   Findings from this study indicate that biochar, particularly after
   modification, can be used as a low-cost filter material to remove ENPs
   from water. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents some optical properties of TNT
   (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), RDX, HMX and tetryl, specifically their
   absorption spectra as a function of concentration in various solvents in
   the ultraviolet and visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. We
   utilize a standoff explosives detection method, called differential
   reflectometry (DR). TNT was diluted in six different solvents (acetone,
   acetonitrile, ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol, and toluene), which
   allowed for a direct comparison of absorption features over a wide range
   of concentrations. A line-shape analysis was adopted with great accuracy
   (R-2 > 0.99) to model the absorption features of TNT in differential
   reflectivity spectra. We observed a blue shift in the pertinent
   absorption band with decreasing TNT concentration for all solvents.
   Moreover, using this technique, it was found that for all utilized
   solvents the concentration of TNT as well as of RDX, HMX, and tetryl,
   measured as a function of the transition wavelength of the ultra-violet
   absorption edge in differential reflectivity spectra shows three
   distinct regions. A model is presented to explain this behavior which is
   based on intermolecular hydrogen bonding of explosives molecules with
   themselves (or lack thereof) at different concentrations. Other
   intermolecular forces such as dipole dipole interactions, London
   dispersion forces and it-stacking contribute to slight variations in the
   resulting spectra, which were determined to be rather insignificant in
   comparison to hydrogen bonding. The results are aimed towards a better
   understanding of the DR spectra of explosives energetic materials. (C)

Title = {{Boundary conditions for thermal lattice Boltzmann equation method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{237}},
Pages = {{366-395}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose a thermal boundary condition treatment based on the
   ``bounce-back{''} idea and interpolation of the distribution functions
   for both the Dirichlet and Neumann (normal derivative) conditions in the
   thermal lattice Boltzmann equation (TLBE) method. The coefficients for
   the distribution functions involved are determined to satisfy the
   Dirichlet or Neumann condition with second-order accuracy. For the
   Dirichlet condition there is an adjustable parameter in the treatment
   and three particular schemes are selected for demonstration, while for
   the Neumann condition the second-order accurate scheme is unique. When
   applied to inclined or curved boundaries, the Dirichlet condition
   treatment can be directly used, while the Neumann condition given in the
   normal direction of the boundary should be converted into derivative
   conditions in the discrete velocity directions of the TLBE model. A
   spatially coupled formula relating the boundary temperature, boundary
   normal heat flux, and the distribution functions near the boundary is
   thus derived for the Neumann problems on curved boundaries. The
   applicability and accuracy of the present boundary treatments are
   examined with several numerical tests for which analytical solutions are
   available, including the 2-dimensional (2-D) steady-state channel flow,
   the 1-D transient heat conduction in an inclined semi-infinite solid,
   the 2-D steady-state and transient heat conduction inside a circle and
   the 3-D steady-state circular pipe flow. While the Dirichlet condition
   treatment leads to second-order accuracy for the temperature field, it
   only gives a first-order accurate boundary heat flux because of the
   irregularity of the cuts by the curved boundary with the lattices. With
   the Neumann condition on the curved boundary, the accuracy for the
   temperature field obtained is first-order. When the tangential
   temperature gradient on the boundary is decoupled, second-order
   convergence of the temperature field can be obtained with Neumann
   conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Antibody-immobilized AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors
   (HEMTs) were used to detect a short peptide consisting of 20 amino
   acids. One-binding-site model and two-binding-site model were used for
   the analysis of the electrical signals, revealing the number of binding
   sites on an antibody and the dissociation constants between the antibody
   and the short peptide. In the binding-site models, the surface coverage
   ratio of the short peptide on the sensor surface is relevant to the
   electrical signals resulted from the peptide-antibody binding on the
   HEMTs. Two binding sites on an antibody were observed and two
   dissociation constants, 4.404 x 10(-11) M and 1.596 x 10(-9) M, were
   extracted from the binding-site model through the analysis of the
   surface coverage ratio of the short peptide on the sensor surface. We
   have also shown that the conventional method to extract the dissociation
   constant from the linear regression of curve-fitting with Langmuir
   isotherm equation may lead to an incorrect information if the receptor
   has more than one binding site for the ligand. The limit of detection
   (LOD) of the sensor observed in the experimental result (similar to 10
   pM of the short peptide) is very close to the LOD (around 2.7-3.4 pM)
   predicted from the value of the smallest dissociation constants. The
   sensitivity of the sensor is not only dependent on the transistors, but
   also highly relies on the affinity of the ligand-receptor pair. The
   results demonstrate that the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs cannot only be used for
   biosensors, but also for the biological affinity study. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Comprehensive characterization of defects formed in bulk ZnO single
   crystals co-implanted with N and Zn as well as N and O atoms is
   performed by means of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)
   complemented by Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. It is
   shown that in addition to intrinsic defects such as Zn vacancies and Zn
   interstitials, several N-related defects are formed in the implanted
   ZnO. The prevailed configuration of the defects is found to depend on
   the choices of the co-implants and also the chosen annealing ambient.
   Specifically, co-implantation with O leads to the formation of (i)
   defects responsible for local vibrational modes at 277, 511, and 581
   cm(-1); (ii) a N-related acceptor with the binding energy of 160640 meV
   that is involved in the donor-acceptor pair emission at 3.23eV; and
   (iii) a deep donor and a deep NO acceptor revealed from ODMR. Activation
   of the latter defects is found to require post-implantation annealing in
   nitrogen ambient. None of these defects are detected when N is
   co-implanted with Zn. Under these conditions, the dominant N-induced
   defects include a deep center responsible for the 3.3128 eV PL line, as
   well as an acceptor center of unknown origin revealed by ODMR. Formation
   mechanisms of the studied defects and their role in carrier
   recombination are discussed. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Sintering of metal particles at high temperature in thermochemical
   looping processes, such as the iron-based looping process, dramatically
   reduces their reactivity. During the sintering process, metal particles
   lose their chemically active surface area, typically within only a few
   oxidation and reduction cycles. To cope with this problem, a uniform
   external magnetic field is applied to a fluidized mixture of iron and
   silica particles to form an organized structure of magnetic iron chains.
   In this study, reaction kinetics of the magnetically stabilized porous
   structure during oxidation has been examined using thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA). High temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) has been
   performed in situ to determine at which temperatures structural changes
   occur. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been performed on samples,
   both before and after many cycles, to show the morphological changes
   that occur within the sample. TGA results demonstrate that the
   magnetically stabilized porous structure has excellent stability and
   reactivity at high reaction temperatures. These results indicate that
   this structure is suitable for many industrial and chemical processing
   applications involving high temperature, such as synthetic fuel
   production.}},

Title = {{Conservation tillage in dryland agriculture impacts watershed hydrology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{483}},
Pages = {{26-38}},
Month = {{MAR 13}},
Abstract = {{Dryland (non-irrigated) crop production in semi-arid regions requires
   sufficient water storage in the soil profile to ensure adequate plant
   available water, particularly in areas where the majority of annual
   precipitation occurs during the non-growing season. Producers can
   increase soil water storage through the adoption of best management
   practices (BMPs) for tillage and crop residue management. The objective
   of this study was to assess our hypothesis that watershed-wide adoption
   of no-till (NT) farming would decrease winter water losses and increase
   early growing season plant available water as compared with conventional
   tillage (CT) methods. We analyzed water storage potential under assumed
   full-scale adoption of NT and CT cropping practices in the Palouse
   region of eastern Washington State by applying the Distributed Hydrology
   Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) with modifications to represent the
   physical changes to infiltration, evaporation, and runoff that result
   from tillage management.
   DHSVM yielded a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) for streamflow of
   0.69 for the watershed-scale simulations over the Palouse River basin,
   which falls within the NSE ranges reported for DHSVM (0.57-0.91).
   Surface temperature predictions resulted in an NSE of 0.60, and the
   model was able to predict the soil state (frozen or unfrozen) 81\% of
   the time. Simulated soil moisture was approximately 50\% greater under
   widespread adoption of CT versus NT management during the majority of
   the winter months. Predicted volumetric soil moisture content for April
   1, 2005 was 29\% and 34\% under CT and NT management, respectively. This
   difference in winter and spring soil moisture was caused primarily by
   decreased evaporation under NT, with minimal effects resulting from
   changes in infiltration. Two simple crop yield estimation methods
   indicated that increased spring soil moisture under NT management may
   result in a 21-26\% wheat yield increase.
   We concluded that NT has the potential to increase soil water storage of
   winter precipitation in the root-zone, which may lead to higher wheat
   yields in the Palouse region. Furthermore, DHSVM was found to be
   suitable for investigating some watershed-scale agricultural management
   opportunities and has the potential to address additional questions
   pertaining to sustainable farming. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined grip force and cognition in Parkinson's
   disease (PD), Parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSAp),
   progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and healthy controls. PD is
   characterized by a slower rate of force increase and decrease and the
   production of abnormally large grip forces. Early-stage PD has
   difficulty with the rapid contraction and relaxation of hand muscles
   required for precision gripping. The first goal was to determine which
   features of grip force are abnormal in MSAp and PSP. The second goal was
   to determine whether a single variable or a combination of motor and
   cognitive measures would distinguish patient groups. Since PSP is more
   cognitively impaired relative to PD and MSAp, we expected that combining
   motor and cognitive measures would further distinguish PSP from PD and
   MSAp.
   Methods: We studied 44 participants: 12 PD, 12 MSAp, 8 PSP, and 12
   controls. Patients were diagnosed by a movement disorders neurologist
   and were tested off anti-Parkinsonian medication. Participants completed
   a visually guided grip force task wherein force pulses were produced for
   2 s, followed by 1 s of rest. We also conducted four cognitive tests.
   Results: PD, MSAp, and PSP were slower at contracting and relaxing force
   and produced longer pulse durations compared to controls. PSP produced
   additional force pulses during the task and were more cognitively
   impaired relative to other groups. A receiver operator characteristic
   analysis revealed that the combination of number of pulses and Brief
   Test of Attention (BTA) discriminated PSP from PD, MSAp, and controls
   with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.
   Conclusions: Slowness in contracting and relaxing force represent
   general features of PD, MSAp, and PSP, whereas producing additional
   force pulses was specific to PSP. Combining motor and cognitive measures
   provides a robust method for characterizing behavioral features of PSP
   compared to MSAp and PD.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{Textured barium titanate (BaTiO3) films are attracting immense research
   interest due to their lead-free composition and excellent piezoelectric
   and dielectric properties. Most synthesis methods for these films
   require a high temperature, leading to the formation of a secondary
   phase and an overall decrease in the electrical properties of the
   ceramic. In order to alleviate these issues, a novel fabrication method
   is introduced by transferring oriented rutile TiO2 nanowires to a
   textured BaTiO3 film at temperatures below 160 degrees C. The
   microstructure and thickness of the fabricated BaTiO3 films were
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and the crystal structure
   and degree of orientation were evaluated by x-ray diffraction patterns
   using the Lotgering method. It is shown that the thickness of the BaTiO3
   film can be controlled by the length of TiO2 nanowire array template,
   and the degree of orientation of the textured BaTiO3 films is highly
   dependent on the film thickness; the crystallographic orientation has
   been measured to reach up to 87\%. The relative dielectric constant
   (epsilon(r) = 1300) and ferroelectric properties (Pr = 2.7 mu C cm(-2),
   E-c = 4.0 kV mm(-1)) of the textured BaTiO3 films were also
   characterized to demonstrate their potential application in sensors,
   random access memory, and micro-electromechanical systems.}},

Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Poisson and drift-diffusion equations are solved in a three-dimensional
   device structure to simulate graphene-based vertical field effect
   transistors (GVFETs). Operation mechanisms of the GVFET with and without
   punched holes in the graphene source contact are presented and compared.
   The graphene-channel Schottky barrier can be modulated by gate electric
   field due to graphene's low density of states. For the graphene contact
   with punched holes, the contact barrier thinning and lowering around
   punched hole edge allow orders of magnitude higher tunneling current
   compared to the region away from the punched hole edge, which is
   responsible for significant performance improvement as already verified
   by experiments. Small hole size is preferred due to less electrostatic
   screening from channel inversion layer, which gives large electric field
   around the punched hole edge, thus, leading to a thinner and lower
   barrier. Bilayer and trilayer graphenes as the source contact degrade
   the performance improvement because stronger electrostatic screening
   leads to smaller contact barrier lowering and thinning. High punched
   hole area percentage improves current performance by allowing more gate
   electric field to modulate the graphene-channel barrier. Low effective
   mass channel material gives better on-off current ratio. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The synthesis of asymmetric spherical nanoparticles has attracted great

   report the formation of hemispherical or truncated
   polystyrene/nanosaponite composite particles via one-pot miniemulsion
   polymerization. It was found that the morphology of final composite
   latex particles strongly depends on the size of the nanoclay and its
   surface properties. Hemisphere or truncated sphere is the dominant
   morphology if the size of the nanoclay is larger than 100 nm. With the
   increase of the nanoclay content (up to 30 wt \%), the fraction of
   hemispherical or truncated polystyrene/nanosaponite composite latex
   particles increased accordingly. The formation of hemispherical
   particles is possibly attributed to either the asymmetric growth of
   polymer chains on one side of the hydrophobically modified clay or the
   mechanical peeling-off of large spherical particles between polymer and

Abstract = {{Power networks and information systems become more and more
   interdependent to ensure better supports for the functionality as well
   as improve the economy. However, power networks also tend to be more
   vulnerable due to the cascading failures from their interdependent
   information systems, i.e., the failures in the information systems can
   cause the failures of the coupled portion in power networks. Therefore,
   the accurate vulnerability assessment of interdependent power networks
   is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events
   or adversarial attacks targeting on critical network nodes. In this
   paper, we study the Interdependent Power Network Disruptor (IPND)
   optimization problem to identify critical nodes in an interdependent
   power network whose removals maximally destroy its functions due to both
   malfunction of these nodes and the cascading failures of its
   interdependent communication network. First, we show the IPND problem is
   NP-hard to be approximated within the factor of (2 - epsilon). Despite
   its intractability, we propose a greedy framework with novel centrality
   functions based on the networks' interdependencies, to efficiently solve
   this problem in a timely manner. An extensive experiment not only
   illustrates the effectiveness of our approach on networks with different
   topologies and interdependencies, but also highlights some important
   observations which help to sharpen the robustness of interdependent
   networks in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Powerline communications (PLC) is a favorable technique for many smart
   grid applications. By transmitting information over the existing
   powerline infrastructure, PLC has the benefit of low deployment cost.
   However, due to low transmit power, limited bandwidth, and harsh channel
   conditions, reliable long-distance and high-capacity PLC is challenging.
   Relay-aided (RA-) PLC is promising in addressing these issues. In this
   paper, we investigate the performance of the amplify-and-forward (AF)
   RA-PLC system from an information-theoretic perspective. The capacity of
   AF-based RA-PLC is analyzed for frequency-selective PLC channels. The
   capacity bounds are derived, and the optimal power allocation between
   the transmitting nodes and the optimal power distribution over the
   signal frequency band are obtained. The capacity benefits and features
   of AF-based RA-PLC are evaluated with two prevalent powerline channel
   models. Based on the signal attenuation model, the capacity of AF-based
   RA-PLC is compared with direct-link (DL-) PLC, and the effect of relay
   location is revealed. In addition, based on the transmission line (TL)
   model, the effects of branch density and load impedance on the capacity
   of AF-based RA-PLC are evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The growing population and global warming have been calling for more
   effective energy usage, which have stimulated the emergence of smart
   sustainable energy technology. The distinct feature of this newly
   emerging technology is the incorporation of advanced information and
   communication technologies (ICT), which collects more detailed
   information on how energy is generated, distributed, and consumed.
   Various smart metering technologies have also been proposed to support
   the optimization on sustainable energy usage. Despite the obvious
   benefits of these technologies, people may still hesitate to adopt them
   because of possible privacy breach. On the other hand, we observe that
   the major target information for making the sustainable energy system
   smart is the aggregated statistics of energy usage, not the full
   detailed usage profiles which would compromise customers' privacy. Thus,
   how to design schemes to collect aggregated statistics while preserving
   customers' privacy becomes an important research problem. In this paper,
   we propose two schemes to deal with this problem. The first one can
   support dynamic profiling, which can extract aggregated statistical
   information without compromising individual privacy. The second one aims
   to extract correlation information among various factors for the smart
   system design and can also be used as an underlying tool for baseline
   inference and association rule mining.}},

Abstract = {{Current velocity observations from the continental shelves of Coquimbo
   (similar to 30 degrees S) and Concepcion (similar to 36 degrees 30'S),
   central Chile, were analyzed to evaluate the role of water column
   stratification and shelf width on baroclinic semidiurnal tidal currents.
   Semidiurnal barotropic currents off both zones were typically <5cm/s,
   but depth-dependent semidiurnal flows could exceed 10 cm s(-1) during
   stratified conditions. Both zones are recognized as pronounced upwelling
   centers, with maximum upwelling-favorable winds in spring and summer,
   respectively. At the northern zone, stratification was mainly controlled
   by temperature differences between surface and bottom waters with
   maximum stratification during summer. The southern zone showed more
   stratification during winter because of freshwater input from local
   rivers. Consequently, greater variability in the baroclinic semidiurnal
   currents was observed during summer at the northern continental shelf
   and in winter at the south. In both regions, much of the semidiurnal
   variability was consistent with an internal wave's first baroclinic mode
   of wavelengths of similar to 10-13 km. Nevertheless, during the period
   of maximum energy fluxes off the north, the second baroclinic mode
   (wavelength similar to 7 km) was also important and matched periods of
   low upwelling index (relaxation of upwelling favorable winds). Typical
   energy fluxes during summer integrated in the water column, related to
   the semidiurnal internal tides were 0.12 W/m of the northern site and
   0.1 W/m off the southern site. Possible sites of internal wave
   generation off the south were the Biobio submarine canyon and the
   slope/shelf break, while off the north, the generation site was the
   slope/shelf break.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional mixture theory model for flow and sediment transport
   in the seafloor boundary layer, SedMix3D, simulated the flow over and
   the resulting sediment entrainment and evolution of rippled beds.
   SedMix3D treats the fluid-sediment mixture as a continuum of varying
   density and viscosity with the concentration of sediment and velocity of
   the mixture simulated by the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a
   sediment flux equation for the mixture. Model validation was performed
   by comparing simulated time-dependent flow quantities and bulk flow
   statistics with measurements obtained in the laboratory under scaled
   forcing conditions. Two-dimensional planes extracted from a
   three-dimensional simulation were compared to observations made using
   planar Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in a laboratory flume. The
   simulated results of time-averaged velocities and time-dependent
   quantities of vorticity and swirling strength were in good agreement
   with the observations. The model was used to analyze the
   three-dimensionality of vortex formation and ejection produced by
   oscillatory flow over vortex ripples, a process that cannot be observed
   in the laboratory with planar PIV measurements. The three-dimensional
   simulated results showed that the swirling strength varied significantly
   in the cross-flow direction, indicating that the vortices formed and
   dissipated non-uniformly due to random fluctuations. Subsequently, an
   order of magnitude difference in offshore sediment flux was observed
   using two different methods to calculate sediment fluxes (spatially
   averaging and at a point). The results suggest that while a
   two-dimensional plane may be sufficient to examine the general
   hydrodynamics over ripples, three-dimensional analysis is necessary for
   a complete understanding of sediment transport.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the impact of Asian soybean rust on soybean yield is of
   great importance in the crop simulation model for this crop become it is
   possible to predict yield using different sowing dates and growth
   conditions. The goal of this study were to evaluate the performance of
   two soybean cultivars in Triangulo Mineiro/Alto Paranaiba, MG, Brazil
   and the effects of soybean rust on the yield of these cultivars using
   the CSM-CROPGRO Soybean model. Two soybean cultivars ``NK 7074{''}
   (early) and ``UFUS-Impacta{''} (medium late), which differ in their
   development cycles, were growing in Uberaba city during the 2009/2010
   growing season. The validation for cultivar ``UFUS-Impacta{''} was
   conducted comparing the measured and simulated yield data considering
   three different sowing dates in the ``Uberlandia{''} city during the
   2002/2003 growing season. Daily meteorological data obtained from six
   meteorological stations of the National Institute of Meteorology
   (INMET). To determine the performance of the soybean cultivars and the
   effect of soybean rust on yield, three different scenarios were used: no
   occurrence of rust (NOR) and occurrence of rust with inoculum
   concentrations of U5.000 and U10.000 urediniospores/mL. For all
   environments studied, the early cultivar had the best performance than
   the medium late cultivar. Soybean rust had the most effect on yield for
   the U10.000 scenario than for the U5.000 scenario. The best soybean
   performance occurred for ``Araxa{''} and ``Uberaba{''} cities. The
   South-Southeast area of the ``Triangulo Mineiro/Alto Paranaiba{''}
   region was the most sensitive to the effect of rust on yield compared to
   the North region.}},

Abstract = {{Link failure localization has been an important and challenging problem
   for all-optical networks. The most general monitoring structure, called
   m-trail, is a light-path into which optical signals are launched and
   monitored. How to minimize the number of required m-trails is critical
   to the expense of this technique. Existing solutions are limited to
   localizing single link failure or handling only small networks.
   Moreover, some practical constraints, like lacking of knowledge of the
   failure quantity, are ignored. To overcome these limitations is
   prospective but quite challenging. To this end, we provide novel
   theoretical solution frameworks toward the multi-failure localization
   problem. On one hand, for small dense networks, we provide a
   tree-decomposition based algorithm; on the other hand, a random walk
   based localized algorithm for large scale sparse networks is proposed.
   In addition, we further adapt these two algorithms to cope with three
   practical constraints. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are
   included to prove the correctness and efficiency of the proposed
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of water and contaminant discharges is an important
   hydrological problem. Fractured rock aquifers are recognized as highly
   complex flow and transport systems, and the fractured rock passive flux
   meter (FRPFM) is a recently tested device to simultaneously measure
   cumulative water and contaminant mass fluxes in fractures intersecting
   an observation well (boring). Furthermore, the FRPFM is capable of
   indicating orientations and directions of flow in hydraulically active
   ({''}flowing{''}) fractures. The present work develops a discharge
   estimator for when FRPFM measurements of fracture fluxes in the
   direction perpendicular to a transect (control plane) along one or more
   observation wells are available. In addition, estimation uncertainty in
   terms of a coefficient of variation is assessed based on a Monte Carlo
   approach under normalized conditions. Sources of uncertainty considered
   are spatially random fracture trace locations, random trace lengths, and
   orientations as well as variability of trace average fluxes (including
   smooth spatial trends), variability of local fluxes within traces, and
   flux measurement errors. Knowledge about the trace length distribution,
   which is commonly not available from borehole surveys, is not required
   for discharge estimation. However, it does affect the uncertainty
   assessment, and equations for upper uncertainty bounds are given as an
   alternative. In agreement with general statistical inference, it is
   found that discharge uncertainty decreases proportionally with the
   number of fluxes measured. Results are validated, and an example problem
   illustrates practical application and performance. Citation: Acar, O.,

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The coupling of passive structural response of flexible membranes with
   the flow over them can significantly alter the aerodynamic
   characteristic of simple flat-plate wings. The use of flexible wings is
   common throughout biological flying systems inspiring many engineers to
   incorporate them into small engineering flying systems. In many of these
   systems, the motion of the membrane serves to passively alter the flow
   over the wing potentially resulting in an aerodynamic benefit. In this
   study, the aerodynamic loads and the flow field for a rigid flat-plate
   wing are compared to free trailing-edge membrane wings with two
   different pre-tensions at a chord-based Reynolds number of approximately
   50,000. The membrane was silicon rubber with a scalloped free trailing
   edge. The analysis presented includes load measurements from a sting
   balance along with velocity fields and membrane deflections from
   synchronized, time-resolved particle image velocimetry and digital image
   correlation. The load measurements demonstrate increased aerodynamic
   efficiency and lift, while the synchronized flow and membrane
   measurements show how the membrane motion serves to force the flow. This
   passive flow control introduced by the membranes motion alters the flows
   development over the wing and into the wake region demonstrating how, at
   least for lower angles of attack, the membranes motion drives the flow
   as opposed to the flow driving the membrane motion.}},

Title = {{Impact of SO2 on elemental mercury oxidation over CeO2-TiO2 catalyst}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{219}},
Pages = {{319-326}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Effect of SO2 on elemental mercury (Hg-0) oxidation over a highly active
   CeO2-TiO2 catalyst was systematically investigated. SO2 was found to
   have different, even contrary, effects on Hg-0 oxidation under different
   flue gas conditions. In pure N-2 atmosphere, SO2 inhibited Hg-0
   oxidation. In N-2 plus O-2 atmosphere, low concentration of SO2 promoted
   Hg-0 oxidation, while high concentration of SO2 deteriorated Hg-0
   oxidation. The promotional effect of SO2 on Hg-0 oxidation was probably
   due to SO3 generated from SO2 oxidation, and the inhibitive effect of
   SO2 on Hg-0 oxidation was attributed to the competitive adsorption
   between SO2 and Hg-0. The results suggest a balance point for SO2
   concentration, where the promotional effect on Hg-0 oxidation by SO3
   originated from SO2 is equal to the inhibitive effect of SO2 on Hg-0
   adsorption and subsequent oxidation via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   mechanism. In the presence of NO, SO2 with the aid of O-2 exhibited
   promotional effect on Hg-0 oxidation through NO-catalyzed oxidation to
   form SO3 and hence a balance point of higher SO2 concentration. However,
   without O-2, SO2 greatly limited Hg-0 oxidation in the presence of NO.
   When HCl was present, most Hg-0 oxidation was due to reactions between
   active chlorine species and adsorbed Hg-0. SO2 inhibited Hg-0 adsorption
   and therefore deteriorated Hg-0 oxidation by chlorine species. When both
   NO and HCl were present, NO accelerated the conversion of SO2 to SO3,
   and hence relieved the prohibitive effect of SO2 on Hg-0 oxidation by
   HCl. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of joint congestion control and
   scheduling in wireless networks with quality-of-service (QoS)
   guarantees. Different from per-destination queueing in the existing
   works, which is not scalable, this paper considers per-link queueing at
   each node, which significantly reduces the number of queues per node.
   Under per-link queueing, we formulate the joint congestion control and
   scheduling problem as a network utility maximization (NUM) problem and
   use a dual decomposition method to separate the NUM problem into two
   subproblems, i.e., a congestion control problem and a scheduling
   problem. Then, we develop a sliding-mode-based (SM) distributed
   congestion control scheme and prove its convergence and optimality
   property. Different from the existing schemes, our congestion control
   scheme is capable of providing multiclass QoS under the general scenario
   of multipath and multihop; in addition, it is robust against network
   anomalies, e.g., link failures, because it can achieve multipath load
   balancing.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and current rainfall characterization is an important tool for
   water-related system design and management. Updated rainfall
   intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships in peninsular India
   were developed; impacts on runoff and groundwater recharge attributable
   to changes in rainfall characteristics are discussed. Two data sets were
   used from gage in Hyderabad city, the capital of Andhra Pradesh: hourly
   rainfall data for the 19 years from 1993-2011 and daily rainfall data
   for the 30 years from 1982-2011. Hourly data were used to develop
   updated rainfall IDF relationships; daily data were used for trend
   analysis of threshold-based rainfall events. IDF curves were developed
   for return periods of 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years for 1-,
   2-, 4-, 8-, and 24-h durations. The updated IDF relationships showed a
   significant change in rainfall characteristics compared with older
   relationships for the region surrounding Hyderabad, India; they showed
   greater rainfall intensities across all durations and return periods.
   Greater intensity storms may reduce groundwater recharge and increase
   runoff, making the surface storage of runoff increasingly important to
   enhance recharge and reduce flooding risks. DOI:

   data are consistent with a strong decrease in electron concentration in

   HEMTs, the typical critical voltage for unirradiated devices was similar
   to 13 V. By sharp contrast, no critical voltage was detected for proton

Abstract = {{AlGaN/AlN/GaN/sapphire, AlGaN/GaN/sapphire, AlGaN/GaN/Si, and
   InAlN/GaN/sapphire heterojunctions (HJs) were irradiated with 10 MeV
   electrons to fluences of 2 x 10(15) to 3.3 x 10(16) cm(-2). The main
   effects on the electrical properties were a decrease in two-dimensional
   electron gas (2DEG) mobility and the shift of capacitance-voltage (C-V)
   characteristics to more positive values. The 50\% 2DEG mobility decrease
   occurred at a similar fluence of 3.3 x 10(16) cm(-2) for all AlGaN/GaN
   and AlGaN/AlN/GaN HJs, but at a much lower fluence of 1.3 x 10(16)
   cm(-2) for InAlN/GaN, which is in line with previous observations for
   neutron irradiated HJs. The shift of C-V characteristics is due to
   increased concentration of deep acceptor traps in the barrier/interface
   region. In AlGaN/GaN/Si transistors, the increase of concentration of
   deep barrier/interface traps with activation energy of 0.3, 0.55, and
   0.8 eV was observed. This increase correlates with the observed
   degradation of gate lag characteristics of transistors after irradiation
   with 1.3 x 10(16) cm(-2) electrons. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.

Title = {{Dependence on proton energy of degradation of AlGaN/GaN high electron

Abstract = {{The effects of proton irradiation energy on dc, small signal, and large
   signal rf characteristics of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility
   transistors (HEMTs) were investigated. AlGaN/GaN HEMTs were irradiated
   with protons at fixed fluence of 5 x 10(15)/cm(2) and energies of 5, 10,
   and 15 MeV. Both dc and rf characteristics revealed more degradation at
   lower irradiation energy, with reductions of maximum transconductance of
   11\%, 22\%, and 38\%, and decreases in drain saturation current of 10\%,
   24\%, and 46\% for HEMTs exposed to 15, 10, and 5 MeV protons,
   respectively. The increase in device degradation with decreasing proton
   energy is due to the increase in linear energy transfer and
   corresponding increase in nonionizing energy loss with decreasing proton
   energy in the active region of the HEMTs. After irradiation, both
   subthreshold drain leakage current and reverse gate current decreased
   more than 1 order of magnitude for all samples. The carrier removal rate
   was in the range 121-336 cm(-1) over the range of proton energies
   employed in this study. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{Recent natural and man-made catastrophes, such as the Fukushima nuclear
   power plant, flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon
   oil spill, the Haiti earthquake, and the mortgage derivatives crisis,
   have renewed interest in the concept of resilience, especially as it
   relates to complex systems vulnerable to multiple or cascading failures.
   Although the meaning of resilience is contested in different contexts,
   in general resilience is understood to mean the capacity to adapt to
   changing conditions without catastrophic loss of form or function. In
   the context of engineering systems, this has sometimes been interpreted
   as the probability that system conditions might exceed an irrevocable
   tipping point. However, we argue that this approach improperly conflates
   resilience and risk perspectives by expressing resilience exclusively in
   risk terms. In contrast, we describe resilience as an emergent property
   of what an engineering system does, rather than a static property the
   system has. Therefore, resilience cannot be measured at the systems
   scale solely from examination of component parts. Instead, resilience is
   better understood as the outcome of a recursive process that includes:
   sensing, anticipation, learning, and adaptation. In this approach,
   resilience analysis can be understood as differentiable from, but
   complementary to, risk analysis, with important implications for the
   adaptive management of complex, coupled engineering systems. Management
   of the 2011 flooding in the Mississippi River Basin is discussed as an
   example of the successes and challenges of resilience-based management
   of complex natural systems that have been extensively altered by
   engineered structures.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic response for the solar diffusion driven desalination (DDD)
   process has been investigated. The heat and mass transfer within the
   direct contact evaporator is analyzed by one-dimensional conservation
   equations. The heat and mass transport models account for the transient
   variations within the packed bed due to time varying inlet water and air
   temperatures and humidity. The conservation equations are solved
   numerically using a finite difference scheme to predict water, air/vapor
   mixture and packed bed temperatures and humidity ratio within the
   evaporator and the condenser. The system dynamic response for the packed
   bed materials, wettability, and liquid hold-up, sudden increase-decrease
   in the inlet water temperature is investigated. It is found that the
   response time for the outlet water to reach the steady state temperature
   in the evaporator is shorter for lower liquid hold-ups. The response
   time is not sensitive to the packing material. Higher wettability does
   not affect the response time, but it does result in improved heat
   transfer with a higher exit air temperature and lower exit water
   temperature. The steady state temperature in the evaporator is not
   dependent on the heat capacity of the packing material, and liquid hold
   up. A delayed operating mode for the solar DDD is introduced to enhance
   the fresh water production rate. It is found that increasing the initial
   saline water temperature and decreasing the initial water volume in the
   seawater tank results in a higher fresh water production rate. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{As a result of climate change, and in particular rainfall changes,
   agricultural production is likely to change across the globe. Until now
   most research has focused on areas which will become unsustainable for
   agricultural production. However, there are also regions where climate
   change might actually improve conditions for growth. In the western
   Pampas region of Argentina, average annual rainfall has increased by
   100-200 mm over the last 70 years, mainly during summer. Wheat is grown
   during winter, primarily on stored soil water and the main factor
   limiting plant production in this area is rainfall. Using the well
   tested simulation model APSIM-NWheat, we studied whether recent climate
   change has potentially opened new opportunities for wheat cropping in
   Argentina. Simulation results indicated that the additional rainfall in
   the Pampas of Argentina has increased the achievable yield (defined as
   the yield limited by solar radiation, temperature, water and nitrogen
   supply) of wheat in the currently cropped region, but less than expected
   based on the large amount of additional rainfall. The higher achievable
   yield from additional rainfall could potentially allow an expansion of
   profitable wheat cropping into currently non-cropped areas, where the
   achievable wheat yield increased in average from 1 t/ha to currently 2
   t/ha. However, the poor water-holding capacity of the sandy soils which
   dominate the region outside the current cropping area limits the systems
   ability to use most of the increased summer rainfall. Nevertheless, the
   current higher achievable yield indicates a suitability of the region
   for cropping, which will slightly decline or remain unchanged depending
   on summer rainfall storage, with current and future climate change,
   including projected changes in rainfall, temperature and atmospheric CO2
   concentration. Factors other than just the achievable yield will
   eventually influence any future development of this region for cropping,
   including the high sensitivity of the sandy soils to erosion and
   nutrient leaching, current relatively high land prices, restrictions on
   clearing for cropping, the distance to the nearest port and current
   unsuitable cultivars withstanding the high frost risk.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effects of climate change on sugarcane yield,
   water use efficiency, and irrigation needs in southern Brazil, based on
   downscaled outputs of two general circulation models (PRECIS and CSIRO)
   and a sugarcane growth model. For three harvest cycles every year, the
   DSSAT/CANEGRO model was used to simulate the baseline and four future
   climate scenarios for stalk yield for the 2050s. The model was
   calibrated for the main cultivar currently grown in Brazil based on five
   field experiments under several soil and climate conditions. The
   sensitivity of simulated stalk fresh mass (SFM) to air temperature, CO2
   concentration {[}CO2] and rainfall was also analyzed. Simulated SFM
   responses to {[}CO2], air temperature and rainfall variations were
   consistent with the literature. There were increases in simulated SFM
   and water usage efficiency (WUE) for all scenarios. On average, for the
   current sugarcane area in the State of Sao Paulo, SFM would increase 24
   \% and WUE 34 \% for rainfed sugarcane. The WUE rise is relevant because
   of the current concern about water supply in southern Brazil.
   Considering the current technological improvement rate, projected yields
   for 2050 ranged from 96 to 129 tha(-1), which are respectively 15 and 59
   \% higher than the current state average yield.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing single or
   multiple atlases (templates) from a large population of images. Unlike
   many existing methods, our proposed approach is distinguished by its
   emphasis on the sharpness of the computed atlases and the requirement of
   rotational invariance. In particular, we argue that sharp atlas images
   that retain crucial and important anatomical features with high fidelity
   are more useful for many medical imaging applications when compared with
   the blurry and fuzzy atlas images computed by most existing methods. The
   geometric notion that underlies our approach is the idea of manifold
   learning in a quotient space, the quotient space of the image space by
   the rotations. We present an extension of the existing manifold learning
   approach to quotient spaces by using invariant metrics, and utilizing
   the manifold structure for partitioning the images into more homogeneous
   sub-collections, each of which can be represented by a single atlas
   image. Specifically, we propose a three-step algorithm. First, we
   partition the input images into subgroups using unsupervised or
   semi-supervised learning methods on manifolds. Then we formulate a
   convex optimization problem in each subgroup to locate the atlases and
   determine the crucial neighbors that are used in the realization step to
   form the template images. We have evaluated our algorithm using whole
   brain MR volumes from OASIS database. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the atlases computed using the proposed algorithm not only discover
   the brain structural changes in different age groups but also preserve
   important structural details and generally enjoy better image quality.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a cylindrical insert that can be inserted in the
   fornix for extended release of glaucoma drug timolol. The insert is
   prepared by incorporating timolol-loaded nanoparticles into a poly
   hydroxyl ethyl methacrylate (p-HEMA) matrix. A 1-mm diameter, 7.5-mm
   long insert with 25\% (w/w) particles can release timolol for about 10
   days at an average rate of about 15 mu g/day, which may be
   therapeutically effective. The increase in particle fraction increases
   drug loading, but also increases the release duration. The net effect of
   increasing the particle fraction is a significant increase in release
   duration, but a decrease in daily drug release rates, in the first few
   weeks. The release duration increases to about 1 and 3 months on
   increasing the particle fraction to 50\% and 75\%, respectively. The
   average daily release rates in the first 3 weeks are 15, 9, and 3 mu
   g/day for the inserts with 50\%, 75\%, and 100\% (w/w) particles,
   respectively. The mechanism of release is hydrolysis of the ester bond
   that links timolol to the propoxylated glyceryl triacrylate matrix, and
   thus the release profiles fit a first order reaction model. The water
   content of the inserts decreases from 31\% to almost zero on increasing
   the particle loading from 25\% to 100\%. The rate constant for the
   hydrolysis decreases with an increase in particle loading in the insert
   most likely due to the reduction in the water content. The inserts can
   be packaged in wet conditions and stored in a refrigerator, but the
   inserts will exhibit a burst release caused by release of the drug from
   the particles into the p-HEMA matrix during the shelf life. Also, the
   magnitude of drug release after the initial burst is reduced due to the
   storage. The burst effect could potentially be avoided by packaging the
   inserts in a dry state, with hydration before insertion.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to extend the capabilities of multispectral
   optical imaging techniques for morphological characterization of
   irregular particles, encountered in several applications. We have
   utilized the Gaussian random ellipsoid model to quantize the shape
   elongation and deviation in complex-shaped particles. Compared with the
   Gaussian random sphere model, it is more realistic and is applicable to
   wider range of irregular particles with minimum possible of free
   parameters. By processing the reduced light scattering spectra, the
   proposed inverse technique can simultaneously recover the size, volume
   fraction, elongation, and shape deformation of particles that are
   randomly oriented within a colloidal suspension. The discrete dipole
   approximation is employed in forward light scattering calculations, and
   input synthetic data generation. To investigate the robustness of our
   algorithm in coping with real scenarios, we have added different levels
   of noise to the observed scattering spectra. The results demonstrate the
   potential of our technique to non-invasively recover the morphology
   parameters of irregular particles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler for piecewise convex hyperspectral
   unmixing and endmember extraction is presented. The standard linear
   mixing model used for hyperspectral unmixing assumes that hyperspectral
   data reside in a single convex region. However, hyperspectral data are
   often nonconvex. Furthermore, in standard endmember extraction and
   unmixing methods, endmembers are generally represented as a single point
   in the high-dimensional space. However, the spectral signature for a
   material varies as a function of the inherent variability of the
   material and environmental conditions. Therefore, it is more appropriate
   to represent each endmember as a full distribution and use this
   information during spectral unmixing. The proposed method searches for
   several sets of endmember distributions. By using several sets of
   endmember distributions, a piecewise convex mixing model is applied, and
   given this model, the proposed method performs spectral unmixing and
   endmember estimation given this nonlinear representation of the data.
   Each set represents a random simplex. The vertices of the random simplex
   are modeled by the endmember distributions. The hyperspectral data are
   partitioned into sets associated with each of the extracted sets of
   endmember distributions using a Dirichlet process prior. The Dirichlet
   process prior also estimates the number of sets. Thus, the
   Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler partitions the data into convex regions,
   estimates the required number of convex regions, and estimates endmember
   distributions and abundance values for all convex regions. Results are
   presented on real hyperspectral and simulated data that indicate the
   ability of the method to effectively estimate endmember distributions
   and the number of sets of endmember distributions.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of neutron irradiation temperature and dose on thermal
   diffusivity are investigated by comparing non-irradiated and in-pile
   irradiated MgO samples. MgO pellets were irradiated in-pile of the
   Advanced Test Reactor at Idaho National Laboratory. Samples were
   irradiated at 623 and 973 K to fast neutron fluences of similar to 1 x
   10(25) (1.5 dpa) and similar to 2 x 10(25) n/m(2) (3 dpa). Post
   irradiation examination included X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy, laser flash thermal diffusivity, and transmission electron
   microscopy. Neutron irradiation of MgO causes a significant reduction in
   the thermal diffusivity (46\%-72\% at room temperature) due to
   irradiation-induced defects. The radiation induced thermophysical and
   structural evolution of MgO is reported. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Molecular-dynamics simulations are used to characterize the effects of
   dislocations on the thermal transport properties of UO2. Microstructures
   with various dislocation densities of the order of 10(16) m(-2) are
   simulated at temperatures between 800 and 1600 K. The effects of
   dislocations on the thermal-transport properties are found to be
   independent on temperature, consistent with the classic Klemens-Callaway
   analysis. The effect of dislocation density is also quantified. The
   simulation results are also fit to the pertinent part of the empirical
   formula for the thermal conductivity used in the FRAPCON
   fuel-performance code, which gives the overall effects of temperature
   and dislocation effects on thermal conductivity. The fitted results can
   be well-described within this formalism, indicating that the results of
   molecular-dynamics simulations can be used as a reliable source of
   parameters for models at longer length scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   the accuracy and simplify the application of the Hermite model to
   measured data. The effective region with respect to skewness and

   pressure data from full scale and wind tunnel model low rise buildings
   fall within or very close to this effective region. Common PDF models
   utilized in wind engineering literature are compared with the Hermite
   PDF model for mildly and strongly non-Gaussian wind tunnel and full

Abstract = {{An accurate description of the mechanical response of alpha-titanium
   requires consideration of mechanical anisotropy. In this work we adapt a
   polycrystal self-consistent model embedded in finite elements to
   simulate deformation of textured alpha-titanium under quasi-static
   conditions at room temperature. Monotonic tensile and compressive
   macroscopic stress-strain curves, electron backscattered diffraction and
   neutron diffraction data are used to calibrate and validate the model.
   We show that the model captures with great accuracy the anisotropic
   strain hardening and texture evolution in the material. Comparisons
   between predictions and experimental data allow us to elucidate the role
   that the different plastic deformation mechanisms play in determining
   microstructure and texture evolution. The polycrystal model, embedded in
   an implicit finite element code, is then used to simulate geometrical
   changes in bending experiments of alpha-titanium bars. These
   predictions, together with results of a macroscopic allotropic
   elasto-plastic model that accounts for evolving anisotropy, are compared
   with the experiments. Both models accurately capture the experimentally
   observed upward shift of the neutral axis as well as the rigidity of the
   material response along hard-to-deform crystallographic < c > direction.

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To review the discoveries underpinning the introduction of
   cerebral PET scanning and highlight its modern applications. Background:
   Important discoveries in neurophysiology, brain metabolism, and
   radiotracer development in the post-World War II period provided the
   necessary infrastructure for the first cerebral PET scan.
   Methods: A complete review of the literature was undertaken to search
   for primary and secondary sources on the history of PET imaging.
   Searches were performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and select individual
   journal Web sites. Written autobiographies were obtained through the
   Society for Neuroscience Web site at www.sfn.org. A reference book on
   the history of radiology, Naked to the Bone, was reviewed to corroborate
   facts and to locate references. The references listed in all the
   articles and books obtained were reviewed.
   Results: The neurophysiologic sciences required to build cerebral PET
   imaging date back to 1878. The last 60 years have produced an evolution
   of technological advancements in brain metabolism and radiotracer
   development. These advancements facilitated the development of modern
   cerebral PET imaging. Several key scientists were involved in critical
   discoveries and among them were Angelo Mosso, Charles Roy, Charles
   Sherrington, John Fulton, Seymour Kety, Louis Sokoloff, David E. Kuhl,
   Gordon L. Brownell, Michael Ter-Pogossian, Michael Phelps, and Edward
   Hoffman.
   Conclusions: Neurophysiology, metabolism, and radiotracer development in
   the postwar era synergized the development of the technology necessary
   for cerebral PET scanning. Continued use of PET in clinical trials and
   current developments in PET-CT/MRI hybrids has led to advancement in
   diagnosis, management, and treatment of neurologic disorders. Neurology

Volume = {{153}},

Abstract = {{In 1997, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission amended its
   criteria under which patients administered radioactive materials could
   be released from the hospital. The revised criteria ensures that the
   total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) to any individual exposed to the
   released patient will not likely exceed 5 mSv. Licensees are recommended
   to use one of the three options to release the patient in accordance
   with these regulatory requirements: administered activity, measured dose
   rate, or patient-specific dose calculation. The NRCs suggested
   calculation method is based on the assumption that the patient (source)
   and a family member (target) are each considered to be points in space.
   This point source/target assumption has been shown to be conservative in
   comparison to more realistic guidelines. In this present study, the
   effective doses to family members were calculated using a series of
   revised Oak Ridge National Laboratory stylised phantoms coupled with a
   Monte Carlo radiation transport code. A set of TEDE per cumulated
   activity values were calculated for three different distributions of
   I-131 (thyroid, abdomen and whole body), various separation distances
   and two exposure scenarios (face-to-face standing and side-by-side
   lying). The results indicate that an overestimation of TEDE per
   cumulated activity based on the point source/target method was 2-fold.
   The values for paediatric phantoms showed a strong age-dependency, which
   showed that dosimetry for children should be separately considered
   instead of using adult phantoms as a substitute. On the basis of the
   results of this study, a licensee may use less conservative
   patient-specific release criteria and provide the patient and the family
   members with more practical dose avoidance guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{We examine how the estimation error grows with time when a mobile robot
   estimates its location from relative pose measurements without global
   position or orientation sensors. We show that, in both two-dimensional
   and three-dimensional space, both the bias and the variance of the
   position estimation error grows at most linearly with time
   asymptotically. Non-asymptotic bounds on the bias and variance are
   obtained, which provide insight into the mechanism of error growth. The
   bias is crucially dependent on the trajectory of the robot. Conclusions
   on the asymptotic growth rate of the bias continue to hold even with
   unbiased measurements or error-free translation measurements. Exact
   formulas for the bias and the variance of the position estimation error
   are provided for two specific two-dimensional trajectories - straight
   line and periodic. Experiments with a P3-DX wheeled robot and Monte
   Carlo simulations are provided to verify the theoretical predictions. A
   method to reduce the bias is proposed based on the lessons learned. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper considers a new class of stochastic resource allocation
   problems that requires simultaneously determining the customers that a
   capacitated resource must serve and the stock levels of multiple items
   that may be used in meeting these customers' demands. Our model
   considers a reward (revenue) for serving each assigned customer, a
   variable cost for allocating each item to the resource, and a shortage
   cost for each unit of unsatisfied customer demand in a single-period
   context. The model maximizes the expected profit resulting from the
   assignment of customers and items to the resource while obeying the
   resource capacity constraint. We provide an exact solution method for
   this mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem using a Generalized
   Benders Decomposition approach. This decomposition approach uses
   Lagrangian relaxation to solve a constrained multi-item newsvendor
   subproblem and uses CPLEX to solve a mixed-integer linear master
   problem. We generate Benders cuts for the master problem by obtaining a
   series of subgradients of the subproblem's convex objective function. In
   addition, we present a family of heuristic solution approaches and
   compare our methods with several MINLP (Mixed-Integer Nonlinear
   Programming) commercial solvers in order to benchmark their efficiency
   and quality.}},

Volume = {{203}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{325-350}},

Abstract = {{We consider a replenishment and disposal planning problem (RDPP) that
   arises in settings where customer returns are in as-good-as-new
   condition. These returns can be placed into inventory to satisfy future
   demand or can be disposed of, in case they lead to excess inventory. Our
   focus is on a multi-product setting with dynamic demands and returns
   over a finite planning horizon with explicit replenishment and disposal
   capacities. The problem is to determine the timing of replenishment and
   disposal setups, along with the associated quantities for the products,
   so as to minimize the total costs of replenishment, disposal, and
   inventory holding throughout the planning horizon. We examine two
   variants of the RDPP of interest both of which are specifically
   motivated by a spare part kitting application. In one variant, the
   replenishment capacity is shared among multiple products while the
   disposal capacity is product specific. In the other variant, both the
   replenishment and disposal capacities are shared among the products. We
   propose a Lagrangian Relaxation approach that relies on the relaxation
   of the capacity constraints and develop a smoothing heuristic that uses
   the solution of the Lagrangian problem to obtain near-optimal solutions.
   Our computational results demonstrate that the proposed approach is very
   effective in obtaining high-quality solutions with a reasonable
   computational effort.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a high-frequency DC-DC boost converter capable of
   sustaining up to 4x the rated process voltage using high-voltage devices
   fabricated in standard 0.13 mu m 1.2 V CMOS without additional masking
   steps. Integrated Schottky Barrier Diodes (SBD) and high-voltage stacked
   composite NMOS switches enable processing of large voltages in a 100 MHz
   digitally assisted four-phase switched inductor (SI) boost converter
   architecture. A high-frequency digital delay-locked loop (DDLL) is
   employed to automatically stagger and synchronize each phase to a
   primary current-mode pulsed-width modulator (PWM) controller, thus
   eliminating the need for multiple current sensing circuits. The
   converter operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and utilizes
   integrated Schottky diode output rectifier stages to eliminate dead-time
   controllers and power hungry high side drivers. The converter operates
   at 100 MHz with four external 22 nH inductors and achieves an output
   conversion range of 3 V to 5 V from a 1.2 V input supply. It can deliver
   240 mW at 3 V and 200 mW at 5 V with an efficiency of 60\%, and similar
   to 180 mW at 3 V with peak efficiency of 64\%.}},

Abstract = {{The detrimental effects of illness on cognition are familiar to
   virtually everyone. Some effects resolve quickly while others may linger
   after the illness resolves. We found that a transient immune response
   stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compromised hippocampal
   neurogenesis and impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. The
   immune event caused an similar to 50\% reduction in the number of
   neurons generated during the illness and the onset of the memory
   impairment was delayed and coincided with the time when neurons
   generated during the illness would have become functional within the
   hippocampus. Broad spectrum non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
   attenuated these effects but selective Cox-2 inhibition was ineffective
   while PPAR gamma activation was surprisingly effective at protecting
   both neurogenesis and memory from the effects of LPS-produced transient
   illness. These data may highlight novel mechanisms behind chronic
   inflammatory and neuroinflammatory episodes that are known to compromise
   hippocampus-dependent forms of learning and memory. Published by

Abstract = {{Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfapyridine (SPY), two representative
   sulfonamide antibiotics, have gained increasing attention because of the
   ecological risks these substances pose to plants, animals, and humans.
   This work systematically investigated the removal of SMX and SPY by
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in fixed-bed columns under a broad range of
   conditions including: CNT incorporation method, solution pH, bed depth,
   adsorbent dosage, adsorbate initial concentration, and flow rate.
   Fixed-bed experiments showed that pH is a key factor that affects the
   adsorption capacity of antibiotics to CNTs. The Bed Depth Service Time
   model describes well the relationship between service time and bed depth
   and can be used to design appropriate column parameters. During
   fixed-bed regeneration, small amounts of SMX (3\%) and SPY (9\%) were
   irreversibly bonded to the CNT/sand porous media, thus reducing the
   column capacity for subsequent reuse from 67.9 to 50.4 mg g(-1) for SMX
   and from 91.9 to 72.9 mg g(-1) for SPY. The reduced column capacity
   resulted from the decrease in available adsorption sites and resulting
   repulsion (i.e., blocking) of incoming antibiotics from those previously
   adsorbed. Findings from this study demonstrate that fixed-bed columns
   packed with CNTs can be efficiently used and regenerated to remove
   antibiotics from water. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Methods based on laser ablation, such as Laser-Induced Breakdown
   Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Laser-Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma
   Mass/Optical Emission Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS/OES) are particularly
   suitable for urinary calculi bulk and micro analysis. Investigation of
   spatial distribution of matrix and trace elements can help to explain
   their emergence and growth. However, quantification is still very
   problematic and these methods are often used only for qualitative
   elemental mapping. There are no commercially available standards, which
   would correspond to the urinary calculi matrix. Internal standardization
   is also difficult, mainly due to different crystalline phases in one
   kidney stone.
   The aim of this study is to demonstrate the calibration capabilities and
   examine the limitations of laser ablation based techniques. Calibration
   pellets were prepared from powdered human urinary calculi with
   phosphate, oxalate and urate matrix. For this comparative study, the
   most frequently used laser-ablation based analytical techniques were
   chosen, such as LIBS and LA-ICP-MS. Moreover, some alternative
   techniques such as simultaneous LIBS-LA-ICP-OES and laser ablation

Abstract = {{The evolution of starting jet circulation, impulse and kinetic energy
   are derived in terms of kinematics at the entrance boundary of a
   semi-infinite axisymmetric domain. This analysis is not limited to the
   case of parallel jet flows; and the effect of non-zero radial velocity
   is specifically identified. The pressure distribution along the entrance
   boundary is also derived as it is required for kinetic energy modelling.
   This is done without reliance on an approximated potential function
   (i.e. translating flat plate), making it a powerful analytical tool for
   any axisymmetric jet flow. The pressure model indicates that a non-zero
   radial velocity is required for any `over-pressure' at the nozzle exit.
   Jet flows are created from multiple nozzle configurations to validate
   this model. The jet is illuminated in cross-section, and velocity and
   vorticity fields are determined using digital particle image velocimetry
   (DPIV) techniques and circulation, impulse and kinetic energy of the jet
   are calculated from the DPIV data. A non-zero radial velocity at the
   entrance boundary has a drastic effect on the final jet. Experimental
   data showed that a specific configuration resulting in a jet with a
   converging radial velocity, with a magnitude close to 40\% of the axial
   velocity at its maximum, attains a final circulation which is 90-100\%
   larger than a parallel starting jet with identical volume flux and
   nozzle diameter, depending on the stroke ratio. The converging jet also
   attains a final impulse which is 70-75\% larger than the equivalent
   parallel jet and a final kinetic energy 105-135\% larger.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel and cost-effective method for fabricating
   high-density multilayer metal-insulator-metal (MIM) integrated
   capacitors. To eliminate the usage of numerous photolithography steps
   when parallel stacking multiple capacitors layers, a unique process has
   been developed based on depositing the MIM layers onto a substrate with
   two protruding pillars, polishing down the pillars to expose the
   multilayer cross sections and then selectively etching the metal layers
   on each pillar to form the alternating capacitor plate electrodes. For
   demonstration purpose, only capacitors with two dielectric layers were
   fabricated, and the measurement results were verified by a compact
   analytical model together with finite element simulations. With 200 nm
   thick silicon nitride/oxide dielectric layers, a capacitance density of
   0.6 fF mu m(-2) was achieved, which can be easily increased by scaling
   down the layer thicknesses and/or stacking more layers. A low equivalent
   series resistance (ESR) of 300-700 m Omega was measured, and the
   self-resonance frequency was above measurement limits (> 100 MHz).
   Further design optimization shows that the ESR can be reduced to below
   80 m Omega, while the operation frequency extended to above 2.6 GHz.}},

Title = {{Multi-criteria decision analysis to select metrics for design and
   monitoring of sustainable ecosystem restorations}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{76-86}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The selection of metrics for ecosystem restoration programs is critical
   for improving the quality and utility of design and monitoring programs,
   informing adaptive management actions, and characterizing project
   success. The metrics selection process, that in practice is left to the
   subjective judgment of stakeholders, is often complex and should
   simultaneously take into account monitoring data, environmental models,
   socio-economic considerations, and stakeholder interests. With limited
   funding, it is often very difficult to balance the importance of
   multiple metrics, often competing, intended to measure different
   environmental, social, and economic aspects of the system. To help
   restoration planners and practitioners develop the most useful and
   informative design and monitoring programs, we propose the use of
   multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, broadly defined, to
   select optimal ecosystem restoration metric sets. In this paper, we
   apply and compare two MCDA methods, multi-attribute utility theory
   (MAUT), and probabilistic multi-criteria acceptability analysis
   (ProMAA), for a hypothetical river restoration case study involving
   multiple stakeholders with competing interests. Overall, the MCDA
   results in a systematic, quantitative, and transparent evaluation and
   comparison of potential metrics that provides planners and practitioners
   with a clear basis for selecting the optimal set of metrics to evaluate
   restoration alternatives and to inform restoration design and
   monitoring. In our case study, the two MCDA methods provide comparable
   results in terms of selected metrics. However, because ProMAA can
   consider probability distributions for weights and utility values of
   metrics for each criterion, it is most likely the best option for
   projects with highly uncertain data and significant stakeholder
   involvement. Despite the increase in complexity in the metrics selection
   process, MCDA improves upon the current, commonly-used ad-hoc decision
   practice based on consultations with stakeholders by applying and
   presenting quantitative aggregation of data and judgment, thereby
   increasing the effectiveness of environmental design and monitoring and
   the transparency of decision making in restoration projects. (C) 2012

Journal = {{INTEGRATION-THE VLSI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{131-141}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is not always feasible to implement an application specific custom
   hardware due to cost and time considerations. No instruction set
   compiler (NISC) architecture is one of the promising directions to
   design a custom datapath for each application using its execution
   characteristics. A major challenge with NISC control words is that they
   tend to be at least 4-5 times larger than regular instruction size,
   thereby imposing higher memory requirement. A possible solution to
   counter this is to compress these control words to reduce the code size
   of the application. This paper proposes an efficient bitmask-based
   compression technique to drastically reduce the control word size while
   keeping the decompression overhead in an acceptable range. The main
   contributions of our approach are (i) smart encoding of constant and
   less frequently changing bits, (ii) efficient do not care resolution for
   maximum bitmask coverage using limited dictionary entries, (iii) run
   length encoding to significantly reduce repetitive control words and
   (iv) design of an efficient decompression engine to reduce the
   performance penalty. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
   approach improves compression efficiency by an average of 20\% over the
   best known control word compression, giving a compression ratio of
   25-35\%. In addition, our technique only requires 1-3 on-chip RAMs, thus
   making it suitable for FPGA implementation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Coupling between visual alpha oscillations and default mode activity}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{112-118}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Although, on average, the magnitude of alpha oscillations (8 to 12 Hz)
   is decreased in task-relevant cortices during externally oriented
   attention, its fluctuations have significant consequences, with
   increased level of alpha associated with decreased level of visual
   processing and poorer behavioral performance. Functional MRI signals
   exhibit similar fluctuations. The default mode network (DMN) is on
   average deactivated in cognitive tasks requiring externally oriented
   attention. Momentarily insufficient deactivation of DMN, however, is
   often accompanied by decreased efficiency in stimulus processing,
   leading to attentional lapses. These observations appear to suggest that
   visual alpha power and DMN activity may be positively correlated. To
   what extent such correlation is preserved in the resting state is
   unclear. We addressed this problem by recording simultaneous EEG-fMRI
   from healthy human participants under two resting-state conditions:
   eyes-closed and eyes-open. Short-time visual alpha power was extracted
   as time series, which was then convolved with a canonical hemodynamic
   response function (HRF), and correlated with
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. It was found that visual
   alpha power was positively correlated with DMN BOLD activity only when
   the eyes were open; no such correlation existed when the eyes were
   closed. Functionally, this could be interpreted as indicating that (1)
   under the eyes-open condition, strong DMN activity is associated with
   reduced visual cortical excitability, which serves to block external
   visual input from interfering with introspective mental processing
   mediated by DMN, while weak DMN activity is associated with increased
   visual cortical excitability, which helps to facilitate stimulus
   processing, and (2) under the eyes-closed condition, the lack of
   external visual input renders such a gating mechanism unnecessary. (C)

Abstract = {{Knee osteoarthritis (OA) commonly occurs in the medial compartment of
   the knee and has been linked to overloading of the medial articular
   cartilage. Gait modification represents a non-invasive treatment
   strategy for reducing medial compartment knee force. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of gait
   modifications that were expected to alter medial contact force. A single
   subject implanted with a force-measuring knee replacement walked using
   nine modified gait patterns, four of which involved different hiking
   pole configurations. Medial and lateral contact force at 25, 50, and
   75\% of stance phase, and the average value over all of stance phase
   (0100\%), were determined for each gait pattern. Changes in medial and
   lateral contact force values relative to the subject's normal gait
   pattern were determined by a KruskalWallis test. Apart from early stance
   (25\% of stance), medial contact force was most effectively reduced by
   walking with long hiking poles and wide pole placement, which
   significantly reduced medial and lateral contact force during stance
   phase by up to 34\% (at 75\% of stance) and 26\% (at 50\% of stance),
   respectively. Although this study is based on data from a single
   subject, the results provide important insight into changes in medial
   and lateral contact forces through gait modification. The results of
   this study suggest that an optimal configuration of bilateral hiking
   poles may significantly reduce both medial and lateral compartment knee
   forces in individuals with medial knee osteoarthritis. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Tourists are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters such as
   hurricanes since they might be less informed and prepared than residents
   of disaster-prone areas. Thus, understanding how the traits of a
   tropical cyclone as well as specific characteristics of tourists
   influence affective and cognitive responses to a hurricane warning
   message is a critical component in disaster planning. Using scenarios
   that presented tropical cyclones with different relevant characteristics
   (such as category at landfall), tourists' knowledge, experience with
   hurricanes, trip traits, and the location of the survey (coastal or
   inland), this study contributes to the literature on sociological issues
   related to natural disasters. The findings suggest that risk perceptions
   and fear are influenced differently by the traits of the hurricanes and
   tourists' knowledge and experience. Risk is strongly influenced by the
   projected category of the hurricane at landfall, while fear is not as
   sensitive to this extremely relevant trait of cyclones. The results also
   suggest that the influence of risk and fear on evacuation likelihood is
   strong and positive. This study shows the value of studying cognitive
   and affective responses to uncertain events.}},

Title = {{The Hoodoo: A New Surface Structure for Enhanced Boiling Heat Transfer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The hoodoo is introduced as a beneficial surface structure for enhancing
   boiling heat transfer. A full parametric study was conducted to
   determine which attributes of the hoodoo structure promote boiling heat
   transfer enhancement. Hoodoo size and spacing were observed to have the
   most profound effect on boiling heat transfer, nucleation site
   activation, and critical heat flux (CHF). The CHF enhancement factor,
   defined as the ratio of CHF on the structured surface to that of a
   smooth surface, varies from 1.05 to 1.67 for FC-72 and hexane working
   fluids. Droplet spreading studies confirm the hemiwicking properties of
   the hoodoo surface, and it is postulated to be the primary mechanism for
   CHF enhancement. Measured wicking front speeds varied from 12 to 40 mm/s
   and were observed to obey a power-law dependence on time with an
   exponent of approximately 0.5. Plausible thermohydraulic mechanisms for
   CHF enhancement on the hoodoo surfaces are discussed.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) structures
   with Pd contacts were studied using noise spectroscopy. The high values
   of the mobility and low noise level are characteristic of high-quality
   CNT material. The detailed analysis of the transport and noise
   properties of the CNT structure with back gate topography allows us to
   study the transport determined by Schottky barriers and by pure CNT
   channel conductivity and to establish their separate contribution to the
   total conductivity of the structure. It was demonstrated that at small
   gate overdrive the main source of flicker noise is related to the
   Schottky barriers of the CNT-FETs. With increasing gate voltage, the
   magnitude of flicker noise decreases and at a certain gate voltage it is
   only determined by the transport properties of carbon nanotubes with a
   noise level lower by one order of magnitude. In contrast to previous
   studies where flicker noise determined the excess noise of CNT-based
   structures, we registered generation-recombination noise components in
   our structures and studied their behavior in a wide temperature range.
   This allowed us to investigate the origin of traps capturing the
   carriers, which considerably affects the noise and transport properties
   of CNT structures. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Both cholinergic and GABAergic projections from the rostral basal
   forebrain contribute to hippocampal function and mnemonic abilities.
   While dysfunction of cholinergic neurons has been heavily implicated in
   age-related memory decline, significantly less is known regarding how
   age-related changes in codistributed GABAergic projection neurons
   contribute to a decline in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning. In
   the current study, confocal stereology was used to quantify cholinergic
   (choline acetyltransferase {[}ChAT] immunopositive) neurons, GABAergic
   projection (glutamic decarboxylase 67 {[}GAD67] immunopositive) neurons,
   and total (neuronal nuclei {[}NeuN] immunopositive) neurons in the
   rostral basal forebrain of young and aged rats that were first
   characterized on a spatial learning task. ChAT immunopositive neurons
   were significantly but modestly reduced in aged rats. Although ChAT
   immunopositive neuron number was strongly correlated with spatial
   learning abilities among young rats, the reduction of ChAT
   immunopositive neurons was not associated with impaired spatial learning
   in aged rats. In contrast, the number of GAD67 immunopositive neurons
   was robustly and selectively elevated in aged rats that exhibited
   impaired spatial learning. Interestingly, the total number of rostral
   basal forebrain neurons was comparable in young and aged rats,
   regardless of their cognitive status. These data demonstrate
   differential effects of age on phenotypically distinct rostral basal
   forebrain projection neurons, and implicate dysregulated cholinergic and
   GABAergic septohippocampal circuitry in age-related mnemonic decline.

Abstract = {{Tin oxide (SnO2) is a promising candidate as an anode for lithium ion
   batteries because of its high theoretical capacity. However, poor
   capacity retention caused by large volume changes during cycling, large
   initial irreversible capacity, and low rate capability frustrate its
   practical application. We have developed a ternary nanocomposite based
   on tin indium oxide (SnO2-In2O3) and graphene nanosheet (GNS)
   synthesized via a facile solvothermal method. The incorporation of In2O3
   into SnO2 can improve the electrochemical property of SnO2 and reduce
   the charge transfer resistance of electrode leading to the enhanced
   reversible capacity and rate capability. The graphene nanosheet in the
   composite electrode can accommodate high volume expansion/contraction
   during cycling resulting in excellent capacity retention. As an anode
   for lithium ion batteries, the SnO2-In2O3/GNS nanocomposite exhibits a
   remarkably improved electrochemical performance in terms of lithium
   storage capacity (962 mAh g(-1) at 60 mA g(-1) rate), initial coulombic
   efficiency (57.2\%), cycling stability (60.8\% capacity retention after
   50 cycles), and rate capability (393.25 mAh g(-1) at 600 mA g(-1) rate

Abstract = {{This work presents a physics based circuit model for calculating the
   total energy dissipated into neutral species for nanosecond pulsed
   direct current (DC) dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas. Based on
   experimental observations, it is assumed that the nanosecond pulsed
   DBD's which have been proposed for aerodynamic flow control can be
   approximated by two independent regions of homogeneous electric field.
   An equivalent circuit model is developed for both homogeneous regions
   based on a combination of a resistor, capacitors, and a zener diode.
   Instead of fitting the resistance to an experimental data set, a formula
   is established for approximating the resistance by modeling plasmas as a
   conductor with DC voltage applied to it. Various assumptions are then
   applied to the governing Boltzmann equation to approximate electrical
   conductivity values for weakly ionized plasmas. The developed model is
   then validated with experimental data of the total power dissipated by
   plasmas. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and static contact angle
   measurements were used to study the interaction between silane coupling
   agents and cured cement paste. Three different silane coupling agents
   were investigated: aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APTES),
   3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxy silane (GPTMS), and methoxy-terminated
   polydimethxyl siloxane (PDMS). These silanes have different end groups,
   so the change in surface energy after undergoing a successful reaction
   between the silane and hydroxyls on the surface of the cement paste was
   demonstrated by a change in contact angle. Relative to untreated
   samples, APTES samples decreased the contact angle, PDMS samples
   increased the contact angle, and GPTMS did not show a significant change
   in contact angle. Samples with a water-to-cement ratio (w/c) of 0.5
   showed a larger change in contact angle than 0.4 w/c ratio samples,
   because of a greater number of hydroxyl groups at the surface.
   Deconvolution of the O 1s and Si 2p XPS peaks were performed to
   determine contributions from bridging and nonbridging atoms. An increase
   in bridging silicon and oxygen atoms relative to untreated samples
   indicated successful silane condensation and that a covalent bond was
   formed between the cement paste and silanes.}},

   of amorphous carbon nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are a class of materials that have seen increasing use as
   friction and wear reducers in tribological applications. Amorphous
   carbon (a-C) films have been the subject of significant scientific and
   industrial interest for use as solid-state lubricants. Here, we present
   classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical
   and tribological responses of a-C nanoparticles that are subjected to
   external forces between hydrogen-terminated diamond surfaces. Over the
   range of a-C nanoparticle diameters (2-5 nm) and hydrogenation
   (0\%-50\%) considered, the simulations predict a consistent mechanical
   response where each nanoparticle is highly elastic. The simulations
   predict that the transition from elastic to plastic response is directly
   related to an increase in the percentage of carbon-carbon crosslinking
   within the individual nanoparticles. Contrarily, the simulations also
   predict that the tribological response is noticeably impacted by changes
   in diameter and hydrogenation. This is because during friction, hydrogen
   passivates the unsaturated carbon atoms near the nanoparticle's surface,
   which prevents interfacial bond formation and allows the nanoparticle to
   roll within the interface. From these findings, it is demonstrated that
   a-C nanoparticles are able to provide good tribological performance only
   when sufficient chemical passivation of the nanoparticles is maintained.

Abstract = {{We present a study through extensive simulation that considers the
   impact of inhomogeneous optical scattering coefficient distribution on
   recovery of optical absorption coefficient maps using tomographic
   photoacoustic data collected from media mimicking breast tissue. We
   found that while the impact of scattering heterogeneities/targets is
   modest on photoacoustic recovery of optical absorption coefficients, the
   impact of scattering contrast caused by adipose tissue, a layer of
   normal tissue along the boundary of the breast, is dramatic on
   reconstruction of optical absorption coefficients using photoacoustic
   data-up to 25.8\% relative error in recovering the absorption
   coefficient is estimated in such cases. To overcome this problem, we
   propose a new method to enhance photoacoustic recovery of the optical
   absorption coefficient in heterogeneous media by considering
   inhomogeneous scattering coefficient distribution provided by diffuse
   optical tomography (DOT). Results from extensive simulations show that
   photoacoustic recovery of absorption coefficient maps can be improved
   considerably with a priori scattering information from DOT.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Permutation entropy (PE) has been recently suggested as a novel measure
   to characterize the complexity of nonlinear time series. In this paper,
   we propose a simple method to address some of PE's limitations, mainly
   its inability to differentiate between distinct patterns of a certain
   motif and the sensitivity of patterns close to the noise floor. The
   method relies on the fact that patterns may be too disparate in
   amplitudes and variances and proceeds by assigning weights for each
   extracted vector when computing the relative frequencies associated with
   every motif. Simulations were conducted over synthetic and real data for
   a weighting scheme inspired by the variance of each pattern. Results
   show better robustness and stability in the presence of higher levels of
   noise, in addition to a distinctive ability to extract complexity
   information from data with spiky features or having abrupt changes in
   magnitude. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.022911}},

Abstract = {{Isopolar arrays of aligned cytoskeletal filaments are components in a
   number of designs of hybrid nanodevices incorporating biomolecular
   motors. For example, a combination of filament arrays and motor arrays
   can form an actuator or a molecular engine resembling an artificial
   muscle. Here, isopolar arrays of microtubules are fabricated by flow
   alignment, and their quality is characterized by their degree of
   alignment. We find, in agreement with our analytical models, that the
   degree of alignment is ultimately limited by thermal forces, while the
   kinetics of the alignment process are influenced by the flow strength,
   the microtubule stiffness, the gliding velocity, and the tip length.
   Strong flows remove microtubules from the surface and reduce the
   filament density, suggesting that there is an optimal flow strength for
   the fabrication of ordered arrays.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents numerical studies of hydrogen production performance
   via water gas shift reaction in membrane reactor. The pre-exponential
   factor in describing the hydrogen permeation flux is used as the main
   parameter to account for the membrane permeance variation. The operating
   pressure, temperature and H2O/CO molar ratio are chosen in the 1-20 atm,
   400-600 degrees C and 1-3 ranges, respectively. Based on the numerical
   simulation results three distinct CO conversion regimes exist based on
   the pre-exponential factor value. For low pre-exponential factors
   corresponding to low membrane permeance, the CO conversion approaches to
   that obtained from a conventional reactor without hydrogen removal. For
   high pre-exponential factor, high CO conversion and H-2 recovery with
   constant values can be obtained. For intermediate pre-exponential factor
   range both CO conversion and H-2 recovery vary linearly with the
   pre-exponential factor. In the high membrane permeation case CO
   conversion and H-2 recovery approach limiting values as the operating
   pressure increases. Increasing the H2O/CO molar ratio results in an
   increase in CO conversion but decrease in H-2 recovery due to hydrogen
   permeation driving force reduction. As the feed rate increases in the
   reaction side both the CO conversion and hydrogen recovery decrease
   because of decreased reactant residence time. The sweep gas flow rate
   has a significant effect on hydrogen recovery. Low sweep gas flow rate
   results in low CO conversion H-2 recovery while limiting CO conversion
   and hydrogen recovery can be reached for the high membrane permeance and
   high sweep gas flow rate cases. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{The emission factors and compositions of volatile organic compounds
   (VOC) in exhaust gas from in-use gasoline passenger cars were
   characterized using a chassis dynamometer. Three passenger cars were
   tested at the ECE and the EUDC drive cycles to represent both urban and
   suburban driving scenarios. Exhaust gas was collected in Summa canisters
   and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Common
   gaseous emissions (CH4, NOx, CO, and CO2) were measured by an on-board
   monitoring system. The VOC emission factors of different cars ranged
   from 0.10 to 0.25 g km(-1) at the ECE cycle, and 0.01-0.02 g km(-1) at
   the EUDC cycle. A total of 57 individual VOC were detected in the
   exhaust gas, and the weight percentages were very consistent among the
   three cars. Ethylene (11.80 wt.\%), toluene (1127 wt.\%), and benzene
   (8.83 wt.\%) were the most abundant VOC in exhaust gas. Aromatics
   (38.32\%) dominated the low speed conditions (ECE), while alkanes
   (37.34\%) were the major compounds at the high speed condition (EUDC).
   The total amount of alkenes did not change much between those two
   cycles, while ethylene is abundant in the ECE and EUDC cycles. Ozone
   formation potential (OFP) was calculated to estimate the ozone yield
   from VOC emissions by gasoline cars and the results showed that OFP of
   VOC emission at the ECE cycle was about ten times higher than that at
   the EUDC cycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological studies require sensitive tools to directly quantify
   transport kinetics in the cell/tissue spatial domain under physiological
   conditions. Although biosensors are capable of measuring concentration,
   their applications in physiological studies are limited due to the
   relatively low sensitivity, excessive drift/noise, and inability to
   quantify analyte transport. Nanomaterials significantly improve the
   electrochemical transduction of microelectrodes, and make the
   construction of highly sensitive microbiosensors possible. Furthermore,
   a novel biosensor modality, self-referencing (SR), enables direct
   measurement of real-time flux and drift/noise subtraction. SR
   microbiosensors based on nanomaterials have been used to measure the
   real-time analyte transport in several cell/tissue studies coupled with
   various stimulators/inhibitors. These studies include: glucose uptake in
   pancreatic beta cells, cancer cells, muscle tissues, intestinal tissues
   and P. Aeruginosa biofilms; glutamate flux near neuronal cells; and
   endogenous indole-3-acetic acid flux near the surface of Zea mays roots.
   Results from the SR studies provide important insights into cancer,
   diabetes, nutrition, neurophysiology, environmental and plant physiology
   studies under dynamic physiological conditions, demonstrating that the
   SR microbiosensors are an extremely valuable tool for physiology
   research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the electrical conductivity of LiFePO4 (LFP)
   cathode, ZnO/Carbon was incorporated in the cathode by wet vibratory
   ball milling ZnO, Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and LFP particles together.
   Herein, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used as both dispersant during
   ball milling and carbon source after calcination process. The uniformly
   dispersed carbon and ZnO on the surface of LFP led to a good electronic
   contact between the LFP grains. The charge/discharge rate in the range
   of C/10 to 10C and cycle performance at C/10 for 50 cycles was tested at
   room temperature. The LFP/ZnO/Carbon composite cathode showed a high
   capacity of 158.9 mAhg(-1), displayed excellent high rate and cyclic
   performance due to high amounts of graphitic carbon transformed by ZnO
   used as a catalyst during calcination process. The decrease in capacity
   was within 31\% at a discharge rate of 10C and less than 3\% after 50
   cycles at C/10 rate. The LFP/ZnO/Carbon composite was characterized
   using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high
   resolution Transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Micro-Raman, and specific surface
   area. Electrochemical properties were measured using electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiostatic intermittent titration
   technique (PITT) and galvanostatic measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Adaptation of Endothelial Cells to Physiologically-Modeled, Variable
   Shear Stress}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Endothelial cell (EC) function is mediated by variable hemodynamic shear
   stress patterns at the vascular wall, where complex shear stress
   profiles directly correlate with blood flow conditions that vary
   temporally based on metabolic demand. The interactions of these more
   complex and variable shear fields with EC have not been represented in
   hemodynamic flow models. We hypothesized that EC exposed to pulsatile
   shear stress that changes in magnitude and duration, modeled directly
   from real-time physiological variations in heart rate, would elicit
   phenotypic changes as relevant to their critical roles in thrombosis,
   hemostasis, and inflammation. Here we designed a physiological flow (PF)
   model based on short-term temporal changes in blood flow observed in
   vivo and compared it to static culture and steady flow (SF) at a fixed
   pulse frequency of 1.3 Hz. Results show significant changes in gene
   regulation as a function of temporally variable flow, indicating a
   reduced wound phenotype more representative of quiescence. EC cultured
   under PF exhibited significantly higher endothelial nitric oxide
   synthase (eNOS) activity (PF: 176.0 +/- 11.9 nmol/10(5) EC; SF: 115.0
   +/- 12.5 nmol/10(5) EC, p = 0.002) and lower TNF-a-induced HL-60
   leukocyte adhesion (PF: 37 +/- 6 HL-60 cells/mm(2); SF: 111 +/- 18
   HL-60/mm(2), p = 0.003) than cells cultured under SF which is consistent
   with a more quiescent anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic phenotype.
   In vitro models have become increasingly adept at mimicking natural
   physiology and in doing so have clarified the importance of both
   chemical and physical cues that drive cell function. These data
   illustrate that the variability in metabolic demand and subsequent
   changes in perfusion resulting in constantly variable shear stress plays
   a key role in EC function that has not previously been described.}},

   to handle millions of sequences generated in current studies.
   Furthermore, existing binning methods usually require a priori decisions
   regarding binning parameters such as a distance level for defining an
   OTU.
   Results: We present a novel modularity-based approach (M-pick) to
   address the aforementioned problems. The new method utilizes ideas from
   community detection in graphs, where sequences are viewed as vertices on
   a weighted graph, each pair of sequences is connected by an imaginary
   edge, and the similarity of a pair of sequences represents the weight of
   the edge. M-pick first generates a graph based on pairwise sequence
   distances and then applies a modularity-based community detection
   technique on the graph to generate OTUs to capture the community
   structures in sequence data. To compare the performance of M-pick with
   that of existing methods, specifically CROP and ESPRIT-Tree, sequence
   data from different hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA were used and
   binning results were compared.
   Conclusions: A new modularity-based clustering method for OTU picking of
   16S rRNA sequences is developed in this study. The algorithm does not
   require a predetermined cut-off level, and our simulation studies
   suggest that it is superior to existing methods that require specified
   distance levels to define OTUs. The source code is available at

Abstract = {{High temperature proton conductors (HTPCs) find their applications in
   steam electrolysis, gas sensing, and most importantly, fuel cells. In
   this work, proton conductivities and transport properties of doped
   BaSnO3 are investigated. Samples of BaSn0.9D0.1O2.95 (D = In, Lu, Er, Y,
   and Gd) were prepared by solid-state reaction and relative densities
   >93\% were achieved after sintering at 1600 degrees C or lower. Although
   Y doping is commonly known to yield the highest conductivities for
   BaCeO3 and BaZrO3, In-doped BaSnO3 exhibits the highest conductivity and
   conductivities decrease in the order In > Lu > Er > Y > Gd. Ionic radius
   and electronegativity matching between dopants and host Sn4+ is shown to
   be an important doping strategy for enhancing conductivities of BaSnO3.
   Measurements of HID isotope effect and electromotive force (EMF) were
   performed on BaSnO3 to give direct evidence for proton conduction and to
   examine transport properties. The ratio between conductivities in H- and
   D-atmosphere (sigma(N)/sigma(D)) is 2.62 in reducing conditions,
   indicating protons transfer via the Grotthus mechanism. Proton transport
   numbers reached above 0.75 at 450 degrees C, and n- and p-type
   electronic conduction is identified to be secondary in reducing and
   oxidizing atmospheres, respectively. Electronic contribution to
   conductivity is found to increase with temperatures. Conductivities of
   BaSnO3 are seen to be comparable to Y-doped BaZrO3 (e.g., grain
   conductivities for both Y-doped BaSnO3 and BaZrO3 are similar to 1.5 x
   10(-4) S cm(-1) at 350 degrees C), and are much higher than other common
   HTPCs, such as LaPO4 and LaNbO4. The high conductivity and good
   sinterability make BaSnO3 a promising HTPC. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Whole sugar beets without the tops and without size reduction were
   anaerobically digested in a batch, two-stage, thermophilic, pilot-scale
   digestion system. The two-stage system consisted of a solids digester
   (SD; 150 L working volume) into which the sugar beets were loaded and an
   anaerobic filter (AF; 600 L working volume).
   The methane yield from the system was 305 L at STP/kg volatile solids
   (VS) loaded and was obtained within 17 days. This is equivalent to 52 L
   of methane at STP/kg sugar beet as received from the stockpiles. 60\% of
   the methane was formed in the AF and the rest in the SD. The methane
   yield from this pilot system was 80\% of that obtained in laboratory
   scale trials. 90\% of the total methane produced in the AF was collected
   within 10 days. A 10 day residence time would yield a total of 256 L at
   STP/kg VS or 84\% of total yield from pilot scale system. The digester
   required addition of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. The biogas may
   not require hydrogen sulfide clean up before utilization.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for power sources for electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid
   electric vehicles (HEV) with high-specific energy has brought immense
   interest in LiFePO4 (LFP) as a cathode for lithium ion batteries.
   However, intrinsically poor conductivity of LFP has hindered the
   realization of its high theoretical capacity (170 mAh g(-1)). In order
   to improve the electric conductivity of LFP cathode, Cu flakes with very
   high surface area was incorporated in the cathode by ball milling Cu
   flakes. Uniformly dispersed Cu flakes subsequently transformed to CuO
   during the calcination process. The Cu incorporated LFP composite
   cathode showed a high capacity of 161 mAh g(-1), displayed excellent
   high rate and cyclic performance. The capacity loss was less than 15\%
   at a discharge rate of 2C and less than 1\% after 50 cycles at C/10
   rate. The cathode composite was characterized using X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), Micro-Raman, and specific surface area.
   Electrochemical properties were measured using electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), potentiostatic intermittent titration technique
   (PITT) and galvanostatic measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Update on Grand Challenge Competition to Predict in Vivo Knee Loads}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Validation is critical if clinicians are to use musculoskeletal models
   to optimize treatment of individual patients with a variety of
   musculoskeletal disorders. This paper provides an update on the annual
   Grand Challenge Competition to Predict in Vivo Knee Loads, a unique
   opportunity for direct validation of knee contact forces and indirect
   validation of knee muscle forces predicted by musculoskeletal models.
   Three competitions (2010, 2011, and 2012) have been held at the annual
   American Society of Mechanical Engineers Summer Bioengineering
   Conference, and two more competitions are planned for the 2013 and 2014
   conferences. Each year of the competition, a comprehensive data set
   collected from a single subject implanted with a force-measuring knee
   replacement is released. Competitors predict medial and lateral knee
   contact forces for two gait trials without knowledge of the experimental
   knee contact force measurements. Predictions are evaluated by
   calculating root-mean-square (RMS) errors and R-2 values relative to the
   experimentally measured medial and lateral contact forces. For the first
   three years of the competition, competitors used a variety of methods to
   predict knee contact and muscle forces, including static and dynamic
   optimization, EMG-driven models, and parametric numerical models.
   Overall, errors in predicted contact forces were comparable across
   years, with average RMS errors for the four competition winners ranging
   from 229 N to 312 N for medial contact force and from 238 N to 326 N for
   lateral contact force. Competitors generally predicted variations in
   medial contact force (highest R-2 = 0.91) better than variations in
   lateral contact force (highest R-2 = 0.70). Thus, significant room for
   improvement exists in the remaining two competitions. The entire
   musculoskeletal modeling community is encouraged to use the competition
   data and models for their own model validation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Sugar beet tailings were anaerobically digested at non-agitated and
   agitated conditions in identical thermophilic batch reactors. The
   average methane yield in the agitated digester was only 74\% of that in
   the non-agitated digester. Ninety percent of the ultimate methane yield
   was produced in approximately 5 days in the non-agitated digester
   whereas it took 12 days in agitated digester. Even upon using an active
   inoculum from non-agitated digester the methane rate and yield was low
   in the agitated digester. On the other hand when the poorly performing
   inoculum from the agitated digester was transferred to the non-agitated
   digester, its activity was immediately enhanced. The non-agitated
   digester harbored a diverse microbial community with phylotypes
   Methanoculleus and Methanosarcina being dominant methanogens.
   Methanosaeta was the only methanogen detected in the agitated digester.
   It also contained a hydrogen-producing bacterial phylotype Petrotoga in
   high proportion which was not detected in the other digester. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{While brain imaging and electrophysiology play a central role in
   neuroscience research and in the evaluation of neurological disorders, a
   single noninvasive modality that offers both high spatial and temporal
   resolution is currently not available. Here we show in an acute epilepsy
   rat model that photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can noninvasively track
   seizure brain dynamics with both high spatial and temporal resolution,
   and at a depth that is clinically relevant. The noninvasive yet whole
   surface and depth capabilities of the PAT system allowed us to actually
   see what is happening during ictogenesis in terms of seizure onset and
   spread. Both seizure onset and propagation were tomographically detected
   at a spatial resolution of 150 pm and a temporal resolution of 300 ms,
   respectively. The current study lends support to the theory that seizure
   onset and spread involves a rich interplay between multiple cortical and
   subcortical brain areas during the onset and spread of epileptic
   seizures. Dynamical changes of vasculature during epileptiform events
   were also detected with high spatiotemporal resolution. Together, these
   findings suggest that PAT represents a powerful tool for noninvasively
   mapping seizure onset and propagation patterns, and the `functional'
   connectivity within epileptic brain networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We discuss recent advances in the microscopic simulations of thermal
   conductivity through the prism of comparisons with experimental
   measurements. By dissecting the thermal conductivity into its
   constituent properties, heat capacity, phonon structure and anharmonic
   phonon properties, we show that the reliable prediction of the thermal
   transport properties over a range of conditions requires each to be
   described correctly. However, it is sometimes possible to obtain thermal
   conductivity values in overall good agreement with experiment through a
   cancellation of errors in the constituent properties. Major advances in
   the prediction of thermal transport properties in the last few years
   have come through increases in computational power and through
   development of numerical algorithms for the essentially exact solution
   of the linearized Boltzmann Transport Equation, with interatomic
   interactions described by first-principles electronic-structure
   calculations. This approach enables consistent ab initio determination
   of the thermal conductivity in the pure crystals. We also discuss the
   effects of various defects on thermal conductivity and compare results
   from the atomistic simulations, classical theories from the 1950s, and
   experimental measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Observations of suspended sediment stratification from acoustic
   backscatter in muddy environments}},
Journal = {{MARINE GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{336}},
Pages = {{24-32}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration estimated from
   acoustic backscatter are used to re-examine the relation between
   sediment stratification and floc size in a cohesive sedimentary
   environment. Concentration measurements by optical backscatter sensors
   at two vertical levels are used to calibrate the acoustic backscatter
   intensity. In spite of the complexities due to the rapidly changing flow
   and cohesive sediment properties, the estimates of sediment
   concentration reproduce well the observations. Together with the
   vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration, measured current
   profiles are used to calibrate a one-dimensional-vertical (1DV) boundary
   layer numerical model for combined wave-current flow on muddy beds. The
   numerical simulations are used to investigate the effect of the floc
   size on the vertical structure of the suspended sediment concentration
   profile. For similar flow conditions, smaller flocs result in more mixed
   profiles with higher concentration in the upper water column and lower
   near-bed concentration. This is the first time this effect is seen in
   direct field observations, and confirms previously published numerical
   results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a three-step method for estimating time-resolved velocity
   fields using time-resolved point measurements and non-time-resolved
   particle image velocimetry data. A variant of linear stochastic
   estimation is used to obtain an initial set of time-resolved estimates
   of the flow field. These estimates are then used to identify a linear
   model of the flow dynamics. The model is incorporated into a Kalman
   smoother, which provides an improved set of estimates. We verify this
   method with an experimental study of the wake behind an
   elliptical-leading-edge flat plate at a thickness Reynolds number of
   3,600. We find that, for this particular flow, the Kalman smoother
   estimates are more accurate and more robust to noise than the initial,
   stochastic estimates. Consequently, dynamic mode decomposition more
   accurately identifies coherent structures in the flow when applied to
   the Kalman smoother estimates. Causal implementations of the estimators,
   which are necessary for flow control, are also investigated. Similar
   outcomes are observed, with model-based estimation outperforming
   stochastic estimation, though the advantages are less pronounced.}},

Abstract = {{In the aftermath of the recent terrorist attacks, there has been an
   increasing need for automated, high-speed detection technologies that
   can detect trace amounts of explosives without human intervention. Our
   group at the University of Florida has developed differential reflection
   spectroscopy which can detect explosive residue on surfaces such as
   parcel, cargo and luggage. In this differential reflection device,
   explosives show spectral fingerprints at specific wavelengths, for
   example, the spectrum of 2,4,6, trinitrotoluene shows an absorption edge
   at 420 nm. Additionally, we have developed a support vector machine
   based computer software to classify the explosives and non-explosive
   materials. In this study we will (i) describe this system and give an
   insight into the operation of our prototype, (ii) demonstrate our
   software for the detection of the spectral finger-prints, and (iii)
   discuss the normalization of the data which significantly increases
   classification rates and decreases the number of parameters. DOT:

Title = {{The mixing of cohesive granular materials featuring a large size range
   in the absence of gravity}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{235}},
Pages = {{18-26}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We have studied the shear mixing of bidisperse collections of cohesive
   particles in an effort to develop models that would allow one to predict
   and control the homogeneity of particle composites. Our focus has been
   on the effects of interparticle cohesion and shear rate on the
   microstructure of particle composites. Furthermore, we have focused on
   particles that have a ``large size range,{''} specifically a 7:1
   diameter ratio, such that homogeneous mixtures would include the small
   particles filling in the gaps formed between big particles, resulting in
   a correlation between the packing fraction and mixing quality. As a
   model problem, the cohesion resulting from the van der Waals force
   acting between particles was considered. Simulations were performed in
   which initially segregated bidisperse collections of particles were
   subjected to plane shear under constant applied stress as a method of
   mixing. Gravity was ignored in these simulations so that the different
   particles were not driven to different sides of the mixtures and the
   only hindrance to homogeneous mixing was cohesion. Simulations were
   performed with a variety of shear rates and particle cohesion strengths
   for both the large and small particles, and the homogeneity of the
   resultant mixtures was quantified using two distinct statistics: the
   estimated mean size of small-particle clusters and the spatial variance
   in the relative concentrations of the small and large particles.
   Microstructure images of the mixtures were used to provide additional
   qualitative measure of homogeneity as well as a measure of the relevance
   of the order statistics. These data suggested that the cohesiveness
   (Hamaker constant) of the small particles had the strongest influence on
   the mixture's homogeneity. When the small particles were not
   sufficiently cohesive, they did not significantly agglomerate, and so
   the resulting mixtures were relatively homogeneous over the range of
   shear rates and Hamaker constants of the big particles explored here.
   When the small particles were more cohesive, the small particles formed
   strong agglomerates and the mixtures become significantly inhomogeneous
   at lower shear rates. Somewhat surprisingly in these cases, better
   mixing was not achieved by simply making the large particles less
   cohesive. Rather, reducing the cohesiveness of the large particles far
   enough caused the large particles to pack more tightly, making the
   small-particle agglomerates unable to fit in between them, ultimately
   resulting in worse mixing. As such, the best mixing in these cases was
   achieved when the big particles were moderately cohesive. A correlation
   between solid volume fraction and homogeneity was not observed when
   particle cohesion was varied, as making either the small or large
   particles more cohesive led to a decrease in solid volume fraction,
   regardless of the effect on homogeneity. On the other hand, when
   homogeneity was found to increase with shear rate, so did the solid
   volume fraction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A magnetic biochar based adsorbent with colloidal or nanosized

   biochar matrix. Biochar/gamma-Fe2O3 composite exhibited excellent
   ferromagnetic property with a saturation magnetization of 69.2 emu/g.
   Batch sorption experimental results showed that the composite has strong
   sorption ability to aqueous arsenic. Because of its excellent

Abstract = {{Two equations quantifying vapor-liquid equilibrium properties of
   ammonia-water mixtures are presented. Alternative polynomial
   correlations in the literature show thermodynamically inconsistent
   oscillatory behavior at high ammonia concentrations, and violate energy
   constraints because the bubble and dew lines cross and also fail to meet
   at pure components. This undesirable behavior can cause iterative models
   to diverge. A curve-fitting procedure that forces the bubble and dew
   lines to meet at pure-component compositions is developed and numerical
   techniques are employed to reduce the oscillatory behavior close to the
   pure-substance values. In addition, an improved data set selection is
   chosen by reviewing and incorporating recent literature reports. The
   equations presented are an improvement over prior polynomial expressions
   for vapor-liquid properties of the ammonia-water mixture, and are meant
   for industrial calculations in absorption refrigeration systems for
   pressures between 0.05 and 2 MPa (7.25 and 290 psia).}},

Abstract = {{The Howland current pump is a popular bioelectrical circuit, useful for
   delivering precise electrical currents. In applications requiring high
   precision delivery of alternating current to biological loads, the
   output impedance of the Howland is a critical figure of merit that
   limits the precision of the delivered current when the load changes. We
   explain the minimum operational amplifier requirements to meet a target
   precision over a wide bandwidth. We also discuss effective compensation
   strategies for achieving stability without sacrificing high frequency
   output impedance. A current source suitable for Electrical Impedance
   Tomography (EIT) was simulated using a SPICE model, and built to verify
   stable operation. This current source design had stable output impedance
   of 3.3M Omega up to 200 kHz, which provides 80 dB precision for our EIT
   application. We conclude by noting the difficulty in measuring the
   output impedance, and advise verifying the plausibility of measurements
   against theoretical limitations.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the discrete lattice effect of various forcing methods in
   the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to include the body force obtained
   from the immersed boundary method (IBM). In the immersed boundary
   lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM), the LBM needs a forcing method to
   involve the body force on a forcing point near the immersed boundary
   that is calculated by IBM. The proper forcing method in LBM is derived
   to include the body force, which appears to resolve problems such as
   multiphase flow, non-ideal gas behavior, etc. Many researchers have
   adopted different forcing methods in LBM to involve the body force from
   IBM, even when they solved similar problems. However, it is necessary to
   evaluate the discrete lattice effect, which originates from different
   forcing methods in LBM, to include the effect of the body force from IBM
   on the results. Consequently, in this study, a rigorous analysis of the
   discrete lattice effect for different forcing methods in IB-LBM is
   performed by solving various problems.}},

Abstract = {{Uranium dioxide (UO2)-10 vol\% silicon carbide (SiC) composite fuel
   pellets were produced by oxidative sintering and Spark Plasma Sintering
   (SPS) at a range of temperatures from 1400 to 1600 degrees C. Both SiC
   whiskers and SiC powder particles were utilized. Oxidative sintering was
   employed over 4 h and the SPS sintering was employed only for 5 min at
   the highest hold temperature. It was noted that composite pellets
   sintered by SPS process revealed smaller grain size, reduced formation
   of chemical products, higher density, and enhanced interfacial contact
   compared to the pellets made by oxidative sintering. For given volume of
   SiC, the pellets with powder particles yielded a smaller grain size than
   pellets with SiC whiskers. Finally thermal conductivity measurements at
   100 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 900 degrees C revealed that SPS
   sintered UO2-SiC composites exhibited an increase of up to 62\% in
   thermal conductivity compared to UO2 pellets, while the oxidative
   sintered composite pellets revealed significantly inferior thermal
   conductivity values. The current study points to the improved processing
   capabilities of SPS compared to oxidative sintering of UO2-SiC

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores the role of a key dimensionless design parameter,
   denoted `coupling strength', that governs the power generation
   performance of electrodynamic (electromagnetic) vibrational energy
   harvesters. The importance of coupling strength-and not just the
   electrodynamic transduction coefficient-on the output power and
   efficiency of the vibration energy harvesting device is presented
   analytically using a standard electromechanical model and validated
   using experimental results. It is shown that, up to a certain point,
   increasing the coupling strength of the harvester substantially
   increases the output power, resulting in improved electrodynamic
   coupling effectiveness and device efficiency. An electrodynamic
   harvester is designed such that the coupling strength can be varied
   through manual adjustments without altering the input vibration
   characteristics. Experimentally, the harvester is tested at a constant
   input acceleration amplitude of 0.74 m s(-2) at the device natural
   frequency of 28.1 Hz. By increasing the coupling strength of the device
   from 2.6 to 49.2, the output power increased from 0.64 to 1.06 mW. The
   corresponding electrodynamic coupling effectiveness increased from 0.53
   to 0.92, and the mechanical-to-electrical device efficiency increased
   from 21\% to 45.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the incoming pollution load from contributing watersheds
   is a basic requirement to assess the functioning of storm water
   treatment systems. These systems are often built with assumed design
   performances, but their pollution loads and functioning are seldom
   checked, making their efficacy questionable. This paper presents a case
   study of a storm water system built in a 40-ha residential catchment in
   Gainesville, Florida. Despite its promising performance and assumed low
   pollution load, a receiving wetland basin overfilled with sediments, and
   a polishing pond was overgrown with algae. It was hypothesized that the
   system was not functioning as designed as a response to high sediment
   loads and poor treatment performance; hence, an investigation was
   carried out to quantify the suspended sediments through the storm water
   system during runoff events. Ten events were collected and analyzed for
   suspended sediment concentration (SSC), sediment mass load, and first
   flush intensity. In addition, total phosphorus (TP) associated with
   different particle fractions was analyzed. Results from this study
   showed that SSC event mean concentration (EMC) was 23.7-194.6 mg/L in
   untreated runoff, 8.8-65.1 mg/L after a hydrodynamic separator (HDS),
   and 4.6-107.5 mg/L in the receiving water. A large first flush intensity
   was found in most events, with 43-86\% of the total mass of particulate
   matter (PM) coming during the first 20\% of the storm water volume.
   Total phosphorus concentration in runoff was typical of similar land
   uses in Florida, ranging from 0.162 to 0.834 mg/L. Event mean
   concentration and load of PM were not significantly greater than
   estimates for similar catchments, but the HDS removal efficiency
   (46-88\%) was considerably lower than the design estimates. These
   findings support the need for proper monitoring and maintenance of storm
   water treatment units despite their pollution loading intensity. DOI:

Abstract = {{Tornadoes represent a unique natural hazard because of the very low
   probability of occurrence, short warning times (on the order of only a
   few minutes), and the intense and destructive forces imposed on
   engineered and nonengineered buildings. The very low-probability/very
   high-consequence nature of a tornado strike makes designing for survival
   and reducing damage under typical financial constraints a substantial
   challenge. On April 27, 2011, an enhanced Fujita (EF) 4 (EF4) tornado
   devastated an almost 10-km (5.9-mi) long, 0.8-km-wide (1/2-mi-wide)
   path, through the city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and continued on the
   ground for 130 km (80 mi). This paper presents the design concept that
   resulted following a week-long data reconnaissance deployment throughout
   the city of Tuscaloosa by the authors. The dual-objective philosophy
   proposed herein is intended to focus on both building damage and loss
   reduction in low-to-moderate tornado wind speeds and building occupant
   life safety in more damaging wind-speed events such as EF4 and EF5
   tornadoes. The philosophy articulates a design methodology that is the
   basis upon which structural engineering was formed-namely, provide life
   safety and control damage-but the new philosophy is focused at separate
   tornado intensity levels. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000622. (C)

Abstract = {{Global water shortages caused by rapidly expanding population,
   escalating water consumption, and dwindling water reserves have rendered
   water reuse a strategically significant approach to meet current and
   future water demand. This study is the first to our knowledge to
   evaluate the technical feasibility of iron-mediated aeration (IMA), an
   innovative, potentially economical, holistic, oxidizing co-precipitation
   process operating at room temperature, atmospheric pressure, and neutral
   pH, for water reuse. In the IMA process, dissolved oxygen (O-2) was
   continuously activated by zero-valent iron (Fe-0) to produce reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) at ambient pH, temperature, and pressure.
   Concurrently, iron sludge was generated as a result of iron corrosion.
   Bench-scale tests were conducted to study the performance of IMA for
   treatment of secondary effluent, natural surface water, and simulated
   contaminated water. The following removal efficiencies were achieved:
   82.2\% glyoxylic acid, similar to 100\% formaldehyde as an oxidation
   product of glyoxylic acid, 94\% of Ca2+ and associated alkalinity, 44\%
   of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 26\% of electrical conductivity (EC),
   98\% of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), 80\% of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 45\%
   of total nitrogen (TN), 96\% of total phosphorus (TP), 99.8\% of total
   Cr, > 90\% of total Ni, 99\% of color, 3.2 log removal of total
   coliform, and 2.4 log removal of E. Coli. Removal was attributed
   principally to chemical oxidation, precipitation, co-precipitation,
   coagulation, adsorption, and air stripping concurrently occurring during
   the IMA treatment. Results suggest that IMA is a promising treatment
   technology for water reuse. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium and its alloys have been investigated for their potential
   application as biodegradable implant materials. Although properties of
   magnesium such as biocompatibility and susceptibility to dissolution are
   desirable for biodegradable implant applications, its high degradation
   rate and low strength pose a significant challenge. A potential way to
   reduce the initial degradation rate is to form a self-passivating
   protective layer on the surface of the alloy. Oxides with a low enthalpy
   of formation result in a strong thermodynamic driving force to produce
   oxide surfaces that are more stable than the native oxide (MgO), and
   possibly reduce the initial degradation rate in these alloys. In the
   present study a ternary Mg-3 wt.\% Sc-3 wt.\% Y alloy was investigated
   and its oxidation behavior studied. The effect of surface passivation on
   the in vitro degradation rate was studied and the degradation products
   identified. The results show that the oxide provided an initial
   degradation barrier and 24 h oxidation resulted in a negligible
   degradation rate for up to 23 days. Furthermore, the degradation
   products of the alloy showed no significant toxicity to osteoblastic
   cells, and cell proliferation studies confirmed cell attachment and
   proliferation on the surface of the oxidized alloy. (C) 2012 Acta

Title = {{Comparison of two aerial imaging platforms for identification of
   Huanglongbing-infected citrus trees}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},

Abstract = {{Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening disease is one of the most
   important diseases affecting citrus orchards in Florida and other parts
   of the world. The first critical step for a successful control of HLB is
   its detection and diagnosis. Spectroscopy has proven to yield reliable
   results for its early detection, minimizing the time consumed for this
   process. This study presents a new approach of high-resolution aerial
   imaging for HLB detection using a low-cost, low-altitude remote sensing
   multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A multi-band imaging sensor
   was attached to a UAV that is capable of acquiring aerial images at
   desired resolution by adjusting the flying altitude. Moreover, the
   results achieved using UAV-based sensors were compared with a similar
   imaging system (aircraft-based sensors) with lower spatial resolution.
   Data comprised of six spectral bands (from 530 to 900 nm) and seven
   vegetation indices derived from the selected bands. Stepwise regression
   analysis was used to extract relevant features from UAV-based and
   aircraft-based spectral images. At both spatial resolutions, 710 nm
   reflectance and NIR-R index values were found to be significantly
   different between healthy and HLB-infected trees. During classification
   studies, accuracies in the range of 67-85\% and false negatives from 7\%
   to 32\% were acquired from UAV-based data; while corresponding values
   were 61-74\% and 28-45\% with aircraft-based data. Among the tested
   classification algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) with kernel
   resulted in better performance than other methods such as SVM (linear),
   linear discriminant analysis and quadratic discriminant analysis. Thus,
   high-resolution aerial sensing has good prospect for the detection of
   HLB-infected trees. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The interplay between cohesive sediment flocculation, turbulence, and
   sediment availability is studied using field observations collected on
   the muddy Atchafalaya inner shelf, Louisiana, USA. Observations were
   made at two sites, characterized by surficial sediments of different
   grain size. At the coarse-sediment site, a negative correlation between
   floc size and suspended sediment concentration was observed for the
   first time in a field experiment under energetic wave conditions. This
   agrees with previous laboratory studies and field observations, and
   suggests that strong near-bed turbulence associated with significant
   sediment resuspension also results in the breaking of macro-flocs
   (230-mu m mode). At the fine-sediment site, the relative abundance of
   clay and fine silt available for flocculation appears to promote
   persistent macro-flocs of approximately 300-mu m. The observations
   support the assumption that sediment supply and surficial sediment
   properties, in addition to turbulence and suspended sediment
   concentration, play an important role in flocculation. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   to a step current wave moving without attenuation and at a constant
   speed along a vertical lightning channel. The solution presented, in
   contrast to previously published solutions, was derived in an exact way,
   i.e., no approximations were introduced in its derivation. In this
   paper, this exact approach is extended to more practical line
   configurations. Specifically, still for the case of an external field
   due to a step current and perfectly conducting ground, the cases of
   terminated single-conductor line and multiconductor line (including
   grounded conductors) will be studied. Further, single-and multiconductor
   lines (including grounded conductors) excited by an external field due
   to a linearly rising current will be examined.}},

Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Colossal permittivity (epsilon=301,484 at room temperature and 1kHz) of
   barium titanate was induced in ceramics synthesized using the microwave
   sintering method. Three different sintering processes (conventional,
   spark plasma, and microwave) were performed to better understand
   colossal permittivity in sintered barium titanate. The dielectric
   permittivity measurements revealed that the appearance of colossal
   permittivity has strong dependence on the sintering temperature and
   atmosphere, and less on the grain size of the sintered ceramics.
   However, the as-sintered barium titanate samples produced by microwave
   sintering show high dielectric loss (tan>1) consistent with oxygen
   reduction during the microwave sintering process and consequent
   accumulation of oxygen vacancies and associated charge carriers at the
   grain boundary. Since the highly conductive state of as-sintered
   ceramics precludes their use in dielectric applications, thermal
   annealing at different conditions was performed to recover insulating
   characteristics. Microwave-sintered barium titanate with post annealing
   process (950 degrees C for 12h in air) showed low dielectric loss
   (tan=0.045) at room temperature and 1kHz, while still showing a much
   higher permittivity (epsilon=36,055) than conventionally sintered barium
   titanate (epsilon=3500).}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that plastic anisotropy induced by texture
   development is the main cause of Swift effects in polycrystals subjected
   to monotonic free-end torsion. In this paper, analytical results and
   finite element simulations using a macroscopic model with yielding
   described by the isotropic form of Cazacu et al. (2006) criterion and
   isotropic hardening point to a new interpretation of Swift effects.
   Specifically, it is shown that a slight difference between the uniaxial
   yield stresses in tension and compression leads to irreversible length
   changes under monotonic free-end testing conditions. Furthermore,
   simulations using a self-consistent viscoplastic polycrystal model
   confirm the predictions obtained with the macroscopic model. Finally, a
   comparison between finite-element simulations and room temperature
   experiments on a commercially pure aluminum under free end torsion show
   that the model predicts that axial elongation occurs even at relatively
   small plastic strains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water droplets were either pushed or pulled with an ultra-violet (UV)
   light on vertically aligned ZnO nanorods. Steric acid-immobilized ZnO
   nanorods grown on quartz substrates exhibit a hydrophobic surface
   possessing high contact angles between water droplets and the
   substrates. Exposure of UV onto droplets on ZnO NRs led to reduction of
   contact angles and resulted the internal circulating flows inside the
   droplets. Droplets located at different sites under the spot of the UV
   light created different magnitudes of contact angle changes and the
   internal circulating flows which allowed us to push the droplets away or
   pull the droplets toward the centre of the UV spot.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the numerical simulation on the performance of
   mini-scale reactors for hydrogen production coupled with liquid
   methanol/water vaporizer, methanol/steam reformer, and methanol/air
   catalytic combustor. These reactors are designed similar to
   tube-and-shell heat exchangers. The combustor for heat supply is
   arranged as the tube or shell side. Based on the obtained results, the
   methanol/air flow rate through the combustor (in terms of gas hourly
   space velocity of combustor, GHSV-C) and the methanol/water feed rate to
   the reformer (in terms of gas hourly space velocity of reformer, GHSV-R)
   control the reactor performance. With higher GHSV-C and lower GHSV-R,
   higher methanol conversion can be achieved because of higher reaction
   temperature. However, hydrogen yield is reduced and the carbon monoxide
   concentration is increased due to the reversed water gas shift reaction.
   Optimum reactor performance is found using the balance between GHSV-C
   and GHSV-R. Because of more effective heat transfer characteristics in
   the vaporizer, it is found that the reactor with combustor arranged as
   the shell side has better performance compared with the reactor design
   having the combustor as the tube side under the same operating
   conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new Bayesian approach is proposed to estimate the annual energy
   production (AEP) of a site where construction of wind turbines is
   considered. The approach uses long-term wind speeds of a nearby weather
   station and short-term wind speeds near the target site. Uncertainties
   exist due to the limited amount of data in the target site, in addition
   to the inherent uncertainties in the wind speed, the air density, the
   surface roughness exponent, and the power performance of the turbine.
   The proposed method systematically addresses these uncertainties and
   provides the distribution of the AEP. For illustration, we used the wind
   speed data near Yeosu, Korea, and the power performance curve of a 3 MW
   turbine. For the site and the turbine studied, the range given by the
   95\% confidence interval corresponded to 8.9\% of the mean AEP, and the
   range given by the 99\% confidence interval corresponded to 11.9\% of
   the mean AEP. Benefits of using the Bayesian approach compared to the
   classical statistical inference was also illustrated with the case
   study. The proposed approach provides a more conservative estimation
   considering the uncertainties due to the limited amount of data.
   Distributions of parameters of the prediction model are also provided,
   which enables a more detailed analysis of the prediction. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents a series of user parameter-free iterative Sparse
   Asymptotic Minimum Variance (SAMV) approaches for array processing
   applications based on the asymptotically minimum variance (AMV)
   criterion. With the assumption of abundant snapshots in the
   direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem, the signal powers and
   noise variance are jointly estimated by the proposed iterative AMV
   approach, which is later proved to coincide with the Maximum Likelihood
   (ML) estimator. We then propose a series of power-based iterative SAMV
   approaches, which are robust against insufficient snapshots, coherent
   sources and arbitrary array geometries. Moreover, to overcome the
   direction grid limitation on the estimation accuracy, the
   SAMV-Stochastic ML (SAMV-SML) approaches are derived by explicitly
   minimizing a closed form stochastic ML cost function with respect to one
   scalar paramter, eliminating the need of any additional grid refinement
   techniques. To assist the performance evaluation, approximate solutions
   to the SAMV approaches are also provided for high signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) and low SNR scenarios. Finally, numerical examples are generated
   to compare the performances of the proposed approaches with those of the
   existing ones.}},

Abstract = {{The experimental heat transfer rates from a supersonic two-phase
   impinging air jet with disperse droplets are presented. The experimental
   configuration consists of an expanding disperse mixture of air and water
   through a converging-diverging nozzle, designed for Mach 3.26 with a
   liquid to air mass flow ratio ranging from 1.28\% to 3.83\%, impinging
   upon a thin film heater constructed of nichrome. The spatially varying
   heat transfer coefficient is measured, and peak values are on the order
   of 200, 000W/m(2)K. Two distinct regions of heat transfer are
   identified, one dominated by the jet impingement flow and another
   dominated by thin film heat transfer. The heat transfer coefficient of
   an impinging jet with dry air and no droplets is measured during the
   investigation as well. The heat transfer results are compared, and it is
   demonstrated that the addition of disperse water droplets to the jet
   significantly increases the heat removal capability of the jet as well
   as smoothing the spatial temperature distribution of the heater surface.
   As much as an order of magnitude increase in heat transfer coefficient
   is observed near the centerline of the jet and a factor of 3-5 increase
   is seen at a distance of approximately 4 nozzle diameters from the jet.
   The fundamental heat transfer coefficient measurements should benefit
   applications involving supersonic two-phase jets for high heat flux

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Many biological interfaces provide low friction aqueous lubrication
   through the generation and maintenance of a high water content polymeric
   surface gel. The lubricity of such gels is often attributed to their
   high water content, high water permeability, low elastic modulus, and
   their ability to promote a water film at the sliding interface. Such
   biological systems are frequently characterized as ``soft,{''} where the
   elastic moduli are on the order of megapascals or even kilopascals. In
   an effort to explore the efficacy of such systems to provide lubricity,
   a thin and soft hydrogel surface layer (similar to 5 mu m in thickness)
   with a water content of over > 80 \% was constructed on a silicone
   hydrogel contact lens, which has a water content of approximately 33 \%.
   Nanoindentation measurements with colloidal probes on atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) cantilevers revealed an exceedingly soft elastic
   modulus of similar to 25 kPa. Microtribological experiments at low
   contact pressures (6-30 kPa) and at slow sliding speeds (5-200 mu m/s)
   gave average friction coefficients below mu = 0.02. However, at higher
   contact pressures, the gel collapsed and friction loops showed a
   pronounced stick-slip behavior with breakloose or static friction
   coefficient above mu = 0.5. Thus, the ability of the soft surface
   hydrogel layers to provide lubricity is dependent on their ability to
   support the applied pressure without dehydrating. These transitions were
   found to be reversible and experiments with different radii probes
   revealed that the transition pressures to be on the order of 10-20 kPa.}},

Title = {{Mass transfer coefficients of ammonia for liquid dairy manure}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{107-113}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Available data indicate that 75-80\% of total nitrogen entering a dairy
   operation is lost as ammonia (NH3) via manure storage systems such as
   anaerobic lagoons. Direct measurement of NH3 emissions from manure
   holding systems can be complicated and expensive; however, process-based
   emission models can provide a cost-effective alternative for estimating
   NH3 emissions. The overall NH3 mass transfer coefficient (K-OL) is an
   important component of any NH3 emission process-based model. Models
   relying purely on theoretically-derived mass transfer coefficients have
   not adequately predicted NH3 emissions from livestock manure, and these
   values are lacking in general for liquid dairy manure handling systems.
   To provide critically needed K-OL data for dairy facilities, this study
   directly measured NH3 loss from dilute dairy manure slurries placed in a
   laboratory convective emission chamber to determine realistic NH3 K-OL
   values under conditions typically experienced in the Pacific Northwest.
   The K-OL values increased as liquid temperature and air velocity
   increased and decreased as air temperature and total solids content
   increased, exhibiting an overall range of 1.41 x 10(-6)-3.73 x 10(-6) m
   s(-1). These values were then used to develop a non-linear empirical
   model of K-OL for dilute dairy manure slurries (R-2 = 0.83). The K-OL
   exhibited sensitivity to the four model parameters considered in
   descending order: liquid manure temperature, ambient air temperature,
   wind or air velocity, and total solids concentration. The suite of K-OL
   values applicable to liquid dairy manure and the establishment of an
   empirical model that yields accurate K-OL estimates under a range of
   conditions for use in process-based models provide valuable tools for
   predicting NH3 emissions from dairy operations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We tested whether daily exercise modulates immune and neuroimmune
   cytokines, hippocampus-dependent behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis
   in aging male F344 rats (18mo upon arrival). Twelve weeks after
   conditioned running or control group assignment, the rats were trained
   and tested in a rapid water maze followed by an inhibitory avoidance
   task. The rats were BrdU-injected beginning 12 days after behavioral
   testing and killed 3 weeks later to quantify cytokines and neurogenesis.
   Daily exercise increased neurogenesis and improved immediate and 24 h
   water maze discrimination index (DI) scores and 24 h inhibitory
   avoidance retention latencies. Daily exercise decreased cortical VEGF,
   hippocampal IL-1 beta and serum MCP-1, GRO-KC and leptin levels but
   increased hippocampal GRO-KC and IL-18 concentrations. Serum leptin
   concentration correlated negatively with new neuron number and both DI
   scores while hippocampal IL-1 beta concentration correlated negatively
   with memory scores in both tasks. Cortical VEGF, serum GRO-KC and serum
   MCP-1 levels correlated negatively with immediate DI score and we found
   novel positive correlations between hippocampal IL-18 and GRO-KC levels
   and new neuron number. Pathway analyses revealed distinct serum,
   hippocampal and cortical compartment cytokine relationships. Our results
   suggest that daily exercise potentially improves cognition in aging rats
   by modulating hippocampal neurogenesis and immune and neuroimmune
   cytokine signaling. Our correlational data begin to provide a framework
   for systematically manipulating these immune and neuroimmune signaling
   molecules to test their effects on cognition and neurogenesis across
   lifespan in future experiments. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This literature review focuses on the prevalence of nitrogen and
   phosphorus in urban environments and the complex relationships between
   land use and water quality. Extensive research in urban watersheds has
   broadened our knowledge about point and non-point pollutant sources, but
   the fate of nutrients is not completely understood. For example, it is
   not known how long-term nutrient cycling processes in turfgrass
   landscapes influence nitrogen retention rates or the relative
   atmospheric contribution to urban nitrogen exports. The effect of
   prolonged reclaimed water irrigation is also unknown. Stable isotopes
   have been used to trace pollutants, but distinguishing sources (e.g.,
   fertilizers, wastewater, etc.) can be difficult. Identifying pollutant
   sources may aid our understanding of harmful algal blooms because the
   extent of the relationship between urban nutrient sources and algal
   blooms is unclear. Further research on the delivery and fate of
   nutrients within urban watersheds is needed to address manageable water
   quality impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a complex hinge and gliding joint
   that induces significant shear loads onto the fibrocartilage TMJ disc
   during jaw motion. The purpose of this study was to assess regional
   variation in the disc's shear loading characteristics under
   physiologically relevant loads and to associate those mechanical
   findings with common clinical observations of disc fatigue and damage.
   Porcine TMJ discs were compressed between an axially translating bottom
   platen and a 2.5-cm-diameter indenter within a hydrated testing chamber.
   Discs were cyclically sheared at 0.5, 1, or 5 Hz to 1, 3, or 5\% shear
   strain. Within the anterior and intermediate regions of the disc when
   sheared in the anteroposterior direction, both shear and compressive
   moduli experienced a significant decrease from instantaneous to steady
   state, while the posterior region's compressive modulus decreased
   approximately 5\%, and no significant loss of shear modulus was noted.
   All regions retained their shear modulus within 0.5\% of instantaneous
   values when shear was applied in the mediolateral direction. The results
   of the disc's regional shear mechanics suggest an observable and
   predictable link with the common clinical observation that the posterior
   region of the disc is most often the zone in which fatigue occurs, which
   may lead to disc damage and perforation.}},

Title = {{Effect of silane coupling agent on the durability of epoxy adhesion for

Abstract = {{In this article, the durability of the interfacial bonds between epoxy
   and concrete during hygrothermal exposure was investigated. Through the
   application of a silane coupling agent, we examined the hypothesis that
   hydrogen bonding plays a large role in the degradation of the
   interfacial bond between epoxy and concrete, in which displacement of
   epoxy with water induces the disruption of the interfacial hydrogen
   bond. This hypothesis suggests that durability can be enhanced with the
   use of a silane coupling agent by changing the interfacial hydrogen
   bonds to stronger covalent bonds. The slant shear test results show that
   the durability of the interfacial bond was significantly enhanced with
   the use of an epoxy-functional silane coupling agent. Spectroscopic
   features using FTIR confirmed the changes in chemical nature of concrete
   after the silane modification. By calculating the percent contribution
   to the bond strength for each set of specimens, it was confirmed that
   the silane application improved the durability with exposure for all
   conditions; however, over time the improvement diminished. POLYM. ENG.

Abstract = {{Detection of immature green citrus fruit is important during the early
   life cycle of citrus fruit. It allows growers to manage citrus groves
   more efficiently and maximize yields by identifying expected fruit
   yields well in advance before harvesting. It also helps the growers
   prepare harvesting equipment and pickers for the harvesting operation. A
   novel technique was developed for detecting immature green citrus fruit
   from an outdoor color image and counting number of fruits. This
   technique is unique in that it is the first known attempt towards
   exploring it on green citrus fruits. A set of 71 images containing
   immature green citrus fruit was acquired in an experimental citrus grove
   at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA. An algorithm
   was developed using a set of 11 training images by calculating the fast
   Fourier transform leakage values for fruit and leaves. A threshold value
   was obtained by comparing the percent leakage of fruit and other
   objects. The algorithm was tested on a set of 60 validation images. The
   correct total fruit count for a validation set came out to be 120,
   whereas the actual number of fruit was 146. The overall correct
   detection rate was 82.2 \%. The proposed algorithm can be further
   improved to help growers manage their grove more efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{A suite of techniques was utilized to evaluate the correlation between
   biofilm physiology, fluid-induced shear stress, and detachment in hollow
   fiber membrane aerated bioreactors. Two monoculture species biofilms
   were grown on silicone fibers in a hollow fiber membrane aerated

   conditions. Both physiology (biofilm thickness and roughness) and
   nutrient mass transport data indicated the presence of a steady state
   mature biofilm after 3 weeks of development. Surface shear stress proved
   to be an important parameter for predicting passive detachment for the
   two biofilms. The average shear stress at the surface of Nitrosomonas
   europaea biofilms (54.5?+/-?3.2?mPa) was approximately 20\% higher than
   for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms (45.8?+/-?7.7?mPa), resulting in
   higher biomass detachment. No significant difference in shear stress was
   measured between immature and mature biofilms of the same species. There
   was a significant difference in detached biomass for immature vs. mature
   biofilms in both species. However, there was no difference in detachment
   rate between the two species. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 525534. (c)

Abstract = {{The cache hierarchy's large contribution to total microprocessor system
   power makes caches a good optimization candidate. To facilitate a fast
   design-time cache optimization process, we propose a single-pass
   trace-driven cache simulation methodology-T-SPaCS-for a two-level
   exclusive cache hierarchy. Direct adaptation of conventional
   trace-driven cache simulation to two-level caches requires significant
   storage and simulation time as numerous stacks record cache access
   patterns for each level one and level two cache combination and each
   stack is repeatedly processed. T-SPaCS significantly reduces storage
   space and simulation time using a set of stacks that only record the
   complete cache access pattern. Thereby, T-SPaCS simulates all cache
   configurations for both the level one and level two caches
   simultaneously in a single pass. Experimental results show that T-SPaCS
   is 21.02X faster on average than sequential simulation for instruction
   caches and 33.34X faster for data caches. A simplified, but minimally
   lossy version of T-SPaCS (simplified-T-SPaCS) increases the average
   simulation speedup to 30.15X for instruction caches and 41.31X for data
   caches. We leverage T-SPaCS and simplified-T-SPaCS for determining the
   lowest energy cache configuration to quantify the effects of lossiness
   and observe that T-SPaCS and simplified-T-SPaCS still find the lowest
   energy cache configuration as compared to exact simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Broadcast scheduling in multihop Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is an
   effective mechanism to perform interference-aware broadcasting. Existing
   works provide centralized solutions, which cannot be implemented
   locally. Additionally, they consider very elementary network and
   interference models, in which, either all sensor nodes have the same
   transmission range or their transmission ranges are equal to their
   interference ranges that are not very practical. Furthermore, they
   entirely ignore the existence of WSNs in 3D. In this paper, we study the
   broadcast scheduling in 2D and 3D WSNs. We consider that sensor nodes
   may have different transmission ranges and their interference ranges are
   alpha times of their transmission ranges (where alpha > 1). We devise
   efficient coloring methods for coloring a hexagonal tiling in 2D plane
   and a truncated octahedron tiling in 3D space, based on which we propose
   O(1)-centralized approximation algorithms and O(1)-localized
   approximation algorithms for the broadcast scheduling problem in 2D and
   3D WSNs, respectively. Our O(1)-centralized approximation algorithms for
   3D WSNs and O(1)-localized approximation algorithms for 2D and 3D WSNs
   are the first approximation algorithms for the corresponding problems.
   Finally, we present an efficient greedy heuristic to study the effect of
   various priority metrics for greedily scheduling multiple interfering
   transmissions. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are
   provided to evaluate the performance of our algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Ion beam modification to effect ion beam mixing without changing
   morphology was investigated as a means to improve the electrochemical
   performance of Ge thin film electrodes for rechargeable Li batteries. As
   a result of a minimum tenfold increase in the strength of adhesion of
   the Ge film to the current collector (substrate), the ion beam-mixed
   electrodes exhibited stable specific capacities of similar to 1500 mAh
   g(-1) (close to the theoretical maximum of 1623 mAh g(-1)) for
   galvanostatic cycling rates of 0.2C-1.6C using both single- and
   multi-rate testing schemes. Electron microscopy investigations showed
   that the ion beam-mixed electrodes transform from a flat, continuous,
   nonporous microstructure in the virgin state to a rough, cracked, porous
   microstructure as a result of electrochemical cycling, but remain in
   excellent electrical contact with the current collector. The results
   suggest that ion beam mixing could be used to produce inexpensive, high

Abstract = {{Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles are of interest because of their room
   temperature coercivity and high magnetic anisotropy constant, which make
   them attractive in applications such as sensors based on the Brownian
   relaxation mechanism and probes to determine the mechanical properties
   of complex fluids at the nanoscale. These nanoparticles can be
   synthesized with a narrow size distribution by the thermal decomposition
   of an ironcobalt oleate precursor in a high boiling point solvent. We
   studied the influence of aging time of the ironcobalt oleate precursor
   on the structure, chemical composition, size, and magnetic relaxation of
   cobalt ferrite nanoparticles synthesized by the thermal decomposition
   method. The structure and thermal behavior of the ironcobalt oleate was
   studied during the aging process. Infrared spectra indicated a shift in
   the coordination state of the oleate and iron/cobalt ions from bidentate
   to bridging coordination. Aging seemed to influence the thermal
   decomposition of the ironcobalt oleate as determined from
   thermogravimmetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, where
   shifts in the temperatures corresponding to decomposition events and a
   narrowing of the endotherms associated with these events were observed.
   Aging promoted formation of the spinel crystal structure, as determined
   from X-ray diffraction, and influenced the nanoparticle magnetic
   properties, resulting in an increase in blocking temperature and
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Mossbauer spectra also indicated changes
   in the magnetic properties resulting from aging of the precursor oleate.
   Although all samples exhibited some degree of Brownian relaxation, as
   determined from complex susceptibility measurements in a liquid medium,
   aging of the ironcobalt oleate precursor resulted in crossing of the
   in-phase chi' and out-of-phase chi `' components of the complex
   susceptibility at the frequency of the Brownian magnetic relaxation
   peak, as expected for nanoparticles that relax through a single
   relaxation mechanism. The resulting nanoparticles would be suitable for
   sensors based on the Brownian relaxation mechanism and in determining
   mechanical properties of complex fluids at the size scale of the
   nanoparticles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   x)Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-xK(1/2)Bi(1/2)TiO(3) (NBT-KBT) was studied using
   high-resolution powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.
   A temperature-independent morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) separating
   NBT-like pseudorhombohedral (R) and KBT-like pseudotetragonal (T) phases
   was observed at x approximate to 0.2. For x < 0.2, both local and
   average room-temperature structures are similar to those in NBT.
   Simultaneous long-range antiphase and short-range in-phase octahedral
   rotations average, resulting in effective antiphase a(-) a(-) c(-)
   tilting, which yields monoclinic symmetry when probed by x-ray
   diffraction (XRD). For these compositions, polar ordering is coupled to
   antiphase octahedral rotations so that tilting and ferroelectric (FE)
   domains coincide. Compositions with x > 0.2 exhibit a tetragonal-like
   distortion; however, complex splitting of reflections in XRD patterns
   suggests that the actual symmetry is lower than tetragonal. For 0.2 <= x
   <= 0.5, in-phase octahedral tilting a(0)b(+)a(0) (or a(+)b(0)b(0)) is
   present but confined to the nanoscale, while for x > 0.5 the structure
   becomes untilted. In-phase tilting evolves above the ferroelectric
   transition and occurs around a nonpolar (a or b) axis of the average T
   structure. The onset of polar order has no significant effect on the
   coherence length of in-phase tilting, which suggests only weak coupling
   between the two phenomena. The average symmetry of the T phase is
   determined by the effective symmetry (Imm2) of assemblages of coherent
   in-phase tilted nanodomains. Near the MPB, the coexistence of extended
   R-and T-like regions is observed, but lattice distortions within each
   phase are small, yielding narrow peaks with a pseudocubic appearance in
   XRD. The temperature of the FE phase transition exhibits a minimum at
   the MPB. The structured diffuse scattering observed in electron
   diffraction patterns for all the compositions suggests that polar order
   in NBT-KBT solid solutions is modulated away from the average
   displacements refined using powder diffraction data. DOI:

   fields of low frequencies, approximately 3\% to 4\% of the volume
   fraction of non-180 degrees domains parallel to the field experienced
   polarization reorientation. This subtle non-180 degrees domain wall
   motion directly contributes to 64\% to 75\% of the magnitude of the

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) offers three-dimensional (3D) structural
   and functional imaging of living biological tissue with label-free,

   Despite advances in live animal imaging with PAT, there is still a need
   for 3D imaging at centimeter depths in real-time. We report the
   development of four dimensional (4D) PAT, which integrates time
   resolutions with 3D spatial resolution, obtained using spherical arrays
   of ultrasonic detectors. The 4D PAT technique generates motion pictures
   of imaged tissue, enabling real time tracking of dynamic physiological
   and pathological processes at hundred micrometer-millisecond
   resolutions. The 4D PAT technique is used here to image needle-based
   drug delivery and pharmacokinetics. We also use this technique to
   monitor 1) fast hemodynamic changes during inter-ictal epileptic
   seizures and 2) temperature variations during tumor thermal therapy.}},

Title = {{Proliferation zones in the axolotl brain and regeneration of the
   telencephalon}},
Journal = {{NEURAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although the brains of lower vertebrates are known to
   exhibit somewhat limited regeneration after incisional or stab wounds,
   the Urodele brain exhibits extensive regeneration after massive tissue
   removal. Discovering whether and how neural progenitor cells that reside
   in the ventricular zones of Urodeles proliferate to mediate tissue
   repair in response to injury may produce novel leads for regenerative
   strategies. Here we show that endogenous neural progenitor cells
   resident to the ventricular zone of Urodeles spontaneously proliferate,
   producing progeny that migrate throughout the telencephalon before
   terminally differentiating into neurons. These progenitor cells appear
   to be responsible for telencephalon regeneration after tissue removal
   and their activity may be up-regulated by injury through an olfactory
   cue.
   Results: There is extensive proliferation of endogenous neural
   progenitor cells throughout the ventricular zone of the adult axolotl
   brain. The highest levels are observed in the telencephalon, especially
   the dorsolateral aspect, and cerebellum. Lower levels are observed in
   the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. New cells produced in the
   ventricular zone migrate laterally, dorsally and ventrally into the
   surrounding neuronal layer. After migrating from the ventricular zone,
   the new cells primarily express markers of neuronal differentiative
   fates. Large-scale telencephalic tissue removal stimulates progenitor
   cell proliferation in the ventricular zone of the damaged region,
   followed by proliferation in the tissue that surrounds the healing edges
   of the wound until the telencephalon has completed regeneration. The
   proliferative stimulus appears to reside in the olfactory system,
   because telencephalic regeneration does not occur in the brains of
   olfactory bulbectomized animals in which the damaged neural tissue
   simply heals over.
   Conclusion: There is a continual generation of neuronal cells from
   neural progenitor cells located within the ventricular zone of the
   axolotl brain. Variable rates of proliferation were detected across
   brain regions. These neural progenitor cells appear to mediate
   telencephalic tissue regeneration through an injury-induced olfactory
   cue. Identification of this cue is our future goal.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated iron concentrations have been observed in the groundwater
   underlying and surrounding several Florida landfill sites. An in situ
   groundwater remediation method for iron (present as soluble ferrous
   iron) using a permeable reactive barrier composed of calcium
   carbonate-based materials (CCBMs), such as limestone, was examined as a
   potentially effective and low-cost treatment technique. The effects of
   various environmental factors (i.e., pH, co-existing cations, and
   natural organic matter (NOM)) on the removal reaction were investigated
   using laboratory batch studies. Solution pH had a minor effect on iron
   removal, with superior iron removal observed in the highest pH solution
   (pH of 9). Sodium and calcium tended to impede the iron removal process
   by increasing the ionic strength of the solution. Manganese competes
   with iron ions at the adsorption sites on CCBMs; therefore, the presence
   of manganese prohibits iron removal and reduces removal effectiveness.
   NOM was found to decrease Fe(II) uptake by CCBMs and reduce the removal
   effectiveness by complexing Fe(II), most likely through the carboxyl
   group, thereby maintaining Fe(II) mobility in the aqueous phase. (C)

Abstract = {{Motivation: Phylogenetics, or reconstructing the evolutionary
   relationships of organisms, is critical for understanding evolution. A
   large number of heuristic algorithms for phylogenetics have been
   developed, some of which enable estimates of trees with tens of
   thousands of taxa. Such trees may not be robust, as small changes in the
   input data can cause major differences in the optimal topology. Tools
   that can assess the quality and stability of phylogenetic tree estimates
   and identify the most reliable parts of the tree are needed.
   Results: We define measures that assess the stability of trees, subtrees
   and individual taxa with respect to changes in the input sequences. Our
   measures consider changes at the finest granularity in the input data
   (i.e. individual nucleotides). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   measures on large published datasets. Our measures are computationally
   feasible for phylogenetic datasets consisting of tens of thousands of
   taxa.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Barium titanate (BT) ceramics with Ba/Ti ratios of 0.95 and 1.00 were
   synthesized using spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. Dielectric
   spectroscopy (frequency range from 40 Hz to 1MHz and temperature range
   from 300K to 30K) was performed on those ceramics (SPS BT). SPS BT
   showed extremely high permittivity up to similar to 10(5), which can be
   referred to as colossal permittivity, with relatively low dielectric
   loss of similar to 0.05. Data analyses following Debye relaxation and
   universal dielectric response models indicate that the origin of
   colossal permittivity in BT ceramics is the result of a hopping polaron
   within semiconducting grains in combination with interfacial
   polarization at the insulating grain boundary. Furthermore, the
   contributions of each polarization mechanism to the colossal
   permittivity in SPS BT, such as a hopping polarization, internal barrier
   layer capacitance effect, and electrode effect, were estimated. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Tailor-made additives, which are molecules that share the same molecular
   structure as a parent molecule with only slight structural variations,
   have previously been demonstrated as a useful means to control
   crystallization dynamics in solution. For example, tailor-made additives
   can be added to solutions of a crystallizing parent molecule to alter
   the crystal growth rate, size, and shape. We apply this strategy as a
   means to predictably control morphology in molecular bulk-heterojunction
   (BHJ) photovoltaic cells. Through the use of an asymmetric oligomer
   substituted with a bulky triisobutylsilyl end group, the morphology of
   BHJ blends can be controlled resulting in a near doubling (from 1.3 to
   2.2\%) in power conversion efficiency. The use of tailor-made additives
   provides promising opportunities for controlling crystallization
   dynamics, and thereby film morphologies, for many organic electronic
   devices such as photovoltaics and field-effect transistors.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of shock waves with deformable particles is an important
   fundamental problem. In some applications, e. g., the detonation of
   explosives loaded with metal particles, the pressure behind the shock
   wave can be significantly larger than the yield strength of the particle
   material. This means that particles can deform severely during their
   interaction with the shock wave. The experimental and theoretical
   studies of shock interaction with deformable particles (SIDP) are
   extremely challenging because of its highly transient nature. As a
   result, no accurate model exists yet that can be used in simulations.
   The objective of this paper is to develop a simple point-particle model
   that accurately captures the unsteady force and heat-transfer in SIDP.
   In the development of this model, we build on earlier models by Ling et
   al. (Int. J. Multiphase Flow 37, 1026-1044 (2011)) for the unsteady
   force and heat-transfer contributions for rigid particles. Insights
   gained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) guide the extension of
   these models to deforming particles. Results obtained with the extended
   model for the interaction of a deforming particle with a shock wave and
   a Chapman-Jouguet detonation wave compare well with DNS results and
   therefore offer significant improvements over standard models. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Partial reconfiguration (PR) enables shared FPGA systems to
   nonintrusively time multiplex hardware tasks in partially reconfigurable
   regions (PRRs). To fully exploit PR, higher priority tasks should
   preempt lower priority tasks and preempted tasks should resume execution
   in any PRR. This preemption/resumption requires saving/restoring the
   preempted task's execution context and relocating the task to another
   PRR, however, prior works only provide partial solutions and impose
   limitations and/or overheads. We propose on-chip hardware task
   relocation (HTR) software, which enables a task's execution state to be
   saved, relocated to, and restored in any PRR with sufficient resources.
   The HTR software executes on a soft-core processor in the FPGA's static
   region, and is thus portable across any system/application. Experimental
   results evaluate HTR execution times, enabling designers to tradeoff
   task/PRR granularity and HTR execution times based on application
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a graph-theoretical approach to reveal
   patterns of functional dependencies between different scalp regions. We
   start by computing pairwise measures of dependence from dense-array
   scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. The obtained dependence
   matrices are then averaged over trials and further statistically
   processed to provide more reliability. Graph structure information is
   subsequently extracted using several graph theoretical measures. Simple
   measures of node degree and clustering strength are shown to be useful
   to describe the global properties of the analyzed networks. More
   sophisticated measures, such as betweenness centrality and subgraph
   centrality tend to provide additional insight into the network
   structure, and therefore robustly discriminate two cognitive states. We
   further examine the connected components of the graph to identify the
   dependent functional regions. The approach supports dynamicity in that
   all suggested computations can be easily extended to different points in
   time, thus enabling to monitor dependence evolution and variability with
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Intracortical neural recordings are typically high-dimensional due to
   many electrodes, channels, or units and high sampling rates, making it
   very difficult to visually inspect differences among responses to
   various conditions. By representing the neural response in a
   low-dimensional space, a researcher can visually evaluate the amount of
   information the response carries about the conditions. We consider a
   linear projection to 2-D space that also parametrizes a metric between
   neural responses. The projection, and corresponding metric, should
   preserve class-relevant information pertaining to different behavior or
   stimuli. We find the projection as a solution to the
   information-theoretic optimization problem of maximizing the information
   between the projected data and the class labels. The method is applied
   to two datasets using different types of neural responses: motor cortex
   neuronal firing rates of a macaque during a center-out reaching task,
   and local field potentials in the somatosensory cortex of a rat during
   tactile stimulation of the forepaw. In both cases, projected data points
   preserve the natural topology of targets or peripheral touch sites.
   Using the learned metric on the neural responses increases the
   nearest-neighbor classification rate versus the original data; thus, the
   metric is tuned to distinguish among the conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Phase synchrony is a powerful amplitudeindependent measure that
   quantifies linear and nonlinear dynamics between non-stationary signals.
   It has been widely used in a variety of disciplines including neural
   science and cognitive psychology. Current time-varying phase estimation
   uses either the Hilbert transform or the complex wavelet transform of
   the signals. This paper exploits the concept of phase synchrony as a
   mean to discriminate face processing from the processing of a simple
   control stimulus. Dependencies between channel locations were assessed
   for two separate conditions elicited by distinct pictures (representing
   a human face and a Gabor patch), both flickering at a rate of 17. 5 Hz.
   Statistical analysis is performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
   Moreover, the phase synchrony measure used is compared with a measure of

Abstract = {{High-resolution sparse spectral estimation techniques have recently been
   shown to offer significant performance gains as compared to most
   conventional estimation approaches, although such methods typically
   suffer the drawback of being computationally cumbersome. In this paper,
   we seek to alleviate this drawback somewhat, examining computationally
   efficient implementations of the recent iterative sparse maximum
   likelihood-based approaches (SMLA), exploiting the inherent rich
   structure of these estimators. The derived implementations reduce the
   resulting computational complexity with at least one order of magnitude,
   while still yielding exact implementations. The effectiveness of the
   discussed techniques are illustrated using experimental examples.}},

Abstract = {{Much work in the study of hyperspectral imagery has focused on
   macroscopic mixtures and unmixing via the linear mixing model. A
   substantially different approach seeks to model hyperspectral data
   non-linearly in order to accurately describe intimate or microscopic
   relationships of materials within the image In this paper we present and
   discuss a new model (MacMicDEM) that seeks to unify both approaches by
   representing a pixel as both linearly and non-linearly mixed, with the
   condition that the endmembers for both mixture types need not be
   related. Using this model, we develop a method to accurately and quickly
   unmix data which is both macroscopically and microscopically mixed.
   Subsequently, this method is then validated on synthetic and real

   enhanced molecular packing and exciton diffusion in the ZnPc film.
   Coupled with exciton blocking provided by tetracene, this results in a
   more than 100\% increase in the external quantum efficiency for ZnPc
   absorption in bilayer ZnPc/C-60 devices. The power conversion efficiency
   is increased from 2.0\% to 3.5\% for bilayer devices, and from 3.8\% to

Abstract = {{We describe a multispectral continuous-wave diffuse optical tomography
   (DOT) system that can be used for in vivo three-dimensional (3-D)
   imaging of seizure dynamics. Fast 3-D data acquisition is realized
   through a time multiplexing approach based on a parallel lighting
   configuration - our system can achieve 0.12ms per source per wavelength
   and up to 14Hz sampling rate for a full set of data for 3-D DOT image
   reconstruction. The system is validated using both static and dynamic
   tissue-like phantoms. In vivo rat experiments using both focal and
   generalized models of seizure are also demonstrated. In the focal
   seizure experiment, hemodynamic seizure focus was clearly detected and
   tracked. In the generalized seizure experiment, early hemodynamic
   responses with heterogeneous patterns were detected several minutes
   preceding the EEG onset of seizures and widespread hemodynamic changes
   were found evolving from local regions. Connectivity changes were also
   found during the development of seizures. This study demonstrates that
   DOT represents a powerful tool for investigating seizure generation and
   propagation, elucidating the causes and mechanism of seizures.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic volume measurement is one of the most basic functions of road
   planning and management. In this paper, we investigate an important
   problem of privacy preserving ``point-to-point{''} traffic volume
   measurement. We formalize ``point-to-point{''} traffic as an
   origin-destination (O-D) flow, which represents the set of vehicles
   traveling from one geographical location (origin) to another location
   (destination). We take advantage of vehicular cyber-physical systems
   (VCPS) to exploit the potential for a fundamental shift in the way how
   O-D data are collected. The challenge is to allow the collection of
   statistical O-D flow information, yet protect identities of individual
   vehicles. To address that, we design two novel schemes which utilize
   both the latest technological advance in VCPS and the nice properties of
   a family of commutative one-way hash functions. Furthermore, we adopt
   statistical methodology and use sampling to achieve far better
   efficiency with graceful degradation in measurement accuracy. We perform
   simulations to demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of our
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A brief review of n-type doping of GaAs, InGaAs and InP using ion
   implantation is presented. While the diffusion of the amphoteric dopant
   Si is not a significant issue its activation is limited to around
   1x10(19)/cm(3). This has prompted many studies into factors that might
   affect dopant activation including co-implantation to force site
   selection, damage and amorphization effects, elevated temperature
   implants and capping effects. A summary of these results is discussed.
   With interest in using III-V materials for n-channel devices in future
   sub 15 nm devices there is also an increasing interest in low energy
   implants. This suggests the role of surface degradation upon annealing
   will become even more important. Recent results along these lines are

   transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) to suppress the activity of the HIV-1.
   The binding affinity of NNRTI to the reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1
   is an important factor determining the efficiency of the drug
   performance. The HIV-1 RT immobilized AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility
   transistors (HEMTs) were used to find the dissociation constant of
   NNRTIs. Comparing to conventional drug analyzing, HEMTs assisting
   experiments are much faster in processing time and lower cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, analysis, and experimental validation of
   the passive case of a variable stiffness suspension system. The central
   concept is based on a recently designed variable stiffness mechanism. It
   consists of a horizontal control strut and a vertical strut. The main
   idea is to vary the load transfer ratio by moving the location of the
   point of attachment of the vertical strut to the car body. This movement
   is controlled passively using the horizontal strut. The system is
   analyzed using an L-2-gain analysis based on the concept of energy
   dissipation. The analyses, simulation, and experimental results show
   that the variable stiffness suspension achieves better performance than
   the constant stiffness counterpart. The performance criteria used are;
   ride comfort, characterized by the car body acceleration, suspension
   deflection, and road holding, characterized by tire deflection.}},

Abstract = {{A variable stiffness architecture is used in the suspension system to
   counteract the body roll moment, thereby enhancing the roll stability of
   the vehicle. The variation of stiffness concept uses the ``reciprocal
   actuation{''} to effectively transfer energy between a vertical
   traditional strut and a horizontal oscillating control mass, thereby
   improving the energy dissipation of the overall suspension. The lateral
   dynamics of the system is developed using a bicycle model. The
   accompanying roll dynamics are also developed and validated using
   experimental data. The positions of the left and right control masses
   are optimally allocated to reduce the effective body roll and roll rate.
   Simulation results show that the resulting variable stiffness suspension
   system has more than 50\% improvement in roll response over the
   traditional constant stiffness counterparts. The simulation scenarios
   examined is the fishhook maneuver.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic climbing robots have shown vertical speeds that approach those
   of the fastest climbing animals, but to date, no work has been conducted
   on directional control or maneuverability while climbing for these
   platforms. Directional control in animals during high-speed terrestrial
   running utilizes altered leg kinematics and leg specialization, however,
   little work has been done to classify biological strategies for
   maneuverability in the scansorial regime. To gain insight on how
   alterations of leg kinematics effect maneuverability during high-speed
   climbing, we propose three methods for directional control and implement
   them on a high-speed, dynamic climbing robotic platform. These methods
   alter the leg kinematics of the platform through asymmetrically changing
   the foot placement, center of mass, and leg length. We show that heading
   angles of up to 37. off of vertical are possible while only decreasing
   the vertical ascension rate by 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a new type of thruster which, similar to squid and

   expelling jets of water. The thrust output of this device depends
   greatly on the nature of the expelled jet, with greater output occurring
   for jets which form a single coherent vortex ring rather than a vortex
   ring with a trailing wake. The average thrust output as well as the
   jetting efficiency are maximized with respect to the thruster's nozzle
   diameter and jet velocity program. The appropriate constraints of the
   problem are defined including a dynamic constraint to ensure that the
   propulsive jet forms a single vortex ring. It is shown that the average
   thrust output under these constraints reaches a maximum when the nozzle
   radius is set to a critical value, and that using an orifice nozzle
   decreases propulsive efficiency at low Reynolds numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Fault diagnosis of localized defects in motor bearings using electrical
   current signal analysis has previously been reported in the literature.
   An extension of this concept is the detection of faults in mechanical
   components influencing the operation of an induction motor, such as a
   gearbox connected to the motor, using electrical current.
   This paper presents a dynamic model-based approach to quantify the
   severity of upstream mechanical equipment faults on electrical
   current-based fault diagnosis metrics, using a wind turbine system as an
   example. A lumped parameter-based dynamic model was used to develop the
   system of equations representing the rotational motion of the drive
   train components in a wind turbine. This mechanical model was coupled
   with a dynamic model for a doubly-fed induction generator to simulate
   the electrical current output under faulty operating conditions. The
   changes in the fault diagnosis metric under different levels of severity
   of the fault were investigated. The influence of faults in multiple
   gears of the gearbox on the electrical current signals was also
   investigated. This method can be advantageous compared with existing
   approaches involving vibration analysis because it is a non-invasive and
   remote monitoring approach, and may not even require additional
   instrumentation. This approach is particularly useful for wind turbine
   operators as well as designers seeking to implement a low-cost condition
   monitoring solution for gear fault detection in a wind turbine.}},

Abstract = {{The potential threat in terms of environmental protection and safe
   navigation posed by wake waves from high-speed ferries and fast
   conventional ships is well documented. Vessels that travel in the
   near-critical regime (depth Froude number similar to 1) at some sections
   along their ship tracks can generate packets of large, solitonic, very
   long and long crested waves. However, it is difficult to determine a
   general characterization of such wakes at the coast, due to the
   transient and nonlinear nature of this phenomenon, and the fact that
   wake impact is influenced by the local bathymetry and coastline
   configuration. This paper investigates the potential benefits of wake
   analysis by means of a time-frequency technique (windowed Fourier
   transform), which is a standard signal analysis method that has only
   recently been applied for wake analysis. Analysis of ship wakes have
   been performed based on instrumental data of sea surface elevation
   recorded at different sites in Tallinn Bay, the Baltic Sea, which is
   characterized by very intense ship traffic and provides a rich
   collection of vessel-wake signals. Results show that the wake signals
   are easily identified in spectrograms. The method is particularly useful
   for identification of low frequency signals that may easily be masked by
   high frequency noise in the wave record. Furthermore, the spectrogram
   provides information that makes it possible to associate wake events
   with individual ships at a given location. This approach also opens a
   new direction for the statistical description of wakes, applicable to
   the characterization of the ``wake climate{''} for sites with intense
   vessel traffic.}},

Abstract = {{One of the fundamental difficulties in neural assembly studies is the
   lack of an effective, high-resolution measure of the spatiotemporal
   structure in spike trains obtained from a single realization. In this
   chapter a systematic approach to estimate the cross-correlation (CC) of
   spike trains, over time and in only one realization, is proposed. The
   solution lies in an alternate definition of cross-correlation which
   suggests that, rather than time averaging as is current practice, we
   should use ensemble averaging. This observation suggests a natural
   instantaneous CC estimator as required for high temporal resolution and
   real-time ensemble analysis and decoding. Results are shown in simulated
   data sets and neural activity of rat motor cortical neurons during a
   behavioral task.}},

Abstract = {{Biomimicry has gained much popularity recently in engineering design,
   taking advantage of natural optimization processes. A new underwater
   thruster design is inspired by propulsion mechanisms of jellyfish,
   squid, octopus and other cephalopods. The thruster expels finite jets of
   water periodically to provide necessary maneuvering forces on underwater
   vehicles and can be placed completely inside the vehicle body. Since the
   design is inspired by squid and jellyfish propulsion, this paper will
   investigate one way in which propulsive thrust is enhanced by these
   animals. A CFD simulation of a swimming jellyfish is analyzed to
   determine propulsive performance with respect to jetting kinematics,
   showing that the shape of the velar opening flaps induce a converging
   radial velocity in the jet increasing the total jet impulse. A prototype
   thruster was equipped with a set of nozzles to create both parallel and
   converging jet flows and it was observed that the converging jet flow
   produced a propulsive jet with approximate to 70\% more impulse than the
   parallel jet flow.}},

Abstract = {{The routing and packet forwarding function is at the core of the IP
   network-layer protocols. The throughput of a router is constrained by
   the speed at which the routing table lookup can be performed. Hash-based
   lookup has been a research focus in this area due to its O(1) average
   lookup time, as compared to other approachs such as trie-based lookup
   which tends to make more memory accesses. With a series of prior
   multi-hashing developments, including d-random, 2-left, and d-left, we
   discover that a new guided multi-hashing approach holds the promise of
   further pushing the envelope of this line of research to make
   significant performance improvement beyond what today's best technology
   can achieve. Our guided multi-hashing approach achieves near perfect
   load balance among hash buckets, while limiting the number of buckets to
   be probed for each key ( address) lookup, where each bucket holds one or
   a few routing entries. Unlike the localized optimization by the prior
   approaches, we utilize the full information of multi-hash mapping from
   keys to hash buckets for global key-to-bucket assignment. We have dual
   objectives of lowering the bucket size while increasing empty buckets,
   which helps to reduce the number of buckets brought from off-chip memory
   to the network processor for each lookup. We introduce mechanisms to
   make sure that most lookups only require one bucket to be fetched. Our
   simulation results show that with the same number of hash functions, the
   guided multiple-hashing schemes are more balanced than d-left and
   others, while the average number of buckets to be accessed for each
   lookup is reduced by 20-50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have revolutionarily changed the
   way people connect with each other and share information. The key to
   this success is reputation systems which enable strangers to establish
   trust based on the past experience. Existing reputation systems assess
   general reputation purely relying on the real identity rather than the
   behaviors of users, e. g., the content or comments posted. Furthermore,
   the general reputation cannot clearly depict the massive and distinct
   behaviors of one particular user. In this paper, we propose a
   fine-grained attribute-based reputation system which represents users'
   reputation in terms of attributes and enables users to rate each other's
   attributes instead of real identities. Our scheme verifies users'
   attributes used to derive the reputation, and further uses the verified
   information to vote on the posted attribute-associated messages, where
   the verification process provides authenticity of the reputation value
   while not revealing the actual value to entities who do not have the
   privilege. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to define a
   fine-grained reputation value based on users' verified attributes in
   OSNs with privacy preservation. We also present the security analysis
   along with the simulation results to verify both the
   privacy-preservation and practicality of our proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A number of intelligent transportation system technologies are deployed
   for disseminating information to travelers. One of the most important
   parameters for assessing the impacts and benefits of these deployments
   that influence route selection is the diversion rates of travelers. In
   this research, a method was developed to estimate traffic diversions on
   the basis of main-line detector data without the need for off-ramp
   detectors. In addition, the estimation allows the assessment of the
   guidelines and procedures for disseminating information and evaluating
   the impacts on alternative routes. The validity of the developed
   methodology was verified by comparing the estimated values with
   real-world data. Case studies of the developed method indicated that the
   average diversion rate was about 10\% to 35\% for three-lane and
   four-lane freeways, depending on the number of lanes blocked. A linear
   relationship between the average diversion rate and the lane blockage
   ratio was also developed; this relationship indicated that there was a
   general trend of increase in diversion with the increase in the lane
   blockage ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Microscopic simulation is critical for evaluating the operation
   strategies of managed lanes. However, most existing tools are limited in
   their ability to simulate dynamic tolling strategies of managed lanes,
   particularly those with multiple segments. Three sets of modeling
   components are developed in this paper to demonstrate simulation of
   high-occupancy toll (HOT) lane operations. The first component
   implements three pricing strategies: responsive pricing; a closed-loop,
   control-based algorithm; and time-of-day pricing. The second component
   mimics drivers' lane choice behaviors in the presence of tolls, and the
   third represents different toll structures for multisegment HOT lane
   facilities. An enhanced version of CORSIM, which contains these new
   modeling components, is validated by simulation experiments involving
   the 95 Express network in South Florida.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of developing a brain-computer interface for the
   communication of basic mental states, a classical conditioning paradigm
   with affective stimuli was used, assessing the possibility to
   discriminate between affirmative and negative thinking in an fMRI-BCI
   setting. 6 Alzheimer patients and 7 healthy control subjects
   participated to the study. Congruent and incongruent word-pairs were
   respectively associated to pleasant (baby laughter) and unpleasant
   (scream) affective stimuli. A Support Vector Machine classifier focusing
   on insula, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex was used to
   discriminate between the activations relative to congruent and
   incongruent word-pairs (eliciting respectively affirmative and negative
   thinking), following the conditioning process. Classification accuracy
   was on average 71\% for Alzheimer patients, reaching 85\%, and on
   average 69\% for control subjects, reaching 83\%. This study shows that
   it is possible to extract information on individuals' mental states by
   exploiting affective responses, overcoming the typical obstacles of
   traditional BCIs, which generally require time-consuming trainings and
   intact cognition.}},

Abstract = {{This study contributes to the literature by developing a geographically
   weighted regression (GWR) model for capturing the effect of land use on
   person miles traveled (PMT) and demonstrating its benefits over simpler
   methods. Travel survey and land use data from southeast Florida were
   used in this analysis. The empirical results reconfirm the strong
   effects of regional accessibility, land use mixing, and connectivity on
   PMT. These land use effects were estimated to be significant after
   controlling for socioeconomic variables. Further, the GWR model
   demonstrated that the marginal sensitivities of PMT to various land use
   attributes vary over space. This spatial variation was particularly
   strong in the case of the effect of regional accessibility. Empirical
   results show that allowing for flexible trends in the parameter effects
   improves the models and explains a greater proportion of the variance in
   PMT across the region. The study also highlights the statistical
   superiority of the GWR model over the global regression models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology to cancel the far-end crosstalk in
   DDR4 memory channel. By utilizing the long via stub, the far end
   crosstalk is greatly reduced without increasing the routing area. To
   further demonstrate the crosstalk cancellation impacts on the memory
   channel margin, DDR4 DQ topology was simulated at the speed of 2133MT/s,
   2400MT/s, and 2677MT/s, respectively. From the DDR4 channel simulation,
   we successfully demonstrated that the eye height and width at the data
   rates of 2677MT/s were improved by the amount of 30.03\% and 22.84\%,
   respectively, after adding the via stubs. The simulation also confirmed
   that the via stub does not affect the eye diagram at all when there is
   no any aggressor. It also demonstrates that, as the via-to-via spacing
   is decreased from 40mil to 25mil, the eye height and width at 2667MT/s
   are increased 11.12\% and 10.82\%, respectively. 12 layer test board is

Abstract = {{Online social networks (OSNs) provide a new platform for product
   promotion and advertisement. Influence maximization problem arisen in
   viral marketing has received a lot of attentions recently. Most of the
   existing diffusion models rely on one fundamental assumption that an
   influenced user necessarily adopts the product and encourages his/ her
   friends to further adopt it. However, an influenced user may be just
   aware of the product. Due to personal preference, neutral or negative
   opinion can be generated so that product adoption is uncertain.
   Maximizing the total number of influenced users is not the uppermost
   concern, instead, letting more activated users hold positive opinions is
   of first importance.
   Motivated by above phenomenon, we proposed a model, called Opinion-based
   Cascading (OC) model. We formulate an opinion maximization problem on
   the new model to take individual opinion into consideration as well as
   capture the change of opinions at the same time. We show that under the
   OC model, opinion maximization is NP-hard and the objective function is
   no longer submodular. We further prove that there does not exist any
   approximation algorithm with finite ratio unless P=NP. We have designed
   an efficient algorithm to compute the total positive influence based on
   this new model. Comprehensive experiments on real social networks are
   conducted, and results show that previous methods overestimate the
   overall positive influence, while our model is able to distinguish
   between negative opinions and positive opinions, and estimate the
   overall influence more accurately.}},

Abstract = {{The least cost influence (LCI) problem, which asks to identify a minimum
   number of seed users who can eventually influence a large number of
   users, has become one of the central research topics recently in online
   social networks (OSNs). However, existing works mostly focused on a
   single network while users nowadays often join several OSNs. Thus, it is
   crucial to investigate the influence in multiplex networks, i.e. the
   influence is diffused across a set of networks via shared users, in
   order to obtain the best set of seed users.
   In this paper, we propose a unified framework to represent and analyze
   the influence diffusion in multiplex networks. More specifically, we
   tackle the LCI problem in multiplex OSNs by reducing multiplex networks
   to a single network via various coupling schemes while preserving the
   most influence propagation properties. Besides the coupling schemes to
   represent the diffusion process, the framework also includes the
   influence relay, a new metric to measure the flow of influence inside
   and between networks. The experiments on both real and synthesized
   datasets validate the effectiveness of the coupling schemes as well as
   provide some interesting insights into the process of influence
   propagation in multiplex networks.}},

Abstract = {{Location-based services enable people to obtain various kinds of
   services based on their current locations. Recently, the geosocial
   networking services, which utilize mobile users' location information to
   realize social interactions, lead to numerous fascinating applications,
   such as content sharing, social shopping, food sourcing, and so on.
   However, extensive and unnecessary uses of mobile users' spatial and
   temporal information pose conspicuous privacy threats not only to their
   locations, but also to the shared contents, which may contain sensitive
   information, such as special interests, real identity, and crucial
   social relationships. To preserve the privacy of mobile users, we may
   apply the attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes to secure mobile
   users' location and their contents. Unfortunately, existing approaches
   fail to jointly consider the privacy of the past shared contents and the
   accessibility of the updated contents for non-revoked users. In this
   paper, we propose a privacy-preserving revocable content sharing scheme
   in geosocial networks. Our scheme allows mobile users to share their
   encrypted location-based contents on an untrusted server without
   revealing actual location information, and further enables other mobile
   users who physically check in at the particular location to search and
   decrypt the content if they have the corresponding attributes.
   Importantly, to secure mobile users' past shared contents and the
   corresponding location information, we design an efficient ciphertext
   update scheme to allow encrypted shared contents to be periodically
   updated and become inaccessible to revoked users. By trace-driven
   simulations, we show both the efficiency and privacy preservation of the
   proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In a power system, it would be valuable to obtain reliable estimates of
   the electromechanical modes in real time. This requires that the system
   has been properly modeled. The model becomes inappropriate when there is
   a mismatch between the assumed model and the true system, e.g. when
   model parameters are not carefully chosen or when the power system
   experiences unexpected changes. Therefore, model validation is equally
   important for it can indicate the validity of the model, and thus, the
   modal estimation. To carry out model validation, this paper proposes a
   recursive whiteness testing method that exploits the statistical
   property of residuals. Compared to the conventional whiteness testing
   method, the new approach is better at tracking the model behavior in
   real time. Tests have been performed on simulation models under
   different conditions.}},
