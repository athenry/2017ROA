Abstract = {{We investigated the molecular binding of n-alkanes on Pd(111) and
   PdO(101) using conventional density functional theory (DFT) and the
   dispersion-corrected DFT-D3 method. In agreement with experimental
   findings, DFT-D3 predicts that the n-alkane desorption energies scale
   linearly with the molecule chain length on both surfaces, and that
   n-alkanes bind more strongly on PdO(101) than on Pd(111). The desorption
   energies computed using DFT-D3 are slightly higher than the measured
   values for n-alkanes on Pd(111), though the agreement between
   computation and experiment is a significant improvement over
   conventional DFT. The measured desorption energies of n-alkanes on
   PdO(101) and the energies computed using DFT-D3 agree to within better
   than 2.5 kJ/mol (<5\%) for chain lengths up to n-butane. The DFT-D3
   calculations predict that the molecule-surface dispersion energy for a
   given n-alkane is similar in magnitude on Pd(111) and PdO(101), and that
   dative bonding between the alkanes and coordinatively unsaturated Pd
   atoms is primarily responsible for the enhanced binding of n-alkanes on
   PdO(101). From analysis of the DFT-D3 results, we estimate that the
   strength of an alkane eta(2)(H, H) interaction on PdO(101) is similar to
   16 kJ/mol, while a single eta(1) H-Pd dative bond is worth about 10
   kJ/mol. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We report the achievement of effective sterilization of exemplary
   bacteria including Escherichia coli and Geobacillus stearothermophilus
   spores on a digital versatile disc (DVD). The spiral arrangement of
   aluminum-covered pits generates strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR)

   that could even damage the DVD plastics. Localized protein denaturation
   and high sterilization efficiency have been demonstrated by using a

Abstract = {{Metal to graphene nanoribbon (GNR) contact is explored by

Abstract = {{We investigated the adsorption of CO2 on PdO(101) using
   temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and dispersion-corrected density
   functional theory calculations (DFT-D3). We find that CO2 desorbs from
   PdO(101) in two main TPD peaks (epsilon(1) and epsilon(2)) centered at
   similar to 176 and 120 K and estimate that the average binding energies
   in the epsilon(1) and epsilon(2) states are 54 +/- 8 and 37 +/- 5 kJ/mob
   respectively. The CO2 layer saturates on PdO(101) at a total coverage of
   similar to 0.47 monolayer (ML), with the CO2 molecules distributed
   nearly evenly between the two adsorbed states. TPD experiments of CO2
   adsorption onto preadsorbed layers of pure O-18(2) and H2O provide
   evidence that the epsilon(1) and epsilon(2) states correspond to CO2
   molecules adsorbed on the coordinatively unsaturated (cus) vs saturated
   (40 Pd sites of the PdO(101) surface, respectively. DFT-D3 calculations
   predict CO2 saturation coverages and binding energies on PdO(101) that
   agree well with our experimental estimates. The calculations suggest
   that CO2 prefers to adsorb initially on a cus-Pd site in an upright,
   linear configuration and that CO2 dialers and trimers form on the cus-Pd
   row as the CO2 coverage increases. The dimers and trimers consist of CO2
   molecules adsorbed in alternating bent and linear geometries. The
   calculations predict that CO2 trimers saturate the cus-Pd row at a
   coverage of 0.26 ML and that further increases in coverage cause CO2 to
   physisorb on the 4f-Pd sites until the CO2 layer saturates at a total
   coverage of 0.52 ML. DFT-D3 indicates that dispersion and electrostatic
   interactions govern the binding of CO2 on the cus-Pd rows of PdO(101).}},

   2,7-bis(phenyl-m-toluylamino)fluorene (TPF) functionalized polyolefins

   materials is straightforward, requiring only three or four steps,
   depending on the polymer, and final isolated yields over all steps

   materials exhibit charge-carrier mobilities that can be controlled over
   3 orders of magnitude by variation of the number of intermediary carbons
   (spacer length) between the pendant TPF groups. The range of hole
   mobilities encompasses the electron mobilities of common electron
   transport materials/emitters such as Alq(3) and PBD, thus, affording the
   opportunity to fabricate electroactive polyolefin based PLEDs with well

Abstract = {{Reference evapotranspiration and solar radiation estimation methods that
   use only measured temperature have been demonstrated to require regional
   calibration for acceptable performance. This study was conducted to
   evaluate regional calibration of incoming solar radiation and reference
   evapotranspiration in Florida, USA. Using satellite-derived estimates of
   solar radiation and reference evapotranspiration as the standard for
   comparison, regional calibration of the Hargreaves-Samani solar
   radiation model and the Turc temperature-based reference
   evapotranspiration equation were evaluated using monthly temperature
   data from 22 weather stations in Florida. Station-specific and regional
   calibration of the Hargreaves-Samani solar radiation model was found to
   produce comparable results, indicating the validity of this approach in
   regional calibration of radiation estimates. Using the regionally
   calibrated radiation estimates, the original Turc equation was found to
   underestimate reference evapotranspiration, indicating an overall
   negative bias for the equation in the region. Using the regionally
   calibrated radiation estimates with the calibrated Turc equation was
   found to produce comparable error but considerably lower bias compared
   to the original Turc equation and the original Hargreaves-Samani solar
   radiation model using coefficients recommended by the Food and

Abstract = {{The objective of this project was to determine if automatic residential
   irrigation systems with soil moisture sensor irrigation controllers
   could reduce irrigation water application while maintaining acceptable
   turfgrass quality as successfully in homes as in plot studies. Research
   was conducted on-site at cooperating homes (n = 58) in southwest
   Florida. Experimental treatments were (1) automatic timer with
   integration of bypass soil moisture sensor control system, (2) automatic
   timer with rain sensor and educational materials, (3) automatic timer
   with rain sensor, and (4) automatic timer only (typical for the region).
   Irrigation application, frequency, quarterly turf quality ratings, and
   weather data were collected over 26 months. Homes with soil moisture
   sensor irrigation controllers bypassed unneeded events during both rainy
   and dry periods, averaging 2 irrigation events per month; all other
   treatments averaged 4.5-6 events per month. Reduction in number of
   irrigation events by soil moisture sensor control systems resulted in
   significant savings, with 65\% cumulative reduction compared to homes
   with typical timer irrigation control. Observed on-site savings were
   comparable to previous plot research, indicating that plot savings could
   be scaled up so long as soil moisture control systems are installed and
   set properly. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000391. (C) 2012 American

   \{6,6\}-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). For inverted

   interlayers for the bottom cathode and the top anode respectively. To
   enhance the device performance, a thin film of 4,4',4

   used along with MoO3 as an anode interlayer to improve the hole
   extraction from the photoactive layer to the anode. The inverted polymer
   solar cells with double interlayer exhibit a higher power conversion
   efficiency of 6.45\% compared, to the I conventional cell of 491\% due
   to efficient charge extraction and favorable vertical morphology of

   indicate that the formation of band bending due to interlayer leads to
   the enhancement in hole extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Control of nanosystems with frictional dynamics using feedback control
   methods is important to a wide range of applications of nanotribology.
   This paper studies the tracking control problem of an array of
   nanoparticles moving on a substrate with friction between the substrate
   and the particles. The focus of this study is on control design and
   stability analysis. The major challenges in this problem include
   nonlinearities and uncertainties in the frictional dynamics and limited
   availability of measurable states in nanosystems. The particle-substrate
   interaction is considered to be unknown, and the unknown effect of
   unmodeled particle dynamics on the dynamics of the center of mass of the
   array is also considered. A nonlinear identifier is first developed to
   identify these unmodeled dynamics. A feedback controller is then
   developed based on the identifier to control the center of mass of the
   particles to track a desired trajectory. Boundedness of the closed-loop
   states and semiglobal asymptotic stability of the tracking error are
   proven using Lyapunov theory for the case of linear inter-particle
   interactions. An example with more general Morse-type inter-particle
   interactions is included to provide some level of confidence that the
   results are general but not assuredness that they are. Numerical
   simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the
   developed identification and control law. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We consider nonparametric adaptive spectral analysis of complex-valued
   data sequences with missing samples occurring in arbitrary patterns. We
   first present two high-resolution missing-data spectral estimation
   algorithms: the Iterative Adaptive Approach (IAA) and the Sparse
   Learning via Iterative Minimization (SLIM) method. Both algorithms can
   significantly improve the spectral estimation performance, including
   enhanced resolution and reduced sidelobe levels. Moreover, we consider
   fast implementations of these algorithms using the Conjugate Gradient
   (CG) technique and the Gohberg-Semencul-type (GS) formula. Our proposed
   implementations fully exploit the structure of the steering matrices and
   maximize the usage of the fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in
   much lower computational complexities as well as much reduced memory
   requirements. The effectiveness of the adaptive spectral estimation
   algorithms is demonstrated via several numerical examples including both
   1-D spectral estimation and 2-D interrupted synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR) imaging examples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a concurrent atomistic continuum (CAC) methodology
   for three-dimensional dynamic simulation of dislocation nucleation,
   migration and interaction. The method is based on a new continuum field
   formulation of balance laws with relevant atomistic information (the
   arrangements and interactions of atoms) considered. In this work, we
   show that the new CAC method allows the smooth passage of dislocations
   through sharp interfaces between the atomistic and the coarse-grained
   finite element domains without unphysical reflection of dislocations or
   the need for heuristic rules; meanwhile, complex dislocation phenomena
   such as dislocation nucleation, dynamic strain bursts associated with
   nucleation and migration avalanches, formations of Lomer-Cottrell locks,
   dislocation rigid boundary interactions, formation of intrinsic and
   extrinsic stacking faults, deformation twinning, and curved dislocation
   loops can be reproduced by the CAC method. All of the CAC simulations
   are directly compared with the corresponding atomic-level molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations. The efficiency, accuracy and potential
   applications of the method are discussed along with necessary additional
   development of criteria for coarse graining. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{This study numerically investigates methanol-steam reforming (MSR) in
   miniature annulus type reactors with reactant flow disturbance and hot
   gas flow heat supply. The reactant flow disturbance is created by
   placing baffle plates into an inner tube packed with catalyst particles
   and heated using hot gas flow in the gap between the inner and outer
   annulus tubes. It was found that the baffle plate increases the heat
   transfer area and creates flow fluctuations inside the catalyst bed,
   which lead to enhanced heat transfer between the hot gas and reactant
   flows and also leads to higher mass transfer inside the catalyst bed.
   The reactant flow temperature can be increased closer to the hot gas
   flow temperature, and the enhanced mass transfer between the catalyst
   particles and reactant flow stream leads to improved methanol conversion
   in the reformer. The pressure drop across the reactor was found to be
   not significantly influenced by the baffle plates in miniature scale
   reactors. It was also found that reducing the thermal resistance between
   the hot gas flow and reactant flow can further improve the methanol
   conversion.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical modeling and numerical simulation study has been carried
   out for a liquid hydrocarbon production system using syngas from biomass
   gasification. The system is based on a Fischer-Tropsch packed bed
   reactor with an external heat removal sink. To ensure the accurate
   prediction of exothermic heat release, the chemical reaction kinetics is
   modeled with a comprehensive product distribution scheme based on a
   novel carbon number dependent chain growth concept and stoichiometric
   relationship between the syngas and hydrocarbons produced. The
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis involves a three-phase phenomenon: gaseous
   phase-syngas, water vapor and light hydrocarbons; liquid phase-heavy
   hydrocarbon; solid phase-catalyst. A porous medium model has been used
   for the two-phase flow through an isotropic packed bed of spherical
   catalyst pellets. An Eulerian multiphase continuum model has been
   applied to describe the gas-liquid flow through the porous medium.
   Heterogeneous catalytic chemical reactions convert syngas into
   hydrocarbons and water. Intraparticle mass transfer limitation has also
   been considered in this model. Two independent validation cases have
   been demonstrated to show a successful implementation of the
   computational schemes. In this study, major attention has been paid to
   reactor temperature profiles because thermal management is highly
   important for the current exothermic catalytic reaction. We believe that
   our model could provide optimum operating conditions for achieving the
   maximum yield for desired products, liquid hydrocarbon fuels, without
   the thermal deactivation of the catalyst.}},

   impact to windows in hurricanes}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of losses during extreme events such as hurricanes is
   important for performance-based design of residential buildings. In this
   paper, a methodology for estimating the probability of debris impact,
   specifically roof sheathing panels, to windows as a result of hurricanes
   is introduced and applied to a series of illustrative examples. The
   methodology is a combination of approaches on flat plate trajectories,
   numerical hurricane modeling, and statistical analysis of structural
   capacity. Within this methodology, one can estimate the probability of
   impact for one or more windows in a certain house group as a hurricane
   approaches and passes on a deterministic track as defined by the center
   of its eye. The impact probability is analyzed for each hour making up
   the full hurricane duration rather than a single analysis using the
   blended (total) hurricane statistics. An illustration of the method is
   presented through an assessment of windborne debris impacts to windows
   in a house group located near the US Gulf coast using a hurricane having
   the same track as hurricane Katrina in 2005. As a result, the
   probability of each window being hit by a roof sheathing panel (RSP)
   during each hour of the hurricane as well as during each of the example
   hurricanes is presented. The results quantify the probability from hour
   to hour during a hurricane and will provide a more accurate estimate of
   the probability and timing of pressurization of buildings for total loss
   estimation including rainwater intrusion volumes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Fast implementations of the sparse iterative covariance-based estimation
   (SPICE) algorithm are presented for source localization with a uniform
   linear array (ULA). SPICE is a robust, user parameter-free,
   high-resolution, iterative, and globally convergent estimation algorithm
   for array processing. SPICE offers superior resolution and lower
   sidelobe levels for source localization compared to the conventional
   delay-and-sum beamforming method; however, a traditional SPICE
   implementation has a higher computational complexity (which is
   exacerbated in higher dimensional data). It is shown that the
   computational complexity of the SPICE algorithm can be mitigated by
   exploiting the Toeplitz structure of the array output covariance matrix
   using Gohberg-Semencul factorization. The SPICE algorithm is also
   extended to the acoustic vector-sensor ULA scenario with a specific
   nonuniform white noise assumption, and the fast implementation is
   developed based on the block Toeplitz properties of the array output
   covariance matrix. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the
   computational gains of the proposed methods. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society

Abstract = {{We have investigated the time evolution of a cloud of non-Brownian
   particles subjected to a periodic shear flow in an otherwise pure liquid
   at low Reynolds number. This experiment illustrates the irreversible
   nature of particulate systems submitted to a shear. When repeating the
   cycles of shear, we have found that clouds of particles progressively
   disperse in the flow direction until reaching a threshold critical
   volume fraction that depends upon the strain amplitude; this critical
   volume fraction coincides with measurements of the threshold for
   reversibility found from experiments on homogeneous suspensions in
   periodic shear. Two distinct patterns, including a ``galaxy-like{''}
   shape, are observed for the evolution of the clouds and the transition
   between the patterns is identified using a simple scaling analysis.

Abstract = {{In the present study, lanthanum (La) as a representative REE was used to
   explore the mechanisms for alleviation of Cd-induced oxidative damage by
   extraneous La at appropriate concentrations, and to assess ecological
   risk of combination of Cd and La at higher concentrations in roots of
   Vicia faba L. seedlings. The seedlings were hydroponically cultured for
   15 d under nutrient solution, 6 mu mol L-1 CdCl2, and combination of 6
   mu mol CdCl2 and increasing concentrations of La, respectively. The
   results showed that the supplementation with low concentrations of
   exogenous La (<120 mu mol L-1) led to reduced contents of Cd, Ca, Cu,
   Zn, Mn or Fe element and increased activities of superoxide dismutase
   (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and ascorbate
   peroxidase (APX) isozymes as well as heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70)
   production in the roots. However, the supplementation with higher La
   (>120 mu mol L-1) showed the adverse effects. The contents of Cd
   elevated above the single Cd treatment in the roots, accompanying with
   the decline of antioxidant isozyme's activities and HSP 70, and
   increment of carbonylated proteins and endoprotease isozyme's
   activities. The results also showed that the root growth was not only
   related to carbonylated proteins, but also to indole acetic acid oxidase
   activities. Therefore, the supplemented extraneous La contributed to
   biphasic effects: stimulated antioxidation at lower concentrations and
   pro-oxidation at higher concentrations against Cd-induced oxidative
   stress in the roots. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Problems of constructing a sediment budget for an inlet is often a
   challenge due to constraints on data collection, quality of data, and
   assumptions one is willing to consider. Existing literature does not
   provide a systematic foundation for equations considered and often
   engineers and geologists typically do not properly consider the
   mathematical constraints placed on the problem of sediment budget
   construction. The present technical note presents a simple methodology
   for assessing sediment budget, i.e. what is possible, and what is not
   possible via a matrix equation system and linear algebra. It is hoped
   that engineers and geologists will not impose unrealistic expectations
   on the sediment budget system via using such an approach. Some simple
   examples are given of both pitfalls and correct approaches to sediment
   budget development. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The 2009-2010 Data Fusion Contest organized by the Data Fusion Technical
   Committee of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society was focused
   on the detection of flooded areas using multi-temporal and multi-modal

   radar data were provided. The goal was not only to identify the best
   algorithms (in terms of accuracy), but also to investigate the further
   improvement derived from decision fusion.
   This paper presents the four awarded algorithms and the conclusions of
   the contest, investigating both supervised and unsupervised methods and
   the use of multi-modal data for flood detection. Interestingly, a simple
   unsupervised change detection method provided similar accuracy as
   supervised approaches, and a digital elevation model-based predictive
   method yielded a comparable projected change detection map without using

Abstract = {{In this paper we present and discuss selected results of our recent
   studies of sorbate self-diffusion in microporous materials. The main
   focus is given to transport properties of carbon molecular sieve (CMS)
   membranes as well as of the intergrowth of FAU-type and EMT-type
   zeolites. CMS membranes show promise for applications in separations of
   mixtures of small gas molecules, while FAU/EMT intergrowth can be used
   as an active and selective cracking catalyst. For both types of
   applications diffusion of guest molecules in the micropore networks of
   these materials is expected to play an important role. Diffusion studies
   were performed by a pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR technique that
   combines advantages of high field (17.6 T) NMR and high magnetic field
   gradients (up to 30 T/m). This technique has been recently introduced at
   the University of Florida in collaboration with the National Magnet Lab.
   In addition to a more conventional proton PFG NMR, also carbon-13 PFG

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with homogenization of a corrugated-core
   sandwich panel, which is a candidate structure for integrated thermal
   protection systems for space vehicles. The focus is on determining the
   local stresses in an integrated thermal protection system panel
   subjected to mechanical and thermal loads. A micromechanical method is
   developed to homogenize the sandwich panel as an equivalent orthotropic
   plate. Mechanical and thermal loads are applied to the equivalent thick
   plate, and the resulting plate deformations were obtained through a
   shear deformable plate theory. The two-dimensional plate deformations
   are used to obtain local integrated thermal protection system stresses
   through reverse homogenization. In addition, simple beam models are used
   to obtain local facesheet deformations and stress. The local stresses
   and deflections computed using the analytical method were compared with
   those from a detailed finite element analysis of the integrated thermal
   protection system. For the integrated thermal protection system examples
   considered in this paper, the maximum error in stresses and deflections
   is less than 5\%. This was true for both mechanical and thermal loads
   acting on the integrated thermal protection system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model for the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic
   response of endmills while considering the actual fluted cross-sectional
   geometry and pretwisted shape of the tools. The model is solved using
   the spectral-Tchebychev (ST) technique. The bending and the coupled
   torsional-axial behavior of four different fluted endmills is compared
   to finite element model (FEM) predictions and experimental results
   obtained using modal testing under free-free boundary conditions. For
   the first eight modes, including six bending and two torsional/axial
   modes, the difference between the 3D-ST and experimental natural
   frequencies is shown to be 3\% or less for all four tools tested during
   this study. For the same modes, the 3D-ST and FEM predictions agree to
   better than 1\%. To demonstrate its application, the 3D-ST model for the
   fluted section of a commercial endmill is coupled to the spindle-holder
   to predict the tool-point dynamics using receptance coupling
   substructure analysis (RCSA) with a flexible connection. The coupled
   model is validated through experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of finding a subnetwork in a given biological
   network (i.e. target network) that is most similar to a given small
   query network. We aim to find the optimal solution (i.e. the subnetwork
   with the largest alignment score) with a provable confidence bound.
   There is no known polynomial time solution to this problem in the
   literature. Alon et al. has developed a state-of-the-art coloring method
   that reduces the cost of this problem. This method randomly colors the
   target network prior to alignment for many iterations until a
   user-supplied confidence is reached. Here we develop a novel coloring
   method, named k-hop coloring (k is a positive integer), that achieves a
   provable confidence value in a small number of iterations without
   sacrificing the optimality. Our method considers the color assignments
   already made in the neighborhood of each target network node while
   assigning a color to a node. This way, it preemptively avoids many color
   assignments that are guaranteed to fail to produce the optimal
   alignment. We also develop a filtering method that eliminates the nodes
   that cannot be aligned without reducing the alignment score after each
   coloring instance. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally
   that our coloring method outperforms that of Alon et al., which is also
   used by a number network alignment methods, including QPath and QNet, by
   a factor of three without reducing the confidence in the optimality of
   the result. Our experiments also suggest that the resulting alignment
   method is capable of identifying functionally enriched regions in the
   target network successfully.}},

Abstract = {{The asymptotic many-server queue with abandonments, G/GI/N + GI, is

   number of servers and the offered load are related via the square-root
   rule, as the number of servers increases indefinitely. QED performance
   entails short waiting times and scarce abandonments (high quality)
   jointly with high servers' utilization (high efficiency), which is
   feasible when many servers cater to a single queue. For the G/GI/N + GI
   queue, we derive diffusion approximations for both its queue-length and
   virtual-waiting-time processes. Special cases, for which closed-form
   analysis is provided, are the G/M/N + GI and G/D/N + GI queues, thus
   expanding and generalizing existing results.}},

   butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was studied using X-ray photoemission

   We found that the vertical profile of the PDTS-BTD:PC71BM thin films
   varies, with a PC71BM rich region near the bottom surface and a polymer
   rich on the top surface. This suggests that the inverted device geometry
   may be superior to the conventional device geometry for the fabrication
   of efficient polymer solar cells. Significant enhancement in the power
   conversion efficiency (PCE) of an inverted polymer solar cell was
   observed compared to the conventional cell. The enhancement in device
   performance is attributed to the efficient charge extraction due to the

Abstract = {{Simulation modelers increasingly require greater flexibility for model
   implementation on diverse operating systems, and they demand high
   computational speed for efficient iterative simulations. Additionally,
   model users may differ in preference for proprietary versus open-source
   software environments. These issues necessitate the development of
   strategies to maximize model compatibility across operating systems, to
   ensure numerically accurate simulations for alternative compiler
   selections, and to understand how these choices affect computational
   speed. We developed an approach to evaluate model performance using
   diverse Fortran compilers on multiple computer operating systems. A
   single desktop computer with five identical hard drives was designed to
   permit meaningful comparisons between five operating systems while
   minimizing differences in hardware configuration. Three Fortran
   compilers and relevant software development tools were installed on each
   operating system. Both proprietary and open-source versions of compilers
   and operating systems were used. Compatibility and performance issues
   among compiler and operating system combinations were assessed for an
   example case: the Cropping System Model (CSM) as implemented in version
   4.5 of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT).
   A simulation study that included 773 simulations and assessed the full
   suite of crop growth modules within DSSAT-CSM was conducted for each
   compiler and operating system configuration. For a given simulation,
   results were identical for anthesis date (ADAT), maturity date (MDAT),
   and maximum leaf area index (LAIX) regardless of the compiler or
   operating system used. Over 94\% of the simulations were identical for
   canopy weight at maturity (CWAM) and cumulative evapotranspiration at
   maturity (ETCM). Differences in CWAM were predominantly less than 2 kg
   ha(-1) and were likely the result of differences in floating point
   handling among compilers. Larger CWAM discrepancies highlighted areas
   for improvement of the model code. Model implementations with the Intel
   Fortran compiler on the Linux Ubuntu operating system provided the
   fastest simulations, which averaged 9.0 simulations s(-1). Evaluating
   simulation models for alternative compiler and operating system
   configurations is invaluable for understanding model performance
   constraints and for improving model robustness, portability, usefulness,
   and flexibility. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   detection, and propagation/transmission delay emulation. We demonstrate
   the effectiveness of DRAGON by modeling a novel two-tier fault-tolerant

Abstract = {{Based on effective medium theory, the Bruggeman equation and
   Maxwell-Wagner (M-W) equation were applied to extract the permittivity
   of SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 powders in slurries with various solids loadings.
   It was found that the margin of error for the calculated permittivity
   broadened with decreasing solids loading and increasing powder
   permittivity. However, the margin of error for permittivity calculated
   from the Bruggeman equation is consistently smaller than that from the
   M-W equation. This smaller margin of error resulted in the applicability
   of the Bruggeman equation to extract the permittivity for all of the
   slurries in this work, in contrast to the M-W equation which is
   restricted to dilute SrTiO3 slurries. Therefore, for slurries of powders
   with high permittivity (e. g., BaTiO3) or slurries with high solid
   loading the Bruggeman equation is necessary instead of the M-W equation.}},

Abstract = {{Inverted polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells have received a great
   deal of attention because of their compatibility with large-scale
   roll-to-roll processing. The inverted cell geometry has the following
   structure: substrate (rigid or flexible)/indium tin

   layer/top anode. Solution-processed metal-oxide films, based on
   materials such as ZnO and TiO2, are typically used as the
   electron-transporting layers. Here, we demonstrate enhanced charge
   collection in inverted polymer solar cells using a surface-modified
   ZnO-polymer nanocomposite electron-transporting layer. Using this
   approach, we demonstrate inverted polymer solar cells based on a
   low-bandgap polymer with an alternating
   dithienogermole-thienopyrrolodione repeat unit (PDTG-TPD) with certified
   power conversion efficiencies of 7.4\%. To our knowledge, this is the

Abstract = {{A concept describing the nanostructure-directed dynamics of acid/base
   interaction and the balance between physisorption and chemisorption on
   an extrinsic semiconductor interface is evaluated and compared for n-
   and p-type semiconductors. The inverse hard/soft acid/base (IHSAB)
   concept, as it complements the HSAB concept, defines the nature of a
   dominant physisorption behavior and enables the creation of a matrix of
   controllable interactions. The technology results in the coupling of
   Lewis acid/base chemistry with the extrinsic semiconductor majority
   carriers. Nanoporous silicon layers facilitate the application of
   nanostructured metal/metal oxides, which provide sensitivity and
   selectivity for the modified interface. Applied fractional depositions
   can produce a dominant reversible physisorptive (sensors) or
   chemisorptive (microreactors) interaction at the semiconductor interface
   as the nanostructures act as antennas to focus the interaction. The
   dynamic natures of n- and p-type silicon are evaluated and compared, by
   focusing on the controlled manipulation of these semiconductors as they
   are modified with nanostructures and interact with the gas-phase
   analytes. The observed semiconductor responses correlate well with the
   temperature dependence of the extrinsic semiconductor, the population of
   the donor or acceptor levels, and the inherent mobilities of electrons.
   The response of the modified n-type semiconductors is found to exceed
   that of comparable p-type systems. The IHSAB concept can be extended to
   assess the properties of several additional semiconductor interfaces
   including nanowires. The results obtained not only pertain to sensor and
   microreactor array design, but also suggest the importance of the
   dynamic changes created, as the majority charge-carrier concentrations
   are manipulated and the Fermi energies are modified through chemical
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The upper GI tract and the colon are readily accessible
   endoscopically, but the small intestine is relatively difficult to
   evaluate.
   Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of using suction as a means of
   locomotion and to assess the initial design of a suction enteroscope.
   Design: Feasibility study.
   Setting: Animal laboratory.
   Intervention: Various prototype suction devices designed in our
   laboratory were tested in swine small intestine in a force test station.
   For in vivo experiments in live anesthetized animals, two suction
   devices (1 fixed tip and 1 movable tip) were attached to the outside of
   the endoscope. By creating suction in the fixed tip, the endoscope was
   anchored while the movable tip was advanced. Suction was then applied to
   the extended tip to attach it to the distal bowel. Suction on the fixed
   tip was then released and the movable tip with suction pulled back,
   resulting in advancement of the endoscope. These steps were sequentially
   repeated. Intestinal segments were sent for pathologic assessment after
   testing.
   Results: Force generated ranged from 0.278 to 4.74 N with 64.3 to 88 kPa
   vacuum pressure. A linear relationship was seen between the pull force
   and vacuum pressures and tip surface area. During in vivo experiments,
   the endoscope was advanced in 25-cm segmental increments with sequential
   suction-and-release maneuvers. No significant bowel trauma was seen on
   pathology and necropsy.
   Limitation: The enteroscopy system requires further refinement.
   Conclusion: A novel suction enteroscope was designed and tested. Suction
   tip characteristics played a critical role impacting the functionality
   of this enteroscopy system.}},

Abstract = {{The essential impediment to apply cognitive radio (CR) technology for
   efficient spectrum utilization lies in the uncertainty of licensed
   spectrum supply. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for
   spectrum harvesting and sharing, and investigate the joint routing and
   frequency scheduling problem in multi-hop cognitive radio networks
   (CRNs) under uncertain spectrum supply. We introduce a new service
   provider, Secondary Service Provider (SSP), to facilitate the accessing
   for secondary users (SUs). We model the vacancy of available bands with
   a series of random variables, and mathematically describe the
   corresponding frequency scheduling and flow routing constraints. From
   the SSP's point of view, we characterize the CRN performance with a pair
   of parameters (alpha, beta), and present an optimization problem to
   minimize the required network-wide spectrum resource at the (alpha,
   beta) level. Given that (alpha, beta) level is specified, we obtain a
   lower bound for the optimization problem and develop a threshold based
   coarse-grained fixing algorithm for a feasible solution. Simulation
   results show that i) for any (alpha, beta) level, the proposed algorithm
   provides a near-optimal solution to the formulated NP-hard problem, and
   ii) the (alpha, beta) based solution is better than the expected
   bandwidth based one in terms of blocking ratio and spectrum utilization

Abstract = {{Forward error correction (FEC) is commonly adopted in cooperative relay
   communications to ensure link-layer communication reliability. Among
   those schemes, rateless fountain codes, such as Luby Transform (LT)
   codes, are favorable for their low complexity and rate adaptability to
   channel fading dynamics. However, the cooperative transmission schemes
   based on primitive fountain codes induce either heavy computation cost
   or large end-to-end latency. To address these issues, we explore
   decomposed LT (DLT) codes, which comprise of two layers of random
   encoding but only a single layer of decoding. By implementing the two
   layers of encoding at the source and the relay(s) respectively, the
   cooperative system can ensure communication reliability on both
   source-relay and relay-destination links with reduced computation cost
   and latency. In this work, we first develop a general decomposition
   technique for the DLT code construction. Based on this, we further
   propose a hybrid decomposition algorithm tailored for LT codes with
   robust Soliton distribution (RSD). The resultant hybrid DLT (h-DLT)
   codes facilitate flexible computation cost allocation. The h-DLT codes
   based cooperative relay communication protocol is then developed and
   analyzed in terms of the transmission latency and energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the uncertainty surrounding the design of a mechanism which is

   directives in order to make them compatible with additional constraints
   imposed by such regulations. We present a modeling approach for
   greenhouse gas emissions quotas which can be incorporated into a
   stochastic dual dynamic programming algorithm, commonly used to solve
   the hydro-thermal scheduling problem. Our approach is flexible and
   capable of accommodating a detailed representation of emissions and
   related constraints. A case study based on the Guatemalan power system
   exemplifies the potential effects of considering these restrictions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a unit commitment problem with uncertain wind
   power output. The problem is formulated as a chance-constrained
   two-stage (CCTS) stochastic program. Our model ensures that, with high
   probability, a large portion of the wind power output at each operating
   hour will be utilized. The proposed model includes both the two-stage
   stochastic program and the chance-constrained stochastic program
   features. These types of problems are challenging and have never been
   studied together before, even though the algorithms for the two-stage
   stochastic program and the chance-constrained stochastic program have
   been recently developed separately. In this paper, a combined sample
   average approximation (SAA) algorithm is developed to solve the model
   effectively. The convergence property and the solution validation
   process of our proposed combined SAA algorithm is discussed and
   presented in the paper. Finally, computational results indicate that
   increasing the utilization of wind power output might increase the total
   power generation cost, and our experiments also verify that the proposed
   algorithm can solve large-scale power grid optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the speech-based gender identification
   problem. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of voice samples are
   typically used as the features for gender identification. However,
   MFCC-based classification incurs high complexity. This paper proposes a
   novel pitch-based gender identification system with a two-stage
   classifier to ensure accurate identification and low complexity. The
   first stage of the classifier identifies and labels all the speakers
   whose pitch clearly indicates the gender of the speaker; the complexity
   of this stage is very low since only threshold-based decision rule on a
   scalar (i.e., pitch) is used. The ambiguous voice samples from all the
   other speakers (which cannot be classified with high accuracy by the
   first stage, and can be regarded as suspicious speakers or difficult
   cases) are forwarded to the second-stage for finer examination; the
   second-stage of our classifier uses Gaussian Mixture Model to accurately
   isolate voice samples based on gender. Experiment results show that our
   system is speech language/content independent, microphone independent,
   and robust against noisy recording conditions. Our system is extremely
   accurate with probability of correct classification of 98.65\%, and very
   efficient with about 5?s required for feature extraction and
   classification. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Flushing is a very complicated process in estuarine environments. In
   order to examine the effects of tidal amplitude, river discharge, and
   stratification on the spatially varying flushing time of the Sumjin
   River Estuary (SRE), 24 longitudinal salinity transects were obtained
   during spring and neap tides from August 2004 to April 2007. The widely
   accepted freshwater fraction method has been used to calculate the
   flushing time for multiple estuarine segments using a spatially varying
   freshwater fraction. The effects of tidal amplitude, river discharge,
   and stratification on estuarine flushing were identified reasonably well
   by the spatially varying time scale. The flushing time appears to be
   close to the semidiurnal (M-2) tidal period during spring tide, but it
   is twice as long during a neap tide near the mouth. The flushing time
   increases in the central regions with a decrease in the tidal amplitudes
   and reduces in the inner-most regions owing to the strong influence of
   gravitational circulation. A linear function negatively relates
   estuarine flushing to the tidal amplitudes near the mouth of the
   estuary, whereas a power-law function relates estuarine flushing to the
   freshwater inflow near the head. In addition, strong stratification
   induced by freshwater discharge and small tidal amplitude exerts
   dominant control to reduce the estuarine flushing in the central and
   upper regions of the estuary during a neap tide.}},

Abstract = {{Colloid retention mechanisms in partially saturated porous media are
   currently being researched with an array of visualization techniques.
   These visualization techniques have refined our understanding of colloid
   movement and retention at the pore scale beyond what can be obtained
   from breakthrough experiments. One of the remaining questions is what
   mechanisms are responsible for colloid immobilization at the triple
   point where air, water, and soil grain meet. The objective of this study
   was to investigate how colloids are transported to the air-water-solid
   (AWS) contact line in an open triangular microchannel, and then retained
   as a function of meniscus contact angle with the wall and solution ionic
   strength. Colloid flow path, meniscus shape and meniscus-wall contact
   angle, and colloid retention at the AWS contact line were visualized and
   quantified with a confocal microscope. Experimental results demonstrated
   that colloid retention at the AWS contact line was significant when the
   meniscus-wall contact angle was less than 16 degrees, but was minimal
   for the meniscus-wall contact angles exceeding 20 degrees. Tracking of
   individual colloids and computational hydrodynamic simulation both
   revealed that for small contact angles (e.g., 12.5 degrees), counter
   flow and flow vortices formed near the AWS contact line, but not for
   large contact angles (e.g., 28 degrees). This counter flow helped
   deliver the colloids to the wall surface just below the contact line. In
   accordance with DLVO and hydrodynamic torque calculations, colloid
   movement may be stopped when the colloid reached the secondary minimum
   at the wall near the contact line. However, contradictory to the
   prediction of the torque analysis, colloid retention at the AWS contact
   line decreased with increasing ionic strength for contact angles of
   10-20 degrees indicating that the air-water interface was involved
   through both counter flow and capillary force. We hypothesized that
   capillary force pushed the colloid through the primary energy barrier to
   the primary minimum to become immobilized, when small fluctuations in
   water level stretched the meniscus over the colloid. For large
   meniscus-wall contact angles counter flow was not observed, resulting in
   less colloid retention, because a smaller number of colloids were
   transported to the contact line. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Stabilized landfill leachate has previously been treated with activated
   carbon (AC); however, information on the selectivity of AC depending
   upon the pore size is minimal. Isotherm and kinetic experiments were
   conducted using three commercially available AC products, one
   micro-porous and two meso-porous. Equilibrium adsorption and
   intraparticle diffusion of organic matter from stabilized leachate was
   studied. Isotherm experimental data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich,
   and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models in non-linear forms. Of the three
   isotherm models, the Redlich-Peterson model provided the best fit to the
   experimental data and showed a similar organic matter adsorption
   capacity (approximately 0.2 g total organic carbon (TOG) g(-1) AC) for
   both microporous and meso-porous AC. The organic matter effective
   intra-particle diffusion coefficients (D-e) in both AC types were on the
   order of 10(-10) m(2) s(-1) for AC particle sizes greater than 0.5 mm.
   Mesa-porous ACs showed slightly higher D-e compared to micro-porous AC.
   Rapid small-scale tests showed a maximum of 80\% TOG removal from
   leachate by each AC investigated. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed a
   preferential adsorption of fulvic-type organic matter with an increase
   in empty bed contact time by each AC. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
   OBJECTIVES: To measure superior/inferior translation and external
   rotation of the humerus relative to the scapula during scapular plane
   abduction using 3-D/2-D model image registration techniques.
   BACKGROUND: Kinematic changes in the glenohumeral joint, including
   excessive superior translation of the humeral head and inadequate
   external rotation of the humerus, are believed to be a possible cause of
   shoulder impingement. Although many researchers have analyzed
   glenohumeral kinematics with various methods, few articles have assessed
   dynamic in vivo glenohumeral motion.
   METHODS: Twelve healthy males with a mean age of 32 years (range, 27-36
   years) were enrolled in this study. Fluoroscopic images of the dominant
   shoulder during scapular plane elevation were taken, and computed
   tomography-derived 3-D bone models were matched with the silhouette of
   the bones in the fluoroscopic images using 3-D/2-D model image
   registration techniques. The kinematics of the humerus relative to the
   scapula were determined using Euler angles.
   RESULTS: On average, there was 2.1 mm of initial humeral translation in
   the superior direction from the starting position to 105 degrees of
   humeral elevation. Subsequently, an average of 0.9 mm of translation in
   the inferior direction occurred between 105 degrees and maximum arm
   elevation. The average amount of external rotation of the humerus was 14
   degrees from the starting position to 60 degrees of humeral elevation.
   The humerus then rotated internally an average 9 degrees by the time the
   shoulder reached maximum elevation. These changes in superior/inferior
   translation and external/internal rotation were statistically
   significant (P<.001 and P = .001, respectively), based on 1-way
   repeated-measures analysis of variance.
   CONCLUSION: The observed glenohumeral translations and rotations
   characterize healthy shoulder function and serve as a preliminary

Abstract = {{Spectrum auction is an enabling technology for improving the spectrum
   efficiency of unused licensed bands (white spaces) in wireless networks.
   However, the back-room dealing (i.e., the frauds of the untrustworthy
   auctioneer and the bid-rigging between the greedy bidders and the
   insincere auctioneer) poses serious security challenges, leading to
   failures of all existing secure auction designs in allocating spectrum
   bands. In this paper, we propose a secure combinatorial spectrum auction
   (SCSA) by utilizing homomorphic encryption to prevent the back-room
   dealing. The idea in SCSA is to incorporate cryptographic techniques
   into the spectrum auction to address the frauds and bid-rigging. It
   computes and reveals the results of spectrum auction while the actual
   bidding values of bidders are kept confidential. SCSA also provides a
   corresponding procedure in implementing the combinatorial spectrum
   auction under the interference constraints. We show that compared with
   existing secure spectrum auction designs against the untrustworthy
   auctioneer, SCSA is much more efficient in both communication and
   computational complexity; and compared with other spectrum auction
   designs with security consideration, SCSA can effectively thwart the
   back-room dealings due to the untrustworthy auctioneer without too much
   performance degradation.}},

Abstract = {{For piezoelectric-based, vibration energy harvesting systems, a
   simplified resonant model is typically used to represent the
   piezoelectric transducer. Furthermore, the total amount of harvested
   power is calculated assuming an ideal and lossless power converter. A
   coupled, system-level model is developed that includes parasitic losses
   in the power converter for a system comprised of a cantilevered
   transducer beam and pulsed resonant converter. The accuracy of the
   system-level model is validated with experimental data, and it is shown
   that the simplified resonant model under-predicts the total harvested
   power by approximately 30\% for the implemented system. In addition to
   capturing the electrical domain behavior of the system, the system-level
   model is also shown to accurately predict the effect of energy
   harvesting on the beam mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta (A beta) proteins accumulate in the
   cerebral vasculature and cause cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The
   objective of this study was to resolve critical formulation issues in
   developing nanoparticles (NPs) capable of permeating the blood brain
   barrier (BBB) and targeting cerebrovascular A beta proteins. To achieve
   this objective we designed immuno-nanovehicles, which are
   chitosan-coated poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs conjugated with
   a novel anti-A beta antibody. Measurements made according to
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory indicated that the
   immuno-nanovehicles have a much lower propensity to aggregate than the
   control nanovehicles. Immuno-nanovehicles showed enhanced uptake at the
   BBB and better targeting of the A beta proteins deposited in the CAA
   model in vitro in comparison with the control nanovehicles. In addition,
   chitosan enhanced aqueous dispersibility and increased the stability of
   immuno-nanovehicles during lyophilization, thus transforming them into
   ideal vehicles for delivering therapeutic and diagnostic agents to the
   cerebral vasculature ridden with vascular amyloid.
   From the Clinical Editor: In this study, the authors report the
   development of chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles conjugated with
   anti-amyloid antibody to be used as immuno-nanovehicles to image
   cerebral amyloid angiopathy deposits in vivo. This method enables
   delivering therapeutic and diagnostic agents to the cerebral vasculature
   ridden with vascular amyloid. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Under nonlinear road pricing (or tolling), the price charged is not
   strictly proportional to the distance travelled inside a tolling area,
   the generalized travel cost is not link-wise additive, and finding a
   user equilibrium distribution is typically formulated as a
   complementarity problem. The latter is a difficult problem to solve in
   mathematical programming. In this paper, we use piecewise linear
   functions to determine tolls and show that finding a user equilibrium
   distribution with such functions can be formulated as a convex
   optimization problem that is based on path flows and solvable by
   traditional algorithms such as simplicial decomposition. For area-based
   and two-part pricing schemes, the tolling function consists of only one
   linear piece and finding a user equilibrium distribution reduces to a
   convex optimization problem formulated in terms of link flows and
   solvable by any software for linearly constrained convex programs.
   To find an optimal pricing scheme, e.g., one that maximizes the social
   benefit, we formulate the problem as a mathematical program with
   equilibrium constraints, an optimization problem that is generally
   non-convex and difficult to solve. However, it is possible to use search
   algorithms to find an optimal scheme because the number of parameters in
   our piecewise linear function is few. To illustrate, we use a coordinate
   search algorithm to find an optimal two-part pricing scheme for a small
   network with randomly generated data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Toward the goal of reproducible live neuronal networks, we investigated
   the influence of substrate patterns on neuron compliance and network
   activity. We optimized process parameters of micro-contact printing for
   reproducible geometric patterns of 10 mu m wide lines of polylysine with
   4, 6, or 8 connections at a constant square array of nodes overlying the
   recording electrodes of a multielectrode array (MEA). We hypothesized
   that an increase in node connections would give the network more inputs
   resulting in higher neuronal outputs as network spike rates. We also
   chronically stimulated these networks during development and added
   astroglia to enhance network activity. Our results show that despite
   frequent localization of neuron somata over the electrodes, the number
   of spontaneously active electrodes was reduced 3-fold compared to random
   networks, independent of pattern complexity. Of the electrodes active,
   the overall spike rate was independent of pattern complexity, consistent
   with homeostasis of activity. Lower mean burst rates were seen with
   higher levels of pattern complexity; however, burst durations increased
   1.6-fold with pattern complexity (n = 6027 bursts, p < 0.001).
   Inter-burst interval and percentage of active electrodes displaying
   bursts also increased with pattern complexity. The extra-burst
   (non-burst or isolated) spike rate increased 4-fold with pattern
   complexity, but this relationship was reversed with either chronic
   stimulation or astroglia addition. These studies suggest for the first
   time that patterns which limit the distribution of branches and inputs
   are deleterious to activity in a hippocampal network, but that higher
   levels of pattern complexity promote non-burst activity and favor longer
   lasting, but fewer bursts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium bismuth titanate (NBT) ceramics are among the most promising
   lead-free materials for piezoelectric applications. This work reports
   the crystal structure and phase evolution of NBT and Fe-modified NBT
   (from 0-2 at.\% Fe) using synchrotron x-ray diffraction and Raman
   spectroscopy, at both ambient and elevated temperatures. The
   crystallographic results are discussed with reference to permittivity
   and piezoelectric thermal depolarization measurements of the same
   compositions. Changes in the depolarization temperature due to Fe
   substitution were detected by Raman spectroscopy and were found to
   correlate closely with depolarization temperatures obtained from
   converse piezoelectric coefficient and permittivity measured in situ.
   The depolarization temperatures obtained from direct piezoelectric
   coefficient measured ex situ as well as the phase transition
   temperatures obtained from synchrotron x-ray diffraction were found to
   be at higher temperatures. The mechanisms underlying the relationship
   between permittivity and piezoelectric depolarization to structural

Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Operation of a low wear (2 x 10(-5) mm(3)/(N-m)), low contact resistance
   copper sliding electrical contact was demonstrated. The wear rate of a
   lightly loaded copper-beryllium metal fiber sliding on a polished copper
   counterface was insensitive to (DC) current density values as great as
   440 A/cm(2) (in a brush positive or anodic configuration). Low wear and
   relatively low friction (mu similar to 0.2 to 0.3) was achieved by
   operating the contact immersed in a liquid medium consisting of a
   hydrofluoroether with helium cover gas, inhibitingoxidationand providing
   cooling of the contact. Similar experiments performed in liquid mediums
   of ultrapure water and dilute (3\%) hydrogen peroxide show an order of
   magnitude increase in wear rate and provide further insight on the role
   of electrochemically enhanced oxidation and the degraded contact
   resistance and tribological behavior of non-noble sliding electrical
   contacts in general. In contrast to high current density slidingin
   hydrofluoroether, an order of magnitude greater wear rate was observed
   for similar sliding conditionsin hydrogen peroxide or water without the
   aid of externally supplied electric potential. A conceptual model is
   proposed correlatingthe rate of brush wear to fatigue strength and
   electrochemically enhanced oxidation as a result of high current density
   transport through the contact. A mathematical expression was derived to
   calculate the approximate wear volume of a single fiber laterally
   contacting a slip-ring, based on direct measurement of the wear scar
   geometry. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1284-1292}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Lesion and functional brain imaging studies have suggested that there
   are two anatomically nonoverlapping attention networks. The dorsal
   frontoparietal network controls goal-oriented top-down deployment of
   attention; the ventral frontoparietal network mediates stimulus-driven
   bottom-up attentional reorienting. The interaction between the two
   networks and its functional significance has been considered in the past
   but no direct test has been carried out. We addressed this problem by
   recording fMRI data from human subjects performing a trial-by-trial cued
   visual spatial attention task in which the subject had to respond to
   target stimuli in the attended hemifield and ignore all stimuli in the
   unattended hemifield. Correlating Granger causal influences between
   regions of interest with behavioral performance, we report two main
   results. First, stronger Granger causal influences from the dorsal
   attention network (DAN) to the ventral attention network (VAN), i.e.,
   DAN -> VAN, are generally associated with enhanced performance, with
   right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), left IPS, and right frontal eye field
   being the main sources of behavior-enhancing influences. Second,
   stronger Granger causal influences from VAN to DAN, i.e., VAN -> DAN,
   are generally associated with degraded performance, with right
   temporal-parietal junction being the main sources of behavior-degrading
   influences. These results support the hypothesis that signals from DAN
   to VAN suppress and filter out unimportant distracter information,
   whereas signals from VAN to DAN break the attentional set maintained by
   the dorsal attention network to enable attentional reorienting.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents three-dimensional flow measurements performed on a
   dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) actuator with the electrodes in a
   serpentine design. Such a configuration induces a local pinching and a
   local spreading of the fluid as one follows along the span of the
   actuator. In this work two different variations on the serpentine
   configuration are evaluated: one constructed from patterned circular
   arcs and one from patterned rectangles. The influence of applied voltage
   is studied for the former case. To quantify these effects stereo
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used to generate time averaged,
   spatially resolved measurements of the detailed flow structure. The
   three components of the velocity vector are measured along spanwise and
   streamwise cuts. These slices are then reconstructed to provide a
   three-dimensional view of the induced flow field. The results for the
   induced flow fields are also compared with stereo-PIV measurements made
   on a standard linear DBD actuator. A truly three-dimensional induced
   flow field was observed as a result of the serpentine configuration.
   These designs could be beneficial for rapid mixing of the local fluid.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial biofilms are organized communities of cells living in
   association with surfaces. The hallmark of biofilm formation is the
   secretion of a polymeric matrix rich in sugars and proteins in the
   extracellular space. In Bacillus subtilis, secretion of the
   exopolysaccharide (EPS) component of the extracellular matrix is
   genetically coupled to the inhibition of flagella-mediated motility. The
   onset of this switch results in slow expansion of the biofilm on a
   substrate. Different strains have radically different capabilities in
   surface colonization: Flagella-null strains spread at the same rate as
   wild type, while both are dramatically faster than EPS mutants. Multiple
   functions have been attributed to the EPS, but none of these provides a
   physical mechanism for generating spreading. We propose that the
   secretion of EPS drives surface motility by generating osmotic pressure
   gradients in the extracellular space. A simple mathematical model based
   on the physics of polymer solutions shows quantitative agreement with
   experimental measurements of biofilm growth, thickening, and spreading.
   We discuss the implications of this osmotically driven type of surface
   motility for nutrient uptake that may elucidate the reduced fitness of
   the matrix-deficient mutant strains.}},

Abstract = {{The continuing search for relevant structure-property relationships in
   the area of organic electronics is expected to impact both intrinsic
   material performance capability and the viability of their
   implementation in a broad range of device applications. Cathodically
   coloring pi-conjugated polymer electrochromes represent a class of
   materials potentially attractive for low-cost and nonemissive flexible
   display devices including e-paper. Nonetheless, both the synthetic
   access to a full range of visible colors and the ability to produce
   solution-processable systems that switch rapidly and durably from a
   colored neutral state to a highly transmissive doped state upon
   electrochemical oxidation require that material structure-property
   relationships be carefully examined. In this report, we correlate
   molecular structure effects, redox properties, and electrochromic
   performance for a series of rationally designed neutral-state green
   polymers composed of electron-rich 3,4-dioxythiophene (DOT) units and
   the electron-deficient core 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD). While
   homopolymers synthesized from 3,4-alkylenedioxy-bridged monomers
   including 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and
   3,4-propylenedioxythiophenes (ProDOT) have shown particularly desirable
   redox-switching properties in the early years of electrochromic polymer
   development, their ``unbridged{''} dialkoxythiophene counterparts
   (DalkOTs) have not raised the same initial interest. Herein, it is shown
   that low band gap systems relying on DalkOT units and electron-deficient
   BTD cores could represent viable alternatives to their ProDOT-based
   counterparts in electrochemical devices involving green-to-transmissive
   switching electrochromes. Interestingly, provided the set of materials
   examined in this study, the long-term switching stability of the
   ProDOT-co-BTD system remains superior to that of its polymeric analog
   relying on DalkOTs - exhibiting less than 15\% loss of contrast over
   20,000 switching cycles (atmospheric conditions). Long-term cycle life
   is further demonstrated in a window-type device integrating the
   ProDOT-co-BTD system. DFT calculations performed at the
   B3LYP/6-31G{*}{*} level suggest subtle variations in the energy-band
   structure of the polymer repeat-units and predict the existence of the
   dual band of optical absorption exhibited by the low-band gap polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Acyclic diene metathesis polymerization (ADMET) was used to synthesize a
   series of perfectly regioregular polyolefins, in which the number of
   backbone atoms between pendant terfluorene groups was precisely
   controlled at 8, 14, or 20 carbons. Analogous random copolymers
   containing identical chromophore densities were also synthesized to
   study the impact of regioregularity on the performance of this class of
   materials in polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs). Additionally, the
   backbone alkene remnants of ADMET were saturated to generate materials
   with somewhat different ordering. These saturated derivatives led to
   improvements in PLED external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) over their
   unsaturated analogues in most cases, with a large improvement in one
   material. Charge mobility, as manifested in current density during PLED
   characterization, and relative solid-state fluorescence quantum yield
   (Phi(F)) also exhibit reasonable dependencies, with longer distances
   between electroactive groups yielding lower PLED current densities and
   higher Phi(F). Regioregularity has the opposite effect, giving rise to
   higher current densities and lower Phi(F) as compared to regiorandom
   analogues.}},

Abstract = {{We report the simultaneous achievement of sensitive surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing
   using digital versatile discs (DVDs). The aluminum-covered data tracks
   of DVDs can efficiently concentrate local electromagnetic field,
   resulting in an excellent SPR medium (with sensitivity of similar to 850
   nm per refractive index unit which is higher than that of most available
   nanofabricated plasmonic substrates) with a small but measurable SERS
   enhancement. The SPR sensitivity and the optical spectra, as well as the
   distribution of electric field amplitude, are simulated using a
   finite-difference time-domain model. The theoretical predictions agree
   reasonably well with the experimental results. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Secondary neutron fluence created during proton therapy can be a
   significant source of radiation exposure in organs distant from the
   treatment site, especially in pediatric patients. Various published
   studies have used computational phantoms to estimate neutron equivalent
   doses in proton therapy. In these simulations, whole-body patient
   representations were applied considering either generic whole-body
   phantoms or generic age-and gender-dependent phantoms. No studies to
   date have reported using patient-specific geometry information. The
   purpose of this study was to estimate the effects of patient-phantom
   matching when using computational pediatric phantoms. To achieve this
   goal, three sets of phantoms, including different ages and genders, were
   compared to the patients' whole-body CT. These sets consisted of
   pediatric age-specific reference, age-adjusted reference and
   anatomically sculpted phantoms. The neutron equivalent dose for a subset
   of out-of-field organs was calculated using the GEANT4 Monte Carlo
   toolkit, where proton fields were used to irradiate the cranium and the
   spine of all phantoms and the CT-segmented patient models. The maximum
   neutron equivalent dose per treatment absorbed dose was calculated and
   found to be on the order of 0 to 5 mSv Gy(-1). The relative dose
   difference between each phantom and their respective CT-segmented
   patient model for most organs showed a dependence on how close the
   phantom and patient heights were matched. The weight matching was found
   to have much smaller impact on the dose accuracy except for very heavy
   patients. Analysis of relative dose difference with respect to height
   difference suggested that phantom sculpting has a positive effect in
   terms of dose accuracy as long as the patient is close to the 50th
   percentile height and weight. Otherwise, the benefit of sculpting was
   masked by inherent uncertainties, i.e. variations in organ shapes, sizes
   and locations. Other sources of uncertainty included errors associated
   with beam positioning, neutron weighting factor definition and organ
   segmentation. This work demonstrated the importance of hybrid phantom
   height matching for more accurate organ dose calculation in proton
   therapy and the potential limitations of reference phantoms released by
   regulatory bodies for radiation therapy applications.}},

Abstract = {{Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) has received increasing
   attention in recent years due to ongoing military operations in Iraq and
   Afghanistan. Sudden impacts or explosive blasts generate stress and
   pressure waves that propagate at high velocities and affect sensitive
   neurological tissues. The immediate soft tissue response to these stress
   waves is difficult to assess using current in vivo imaging technologies.
   However, these stress waves and resultant stretching and shearing of
   tissue within the nano- to microsecond time scale of blast and impact
   are likely to cause initial injury. To visualize the effects of stress
   wave loading, we have developed a new ex vivo model in which living
   tissue slices from rat brain, attached to a ballistic gelatin substrate,
   were subjected to high-strain-rate loads using a polymer split Hopkinson
   pressure bar (PSHPB) with real-time highspeed imaging. In this study,
   average peak fluid pressure within the test chamber reached a value of
   1584 +/- 63.3 psi. Cavitation due to a trailing underpressure wave was
   also observed. Time-resolved images of tissue deformation were collected
   and large maximum eigenstrains (0.03-0.42), minimum eigenstrains (-0.33
   to -0.03), maximum shear strains (0.09-0.45), and strain rates
   (8.4x10(3)/sec) were estimated using digital image correlation (DIC).
   Injury at 4 and 6 h was quantified using Fluoro-Jade C. Neuronal injury
   due to PSHPB testing was found to be significantly greater than injury
   associated with the tissue slice paradigm alone. While large pressures
   and strains were encountered for these tests, this system provides a
   controllable test environment to study injury to submerged brain slices
   over a range of strain rate, pressure, and strain loads.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of electrochromism and electroluminescence in functional
   materials could lead to single-layer dual
   electrochromic/electroluminescent (EC/EL) display devices, capable of
   simultaneous operation in emissive and reflective modes. Whereas such
   next generation displays could provide optimal visibility in any ambient
   lighting situation, materials available that exhibit such
   characteristics in the active layer are limited due to the required
   intrinsic multifunctionality (i.e., redox activity, electroluminescence,
   electrochromism, and ion conductivity) and to date can only be achieved
   via the rational design of ionic transition-metal I complexes. Reported
   herein is the synthesis and characterization of a new family of
   acrylate-containing ruthenium (tris)bipyridine-based coordination
   complexes with multifunctional characteristics. Potential use of the
   presented compounds in EC/EL devices is established, as they are applied
   as cross-linked electrochromic films and electrochemiluminescent layers
   in light-emitting electrochemical cell devices. Electrochromic switching
   of the polymeric networks between yellow, orange, green, brown and
   transmissive states is demonstrated, and electrochemiluminescent devices
   based on the complexes synthesized show red-orange to deep red emission
   with lambda(max) ranging from 680 to 722 nm and luminance up to 135
   cd/m(2). Additionally, a dual EC/EL device prototype is presented where
   light emission and multicolor electrochromism occur from the same pixel
   comprised of a single active layer, demonstrating a true combination of
   these properties in ionic transition-metal complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Using current-voltage (I-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V), and
   electric-field-modulated Raman measurements, we report on the unique
   physics and promising technical applications associated with the
   formation of Schottky barriers at the interface of a one-atom-thick
   zero-gap semiconductor (graphene) and conventional semiconductors. When
   chemical-vapor-deposited graphene is transferred onto n-type Si, GaAs,
   4H-SiC, and GaN semiconductor substrates, there is a strong
   van-der-Waals attraction that is accompanied by charge transfer across
   the interface and the formation of a rectifying (Schottky) barrier.
   Thermionic-emission theory in conjunction with the Schottky-Mott model
   within the context of bond-polarization theory provides a surprisingly
   good description of the electrical properties. Applications can be made
   to sensors, where in forward bias there is exponential sensitivity to
   changes in the Schottky-barrier height due to the presence of absorbates
   on the graphene, and to analog devices, for which Schottky barriers are
   integral components. Such applications are promising because of
   graphene's mechanical stability, its resistance to diffusion, its
   robustness at high temperatures, and its demonstrated capability to
   embrace multiple functionalities.}},

Title = {{Transport of Topical Anesthetics in Vitamin E Loaded Silicone Hydrogel

Abstract = {{Transport of surface active anesthetic drugs through silicone hydrogel
   contact lenses containing nano-sized vitamin E aggregates is explored
   for achieving extended anesthetics delivery. Commercial silicone
   hydrogel contact lenses release most ophthalmic drugs including local
   anesthetics for only a few hours, which is not adequate. Here we focus
   on creating dispersion of highly hydrophobic vitamin E aggregates in the
   lenses as barriers for drug diffusion for increasing the release
   durations. This approach has been shown previously to be successful in
   extending the release durations for some common hydrophilic ophthalmic
   drugs. The topical anesthetic drugs considered here (lidocaine,
   bupivacaine, and tetracaine) are hydrophilic at physiologic pH due to
   the charge, and so these cannot partition into the vitamin E barriers.
   However, these surface active drug molecules adsorb on the surface of
   the vitamin E barriers and diffuse along the surface, leading to only a
   small decrease in the effective diffusivity compared to
   non-surface-active hydrophilic drugs. The drug adsorption can be
   described by the Langmuir isotherm, and measurements of surface coverage
   of the drugs on the vitamin E provide an estimate of the available
   surface area of vitamin E, which can then be utilized to estimate the
   size of the aggregates. A diffusion controlled transport model that
   includes surface diffusion along the vitamin E aggregates and diffusion
   in the gel fit the transport data well. In conclusion, the vitamin E
   loaded silicone contact lens can provide continuous anesthetics release
   for about 1-7 days, depending on the method of drug loading in the
   lenses, and thus could be very useful for postoperative pain control
   after corneal surgery such as the photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)
   procedure for vision correction.}},

Abstract = {{An optical coherence tomography (OCT) system employing a
   microelectromechanical system (MEMS) mirror was used to measure the
   refractive index (RI) of anatomically different regions in acute brain
   tissue slices, in which viability was maintained. RI was measured in
   white-matter and grey-matter regions, including the cerebral cortex,
   putamen, hippocampus, thalamus and corpus callosum. The RI in the corpus
   callosum was found to be similar to 4\% higher than the RIs in other
   regions. Changes in RI with tissue deformation were also measured in the
   cerebral cortex and corpus callosum under uniform compression (20-80\%
   strain). For 80\% strain, measured RIs increased nonlinearly by up to
   70\% and 90\% in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum respectively.
   Knowledge of RI in heterogeneous tissues can be used to correct
   distorted optical images caused by RI variations between different
   regions. Also deformation-dependent changes in RI can be applied to OCT
   elastography or to mechanical tests based on optical imaging such as
   indentation tests. (C)2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We report R-2 and R-2{*} in human hippocampus from five unfixed
   post-mortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) and three age-matched control
   cases. Formalin-fixed tissues from opposing hemispheres in a matched AD
   and control were included for comparison. Imaging was performed in a 600
   MHz (14 T) vertical bore magnet at MR microscopy resolution to obtain
   R-2 and R-2{*} (62 mu m x 62 mu m in-plane, 80 mu m slice thickness),
   and R-1 at 250 pm isotropic resolution. R-1, R-2 and R-2{*} maps were
   computed for individual slices in each case, and used to compare
   subfields between AD and controls. The magnitudes of R-2 and R-2{*}
   changed very little between AD and control, but their variances in the
   Cornu Ammonis and dentate gyrus were significantly higher in AD compared
   for controls (p<0.001). To investigate the relationship between tissue
   iron and MRI parameters, each tissue block was cryosectioned at 30 mu m
   in the imaging plane, and iron distribution was mapped using synchrotron
   microfocus X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. A positive correlation of
   R-2 and R-2{*} with iron was demonstrated. While studies with fixed
   tissues are more straightforward to conduct, fixation can alter iron
   status in tissues, making measurement of unfixed tissue relevant. To our
   knowledge, these data represent an advance in quantitative imaging of
   hippocampal subfields in unfixed tissue, and the methods facilitate
   direct analysis of the relationship between MRI parameters and iron. The
   significantly increased variance in AD compared for controls warrants
   investigation at lower fields and in-vivo, to determine if this
   parameter is clinically relevant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A new tri-electrode probe is presented and applied to local
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (LEIS) measurements. As opposed
   to two-probe systems, the three-probe one allows measurement not only of
   normal, but also of radial contributions of local current densities to
   the local impedance values. The results concerning the cases of the
   blocking electrode and the electrode with faradaic reaction are
   discussed from the theoretical point of view for a disk electrode.
   Numerical simulations and experimental results are compared for the case
   of the ferri/ferrocyanide electrode reaction at the Pt working electrode
   disk. At the centre of the disk, the impedance taking into account both
   normal and radial contributions was in good agreement with the local
   impedance measured in terms of only the normal contribution. At the
   periphery of the electrode, the impedance taking into account both
   normal and radial contributions differed significantly from the local
   impedance measured in terms of only the normal contribution. The radial
   impedance results at the periphery of the electrode are in good
   agreement with the usual explanation that the associated larger current
   density is attributed to the geometry of the electrode, which exhibits a
   greater accessibility at the electrode edge. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Activated carbon is known to adsorb aqueous Hg(II). MPAC (magnetic
   powdered activated carbon) has the potential to remove aqueous Hg to
   less than 0.2 mu g/L while being magnetically recoverable. Magnetic
   recapture allows simple sorbent separation from the waste stream while
   an isolated waste potentially allows for mercury recycling. MPAC
   Hg-removal performance is verified by mercury mass balance, calculated
   by quantifying adsorbed, volatilized, and residual aqueous mercury. The
   batch reactor contained a sealed mercury-carbon contact chamber with
   mixing and constant N-2 (g) headspace flow to an oxidizing trap. Mercury
   adsorption was performed using spiked ultrapure water (100 mu g/L Hg).
   Mercury concentrations were obtained using EPA method 245.1 and cold
   vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy. MPAC synthesis was optimized for
   Hg removal and sorbent recovery according to the variables: C:Fe,
   thermal oxidation temperature and time. The 3:1 C:Fe preserved most of
   the original sorbent surface area. As indicated by XRD patterns, thermal
   oxidation reduced the amorphous characteristic of the iron oxides but
   did not improve sorbent recovery and damaged porosity at higher
   oxidation temperatures. Therefore, the optimal synthesis variables, 3:1
   C:Fe mass ratio without thermal oxidation, which can achieve 92.5\% (+/-
   8.3\%) sorbent recovery and 96.3\% (+/- 9\%) Hg removal. The mass
   balance has been closed to within approximately +/- 15\%. (C) 2011

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 supported Mn-Ce mixed oxides (Mn-Ce/Ti) synthesized by an
   ultrasound-assisted impregnation method were employed to oxidize
   elemental mercury (Hg-0) at low temperatures in simulated low-rank
   (sub-bituminous and lignite) coal combustion flue gas and corresponding
   selective catalytic reduction (SCR) flue gas. The catalysts were
   characterized by BET surface area analysis. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The
   combination of MnOx and CeO2 resulted in significant synergy for Hg-0
   oxidation. The Mn-Ce/Ti catalyst was highly active for Hg-0 oxidation at
   low temperatures (150-250 degrees C) under both simulated flue gas and
   SCR flue gas. The dominance of Mn4+ and the presence of Ce3+ on the
   Mn-Ce/Ti catalyst were responsible for its excellent catalytic
   performance. Hg-0 oxidation on the Mn-Ce/Ti catalyst likely followed the
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where reactive species on catalyst
   surface react with adjacently adsorbed Hg-0 to form Hg2+. NH3 consumed
   the surface oxygen and limited the adsorption of Hg-0, hence inhibiting
   Hg-0 oxidation over Mn-Ce/Ti catalyst. However, once NH3 was cut off,
   the inhibited mercury oxidation activity could be completely recovered
   in the presence of O-2. This study revealed the possibility of
   simultaneously oxidizing Hg-0 and reducing NOx at low flue gas
   temperatures. Such knowledge is of fundamental importance in developing
   effective and economical mercury and NOx control technologies for
   coal-fired power plants. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in coastal habitats due to sea-level rise provide an uncertain,
   yet significant threat to shoreline dependent birds. Rising sea levels
   can cause habitat fragmentation and loss which can result in
   considerable reduction in their foraging and nesting areas.
   Computational models and their algorithmic assumptions play an integral
   role in exploring potential mitigation responses to uncertain and
   potentially adverse ecological outcomes. The presence of uncertainty in
   metapopulation models is widely acknowledged but seldom considered in
   their development and evaluation, specifically the effects of uncertain
   model inputs on the model outputs. This paper was aimed to (1) quantify
   the contribution of each uncertain input factor to the uncertainty in
   the output of a metapopulation model which evaluated the effects of
   long-term sea-level rise on the population of Snowy Plovers (Charadrius
   alexandrinus) found in the Gulf Coast of Florida, and (2) determine the
   ranges of model inputs that produced a specific output for the purpose
   of formulating environmental management decisions. This was carried out
   by employing global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (GSA) using two
   generic (model independent) methods, the qualitative screening Morris
   method and a quantitative variance-based Sobol' method coupled with
   Monte Carlo filtering. The analyses were applied to three density
   dependence scenarios: assuming a ceiling-type density dependence,
   assuming a contest-type density dependence, and assuming that density
   dependence is uncertain as to being ceiling- or contest-dependent. The
   sources of uncertainty in the outputs depended strongly on the type of
   density dependence considered in the model. In general, uncertainty in
   the outputs highly depended on the uncertainty in stage matrix elements
   (fecundity, adult survival, and juvenile survival), dispersal rate from
   central areas with low current populations (the ``Big Bend{''} area of
   Florida) to the northern, panhandle populations, the maximum growth
   rate, and density dependence type. Our results showed that increasing
   the maximum growth rate to a value of 1.2 or larger will increase the
   final average population of Snowy Plovers assuming a contest-type
   density dependence. Results suggest that studies that further quantify
   which density dependence relationship best describes Snowy Plover
   population dynamics should be conducted since this is the main driver of
   uncertainty in model outcomes. Furthermore, investigating the presence
   of Snowy Plovers in the Big Bend region may be important for providing
   connection between the panhandle and peninsula populations. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown on SiC

   Proton irradiation at lower energy was found to degrade the direct

   higher-energy irradiation, because the energy loss component of the
   lower energy protons was larger than those of higher-energy protons in

Abstract = {{The vital sign, including respiration and heartbeat signal, can be
   detected through a non-contact Doppler radar. Since the harmonics and
   intermodulation products of the respiration are major interferences
   according to the previous researches, the heartbeat signal cannot be
   clearly identified without holding the breath, detected from back of the
   subject or just filtered to remove respiration signal. A synchronized
   motion technique (SMT) based on Doppler concept is proposed to suppress
   the interference from the respiration in non-contact heartbeat
   detection. The experiment results show that the SMT effectively improve
   the heartbeat-to-respiration ratio (HRR) up to 76 \% while subject kept
   normal breathing. The SMT mechanism is also analyzed through non-linear
   simulation which agrees well with the measurement data.}},

Abstract = {{New efficiency-improving technique applicable for all types of
   shunt-diode rectifier is presented. The proposed technique using a
   harmonic-termination circuit improves the efficiency of conventional
   shunt-diode rectifiers by nearly 10\% at 13.56 MHz. The efficiency of a
   shunt-diode rectifier was analyzed by using Fourier transform and it is
   concluded that the efficiency loss can be significantly reduced by using
   a series resonant circuit to terminate the 2nd harmonic component. The
   series harmonic-termination circuit consists of lumped components, so
   that the circuit size in MHz band can be smaller compared to a
   conventional shunt-diode rectifier with a lambda/4 stub line technique.
   In this paper, both theoretical analysis and experimental results are
   presented. The proposed circuit can be used for high efficiency and
   compact wireless power receivers to improve efficiency of emerging
   wireless power transmission or energy harvesting systems.}},

Abstract = {{Network traffic in the transport layer of end-to-end congestion networks
   plays a vital role in effecting the throughput in the Medium Access
   Control (MAC) layer. Common queue length management techniques on nodes
   in such networks focus on servicing the packets based on their Quality
   of Service (QoS) requirements (e. g., Differentiated-Services, or
   DiffServ, networks). In this paper, a continuous control strategy is
   suggested for a DiffServ network to track the desired ensemble average
   queue length level specified by the network operator. A Lyapunov-based
   stability analysis is provided to illustrate global asymptotic tracking,
   and simulations demonstrate the performance and feasibility of the
   controller, along with showing global asymptotic tracking of the queue
   lengths in the Premium Service buffer.}},

Abstract = {{There is significant recent interest in applying model-based control
   techniques to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. This requires
   a predictive model of the building's thermal dynamics. Due to the
   complexity of the underlying physical processes, usually system
   identification techniques are used to identify parameters of a
   physics-based model. We investigate the effect of various model
   structures and identification techniques on the parameter estimates
   through a combination of analysis and experiments conducted in a
   commercial building. We observe that a second order model can reproduce
   the input-output behavior of a full-scale model (with 13 states). Even a
   single state model has enough predictive ability that it may be
   sufficient for control purposes. We also show that the application of
   conventional techniques to closed-loop data from buildings (that are
   collected during usual operation) leads to poor estimates; their
   inaccuracy becomes apparent only when forced-response data is used for
   validation where there is sufficient difference among various inputs and
   outputs. The results of this investigation are expected to provide
   guidelines on do's and don'ts in modeling and identification of
   buildings for control.}},

Abstract = {{Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a potential control
   architecture for operating buildings in a more energy efficient manner.
   We study through simulations the effect of several sources of
   uncertainty that arise in the implementation of MPC on the energy
   consumption, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality (IAQ). These
   include occupancy profile, measurement errors and mismatch between the
   plant and its model that the control algorithm uses. Simulations are
   carried out for two extreme cases: a winter day with no solar load and a
   summer day with high solar load. The study shows that increasing
   fluctuations in occupancy, errors in measuring occupancy, and model
   mismatch have the strongest impact on the energy consumption. However,
   measurement errors in outside temperature and solar load does not have
   significant impact. Therefore, it is possible to improve the controller
   performance by using more accurate occupancy sensors. Furthermore,
   implementation cost can also be reduced by eliminating the sensors and
   prediction algorithms for predicting outside temperature and thermal
   loads without compromising the controller performance. Even with these
   uncertainties, MPC delivers 12-37\% reduction of energy use over
   conventional control methods without affecting thermal comfort and IAQ.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded systems increasingly combine multi-core processors and
   heterogeneous resources such as graphics-processing units and
   field-programmable gate arrays. However, significant application design
   complexity for such systems caused by parallel programming and
   device-specific challenges has often led to untapped performance
   potential. Application developers targeting such systems currently must
   determine how to parallelize computation, create different
   device-specialized implementations for each heterogeneous resource, and
   then determine how to apportion work to each resource. In this paper, we
   present the RACECAR heuristic to automate the optimization of
   applications for multi-core heterogeneous systems by automatically
   exploring implementation alternatives that include different algorithms,
   parallelization strategies, and work distributions. Experimental results
   show RACECAR-specialized implementations can effectively incorporate
   provided implementations and parallelize computation across multiple
   cores, graphics-processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays,
   improving performance by an average of 47x compared to a CPU, while the
   fastest provided implementations are only able to average 33x.}},

Abstract = {{Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been widely shown to have
   significant performance and power advantages compared to microprocessors
   and graphics-processing units (GPUs), but remain a niche technology due
   in part to productivity challenges. Although such challenges have
   numerous causes, previous work has shown two significant contributing
   factors: 1) prohibitive place-and-route times preventing mainstream
   design methodologies, and 2) limited application portability preventing
   design reuse. Virtual reconfigurable architectures, referred to as
   intermediate fabrics (IFs), were recently introduced as a potential
   solution to these problems, providing 100x-1000x place-and-route
   speedup, while also enabling application portability across potentially
   any physical FPGA. However, one significant limitation of existing
   intermediate fabrics is area overhead incurred from virtualized
   interconnect resources. In this paper, we perform design-space
   exploration of virtual interconnect architectures and introduce an
   optimized virtual interconnect that reduces area overhead by 48\% to
   54\% compared to previous work, while also improving clock frequencies
   by 24\% with a modest routability overhead of 16\%.}},

Abstract = {{A method of incorporating the multi-mixture pixel model into
   hyperspectral endmember extraction is presented and discussed. A vast
   majority of hyperspectral endmember extraction methods rely on the
   linear mixture model to describe pixel spectra resulting from mixtures
   of endmembers. Methods exist to unmix hyperspectral pixels using
   nonlinear models, but rely on severely limiting assumptions or
   estimations of the nonlinearity. This paper will present a hyperspectral
   pixel endmember extraction method that utilizes the bidirectional
   reflectance distribution function to model microscopic mixtures. Using
   this model, along with the linear mixture model to incorporate
   macroscopic mixtures, this method is able to accurately unmix
   hyperspectral images composed of both macroscopic and microscopic
   mixtures. The mixtures are estimated directly from the hyperspectral
   data without the need for a priori knowledge of the mixture types.
   Results are presented using synthetic datasets, of multi-mixture pixels,
   to demonstrate the increased accuracy in unmixing using this new
   physics-based method over linear methods. In addition, results are
   presented using a well-known laboratory dataset.}},

Abstract = {{The widely deployed electronic health (eHealth) systems changed people's
   daily life due to the extraordinary benefits, such as more efficiency,
   higher accuracy and broader availability. Patients in the eHealth
   network use their personal health records (PHRs) to communicate with
   their physicians and obtain medical services. As a matter of fact,
   patients who share the same diseases or symptoms want to communicate
   with each other not only for treatment, but also for psychological
   therapy. However, without sufficient knowledge of the authenticity of
   other patients' PHRs, patients are reluctant to share their medical
   information. On the other hand, patients would accept the
   patient-to-patient interaction only if their privacy issues of PHR are
   also well preserved. In this paper, we design a privacy-preserving
   user-centric private matching scheme from a social perspective in
   eHealth networks, where patients use verified PHR to find other patients
   who share the same situations and derive different user-centric results
   based on each one's own policy. In our scheme, the matching process
   guarantees both the verifiability and the privacy of patients' PHRs.
   Based on security and efficiency analysis, we show that our work
   satisfies both the privacy preservation and practicality requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and estimating the primary user (PU) behavior is critical to
   implement dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. In this
   paper, we investigate the estimation accuracy of the PU behavior based
   on the Markov model. Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation is employed to
   estimate the transition probabilities of the Markov model based on the
   sample sequence of PU idle/busy states. An approximate distribution of
   the ML estimator is derived to evaluate the estimation accuracy
   specified by the confidence level. To meet the requirement of estimation
   accuracy while reducing the unnecessary sensing time, we propose a
   learning algorithm which refines the estimation results iteratively. It
   dynamically estimates the required length of the sample sequence which
   is adaptive to the changing PU behavior. Numerical results show that the
   proposed estimation algorithm well tracks the variation of the PU
   behavior. Compared to the estimation method using fixed length of sample
   sequence, the proposed algorithm achieves the same requirement of the

Abstract = {{UWB receivers based on energy detection (ED) are often an excellent
   choice for short-range wireless applications that require low-power and
   low-complexity architectures. However, this type of receiver is very
   sensitive to channel noise as well as inter-symbol (ISI) and inter-frame
   (IFI) interference caused by multipath fading. Therefore, the
   integration window becomes an important design parameter since the noise
   energy, ISI, and IFI are proportional to the integration time. This work
   presents analytical expressions that are corroborated with simulations
   to determine the optimal integration time of an ED receiver employing
   pulse-position modulation. The equations presented in this work are
   especially helpful when designing a system since they simplify
   calculations and trade-off decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Network coding is widely recognized as a promising approach to increase
   the throughput of wireless networks. In order to maximize the benefit of
   network coding, the consideration of potential coding opportunities is
   incorporated into the route selection, which is referred to as
   coding-aware routing. Most of existing coding- aware routing metrics are
   designed based on traditional routing metrics like expected transmission
   count (ETX) and fail to take many critical factors into account, such as
   traffic load, link transmission rate and interference. Therefore, the
   routes discovered with them are always sub-optimal. In this paper, we
   present a novel routing metric called Coding-aware Path Transmission
   Time (CPTT). CPTT considers the effect of traffic load, multirate,
   intra-flow and inter-flow interference as well as network coding and
   quantifies them in a unified manner, which can be used to accurately
   evaluate path performance and discover the path with high throughput.
   Through extensive simulations, we compare CPTT with different coding-
   aware routing metrics proposed in the literature and show that the paths
   selected with CPTT have maximum end-to-end throughput under network
   coding.}},

Abstract = {{We consider here the flow instability that evolves during the
   spontaneous release of a high pressure gas mixed with small solid
   particles in a spherical shock tube representing a detonative
   combustion. Upon the release of the particle-laden high pressure gas
   contained in the small sphere, a primary shock and a secondary shock are
   formed. Two material interfaces develop between the two shocks: one
   between the gas-gas, as in the classical single-phase problem. The
   second one is between the pure gas and the mixture of gas and solid
   particles. Because of the density discontinuity, Rayleigh-Taylor-type
   instabilities may develop for both surfaces, which are studied herein
   using a high-order numerical scheme. The interaction mechanisms involved
   can influence the instability and control the efficiency of the
   combustion process.}},

Abstract = {{Structural design is an inverse problem where the geometry that fits a
   specific design objective is found iteratively through repeated analysis
   or forward problem solving. In the case of compliant structures, the
   goal is to design the structure for a particular desired structural
   response that mimics traditional mechanisms and linkages. It is possible
   to state the inverse problem in many different ways depending on the
   choice of objective functions used and the method used to represent the
   shape. In this paper, some of the objective functions that have been
   used in the past, for the topology optimization approach to designing
   compliant mechanisms are compared and discussed. Topology optimization
   using traditional finite elements often do not yield well-defined smooth
   boundaries. The computed optimal material distributions have shape
   irregularities unless special techniques are used to suppress them. In
   this paper, shape is represented as the contours or level sets of a
   characteristic function that is defined using B-spline approximation to
   ensure that the contours, which represent the boundaries, are smooth.
   The analysis is also performed using B-spline elements which use
   B-spline basis functions to represent the displacement field.
   Application of this approach to design a few simple mechanisms is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Most damage growth models require accurate stress intensity factor as
   well as model parameters for predicting damage growth. Depending on
   geometries and loading conditions, these models become complicated with
   additional model parameters. This paper shows that a simple model, such
   as the Paris model, can be used for complex geometries by compensating
   the error in stress intensity factor with the equivalent model
   parameters that are different from the true ones. Actual damage growth
   is simulated using the extended finite element method to model the
   effects of crack location and geometry on the relationship between crack
   size and stress intensity factor. The detection process of crack using
   structural health monitoring systems is modeled by adding random noise
   and a deterministic bias. The equivalent model parameters are then
   identified using the least-square-filtered Bayesian method, from which
   the remaining useful life is estimated. Using three examples, it is
   shown that the RUL estimates are accurate even when an inaccurate stress
   intensity factor is used.}},

Abstract = {{Monte-Carlo (MC) methods are often used to carry out reliability based
   design of structures. Methods that improve the accuracy of MC simulation
   include Separable Monte Carlo (SMC), Markov Chain Monte-Carlo, and
   importance sampling. We explore the utility of combining SMC and
   importance sampling for improving accuracy. The accuracy of the
   estimates is compared for crude MC, SMC, importance sampling and
   combined method for a composite plate example and a tuned mass damper
   example. For these examples SMC and importance sampling reduced the
   error individually by factors of 2 to 5, and the combination reduced it
   further by about a factor of 2. The results were also compared with the
   first order reliability method (FORM). FORM was grossly inaccurate for
   the tuned mass-damper example which has a failure region bounded by safe
   regions on either side.}},

Abstract = {{Squid and jellyfish generate propulsive forces by successively taking in
   and expelling high momentum jets of water This method of propulsion
   offers several advantages to underwater vehicles/robots. The driving
   mechanism can be placed internal to the vehicle, reducing the drag
   associated with an abundance of external thrusters and control surfaces.
   The thrusters can generate accurate predictable forcing in the low
   thrust range, while still generating. thrust nearly instantaneously over
   the entire force range. Vortex ring formation dynamics play an important
   role in creating thrust. It is observed that squid and jellyfish eject
   fluid jets which are not exactly parallel, and have a contracting
   velocity in the radial direction. A prototype thruster was developed
   which generates both parallel and converging propulsive jets. The total
   impulse of the jet is determined from DPN techniques to determine the
   effect a non-zero radial velocity had on thrust production. The radial
   velocity was observed to increase the total impulse of the jet by 70\%
   for low stroke ratio jets, and 75\% for large stroke ratio jets.}},

   Therefore, it is even more expensive to optimize considering the system

   optimization problem using surrogates into less expensive problems with
   fixed risk allocation for each failure mode. In addition, the fixed risk
   allocation problem is transformed from a purely probabilistic problem to
   a deterministic one through an iterative process of updating safety
   factors to limit the number of calls to evaluate the reliability. We

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to show equivalence between continuum and
   discrete formulations in sensitivity analysis when a linear velocity
   field is used. Shape sensitivity formulations are presented when the
   body forces and surface fractions depend on shape design variables.
   Especially, the continuum-discrete (C-D) and discrete-discrete (D-D)
   approaches are compared in detail. It is shown that the two methods are
   theoretically and numerically equivalent when the same discretization,
   numerical integration, and linear design velocity fields are used. The
   accuracy of sensitivity calculation is demonstrated using a cantilevered
   beam under uniform pressure and an arch dam crown cantilever under
   gravity and hydrostatic loading at the upstream face of the structure.
   It is shown that the sensitivity results are consistent with finite
   difference results, but different from the analytical sensitivity due to
   discretization and approximation errors of numerical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the control design and analysis of a nonlinear model
   of a MacPherson suspension system equipped with a magnetorheological
   (MR) damper. The model suspension considered incorporates the kinematics

   using an l(2)-gain analysis based on the concept of energy dissipation.
   The controller is effectively a smooth saturated PID. The performance of
   the closed-loop system is compared with a purely passive MacPherson
   suspension system and a semi-active damper, whose damping coefficient is
   tunned by a Skyhook-Acceleration Driven Damping (SH-ADD) method.
   Simulation results show that the developed controller outperforms the
   passive case at both the rattle space, tire hop frequencies and the
   SH-ADD at tire hop frequency while showing a close performance to the
   SH-ADD at the rattle space frequency. Time domain simulation results
   confirmed that the control strategy satisfies the dissipative
   constraint.}},

Abstract = {{The design of engineering systems is often based on analysis models with
   substantial errors in predicting failures, that is epistemic
   uncertainty. The epistemic uncertainty is reduced by post design tests,
   and the safety of unsafe designs restored by redesign. When this process
   of design, test and redesign is to be based on probabilistic analysis,
   there is some controversy on whether uncertainty associated with
   variability (aleatory uncertainty) should be treated differently than
   the epistemic uncertainty. In this paper we compare several approaches
   to design and redesign and treatments of the epistemic uncertainties.
   These include safety factors, probabilistic approach disregarding
   redesign and regarding redesign, treating epistemic uncertainty and
   aleatory uncertainty the same, and more conservative treatment of the
   epistemic uncertainty. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can
   allow tradeoff of system performance against development cost
   (probability of redesign), while a standard reliability based design
   optimization, which does not take into account future redesign, provides
   only a single point on the tradeoff curve. We also show that the
   tradeoff can be achieved even with the traditional safety factor
   approach, without any probabilistic optimization. Furthermore, we
   investigate different treatments of epistemic error for probability of
   failure calculation. We find that it is possible to design to the 95th
   percentile of the probability of failure with modest mass penalty
   compared to treating epistemic and aleatory uncertainty alike.}},

Abstract = {{Freeform surfaces, including the femoral components of knee prosthetics,
   present a significant challenge in manufacturing. The finishing process
   is often performed manually, leading to high variation in quality. This
   study proposes using Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) to finish the
   cobalt chromium (Co-Cr) alloy femoral components of knee prosthetics and
   varying the surface pattern to alter surface wettability, which
   influences the tribological properties of the surfaces. As a first step,
   flat workpieces of the same material were used in this paper. To obtain
   an understanding of the relationship-between surface pattern and
   wettability, two sets of finishing conditions were developed to yield
   two different surface patterns while maintaining roughness values (2-5
   nm Ra). One surface consists of long cutting marks exhibiting strong
   directionality, while the other consists of short, intermittent cutting
   marks. The surface with strong directionality resulted in an increased
   contact angle between the workpiece and de-ionized water (from 90.0
   degrees +/- 1.5 degrees to 93.8 degrees +/- 2.5 degrees), thus a
   decrease in wettability. The other surface showed a decreased contact
   angle (from 98.7 degrees +/- 5.3 degrees to 93.3 degrees +/- 3.7
   degrees), thus an increase in wettability. This study experimentally
   demonstrates the feasibility of MAF to alter surface pattern-and to
   potentially alter the wettability-while maintaining initial surface
   roughness at a nanometer scale.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the extension of the Lawn and Evans
   indentation fracture model, developed primarily for microscale contact,
   to nanoscale contacts. Systematic nanoindentation fracture experiments
   are performed on Si (100) using a sharp diamond cube corner (radius, r =
   32 rim) indenter as a function of load, load cycles, contact dimension,
   and contact separation. Atomic force microscopy is used to image and
   measure contact deformation and fracture. The experimental results show
   that the threshold load for fracture was 290 mu N, which is lower than
   previously reported. Adjacent indents separated by less than three times
   the radius of each indent were observed to interact with each other,
   such that, second indents were consistently deeper than the first at the
   same loads. There was an increase in crack length for pairs of indents
   that were separated by equally small distances (<3 indentation radii).
   These results have clear implications for nanofabrication where stress
   field interactions impose limits on the closeness (resolution) to which
   features can be generated and to free abrasive machining where stress
   field interactions enhance the ability to machine below the threshold
   load.}},

Abstract = {{A method of incorporating macroscopic and microscopic reflectance models
   into hyperspectral pixel unmixing is presented and discussed. A vast
   majority of hyperspectral unmixing methods rely on the linear mixture
   model to describe pixel spectra resulting from mixtures of endmembers.
   Methods exist to unmix hyperspectral pixels using nonlinear models, but
   rely on severely limiting assumptions or estimations of the
   nonlinearity. This paper will present a hyperspectral pixel unmixing
   method that utilizes the bidirectional reflectance distribution function
   to model microscopic mixtures. Using this model, along with the linear
   mixture model to incorporate macroscopic mixtures, this method is able
   to accurately unmix hyperspectral images composed of both macroscopic
   and microscopic mixtures. The mixtures are estimated directly from the
   hyperspectral data without the need for a priori knowledge of the
   mixture types. Results are presented using synthetic datasets, of
   macroscopic and microscopic mixtures, to demonstrate the increased
   accuracy in unmixing using this new physics-based method over linear
   methods. In addition, results are presented using a well-known
   laboratory dataset. Using these results, and other published results
   from this dataset, increased accuracy in unmixing over other nonlinear
   methods is shown.}},

Abstract = {{A bubble pump is a key component for diffusion-absorption refrigeration
   systems operating at a single pressure. Nevertheless, research focusing
   on bubble pumps is not widely found in the literature. In this study, a
   bubble pump model with a shape of vertical tube subjected to a uniform
   heat flux from the tube outer surface is numerically simulated. A
   saturated ammonia-water solution enters the bubble pump inlet and
   receives heat from the pump wall along the entire pump length. During
   the process, most of the ammonia in the solution vaporizes, and the
   remaining solution is lifted by the buoyant force created by the ammonia
   vapor. A numerical model was implemented by employing a commercial CFD
   code. The applicability of the numerical model implemented in the code
   to the present numerical simulations was validated through a comparative
   study referring to experimental data of a boiling phase change flow of
   water in a vertical pipe being subjected to a uniform heat flux. To
   investigate the influence of the bubble pump's geometrical dimension and
   the heat input on the operating status and performance, numerical
   simulations were performed for four bubble pumps with different
   diameters subjected to five amounts of heat flux. Simulation results are
   provided in terms of the flow parameters including void fraction, and
   vapor and liquid velocities. The simulated spatial distributions of the
   flaw parameters were found to have steep gradients in the radial
   direction near the pump wall due to the heating from the pump wall. In
   addition, simulated flow parameters were compared to those in previous
   one-dimensional (1-D) work for the same problem. It was found that the
   void fraction profiles along the pump length simulated in this study
   seem to be similar to those in 1-D models, but somewhat different
   quantitatively. Based on the results, the present numerical simulation
   model of the bubble pump is considered to be useful for certain
   industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{With their blistering expansions in recent years, popular online social
   sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Bebo, have become some of the major
   news sources as well as the most effective channels for viral marketing
   nowadays. However, alongside these promising features comes the threat
   of misinformation propagation which can lead to undesirable effects,
   such as the widespread panic in the general public due to faulty swine
   flu tweets on Twitter in 2009. Due to the huge magnitude of online
   social network (OSN) users and the highly clustered structures commonly
   observed in these kinds of networks, it poses a substantial challenge to
   efficiently contain viral spread of misinformation in large-scale social
   networks.
   In this paper, we focus on how to limit viral propagation of
   misinformation in OSNs. Particularly, we study a set of problems, namely
   the beta(I)(T)-Node Protectors, which aims to find the smallest set of
   highly influential nodes whose decontamination with good information
   helps to contain the viral spread of misinformation, initiated from the
   set I, to a desired ratio (1 - beta) in T time steps. In this family
   set, we analyze and present solutions including inapproximability
   result, greedy algorithms that provide better lower bounds on the number
   of selected nodes, and a community-based heuristic method for the Node
   Protector problems. To verify our suggested solutions, we conduct
   experiments on real world traces including NetHEPT, NetHEPT\_WC and
   Facebook networks. Empirical results indicate that our methods are among
   the best ones for hinting out those important nodes in comparison with
   other available methods.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic networks model the physiological processes that transform
   metabolites in organisms. A metabolic network is considered to be in
   steady state if the rate at which all such transformations remain
   unchanged. Analyzing steady states has been essential in understanding
   the contribution of individual molecules to long term characteristics of
   the underlying organism. In this paper, we develop a novel method to
   establish the relationship between the functions of genes that take part
   in a given metabolic network and the steady states of that network
   systematically. To do this, we first characterize the impact of each
   reaction on the steady states of the network. Then, using their impacts,
   we group every reaction in the network into clusters of genes with
   similar impacts. We conjecture that genes with similar impacts on the
   set of possible steady states tend to serve similar functions. Following
   from this conjecture, for each group we formed, we calculate the
   enrichment of each gene ontology (GO) term that exists for at least one
   gene in that group. Given a new gene with missing annotations in the
   network, we find the cluster that is closest to that gene in the steady
   state space. We predict the enriched GO terms of in that cluster as
   possible annotations to that gene. Our experiments demonstrate that
   enrichment values correlate highly with the actual GO terms of each
   reaction, and thus, our method can predict the GO terms of less known
   genes accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites consisting of a piezoceramic inclusion and polymer matrix
   offer a combination of electromechanical coupling with high toughness
   and ductility inherent to polymers. There is a wide range of
   applications for these types of materials due to their intrinsic
   piezoelectric and dielectric properties, such as vibration sensing,
   actuation, energy harvesting and capacitive energy storage. However, the
   relatively low piezoelectric strain coefficient and dielectric
   permittivity of these nanocomposites significantly limit their
   application in energy conversion and energy storage applications. There
   are mainly two coupled to improve the dielectric permittivity and
   electromechanical properties of piezoceramic nanocomposites, namely
   higher aspect ratio active inclusions and alignment of inclusions in the
   direction of the applied electric field. Previously, we have
   demonstrated that using higher aspect ratio lead zirconate titanate
   (PZT) nanowires (NWs) could significantly enhance the energy density and
   d(33) coupling as compared to the samples with lower aspect ratio PZT
   nanorods {[}11]. In this paper, we will show that orientation of PZT NWs
   also influences energy storage capability of nanocomposite.
   Nanocomposites with aligned PZT NWs in the direction of the applied
   electric field show increased dielectric permittivity and energy density
   as compared to those with randomly dispersed inclusions. PZT NWs are
   hydrothermally synthesized, dispersed into a polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVDF), cast into a film and then aligned through uniaxial stretching.
   Scanning electric microscopy (SEM) shows the PZT NWs are successfully
   aligned in direction of stretching. This work demonstrates that the
   energy storage and conversion capability of the nanocomposite can be
   significantly enhanced through the alignment of PZT NWs in the direction
   of the applied electric field. The findings of this research could lead
   to broad interest due to demonstration of developing piezoceramic
   nanocomposites with enhanced dielectric and electromechanical properties
   for next generation energy storage and conversion devices.}},

   visual image correlation (VIC). The VIC data is compared to a finite

   loads, and the load serving entity attempts to schedule the energy
   consumption of these households. To minimize the total energy cost in
   this neighborhood, we propose an online algorithm, called Lyapunov-based
   cost minimization algorithm (LCMA), which jointly considers the energy

Abstract = {{In a direct collocation pseudospectral method, a continuous-time optimal
   control problem is transcribed to a finite-dimensional nonlinear
   programming problem. Solving this nonlinear programming problem as
   efficiently as possible requires that sparsity at both the first- and
   second-derivative levels be exploited. In this paper a computationally
   efficient method is developed for computing the first and second
   derivatives of the nonlinear programming problem functions arising from
   a pseudospectral discretization of a continuous-time optimal control
   problem. Specifically, in this paper expressions are derived for the
   objective function gradient, constraint Jacobian, and Lagrangian Hessian
   arising from the previously developed Radau pseudospectral method. It is
   shown that the computation of these derivative functions can be reduced
   to computing the first and second derivatives of the functions in the
   continuous-time optimal control problem. As a result, the method derived
   in this paper reduces significantly the amount of computation required
   to obtain the first and second derivatives required by a nonlinear
   programming problem solver. The approach derived in this paper is
   demonstrated on an example, where it is found that significant
   computational benefits are obtained when compared against direct
   differentiation of the nonlinear programming problem functions. The
   approach developed in this paper improves the computational efficiency
   of solving nonlinear programming problems arising from pseudospectral
   discretizations of continuous-time optimal control problems.}},

Abstract = {{The iron/iron-oxide looping cycle has the potential to produce high
   purity hydrogen from coal or natural gas without the need for gas phase
   separation: Hydrogen is produced from steam oxidation of iron or Wustite
   yielding primarily Magnetite; Magnetite is then reduced back to
   iron/Wustite using syngas (CO+H-2). A system model has been developed to
   identify favorable operation conditions and process configurations.
   Process configurations for three distinct temperature ranges, (i)
   500-950 K, (ii) 950-1100 K, and (iii) 1100-1200 K have been developed.
   The energy content of high temperature syngas from conventional coal
   gasifiers is sufficient to drive the looping process throughout the
   temperature range considered. Temperatures around 1000 K are
   advantageous for both the hydrogen production step and the iron oxide
   reduction step. Simulations of a large number of subsequent cycles
   indicate that quasi-steady operation is reached after approximately 5
   cycles. Comparison of simulations and experiments indicate that the
   process is currently limited by chemical kinetics at lower temperatures.
   Therefore, product recirculation should be used for a scaled-up process
   to increase reactant residence times while maintaining sufficient
   fluidization velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is among the most prevalent forms of mental illness and a
   major cause of morbidity worldwide. Diagnosis of depression is mainly
   based on symptomatic criteria, and the heterogeneity of the disease
   suggests that multiple different biological mechanisms may underlie its
   etiology. Animal models have been important for recent advances in
   experimental neuroscience, including modeling of human mood disorders,
   such as depression and anxiety. Over the past few decades, a number of
   stress and neurobiochemical models have been developed as primary
   efficacy measures in depression trials, which are paving the way for the
   discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Recent data indicates that
   stress-related mood disorders have influence on neuroplasticity and
   adult neurogenesis. In this chapter, several currently available animal
   models are presented as powerful tools for both mechanistic studies into
   the neurobiology of the antidepressant response and for drug discovery.}},

   available to assist the development of predictive modeling and to
   identify diseases more accurately. Data mining (or knowledge discovery)
   aims to extract information from large datasets and solve challenging
   tasks, like patient assessment, early mental disease diagnosis, and drug
   efficacy assessment. Accurate and fast data analysis methods are very
   important, especially when dealing with severe psychiatric diseases like
   schizophrenia. In this paper, we focus on computational methods related
   to data analysis and more specifically to data mining. Then, we discuss

Abstract = {{The problem of two sources wanting to share information through a
   potentially untrustworthy relay node is considered. The two sources
   transmit symbols simultaneously, and the relay node employs
   Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC) to forward information back to the
   two sources in order to increase throughput. In such a system using PNC,
   the relay node can easily fool the source nodes by manipulating the PNC
   output symbols. To enable relay maliciousness detection, a class of
   variable-rate codes, called certification codes, is introduced. In a
   certification code, redundancy is added to the source message to act as
   a certificate, allowing a node to determine if the relay is behaving in
   a malicious manner. A simple binary certification code is designed and
   analyzed to demonstrate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a mobile sensor network is tasked with cooperatively
   tracking a moving target. Each sensor runs a distributed particle filter
   to estimate the states of the target. Since some sensors may experience
   occasional failures or do not trust their own observations, a general
   case is considered, where only a portion of the sensors have the
   observations of the target. An average consensus algorithm is developed
   to allow each sensor to dynamically track the global mean of all local
   estimates about the target from the network by using communication with
   neighboring sensors only. Due to the limited communication capability on
   each sensor, the consensus algorithm and the cooperative objective of
   tracking the target must be accomplished while ensuring that the overall
   network remains connected. Based on the estimated global mean, a
   potential field based distributed motion control law is then designed to
   drive the sensors to track the target cooperatively, while preserving
   the network connectivity and avoiding collision during the mission
   operation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Supporting real-time transmission in a cognitive radio network has been
   a hot research topic in recent years. However, most previous works only
   considered real-time packets in the network rather than a co-existence
   of real-time and non-realtime traffic. For the works considering
   non-realtime traffic, usually absolute priority is given to real-time
   packets that the QoS of non-realtime ones cannot be guaranteed. In this
   paper, we propose a dynamic spectrum allocation scheme based on Earliest
   Deadline First (EDF) scheduling mechanism to preserve the QoS of both
   kinds of traffic in cellular cognitive radio networks. Simulation
   results demonstrate that the new algorithm has a similar throughput as
   the priority queue algorithm but achieves better balance in the average
   delay and deadline missing rate between the two types of packets.}},

Abstract = {{Online Social Networks (OSNs) have recently emerged as one of the most
   effective channels for information sharing and discovery due to their
   ability of allowing users to read and create new content simultaneously.
   While this advantage provides users more rooms to decide which content
   to follow, it also makes OSNs fertile grounds for the wide spread of
   misinformation which can lead to undesirable consequences. In order to
   guarantee the trustworthiness of content sharing in OSNs, it is thus
   essential to have a strategic investigation on the first and foremost
   concern: the sources of misinformation.
   In this paper, we study k-Suspector problem which aims to identify the
   top k most suspected sources of misinformation. We propose two effective
   approaches namely ranking-based and optimization-based algorithms. We
   further extend our solutions to cope with the incompleteness of
   collected data as well as multiple attacks, which mostly occur in
   reality. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our
   approaches achieve competitive detection ratios in a timely manner in
   comparison with available methods.}},

   approaches work by iteratively factorizing the nonnegative input matrix
   through derived multiplicative update rules. By doing so, we can not
   only extract meaningful overlapping communities via soft community
   assignments produced by NW, but also nicely handle all directed and
   undirected networks with or without weights. To validate the performance
   of our approaches, we extensively conduct experiments on both
   synthesized networks and real-world datasets in comparison with other
   NMF methods. Experimental results show that iSNMF is among the best
   efficient detection methods on reciprocity networks while iANMF
   outperforms current available methods on directed networks, especially

   Nevertheless, crucial aspects like the energetic cost to eliminate the

   element, are neglected. In this work, different control strategies such
   as conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers,
   feed-forward control algorithms and internal model control techniques
   are compared. The comparison is made in an alimentary fluid heating
   process. The performance is measured by using the integral of the
   absolute value of the error, the settling time, the maximum deviation of
   the controlled variable, the work done by the final control element and
   the energetic cost associated with the manipulated variable. It is
   demonstrated how the additional control techniques can help to decrease
   the energetic operation costs. All the strategies can be implemented

   Condor UAV) is addressed. The method proposes the optimization of a
   quadratic performance target function using the closed loop response
   obtained from simulations. In this case the characteristics of the model
   are not used directly in the controller tuning process, but in
   simulations and in some other numeric manipulations. The optimization
   process is made using a modified version of the Levenberg-Marquardt
   algorithm. The simulation results show that a set of controller
   parameters can be found such that the target function has a local
   minimum.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the design of a robust H-infinity gain-scheduled
   controller for the Condor Andino UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). A
   polytopic approximation of the linearization family of the nonlinear
   model is used for the design. Because the linearization family in the
   operating region derives in a linear parameter varying (LPV) description
   with a nonlinear dependence of a set of parameters, a least squares
   approximation of the system matrices is used in order to obtain affine
   dependence. The polytopic description is obtained from the affine LPV
   model when the operating range is defined choosing the varying parameter
   inside a convex hull. The controller is synthesized using the Bounded
   Real Lemma in order to guarantee quadratic H-infinity performance over
   the operating region. The simulation results show that the designed
   controller can be successfully applied to the nonlinear system over the
   operating range.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have shown the advantages of hardware and software
   co-design using FPGAs. However, increasingly lengthy place-and-route
   times represent a barrier to the broader adoption of this technology by
   significantly reducing designer productivity and turns-per-day,
   especially compared to more traditional design environments offered by
   competitive technologies such as GPUs. In this paper, we address this
   challenge by introducing a new approach to FPGA application design that
   significantly reduces compile times by exploiting the functional reuse
   common throughout modern FPGA applications, e.g. as shared code
   libraries and unchanged modules between compiles. To evaluate this
   approach, we introduce Block Place and Route (BPR), an FPGA CAD approach
   that modifies traditional placement and routing to operate at a
   higher-level of abstraction by pre-computing the internal placement and
   routing of reused cores. By extending traditional place-and-route
   algorithms such as simulated-annealing placement and
   negotiated-congestion routing to abstract away the detailed
   implementation of reused cores, we show that BPR is capable of
   orders-of-magnitude speedup in place-and-route over commercial tools
   with acceptably low overhead for a variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature of pressurized water reactor (PWR) core is a key parameter
   used widely for judging the initiation of emergency operating procedures
   and severe accident management. Since direct measurement of the fuel
   cladding surface temperature using thermocouples is not practicable
   currently, the coolant temperature at the core exit locations is
   monitored instead. Several experimental researches showed that the CET
   rise during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and its magnitudes were
   always lower than the actual fuel rod cladding temperature at the same
   time. In this regard, a theoretical analysis of the transient heat
   transfer of coolant flow in a PWR core is needed to confirm the findings
   from the previous experimental works. This paper addresses numerical
   simulation of the transient boiling-induced multiphase flow through a
   simplified PWR core model during a LOCA by a commercial computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The calculated results are discussed to
   understand the transient heat transfer mechanism in the core and to
   provide useful technical information for reactor design and operation.}},

   The metalized electrodes and Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide nanofiber

   either chrome/gold or aluminum, with multiple electrodes are prepared
   using standard photolithography processes. Meanwhile, the Alzheimer's
   beta-amyloid peptide nanofiber solutions are prepared via the hydration
   of beta-amyloid powder at various concentrations. The self-assembly of
   the beta-amyloid nanofibers, to achieve well-dispersed networks, is
   optimized through periodic sonication and readdition of aliquots over
   timed intervals. The beta-amyloid peptide solution can be successfully
   deposited onto the metalized electrodes to yield dense yet

Abstract = {{This study examines the transferability of tour-generation models
   between three metropolitan regions in Florida. Naive transfer methods
   are examined to assess the performance of the transferred models (from
   two other regions) to that of the locally estimated model. The
   assessment is done in the context of the generation of four tour
   purposes. Transferability is evaluated with multiple measures such as
   aggregate and disaggregate predictive abilities and the aggregate
   elasticities to specific socioeconomic factors. The results indicate
   that a transferred model that does best with aggregate predictions is
   not guaranteed to give better performance with elasticities regarding
   specific factors. For any pair of regions, and for a given metric for
   assessing transferability, the models for all tour purposes are not
   equally transferable. Finally, transferability is not symmetric. All
   these issues underscore the need to administer caution in borrowing
   parameters from one region for use in another.}},

   dimensions: abstraction, complexity, culture, engineering, environment,
   and process. Modeling can be a daunting task even for the seasoned
   modeling and simulation professional, and so my goal is to introduce
   modeling in two ways: 1) to use one specific type of model ( Petri Net)
   as an anchor for cross-dimensional discussion, and 2) to provide a
   follow up discussion, with additional non Petri Net examples, to clarify
   the extent of each dimension. For example, in the abstraction dimension,
   one must think about scale, refinement, and hierarchy when modeling
   regardless of the type of modeling language. The reader will come away
   with a broad framework within which to understand the possibilities of
   models and of modeling within the practice of simulation.}},

   characteristics and admittance spectra were performed in the 85 K-400 K
   temperature range for AlGaN/AlN/GaN high electron mobility transistor
   (HEMT) structures with Al composition in the AlGaN barrier changing from
   20\% Al to 50\% Al. AC conductance (G) in the C-V characteristics showed
   a pronounced peak in G-V dependences for voltages corresponding to
   partial depletion as did G-f dependences taken at these peak voltages.
   Admittance spectra measured at these voltages reveal peaks in
   conductance and steps in capacitance with apparent activation energy
   0.11-0.13 eV only weakly dependent on Al composition. Theoretical
   modeling suggests that these features are most likely due to electron
   transitions from the ground level in the triangular well near the
   AlN/GaN interface to the quasi continuum of highly excited states in the
   well with consequent thermal ionization of electrons. For highest Al
   composition of 50\%, additional traps in admittance with activation
   energy of 0.2 eV and 0.25 eV were detected and this correlated with
   partial relaxation of strain in the structure as determined by X-ray

Abstract = {{The method for camera motion estimation is proposed for the moving
   objects. Whereas the estimation of the structure and motion (SaM) of the
   moving objects usually involves the constraints on the motion of the
   camera and the object, the moving camera velocities can be estimated in
   our work using the images of the moving object from the single camera
   without any constraint on the camera and object motion. To this end, the
   dynamics of the partially measurable state are arranged in such a way
   that the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm can be employed for
   stationary objects and then the nonlinear observer based on RISE (robust
   integral signed error) method for dynamic objects sequentially. The
   proposed method has advantages in that when the proposed method and the
   previously developed SaM algorithms are combined together, we can
   reconstruct the 3-D structure of the moving objects from 2-D images from
   a single camera. Simulation results under time-varying velocities of
   both camera and object are presented to verify the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Broadcast authentication mechanisms are essential to cyber-physical
   systems that communicate through wireless links such as wireless sensor
   networks (WSN) and body area network (BAN). Even though symmetric
   key-based authentication schemes are more prevalent among these systems,
   public key-based digital signature schemes have started to gain ground;
   notably, several research efforts have been focused on the Elliptic
   Curve Cryptosystem due to its low overheads. As a combination of sensing
   and computing platform, WSN must handle both time-sensitive as well as
   delay-tolerant but security-sensitive data.
   The cryptographic strength and verification delay of an elliptic curve
   digital signature are determined by the parameters of the curve's
   underlying finite field. The field's parameters and public key are
   usually generated and distributed before the WSN's deployment thus
   cannot be changed easily. This situation creates a need for a
   multi-resolution digital signature scheme that provides the signer a
   choice to trade off a signature's strength for faster verification time
   and less power consumption.
   In this paper, we present a digital signature scheme called
   Multi-Resolution Elliptic Curve Signature (MRECS) that allows the signer
   the ability to create signatures of different strengths from the same
   public key set. Compared to an implementation using a set of different
   keys, MRECS requires less storage overhead and has longer key lifetime
   at the cost of slightly higher but acceptable communication overhead.
   MRECS yields up to 33\% computational overhead reduction compared to
   that of the full-size signature while maintaining a full elliptic curve
   strength regardless of a signature strength.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents CloudBay, an online resource trading and leasing
   platform for multi-party resource sharing. Following a market-oriented
   design principle, CloudBay provides an abstraction of a shared virtual
   resource space across multiple administration domains, and features
   enhanced functionalities for scalable and automatic resource management
   and efficient service provisioning. CloudBay distinguishes itself from
   existing research and contributes in a number of aspects. First, it
   leverages scalable network virtualization and self-configurable virtual
   appliances to facilitate resource federation and parallel application
   deployment. Second, CloudBay adopts an eBay-style transaction model that
   supports differentiated services with different levels of job
   priorities. For cost-sensitive users, CloudBay implements an efficient
   matchmaking algorithm based on auction theory and enables opportunistic
   resource access through preemptive service scheduling. The proposed
   CloudBay platform stands between HPC service sellers and buyers, and
   offers a comprehensive solution for resource advertising and stitching,
   transaction management, and application-to-infrastructure mapping. In
   this paper, we present the design details of CloudBay, and discuss
   lessons and challenges encountered in the implementation process. The
   proof-of-concept prototype of CloudBay is justified through experiments
   across multiple sites and simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-based tuning specializes a system's tunable parameters to the
   varying runtime requirements of an application's different phases of
   execution to meet optimization goals. Since the design space for tunable
   systems can be very large, one of the major challenges in phase-based
   tuning is determining the best configuration for each phase without
   incurring significant tuning overhead (e.g., energy and/or performance)
   during design space exploration. In this paper, we propose phase
   distance mapping, which directly determines the best configuration for a
   phase, thereby eliminating design space exploration. Phase distance
   mapping applies the correlation between a known phase's characteristics
   and best configuration to determine a new phase's best configuration
   based on the new phase's characteristics. Experimental results verify
   that our phase distance mapping approach determines configurations
   within 3\% of the optimal configurations on average and yields an energy
   delay product savings of 26\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used antibody-immobilized AlGaN/GaN high electron
   mobility transistors (HEMTs) for detecting a short peptide, and
   revealing the number of binding sites of the antibody for the peptide
   and the dissociation constants of the antibody-peptide complex. In our
   case, two binding sites were found on the ferritin heavy chain (FHC)
   antibody and the dissociation constants of the antibody-peptide complex
   were 2.723x10(-11) M and 6.994x10(-9) M for the two binding sites,
   respectively. The estimated dissociation constants are consistent within
   the reasonable range of the IGg antibody-antigen complexes binding
   constants. It also reveals the limit of detection is not only decided by
   the performance of the transistors but also the dissociation constant of
   the detected molecules. To our knowledge, it is the first time that
   AlGaN/GaN HEMTs using on the study of protein-peptide binding affinity.
   The results show that AlGaN/GaN HEMTs can not only be used as
   biosensors, but also a good tool and platform for analytical chemistry
   with numerous advantages since they are label-free, low-cost,
   biocompatible, stable in high temperature, real-time detection. Compared
   with other methods and techniques investigating the binding and kinetics
   of biological molecules, we do demonstrate AlGaN/GaN HEMTs have great
   potential to compete with conventional or proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectra signature can provide structural information based on
   vibrational transitions of irradiated molecules. In this work, the
   quantity reflecting mechanism of soil phosphorus concentration was
   studied based on Raman spectroscopy. 15 sand soil samples with different
   phosphate content were made in laboratory and the Raman signatures were
   measured. The relationship between sand soil Phosphorus concentration
   and soil Raman spectra was explored. Then the effective Raman signal was
   extracted from the original Raman spectra by using bior4.4 wavelet
   packet. The relationship between sand soil phosphorus and their
   extracted signals was analyzed and the PLS (Partial Least Squares) model
   for predicting phosphorus concentration in the soil was established and
   compared. The maximum accuracy model comes from the extracted effective
   Raman spectra after the first level decomposing. The calibration R-2 was
   close to 1 and the validation R-2 reached to 0.937. It showed high
   potential in soil phosphorus detecting by using Raman spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{An acoustic localization system using a linear hydrophone array is
   presented which has been designed to provide three dimensional
   positioning information relative to a signal source for testing in
   confined environments such as swimming pools or water tanks. The system
   is designed to fit within the size, power, and computational limitations
   of resource constrained small underwater vehicles. The feasibility of
   the technique was demonstrated in a confined test environment with
   severe multipath signals. Experimental test results in a 8 m diameter,
   4.5 m deep steel tank show localization errors of less than 5\% of the
   slant range which is comparable to commercially available systems
   designed for large vehicles in the open ocean.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{92-99}},
Abstract = {{Slab panel bridges (elsewhere referred to as flat-slab bridges) are
   constructed with multiple precast pretensioned slab panels that are
   placed side by side and act compositely with a cast-in-place concrete
   topping. Design standards from the Florida Department of Transportation
   specify that individual slab panels be supported by a tripod system of
   bearing pads. A single bearing pad is placed at one end, and two bearing
   pads at the opposite end. This paper presents experimental research on
   the effect that this bearing pad arrangement has on the behavior and
   capacity of slab panel members. Four full-scale tests on slab panels
   were conducted, with variables that included the bearing pad arrangement
   (single or double bearing), and the position of the load point {[}shear
   span-to-depth (a/d) ratio of 2.0 and 3.3]. For slab panels loaded at a/d
   of 3.3, test results indicated that the behavior and capacity were
   independent of the bearing pad arrangement. For the panel loaded at a/d
   of 2.0 with a single bearing pad, the failure mode was bond shear. The
   panel loaded at a/d of 2.0 with two bearing pads failed in flexure.
   Experimental results were compared with theoretical capacities
   calculated with American Concrete Institute and AASHTO codes. Design
   recommendations were made on the basis of the experimental results and
   on the comparison with theoretical capacities.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the ground surface in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data is
   useful and can be done efficiently and accurately using the Viterbi
   algorithm. This involves representing the radar image as a trellis graph
   and solving for the optimal path. To identify multiple layer boundaries
   in a radar image in this manner, it is necessary to find multiple
   disjoint paths through the trellis. Two main types of algorithms
   currently exist that find the k best disjoint paths whose aggregate sum
   is minimized. However, this criterion has drawbacks. Instead, we propose
   a novel criterion for choosing multiple disjoint paths in a trellis that
   we call the reciprocal pointer chain. This criterion has both a nice
   intuitive and theoretical justification, and leads to an algorithm with
   better qualitative results and significantly lower computational
   complexity than any of the methods previously proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) was recently introduced in literature
   for simultaneous multi-tensor estimation and tractography. This UKF
   however was not intrinsic to the space of diffusion tensors. Lack of
   this key property leads to inaccuracies in the multi-tensor estimation
   as well as in tractography. In this paper, we propose an novel intrinsic
   unscented Kalman filter (IUKF) in the space of symmetric positive
   definite matrices, which can be used for simultaneous recursive
   estimation of multi-tensors and tractography from diffusion weighted MR
   data. In addition to being more accurate, IUKF retains all the
   advantages of UKF for instance, multi-tensor estimation is only
   performed in the places where it is needed for tractography, which would
   be much more efficient than the two stage process involved in methods
   that do tracking post diffusion tensor estimation. The accuracy and
   effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via real data
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The rheological phenomenon of concrete materials, also termed as creep,
   is one of very important properties of concrete. Excessive deformation
   caused by creep does more detrimental effects on prestressed concrete
   structures than otherwise. Even though some investigations had been
   conducted on the normal concrete mixtures by the researchers and
   engineers all over the world, and the conclusions and the creep
   prediction models based on those investigations were developed, their
   effectiveness to be extended to all the concrete mixtures is very
   limited due primarily to the susceptibility of the creep property of
   concrete to the variation of the properties of aggregate, cement, water
   to cementitious materials ratio and their proportions. Especially for
   prestress concrete, creep induced prestress loss puts severe threat on
   the safety and durability of prestressed structures.
   Thus, in order to thoroughly understand the creep characteristics of the
   typical concrete mixtures used in Florida, this project was carried out
   by University of Florida and Florida Department of Transportation. The
   investigation found out that the creep strains of the concretes with
   different types of coarse aggregates at 91 days are very close, while
   the differences of creep coefficients of the concretes with different
   aggregates are fairly significant.}},

Abstract = {{Different types of coarse aggregates have distinguished petrological,
   petrographical and mineralogical and local characteristics, thus, their
   effects on concrete strength development are quite significant, various
   and unpredictable. So, the laboratory investigation on the concrete
   mixtures using local aggregates becomes very necessary before used in
   engineering practice.
   This paper carried out the evaluation of two types of coarse aggregates
   constantly used in Florida, including Miami Oolite limestone and Georgia
   granite, on their effects on the developments of compressive strength,
   splitting tensile strength and elastic modulus of concrete with time.
   And the prediction models based on ACI and Cario-Lew are evaluated and
   modified.
   The investigation results indicate that the concrete mixtures with
   Georgia granite aggregate tends to develop lower strength than those
   with Miami Oolite aggregate. And the modified models give better
   prediction on strength development of the concrete mixtures with
   aggregates often used in Florida.}},

Abstract = {{An inductively loaded compact patch antenna for a radiation frequency of
   433 MHz is designed taking into consideration a human-body model and
   fabricated on a flexible liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) substrate,
   which is subsequently wrapped into a cylindrical shape to achieve a
   monopole-like omnidirectional radiation pattern for wireless endoscope
   applications. The wrapped patch antenna has a stretched length of 31 mm
   (0.07 lambda(g)), and its cylindrical form has a diameter of 10 mm and a
   width of 18.5 mm, whose dimensions are designed to be comparable to
   those of a commercially available capsule endoscope. Compared to a
   traditional patch antenna with the same radiation frequency, an 86\%
   length reduction is achieved. Omnidirectionality is desired to increase
   the space coverage in communication between the randomly moving capsule
   inside and the receiver outside the body. The enclosed cylindrical
   cavity, surrounded by the ground plane of the patch, provides an
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) protected room that is useful for the
   placement of other electronic components. Multiple inductive notches on
   a patch designed for antenna size reduction are described by an
   equivalent circuit model. Human-body phantom solution is used for
   antenna characterization. The antenna, located at the outermost layer,
   serves not only as a good radiating unit, but also as the EMI
   protecting, mechanically supporting, packaging layer of the endoscope
   system.}},

Abstract = {{A circularly polarized sequential-rotation 2 x 2 patch antenna array
   integrated with a 60-GHz Doppler radar system is implemented on the
   low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrate. The LTCC technology
   with multiple metal layers is able to satisfy the different dielectric
   thickness requirements of antennas and microstrip feedlines, and it also
   provides a compact millimeter-wave packaging option for the CMOS radar
   chip. Compared to linearly polarized single-patch antenna, the 10-dB
   bandwidth of the antenna array on LTCC increases from 1.3 (2.4\%) to 7
   GHz (12.8\%) at 55 GHz, and narrow 50-Omega feedline is achieved to
   realize flip-chip transition. As the modeling and manufacturing
   variations are often present in the millimeter-wave systems, wide
   antenna bandwidth is able to cover the possible frequency drift and
   increase the yield of system-in-package. The circular polarization also
   provides better isolation against other sensors in multiple radars

   shear, were conducted along several orientations in the plane of the
   sheet in order to investigate the plastic anisotropy and the
   tension-compression asymmetry displayed by the material at the

   while the anisotropy in r-ratios is very pronounced. Initial yielding is
   described using criteria that account for both plastic anisotropy and
   strength differential effects. Comparison between experimental data and

Abstract = {{A strong difference between the behavior in tension versus compression
   is observed at the polycrystal level, if either twinning or non-Schmid
   type slip are contributors to plastic deformation at the single crystal
   level. Despite recent progress in modeling the effects of this asymmetry
   in yielding, its influence on damage evolution remains a challenge. In a
   recent paper {[}1] we presented a new constitutive model for voided
   polycrystal that incorporates the effects of the tension-compression
   asymmetry of the incompressible matrix on the overall dilatational
   plastic behavior. In this contribution, this model is used to
   investigate the influence of the tension-compression asymmetry of the
   matrix on void evolution for uniaxial loading conditions. It is shown
   that if the matrix tensile strength is higher than its compressive
   strength, void growth and damage distribution are similar to that in
   classical materials obeying Gurson's {[}2] criterion. On the other hand,
   for certain porous polycrystals in which the matrix tensile strength is
   lower than its compressive strength, void growth rate is much slower.
   Damage distribution is significantly different; the location of the zone
   of maximum porosity shifts from the center of the specimen outwards.
   Furthermore, the influence of the evolving microstructure on void growth
   is studied. It is shown that void growth is significantly affected by
   the rate of change of the matrix strength differential with plastic
   strain. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. Selection and/or peer review

Abstract = {{The logistic model can be used to describe crop response to applied

   is easy to use in practice. The model has been applied to numerous crops
   on different types of soils and under a variety of environmental
   conditions. In this article the model is applied to field data for
   cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in Arkansas for the period 1988-1990.
   Average yields for the three year period are first used to estimate the
   exponential parameters of the model. Then, individual values for the
   linear parameter are estimated for each of the three years. Analysis of
   variance shows that the linear parameter is significantly different
   among years. The analysis shows that applied nitrogen to reach 50\% and
   90\% of maximum yield is 15 and 110 kg ha(-1), respectively.}},

   in the Field}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2294}},
Pages = {{43-52}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have indicated that existing mix design criteria,
   including voids in mineral aggregates, gradation control points, and
   effective asphalt content, do not capture all critical aspects of
   gradation and mixture volumetric properties found to be strongly related
   to rutting and cracking performance. The performance of Superpave (R)
   mixtures varied significantly in mixtures that met all existing
   criteria. Therefore, there was a need to identify and verify additional
   criteria that could ensure better and more consistent performance of
   Superpave mixtures. Four parameters from the dominant aggregate size
   range (DASR)-interstitial component (IC) model have been determined to
   relate well to field performance of Superpave mixtures: DASR porosity,
   disruption factor (DF), effective film thickness (EFT), and the ratio of
   coarse portion to fine portion of fine aggregate (CFA/FFA). These four
   parameters were used in a field performance evaluation of rutting and
   cracking that was conducted to identify performance-related criteria.
   Results indicated that DASR porosity, which reflected the
   characteristics of coarse aggregate structure, was the most dominant
   parameter to control rutting performance. IC characteristics including
   DF, EFT, and CFA/FFA could not overcome the problems associated with a
   mixture that had DASR porosity outside the acceptable range. However, IC
   characteristics were more important than DASR porosity to differentiate
   clearly field cracking performance. The DF criteria should be considered
   in conjunction with EFT and CFA/FFA criteria to distinguish effectively
   the field cracking performance. Therefore, the introduction of DASR-IC
   criteria into current mix design guidelines and specifications will help
   to ensure good field rutting and cracking performance of Superpave
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of urban wet-weather flow pollutant loads are required to

   this paper is to examine the qualitative-quantitative characteristics of
   wet-weather flow in an urbanized test catchment in Cosenza, Italy, and
   to compare three studied water quality constituent concentrations (total
   suspended solids (TSS), total chemical oxygen demand (CODt) and filtered
   chemical oxygen demand (CODf)) obtained by laboratory analyses to those
   measured by a UV/Vis spectrometer ('spectrolyzer scan'), which
   represents a most modern and efficient spectrometric instrument

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal oscillations in EEG waves are indicative of sensory
   and cognitive processing. We propose a method to find the spatial
   amplitude patterns of a time-limited waveform across multiple EEG
   channels. It consists of a single iteration of multichannel matching
   pursuit where the base waveform is obtained via the Hilbert transform of
   a time-limited tone. The vector of extracted amplitudes across channels
   is used for classification, and we analyze the effect of deviation in
   temporal alignment of the waveform on classification performance.
   Results for a previously published dataset of 6 subjects show comparable
   results versus a more complicated criteria-based method.}},

Abstract = {{We show experimental results that the evoked local field potentials of
   the rat somatosensory cortex from natural tactile touch of forepaw
   digits and matched thalamic microstimulation can be qualitatively and
   quantitively similar. In ongoing efforts to optimize the
   microstimulation settings (e.g., location, amplitude, etc.) to match the
   natural response, we investigate whether subspace projection methods,
   specifically the eigenface approach proposed in the computer vision
   community (Turk and Pentland 1991 {[}1]), can be used to choose the
   parameters of microstimulation such that the response matches a single
   tactile touch realization. Since the evoked potentials from multiple
   electrodes are high dimensional spatio-temporal data, the subspace
   projections improve computational efficiency and can reduce the effect
   of noisy realizations. In computing the PCA projections we use the
   peristimulus averages instead of the realizations. The dataset is pruned
   of unreliable stimulation types. A new subspace is computed for the
   pruned stimulation type, and is used to estimate a sequence of
   microstimulations to best match the natural responses. This
   microstimulation sequence is applied in vivo and quantitative analysis
   shows that per realization matching does statistically better than
   choosing randomly from the pruned subset.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to propose a modification
   to the generalized measure of association (GMA) framework that reduces
   the effect of temporal structure in time series; second, to assess the
   reliability of using association methods to capture dependence between
   pairs of EEG channels using their time series or envelopes. To achieve
   the first goal, the GMA algorithm was updated so as to minimize the
   effect of the correlation inherent in the time structure. The
   reliability of the modified scheme was then assessed on both synthetic
   and real data. Synthetic data was generated from a Clayton copula, for
   which null hypotheses of uncorrelatedness were constructed for the
   signal. The signal was processed such that the envelope emulated
   important characteristics of experimental EEG data. Results show that
   the modified GMA procedure can capture pairwise dependence between
   generated signals as well as their envelopes with good statistical
   power. Furthermore, applying GMA and Kendall's tau to quantify
   dependence using the extracted envelopes of processed EEG data concords
   with previous findings using the signal itself.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud storage has been gaining popularity because its elasticity and
   pay-as-you-go manner. However, this new type of storage model also
   brings security challenges. This paper studies the problem of ensuring
   data integrity in cloud storage.
   In the Proof of Retrievability (PoR) model, after outsourcing the
   preprocessed data to the server, the client will delete its local copies
   and only store a small amount of meta data. Later the client will ask
   the server to provide a proof that its data can be retrieved correctly.
   However, most of the prior PoR works apply only to static data. The
   existing dynamic version of PoR scheme has an efficiency problem.
   In this paper, we extend the static PoR scheme to dynamic scenario. That
   is, the client can perform update operations, e. g., insertion, deletion
   and modification. After each update, the client can still detect the
   data losses even if the server tries to hide them. We develop a new
   version of authenticated data structure based on a B+ tree and a merkle
   hash tree. We call it Cloud Merkle B+ tree (CMBT). By combining the CMBT
   with the BLS signature, we propose a dynamic version of PoR scheme.
   Compared with the existing dynamic PoR scheme, our worst case
   communication complexity is O(logn) instead of O(n).}},

Abstract = {{Due to the size and density of small satellite networks (SSNs), the
   traditional clustering algorithms of large monolithic satellite networks
   are often limited. This paper proposes a novel distributed weight-based
   dominating set clustering algorithm to address the clustering problems
   in the stochastically deployed SSNs. Considering the unique features of
   small satellites, this algorithm is able to form the clusters
   efficiently and stably. In this algorithm, satellites are separated into
   different groups according to their spatial characteristics. Firstly, a
   minimum dominating set is chosen as the candidate cluster head set based
   on their weight, which is a weighted combination of residual energy and
   connection degree. Then the cluster heads admit new neighbors that
   accept their invitations into the cluster, until the maximum cluster
   size is reached. Evaluated by the simulation results, in a SSN with 200
   to 800 nodes, the algorithm is able to efficiently cluster more than
   90\% of nodes in 3 seconds.}},

Abstract = {{With Moore's law supplying billions of transistors on-chip, embedded
   systems are undergoing a transition from single-core to multi-core to
   exploit this high transistor density for high performance. However,
   there exists a plethora of multi-core architectures and the suitability
   of these multi-core architectures for different embedded domains (e. g.,
   distributed, real-time, reliability-constrained) requires investigation.
   Despite the diversity of embedded domains, one of the critical
   applications in many embedded domains (especially distributed embedded
   domains) is information fusion. Furthermore, many other applications
   consist of various kernels, such as Gaussian elimination (used in
   network coding), that dominate the execution time. In this paper, we
   evaluate two embedded systems multi-core architectural paradigms:
   symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) and tiled multi-core architectures
   (TMAs). We base our evaluation on a parallelized information fusion
   application and benchmarks that are used as building blocks in
   applications for SMPs and TMAs. We compare and analyze the performance
   of an Intel-based SMP and Tilera's TILEPro64 TMA based on our
   parallelized benchmarks for the following performance metrics: runtime,
   speedup, efficiency, cost, scalability, and performance per watt.
   Results reveal that TMAs are more suitable for applications requiring
   integer manipulation of data with little communication between the
   parallelized tasks (e. g., information fusion) whereas SMPs are more
   suitable for applications with floating point computations and a large
   amount of communication between processor cores.}},

   Experimental results show that code reordering coupled with cache

Abstract = {{A patch antenna and an electronic circuit/sensor system implemented on a
   flat flexible substrate are rolled up to form a wireless endoscope
   capsule. A flexible Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) substrate is used. A
   conventional wirelesses endoscope system is assembled by stacking up
   multiple layers of PCBs comprising a transceiver, a microprocessor, a
   sensor, and an antenna etc., and communication between different layers
   are realized by vertical vias, which usually cause loss and cost to
   design and implement. The approach used here is to design all the
   necessary components on a single piece of a flexible substrate and
   assemble them by rolling up. No via is needed for communication between
   components and layers. Further, the layout is designed to enclose all
   other electronics by the wrapped patch antenna, which offers an
   omnidirectional radiation pattern as well as electromagnetic
   interference (EMI) shielding to the enclosed analog/digital circuits as
   well as sensitive sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is analyzed as an Epsilon
   Negative transmission line for the design of dual band dual mode
   antennas. The dual band design is feasible by exciting an open ended SIW
   to produce the zeroth order resonance (ZOR) or infinite wavelength mode
   at the cutoff frequency where a zero permittivity point is presented,
   and the first order resonance occurring at a frequency where the length
   of the waveguide is a half of the guided wavelength. A new design
   procedure is demonstrated using the theoretical analysis of the SIW. A
   miniaturized dual band antenna working at 10/17 GHz frequency bands is
   implemented and characterized. The proposed design procedure has been
   confirmed. The antenna features a compact size of 0.35 lambda(0) x 0.2

Abstract = {{Technological advancements in wireless communications and embedded
   systems have led to the proliferation of wireless sensor network (WSN)
   applications, each with varying application requirements (i.e.,
   lifetime, throughput, reliability, etc.). Sensor node tunable parameters
   enable WSN designers to specialize/tune a sensor node to meet
   application requirements, but however, parameter tuning is a challenging
   process that requires designer expertise to consider sensor node
   complexities and changing environmental stimuli. In this paper, we
   develop lightweight, online optimization algorithms for sensor node
   parameter tuning, which enables dynamic optimizations to meet
   application requirements and adapt to changing environmental stimuli.
   Results reveal that our online optimizations quickly converge to a near
   optimal solution using minimal computational and storage resources, and
   are thus amenable for implementation on resource and energy-constrained
   sensor nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Communication between cortices mediated by deep brain structures such as
   the amygdala and fusiform gyrus has been suggested to explain the
   enhanced perception of stimuli bearing emotional content or having
   facial features. In this paper, we analyze the dependence structure of
   the relevant brain regions to assess their connectivity in response to a
   facial stimulus, and to discriminate it from a mock stimulus. The
   proposed approach treats the brain as a graphical network where vertices
   correspond to locations of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and
   weights of the edges correspond to dependence values. We employ a novel
   measure of dependence, called generalized measure of association (GMA),
   due to its underlying simplicity, and compare its performance against
   Pearson's correlation. The performance is assessed in terms of the
   discriminability between the face and mock stimuli. We observe that GMA
   successfully exhibits higher dependence in regions that might reflect
   the activity of the amygdaloid complex and the right fusiform gyrus when
   the stimulus is face. Furthermore, the distributions of the dependence
   values show that GMA also achieves a better separation between face and
   mock, compared to correlation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents Data-Driven Tree-structured Bayesian network (DDT),
   a novel probabilistic graphical model for hierarchical unsupervised
   image segmentation. The DDT captures long and short-ranged correlations
   between neighboring regions in each image using a tree-structured prior.
   Unlike other previous work, DDT first segments an input image into
   superpixels and learn a tree-structured prior based on the topology of
   superpixels in different scales. Such a tree structure is referred to as
   data-driven tree structure. Each superpixel is represented by a variable
   node taking a discrete value of class/label of the segmentation. The
   probabilistic relationships among the nodes are represented by edges in
   the network. The unsupervised image segmentation, hence, can be viewed
   as an inference problem of the nodes in the tree structure of DDT, which
   can be carried out efficiently. We evaluate quantitatively our results
   with respect to the ground-truth segmentation, demonstrating that our
   proposed framework performs competitively with the state of the art in
   unsupervised image segmentation and contour detection.}},

Abstract = {{In the past two decades, runoff-permeable porous pavement and porous
   friction courses of pavement systems have been implemented more
   frequently, first in Europe and subsequently in the United States.
   Consequently, research and case studies are increasing, with a
   commensurate increase in the knowledge base for these drainable pavement
   matrices and systems. The main distinguishing parameter of these porous
   matrices is the hydraulic conductivity (k), as compared with traditional
   impervious pavements. Equipment and standards for measuring k vary
   widely. This variability includes laboratory and field permeameters,
   constant-head and falling-head permeameters, and methods based on
   differing equipment and differing protocols. In many cases, such
   variability generates results that are either difficult to compare or
   not comparable. As a result, the value of k that is generated from
   different methods and different equipment is uncertain. The disparate
   methods and measurement of k as a parameter challenge the researcher and
   the practitioner. During the development and specifying phase, the
   researcher and the designer require a representative value of k to
   ensure proper predictive models and design. During and after
   construction, the engineer and the practitioner require k for quality
   control. This paper illustrates and summarizes the available methods for
   measuring the k of pavement porous mixes. Some case studies are examined
   to verify the differences between methods and equipment used for
   determination of k. The European Standard UNI EN 12697-19 is examined
   through an experimental study. Theoretical and practical results help
   explain the measurement of k for pavements as a primary parameter of
   porous runoff-permeable mixes.}},

Abstract = {{The task of the binary classification problem is to determine which of
   two distributions has generated a length-n test sequence. The two
   distributions are unknown; two training sequences of length N, one from
   each distribution, are observed. The distributions share an alphabet of
   size m, which is significantly larger than n and N. How does N, n, m
   affect the probability of classification error? We characterize the
   achievable error rate in a high-dimensional setting in which N, n, m all
   tend to infinity, under the assumption that probability of any symbol is
   O(m(-1)). The results are:
   1) There exists an asymptotically consistent classifier if and only if m
   = o(min\{N-2, Nn\}). This extends the previous consistency result in
   {[}1] to the case N not equal n.
   2) For the sparse sample case where max\{n, N\} = o(m), finer results
   are obtained: The best achievable probability of error decays as -
   log(P-is an element of) = J min\{N-2, Nn\}(1 + o(1))/m with J > 0.
   3) A weighted coincidence- based classifier has non-zero generalized
   error exponent J.
   4) The l(2)-norm based classifier has J = 0.}},

Abstract = {{The POWER (PrObabilistic Weighted Ensemble of Roles) model{[}1] is a
   Bayesian mixture model where a single data point is generated by
   multiple components with varying degrees of influence. This is unlike
   standard mixture models where each data point is generated by a single
   mixture component. The POWER model allows for capturing various hidden
   and complexly overlapping components and roles of entities that
   contribute to generating the data points. However. the POWER model
   suffers from a very slow learning time. The highest complexity time of
   the parameters' learning steps is O (n . k . d(2)) with n being the
   number of data points. k the number of components of the model and d the
   number of data attributes.
   In this paper. we propose an approximation to the POWER model weight
   parameter learning algorithm that reduces the computational time
   significantly. The overall complexity of the new algorithm is O (n . k .
   d . p) in practice (where p is an approximation parameter much smaller
   than d). This allows the model learning time to be linear in the number
   of attributes of the data and provides a significant speedup over the
   original algorithm.
   We demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation technique using
   synthetic and real datasets. We also provide experimental results of the
   approximate POWER model on a dataset of NIPS papers and a dataset of
   wireless web access patterns and show that the model learnt are similar.
   An implementation of the approximate POWER model on the dataset of NIPS
   papers is about 27 times faster than the original version.}},

Abstract = {{Projected increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
   ({[}CO2]) and air temperature associated with future climate change are
   expected to affect crop development, crop yield, and, consequently,
   global food supplies. They are also likely to change agricultural
   production practices, especially those related to agricultural water
   management and sowing date. The magnitude of these changes and their
   implications to local production systems are mostly unknown. The
   objectives of this study were to: (i) simulate the effect of projected
   climate change on spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Lang) yield and
   water use for the subtropical environment of the Darling Downs,
   Queensland, Australia; and (ii) investigate the impact of changing
   sowing date, as an adaptation strategy to future climate change
   scenarios, on wheat yield and water use. The multi-model climate
   projections from the IPCC Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3)
   for the period 2030-2070 were used in this study. Climate scenarios
   included combinations of four changes in air temperature (0 degrees C, 1
   degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C), three {[}CO2] levels (380 ppm,
   500 ppm, and 600 ppm), and three changes in rainfall (-30\%, 0\%, and
   +20\%), which were superimposed on observed station data. Crop
   management scenarios included a combination of six sowing dates (1 May,
   10 May, 20 May, 1 June, 10 June, and 20 June) and three irrigation
   regimes (no irrigation (NI), deficit irrigation (DI), and full
   irrigation (FI)). Simulations were performed with the model DSSAT4.5,
   using 50 years of daily weather data. We found that: (1) grain yield and
   water-use efficiency (yield/evapotranspiration) increased linearly with
   {[}CO2]; (2) increases in {[}CO2] had minimal impact on
   evapotranspiration; (3) yield increased with increasing temperature for
   the irrigated scenarios (DI and FI), but decreased for the NI scenario;
   (4) yield increased with earlier sowing dates; and (5) changes in
   rainfall had a small impact on yield for DI and FI, but a high impact
   for the NI scenario.}},

   The contact angle of the droplets reduce to a lower value due to the
   absorption of UV by ZnO NRs and a circulating current was observed
   inside the droplet. The droplets were either pushed away from or pulled
   toward to the center of the UV light depending on the locations of the
   droplets to the UV light. It is obvious that in the pushing mode, the
   circulating current dominate the direction of the movement of the

Abstract = {{The complex wave representation (CWR) converts unsigned two-dimensional
   (2D) distance transforms into their corresponding wave functions. Here,
   the distance transform S(X) appears as the phase of the wave function
   phi(X)-specifically, phi(X) = exp(iS(X)/tau), where tau is a free
   parameter. In this work, we prove a novel result using the higher-order
   stationary phase approximation: we show convergence of the normalized
   power spectrum (squared magnitude of the Fourier transform) of the wave
   function to the density function of the distance transform gradients as
   the free parameter tau -> 0. In colloquial terms, spatial frequencies
   are gradient histogram bins. Since distance transform gradients carry
   only orientation information (as their magnitudes are identically equal
   to one almost everywhere), the 2D Fourier transform values mainly lie on
   the unit circle in the spatial frequency domain as tau -> 0. The proof
   of the result involves standard integration techniques and requires
   proper ordering of limits. Our mathematical relation indicates that the
   CWR of distance transforms is an intriguing, new representation.}},

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric oxides are used in many modern technologies including
   sensors, actuators, thin-film memories and energy harvesting.
   Ferroelectrics of similar composition often show wide variations in
   their characteristic properties. Such variations in properties can be
   largely attributed to differences in the structural arrangements of
   domains and distributions of defects within a
   multidomain/polycrystalline material. Recent developments in
   characterization techniques and first-principle calculations have
   significantly advanced our understanding of how ferroelectric domains
   interact with material defects, and thereby influence the properties of
   a material. This review provides a broad outlook of the contributions
   from different experimental and computational studies that have
   clarified the structure of domains, domain walls and defects in
   perovskite ferroelectric oxides, and the evolution of these structures
   under the application of electric fields. It is intended that an
   integrated viewpoint of these issues, as provided here, will further
   motivate synergistic activities between the various research groups and
   industries towards the development and characterization of ferroelectric
   oxides.}},

Title = {{Double Shroud Delivery of Silica Precursor for Reducing Hexavalent
   Chromium in Welding Fume}},

Abstract = {{The welding process yields a high concentration of nanoparticles loaded
   with hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), a known human carcinogen. Previous
   studies have demonstrated that using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a
   shielding gas additive can significantly reduce the Cr6+ concentration
   in welding fume particles. In this study, a novel insulated double
   shroud torch (IDST) was developed to further improve the reduction of
   airborne Cr6+ concentration by separating the flows of the primary
   shielding gas and the TMS carrier gas. Welding fumes were collected from
   a welding chamber in the laboratory and from a fixed location near the
   welding arc in a welding facility. The Cr6+ content was analyzed with
   ion chromatography and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results
   from the chamber sampling demonstrated that the addition of 3.2 5.1\% of
   TMS carrier gas to the primary shielding gas resulted in more than a
   90\% reduction of airborne Cr6+ under all shielding gas flow rates. The
   XPS result confirmed complete elimination of Cr6+ inside the amorphous
   silica shell. Adding 100 1000 ppm of nitric oxide or carbon monoxide to
   the shielding gas could also reduce Cr6+ concentrations up to 57\% and
   35\%, respectively; however, these reducing agents created potential
   hazards from the release of unreacted agents. Results of the field test
   showed that the addition of 1.6\% of TMS carrier gas to the primary
   shielding gas reduced Cr6+ concentration to the limitation of detection
   (1.1 mu g/m3). In a worst-case scenario, if TMS vapor leaked into the
   environment without decomposition and ventilation, the estimated TMS
   concentration in the condition of field sampling would be a maximum 5.7
   ppm, still well below its flammability limit (1\%). Based on a
   previously developed cost model, the use of TMS increases the general
   cost by 3.8\%. No visual deterioration of weld quality caused by TMS was
   found, although further mechanical testing is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{While LCR databridge instruments are used to probe the integrity of

   theoretical meanings of resistance and capacitance measurements in PAR
   and SER mode are presented. A large body of data from human cadaver skin
   are used to show that LCR databridge resistance measured at 100 Hz in
   PAR mode and capacitance measured at 100 Hz in SER mode are most
   sensitive to skin resistivity, which is the electrical measurement most
   closely related to skin integrity. The single-frequency databridge
   resistance values are shown to correlate to skin permeability
   measurements using tritiated water. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{In this paper the Fokker-Planck equation is solved by the meshless
   particle partition of unity finite element method with automatic
   boundary condition enforcement. An improved cover generation algorithm
   is presented to automatically minimize interference between boundary
   nodes and interior nodes in the solution domain. Radial basis functions
   are used at boundary nodes to automatically damp the solution to a
   desired small value at boundaries, thus eliminating the need of penalty
   method for boundary condition enforcement. This achieves two important
   goals: (i) improves the conditioning of discretized reduced order system
   and (ii) eliminates spurious modes created by penalty method, thus
   improving the quality of point spectrum of the discretized Fokker-Planck
   operator. This is particularly important for systems without stationary
   solution, in which spurious modes can prevent the construction of
   accurate approximation. Results shown for a two dimensional nonlinear
   oscillator with stationary solution agree well with our former results
   while also decreasing the total number of spurious modes significantly.
   Further, an undamped simple pendulum is examined to demonstrate the
   applicability of this method for systems without stationary solution.}},

   design due to computational tractability. We show that with proper
   choice of asymmetric weights, the convergence rate can be improved
   significantly over even the symmetric optimal design. In particular, we
   prove that the convergence rate in a lattice graph can be made
   independent of the size of the graph with asymmetric weights. A
   Sturm-Liouville operator is used to approximate the graph Laplacian of
   more general graphs. Based on this continuum approximation, we propose a
   weight design method. Numerical computations show that the resulting
   convergence rate with asymmetric weight design is improved considerably
   over that with symmetric optimal weights and Metropolis-Hastings
   weights.}},

Abstract = {{A framework for information-guided simulated annealing is presented in
   this paper. Information gathered during randomized exploration of the
   optimization domain is used as feedback with progressively increasing
   gain to drive the optimization procedure. Modeling of ``information{''}
   can be performed in a variety of ways, with the ultimate objective of
   keeping track of the performance of the stochastic search procedure. A
   guided-annealing temperature is defined that incorporates information
   into the cooling schedule. The resulting algorithm has two phases: phase
   I performs (nearly) unrestricted exploration as a reconnaissance to
   survey the optimization domain, while phase II ``re-heats{''} the
   optimization procedure and exploits information gathered during phase I.
   Phase I flows seamlessly into phase II via an information effectiveness
   parameter without need for user input. The algorithm presented in this
   paper improves the performance and success rate of the existing
   simulated annealing algorithms significantly. Results of are presented
   for a problem that is traditionally used in the literature to illustrate
   the shortcomings of simulated annealing and significant improvement is
   illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we pose a new sequential variant of the famous Colonel
   Blotto game in which two players, Player A and Player B, must allocate
   finite resources among N regions of a battlefield. A key new feature of
   our problem formulation is the introduction of a deterministic sensor
   network employed by Player B to gain an informational advantage over
   Player A. The existence of the sensor network and its properties are
   common knowledge in the game. We pose the resulting resource allocation
   game and obtain necessary conditions for Nash equilibrium optimal mixed
   strategies for the two players in terms of each player's available
   resources and the sensor network characteristics. These conditions apply
   to the marginal probability distribution functions of each player's
   strategy. The optimality conditions are developed using a novel case of
   the associated first-price all pay auctions with upper or lower bounds
   on the players' allocations. A numerical example is included to show the
   tractability of our solution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed set-point
   temperature regulation in a large building. With a large number of
   zones, the problem becomes intractable with standard control approaches
   due to the large state space dimension of the dynamic model. To mitigate
   complexity, we develop here a mean-field control approach applicable to
   large-scale control problems in buildings. The mean-field here
   represents the net effect of the entire building envelope on any
   individual zone. Rather than solving the large-scale centralized
   problem, we explore distributed game-theoretic solution approaches that
   work by optimizing with respect to the mean-field. The methodology is
   illustrated with a numerical example in a simulation environment.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the problem of how to use occupancy information of various
   fidelity to reduce the energy consumed in maintaining desired levels of
   thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) in commercial buildings. We
   focus on the zone-level control, where the control inputs to be decided
   are the supply air (SA) flow rate and the amount of reheat. We propose
   three control algorithms with varying information requirements: (i)
   POBOC, that requires long-horizon accurate prediction of occupancy and a
   model of the hygrothermal dynamics of the zone, (ii) OMBOC, that
   requires only occupancy measurement and a dynamic model, and (iii)
   Z-DCV, that requires only occupancy measurement. The first two
   strategies use a model predictive control framework to compute the
   optimal control inputs, while the third one is a pure feedback-based
   control strategy. Simulations with a calibrated model show that
   significant energy savings over a baseline controller, the kind usually
   used in existing buildings, is possible with the last two strategies,
   that is, even without occupancy prediction. Trade-offs between
   complexity and performance of the control algorithms are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In a multi-robot system, robots are typically required to collaborate
   over a communication network to achieve objectives cooperatively. Due to
   the limited communication and sensing capabilities on each robot, the
   cooperative objective must be accomplished while ensuring that specified
   robots stay within each other's sensing and communication ranges and
   that the overall network remains connected. In this paper, a dipolar
   navigation function and corresponding time-varying continuous controller
   is developed for repositioning and reorienting a group of wheeled robots
   with nonholonomic constraints. Only local sensing feedback information
   from neighbors is used to navigate the robots and maintain network
   connectivity, which indicates that communication is available when
   required for various tasks, but communication is not required for
   navigation. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the
   developed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Mankind has always sought out social interaction, and our social
   interactions influence our thoughts and actions. As technological
   advances in social media provide a means for more rapid, convenient, and
   widespread communication, our resulting social interactions can lead to
   a more dynamic influence. Underlying these interactions are emotional
   responses to different stimuli and a desire not to become isolated from
   peers. In this paper, such social interactions are modeled as an
   undirected graph where each vertex represents an individual and each
   edge represents a social bond between individuals. Motivated by the
   non-local property of fractional-order systems, the emotional response
   of individuals in the network is modeled by fractional-order dynamics
   whose states depend on influences from social bonds. A decentralized
   control method is then developed to manipulate the social group to a
   common emotional state while maintaining existing social bonds (i.e.,
   without isolating peers in the group). Mittag-Leffler stability methods
   are used to prove asymptotic convergence to a common equilibrium point
   (i.e., emotional state) of the networked fractional-order system.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that aggregation of geographically diverse wind
   energy resources offers compelling potential to mitigate wind power
   variability, as wind speed at different geographic locations tends to
   decorrelate with increasing spatial separation. In this paper, we
   explore the extent to which a coalition of wind power producers can
   exploit the statistical benefits of aggregation to mitigate the risk of
   quantity shortfall with respect to forward contract offerings for
   energy. We propose a simple augmentation of the existing two-settlement
   market system with nodal pricing to permit quantity risk sharing among
   wind power producers by affording the group a recourse opportunity to
   utilize improved forecasts of their ensuing wind energy production to
   collectively modify their forward contracted positions so as to utilize
   the projected surplus in generation at certain buses to balance the
   projected shortfall in generation at complementary buses. Working within
   this framework, we show that the problem of optimally sizing a set of
   forward contracts for a group of wind power producers reduces to convex
   programming and derive closed form expressions for the set of optimal
   recourse policies. We also asses the willingness of individual wind
   power producers to form a coalition to cooperatively offer contracts for
   energy. We first show that the expected profit derived from coalitional
   contract offerings with recourse is greater than that achievable through
   independent contract offerings. And, using tools from coalitional game
   theory, we show that the core for our game is non-empty.}},

Abstract = {{We study the robustness to external disturbances of large 1-D network of
   double-integrator agents with distributed control. We provide precise
   quantitative comparison of certain H-infinity norm between two common
   control architectures: predecessor-following and symmetric
   bidirectional. In particular, we show that the scaling laws of the
   H-infinity norm for predecessor-following architecture is O(alpha(N))
   (alpha > 1), but only O(N-3) for symmetric bidirectional architecture,
   where N is the number of agents in the network. The results for
   symmetric bidirectional architecture are obtained by using a PDE model
   to approximate the closed-loop dynamics of the network for large N.
   Numerical calculations show that the PDE approximation provides accurate
   predictions even when N is small. In addition, we examine the robustness
   of asymmetric bidirectional architecture. Numerical simulations show
   that with judicious asymmetry in the velocity feedback, the robustness
   of the network can be improved considerably over symmetric bidirectional
   and predecessor- following architectures.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for dynamic neural network (DNN) observer-based output
   feedback control of uncertain nonlinear systems with bounded
   disturbances is developed. The DNN-based observer works in conjunction
   with a dynamic filter for state estimation using only output
   measurements during on-line operation. A sliding mode term is added to
   the DNN structure to robustly account for exogenous disturbances and
   reconstruction errors. Weight update laws for the DNN, based on
   estimation, tracking errors, and filter output are proposed which
   guarantee global asymptotic regulation of the estimation error. A
   combination of a neural network feedforward term, along with estimated
   state feedback and sliding mode terms yields a global asymptotic
   tracking result. The developed method yields the first output feedback
   technique simultaneously achieving global asymptotic tracking and global
   asymptotic estimation of unmeasurable states for the class of uncertain
   nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new, preparation-free method for measuring the leakage
   current density on ultra-shallow junctions. The junction leakage is
   found by making a series of four-point sheet resistance measurements on
   blanket wafers with variable electrode spacings. The leakage current
   density is calculated using a fit of the measured four-point resistances
   to an analytical two-sheet model. The validity of the approximation
   involved in the two-sheet model is verified by a comparison to finite
   element model calculations.}},

   from the data itself. However, temporal context, when present, can
   provide useful information and alleviate instability in sparse

   conjunction with a dynamical system, the extracted features can provide
   better descriptors for time-varying observations. We show a marked

Abstract = {{Real-time streaming data takes on distinct visible patterns, known as
   regimes, as a result of changing external influences. Regimes
   corresponding to hazardous states, such as turbulent flow in oil
   pipelines or patients experiencing heart arrhythmias, must be identified
   quickly and accurately by on-line detection algorithms. In this paper,
   we propose a modification to the mixture of experts framework, which is
   traditionally used to model piecewise stationary time series. Our
   proposed modification allows experts to produce features specific to
   their designated regimes, rather than being limited to prediction error.
   This approach provides the flexibility to update the mixture modularly
   as new regimes emerge without the burden of retraining the entire
   mixture, as is typical in traditional classifiers. Our approach is
   tested on flow rate data from an oil and gas application, as well as
   detecting heart arrhythmias from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. It
   outperforms traditional classification approaches both in terms of error
   rate and detector delay.}},

   communication architecture to improve underwater vehicle connectivity in
   a region of interest. The approach is simulated using various underwater
   vehicle configurations, both with and without the autonomous surface
   vehicle, where it is found that network connectivity is improved
   significantly via the inclusion of the autonomous surface vehicle. An
   in-water hardware test is then performed and is shown to be consistent

   from recent experimental investigations. The defect chemistry of the
   phosphates related to protonic defects and oxygen vacancies created from
   extrinsic doping is investigated. The results indicate favorable
   orientations for the protonic defect within the structures. The binding
   energies for proton-dopant interactions indicate that defect association

Abstract = {{Water quality criteria for aquatic environments are numerical

   (a) selecting the most sensitive species and testing toxicity to them
   and (b) application of evaluation methods to obtain the water quality
   criteria. The data requirement, tested organisms and three calculation
   methodologies were discussed in detail. In China, establishing
   appropriate and effective water quality criteria for protecting aquatic
   environment is an urgent task and national strategy. The systematic and
   feasible experience from other countries and international organizations
   can be a valuable guide for the Chinese Environmental Protection
   Departments. This review put forward research direction and developing

Abstract = {{Police traffic enforcement is a common, recognizable part of the driving
   environment. As with those in other professions working near roadways,
   officers are at increased danger when they have stopped on the shoulder.
   Statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicate that from
   2000 to 2009, 47 U.S. officers were killed while performing traffic
   stops and 73 were killed while directing traffic or assisting motorists;
   101 officers were killed feloniously while conducting traffic stops. To
   mitigate dangers, every state except Hawaii has implemented a law
   requiring drivers to move over or slow down when approaching a patrol
   vehicle stopped at roadside. This research observed the behavior of more
   than 9,000 right-lane vehicles passing staged police stops on Florida
   freeways in north and central Florida. Each staged stop involved the use
   of a civilian research vehicle, a marked police vehicle, video recording
   of passing traffic, and measurement of passing vehicle speeds with a
   laser speed measurement device. Overall compliance with the move over
   component of the Florida laws was 75.9\%, but compliance with the legal
   requirement to slow to 20 mph below the speed limit when not moving over
   was just 5.8\%. Examination of patrol vehicle emergency lighting
   configurations determined that the use of blue and red emergency lights
   increased compliance in a statistically significant way, to nearly 80\%,
   versus 68.8\% when only amber lights were used. Additionally, when blue
   and red lights were not used, driver merge maneuvers were executed
   closer to the stop, and mean speeds of non move over vehicles were
   higher.}},

Title = {{Kinematic and dynamic gait compensations resulting from knee instability
   in a rat model of osteoarthritis}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) results in pain and disability;
   however, preclinical OA models often focus on joint-level changes. Gait
   analysis is one method used to evaluate both preclinical OA models and
   OA patients. The objective of this study is to describe spatiotemporal
   and ground reaction force changes in a rat medial meniscus transection
   (MMT) model of knee OA and to compare these gait measures with assays of
   weight bearing and tactile allodynia.
   Methods: Sixteen rats were used in the study. The medial collateral
   ligament (MCL) was transected in twelve Lewis rats (male, 200 to 250 g);
   in six rats, the medial meniscus was transected, and the remaining six
   rats served as sham controls. The remaining four rats served as naive
   controls. Gait, weight-bearing as measured by an incapacitance meter,
   and tactile allodynia were assessed on postoperative days 9 to 24. On
   day 28, knee joints were collected for histology. Cytokine
   concentrations in the serum were assessed with a 10-plex cytokine panel.
   Results: Weight bearing was not affected by sham or MMT surgery;
   however, the MMT group had decreased mechanical paw-withdrawal
   thresholds in the operated limb relative to the contralateral limb (P =
   0.017). The gait of the MMT group became increasingly asymmetric from
   postoperative days 9 to 24 (P = 0.020); moreover, MMT animals tended to
   spend more time on their contralateral limb than their operated limb
   while walking (P < 0.1). Ground reaction forces confirmed temporal
   shifts in symmetry and stance time, as the MMT group had lower vertical
   and propulsive ground reaction forces in their operated limb relative to
   the contralateral limb, naive, and sham controls (P < 0.05). Levels of
   interleukin 6 in the MMT group tended to be higher than naive controls
   (P = 0.072). Histology confirmed increased cartilage damage in the MMT
   group, consistent with OA initiation. Post hoc analysis revealed that
   gait symmetry, stance time imbalance, peak propulsive force, and serum
   interleukin 6 concentrations had significant correlations to the
   severity of cartilage lesion formation.
   Conclusion: These data indicate significant gait compensations were
   present in the MMT group relative to medial collateral ligament (MCL)
   injury (sham) alone and naive controls. Moreover, these data suggest
   that gait compensations are likely driven by meniscal instability and/or
   cartilage damage, and not by MCL injury alone.}},

Abstract = {{For smart home researchers, it is essential to test activity recognition
   algorithms with various sets of sensory data. However, diverse sensory
   datasets are not always available due to several constraints, including
   limited budgets. Consequently, smart home simulators have recently grown
   in importance. However, there is still a need for realistic synthetic
   sensory data. This paper presents a simulator, `Persim 3D', which relies
   on automatic scenario generation to create realistic sensory data.
   Persim 3D provides a 3D graphical user interface to help users' spatial
   perception, sensors that operate in real-time, similar to actual
   sensors, and a virtual character that lives in a virtual environment.
   These features allow users to generate longitudinal simulation data and
   eventually contribute to activity recognition research.}},

Title = {{Chamber simulation of photooxidation of dimethyl sulfide and isoprene in

Pages = {{10257-10269}},
Abstract = {{To improve the model prediction for the formation of H2SO4 and
   methanesulfonic acid (MSA), aerosol-phase reactions of gaseous dimethyl
   sulfide (DMS) oxidation products {[}e. g., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] in
   aerosol have been included in the DMS kinetic model with the recently
   reported gas-phase reactions and their rate constants. To determine the
   rate constants of aerosol-phase reactions of both DMSO and its major
   gaseous products {[}e. g., dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) and methanesulfinic
   acid (MSIA)], DMSO was photooxidized in the presence of NOx using a 2
   m(3) Teflon film chamber. The rate constants tested in the DMSO kinetic
   mechanisms were then incorporated into the DMS photooxidation mechanism.
   The model simulation using the newly constructed DMS oxidation mechanims
   was compared to chamber data obtained from the phototoxiation of DMS in
   the presence of NOx. Within 120-min simulation, the predicted
   concentrations of MSA increase by 200-400\% and those of H2SO4, by
   50-200\% due to aerosol-phase chemistry. This was well substantiated
   with experimental data. To study the effect of coexisting volatile
   organic compounds, the photooxidation of DMS in the presence of isoprene
   and NOx has been simulated using the newly constructed DMS kinetic model
   integrated with the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) for isoprene
   oxidation, and compared to chamber data. With the high concentrations of
   DMS (250 ppb) and isoprene (560-2248 ppb), both the model simulation and
   experimental data showed an increase in the yields of MSA and H2SO4 as
   the isoprene concentration increased.}},

Abstract = {{Cerium-doped titanium oxide (Ce-TiO2) nanoparticles were prepared by a
   simple sol-gel method. Ce-doping decreased the crystal size of TiO2,
   increased the catalyst surface area, and inhibited the growth of rutile
   TiO2 crystals. Ce-TiO2 nanoparticles were also dispersed on SBA-15,
   mesoporous silica with one-dimensional pores, forming a Ce-TiO2/SBA-15
   nanocomposite. The nanocomposite materials were well characterized and
   tested as photocatalysts to convert CO2 and H2O to value-added fuels,
   mainly CO and CH4, under UV-vis illumination. Compared with pristine
   TiO2, TiO2 doped by 1 or 3\% Ce improved the production of CO by four
   times. The reason may be due to the facilitated charge transfer induced
   by the doped Ce ions, the higher surface area of the catalyst, as well
   as the stabilization of anatase phase. However, too high a Ce
   concentration reduced the catalytic activity, likely due to the
   formation of recombination centers. Compared with unsupported Ce-TiO2,
   Ce-TiO2 supported on SBA-15 remarkably enhanced the CO2 reduction rate.
   Ce-TiO2/SBA-15 with a Ti : Si ratio of 1 : 4 demonstrated 8-fold
   enhancement in CO production and 115-fold enhancement in CH4 production.
   By contrast, amorphous silica as the substrate was much inferior to
   SBA-15. The findings in this work reveal a promising nanostructured
   catalyst material for solar fuel production using CO2 and H2O as the
   feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the ubiquitous use of distance transforms in the shape analysis
   literature and the popularity of fast marching and fast sweeping
   methods-essentially Hamilton-Jacobi solvers, there is very little recent
   work leveraging the Hamilton-Jacobi to Schrodinger connection for
   representational and computational purposes. In this work, we exploit
   the linearity of the Schrodinger equation to (i) design fast discrete
   convolution methods using the FFT to compute the distance transform,
   (ii) derive the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) via the squared
   magnitude of the Fourier transform of the wave function, (iii) extend
   the Schrodinger formalism to cover the case of curves parametrized as
   line segments as opposed to point-sets, (iv) demonstrate that the
   Schrodinger formalism permits the addition of wave functions-an
   operation that is not allowed for distance transforms, and finally (v)
   construct a fundamentally new Schrodinger equation and show that it can
   represent both the distance transform and its gradient density-not
   possible in earlier efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical description of grain growth was based for many years on
   the so-called spherical model. The spherical model represents a
   polyhedral grain with N faces and a volume, V, by a sphere with an equal
   volume having the equivalent grain radius, R. That model leads to
   several interesting results concerning normal and abnormal grain growth
   as well as grain size distribution. Nevertheless, representation of
   grains by spheres entails a fundamental limitation: namely, all
   topological information of the polyhedral grain is forsaken. The rich
   variety of grain shapes occurring in three-dimensional polycrystalline
   networks, however, makes their energetic and kinetic analyses extremely
   difficult. To simplify analyses of isotropic polycrystals, average
   N-hedra and generalized N-hedra ANHs or GNHs (N = 3, 4, 5, infinity)
   were created as a set of regular polyhedra, consisting of N identical
   faces that act as topological proxies for analyzing irregular grains
   containing N mixed faces. The adoption of ANH/GNH as representations of
   polyhedral grains led to further progress in our understanding of grain
   growth, particularly those aspects related to topological behavior. This
   paper summarizes some recent advances of representing polyhedral grains
   by ANHs/GNHs rather than by spheres.}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the implementation of highly compact three
   dimensional (3D) integrable metamaterial based transmission lines on a
   low resistivity CMOS grade silicon substrate for microwave and
   millimeter wave applications. The composite right-left handed (CRLH)
   architecture is able to be integrated with an integrated circuit (IC)
   using a multilayer surface micromachined fabrication process as a
   post-CMOS process. The fabrication process employs the negative tone
   photo sensitive Benzocyclobutene (BCB) as a low-loss dielectric
   interlayer material allowing packaging compatible high performance RF
   circuits. Since the low temperature and multilayer fabrication is
   compatible with CMOS/MEMS processes, it allows the batch fabrication of
   multiple devices and the easy implementation of 3D vertical
   interconnects. The design, modeling, fabrication and on-wafer
   characterization are presented for 50 Omega compact multilayer finite
   ground coplanar waveguide (FGC) CRLH unit cells and transmission lines
   for broadband and multiband operation at Ku and Ka frequencies of 14 GHz
   and 35 GHz, respectively. Also, the comparison between the simulation
   and measurement results up to 40 GHz on the aforementioned 3D
   electromagnetic structures is provided. The left handed capacitance and
   inductance components of the CRLH structures are implemented with
   photolithographically defined Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) capacitors and
   BCB embedded meander inductors, respectively, which allows the
   fabrication of very compact CRLH devices. The fabricated dual band unit
   cell features a size of lambda(0)/30 at 14 GHz and an insertion loss of
   less than 2dB within the passband.}},

Abstract = {{A compact frequency equalizer based on distributed passive circuits is

   multiple distributed inductive and capacitive elements. As a test
   vehicle, a 3-stage broadband amplifier has been implemented, connected
   to the designed equalizer, and characterized in the targeted frequency
   range. Without the equalizer, the measured gain of the implemented
   amplifier varies from 34.7 dB to 46.97 dB showing a 12.27 dB roll off in
   the frequency range. After connecting the equalizer, overall gain
   variation is reduced to +/- 1.1dB. Compared with other preexisting
   frequency equalizers, the implemented one features a small footprint of
   6x8 mm(2) and a wide frequency bandwidth of 100MHz to 7GHz. Detail

Abstract = {{CubeSats are a simple, low-cost option for developing quickly-deployable
   satellites, however, the tradeoff for these benefits is a small physical
   size, which restricts the CubeSat's solar panels' size and thus the
   available power budget and stored energy reserves. These power/energy
   limitations restrict the CubeSat's functionality and data processing
   capabilities, which makes leveraging CubeSats for compute-intensive
   missions challenging. Additionally, increasing sensor capabilities due
   to technological advances further compounds this functionality
   limitation, enabling sensors to gather significantly more data than a
   satellite's limited downlink bandwidth can accommodate. The influx in
   sensed data, which is particularly high for image-processing
   applications, introduces a pressing need for high-performance on-board
   data processing, which preprocesses and/or compresses the data before
   transmission. FPGAs have been incorporated into state-of-the-art
   satellites to provide high-performance on-board data processing, while
   simultaneously reducing the satellites' data processing energy
   consumption. However, even though FPGAs can provide these capabilities
   in full-scale satellites, a CubeSat's limited power budget makes
   integration of FPGAs into CubeSats a challenging task. For example, the
   commonly used Virtex4QV Radiation Tolerant FPGA family's average power
   consumption ranges from 1.25 to 12.5 Watts, whereas the CubeSat's power
   budget ranges from 2 to 8 Watts, with the smallest, cheapest CubeSat
   systems at the lower end of this range. Therefore, in order to
   successfully integrate FPGAs into CubeSats, the components' power
   consumptions must be clearly budgeted with respect to the CubeSat's
   specific functionalities and orbital pattern, which dictates the
   available power and stored energy reserves. In this paper, we present
   two detailed energy reserve budgeting case studies for FPGA-based
   CubeSats with respect to stored energy reserves for image compression
   and processing using a Canny edge detector. CubeSat designers can
   leverage this energy reserve budget with the application-specific
   components' power consumptions for applications such as hyper-spectral
   imaging (HSI), ground motion target indication (GMTI), and star tracking
   to quickly determine maximum payload operational time with respect to
   specific orbital patterns and mission requirements.}},

Abstract = {{On-board processing systems are often deployed in hostile environments
   and must therefore adhere to stringent constraints such as low power,
   small size, and high dependability in the presence of faults. Since it
   is challenging for designers to simultaneously consider the many design
   tradeoffs and meet the numerous and unique demands and constraints of
   various on-board systems, designers typically rely on a limited set of
   familiar devices and design strategies that may not be optimal for a
   particular system's operating situation. In this paper, we present a
   framework to ease these system design challenges and aid designers in
   considering a broad range of devices and strategies for on-board
   processing, highlighting the most promising options early in the design
   process. Our framework considers the interactions between four key
   system properties-device, mission, fault-tolerant strategy, and
   application-which allows the framework to evaluate how well a design
   will meet mission constraints based on design evaluation metrics to
   identify tradeoffs between varying devices and fault-tolerant
   strategies. This paper focuses on the power and dependability evaluation
   metrics, which our framework calculates and leverages to evaluate the
   effectiveness of varying system designs. Finally, we use our framework
   to evaluate system designs for two case studies on hyperspectral-imaging
   (HSI) missions.}},

   inferring the hidden states and unknown causes/inputs while learning the
   parameters of the model. It is observed that the algorithm is able to
   extract bases from the time varying image sequence that resembles

Abstract = {{Dictionary.com defines learning as the process of acquiring knowledge.
   In psychology, learning is defined as the modification of behavior
   through training. In our work, we combine these definitions to define
   learning as the modification of a system model to incorporate the
   knowledge acquired by new observations. During learning, the system
   creates and modifies a model to improve its performance. As new samples
   are introduced, the system updates its model based on the new
   information provided by the samples. However, this update may not
   necessarily improve the model. We propose a Bayesian surprise metric to
   differentiate good data (beneficial) from outliers (detrimental), and
   thus help to selectively adapt the model parameters. The surprise metric
   is calculated based on the difference between the prior and the
   posterior distributions of the model when a new sample is introduced.
   The metric is useful not only to identify outlier data, but also to
   differentiate between the data carrying useful information for improving
   the model and those carrying no new information (redundant). Allowing
   only the relevant data to update the model would speed up the learning
   process and prevent the system from overfitting. The method is
   demonstrated in all three learning procedures: supervised,
   semi-supervised and unsupervised. The results show the benefit of
   surprise in both clustering and outlier detection.}},

Abstract = {{The class imbalance problem is pervasive in machine learning. To
   accurately classify the minority class, current methods rely on sampling
   schemes to close the gap between classes, or on the application of error
   costs to create algorithms which favor the minority class. Since the
   sampling schemes and costs must be specified, these methods are highly
   dependent on the class distributions present in the training set. This
   makes them difficult to apply in settings where the level of imbalance
   changes, such as in online streaming data. Often they cannot handle
   multi-class problems. We present a novel single-class algorithm called
   Class Conditional Nearest Neighbor Distribution (CCNND), which mitigates
   the effects of class imbalance through local geometric structure in the
   data. Our algorithm can be applied seamlessly to problems with any level
   of imbalance or number of classes, and new examples are simply added to
   the training set. We show that it performs as well as or better than top
   sampling and cost-weighting methods on four imbalanced datasets from the
   UCI Machine Learning Repository, and then apply it to streaming data
   from the oil and gas industry alongside a modified nearest neighbor
   algorithm. Our algorithm's competitive performance relative to the
   state-of-the-art, coupled with its extremely simple implementation and
   automatic adjustment for minority classes, demonstrates that it is worth
   further study.}},

Abstract = {{Classification can be seen as a mapping problem where some function of
   x(n) predicts the expectation of a class variable y(n). This paper uses
   kernel methods for the prediction of class variable, together with a
   recently proposed cost function for classification, called
   Correntropy-loss (C-loss) function. C-Loss is a non-convex loss function
   based on a similarity measure called correntropy and is known to closely
   approximate the ideal 0 - 1 loss function for classification. This paper
   shows via experimental results that, by replacing the cost function -
   Mean Square Error (MSE) in a conventional kernel based functional
   mapping, by a non-convex loss function C-Loss, a non-overfitting, and
   hence, a better classifier can be obtained. Since gradient descent can
   still be used with the C-loss and the kernel mapper, the classifier can
   be easily trained without performance penalty, compared to the SVM,
   which makes the approach very practical.}},

Abstract = {{Correntropy, as an adaptive criterion of Information Theoretic Learning
   (ITL), has been successfully used in signal processing and machine
   learning. How to appropriately select the kernel width of correntropy is
   a crucial problem in correntropy applications. Existing kernel width
   selection methods are not suitable enough for this problem. In this
   paper, we develop an adaptive method for kernel width selection in
   correntropy. Based on the Middleton's non-Gaussian models, this method
   utilizes the kurtosis as a ratio to adjust the standard deviation of the
   prediction error to obtain the kernel width online. The superior
   performance of the new method has been demonstrated by simulation
   examples in the noisy frequency doubling and echo cancelation problems.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced thermal conductivity oxide fuels offer increases in both safety

   performed for 4 hours at 1200 similar to 1600 degrees C and SPS was
   employed only for 5 mins at the same temperature. While oxidative
   sintering failed to achieve enhanced thermal conductivity, the SPS
   sintered pellet obtained promising features such as higher density,
   better interfacial contact, and reduced chemical reaction. Thermal
   conductivity measurement at 100 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 900
   degrees C revealed maximum 62\% higher thermal conductivity value, when
   compared to UO2 pellets, in SPS sintered UO2-10vol\% SiC composite

Journal = {{CROP \& PASTURE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Cotton is one of the most important irrigated crops in subtropical
   Australia. In recent years, cotton production has been severely affected
   by the worst drought in recorded history, with the 2007-08 growing
   season recording the lowest average cotton yield in 30 years. The use of
   a crop simulation model to simulate the long-term temporal distribution
   of cotton yields under different levels of irrigation and the marginal
   value for each unit of water applied is important in determining the
   economic feasibility of current irrigation practices. The objectives of
   this study were to: (i) evaluate the CROPGRO-Cotton simulation model for
   studying crop growth under deficit irrigation scenarios across ten
   locations in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld); (ii) evaluate
   agronomic and economic responses to water inputs across the ten
   locations; and (iii) determine the economically optimal irrigation
   level. The CROPGRO-Cotton simulation model was evaluated using 2 years
   of experimental data collected at Kingsthorpe, Qld The model was further
   evaluated using data from nine locations between northern NSW and
   southern Qld. Long-term simulations were based on the prevalent
   furrow-irrigation practice of refilling the soil profile when the
   plant-available soil water content is <50\%. The model closely estimated
   lint yield for all locations evaluated. Our results showed that the
   amounts of water needed to maximise profit and maximise yield are
   different, which has economic and environmental implications. Irrigation
   needed to maximise profits varied with both agronomic and economic
   factors, which can be quite variable with season and location.
   Therefore, better tools and information that consider the agronomic and
   economic implications of irrigation decisions need to be developed and
   made available to growers.}},

Title = {{A metastable liquid precursor phase of calcium carbonate and its
   interactions with polyaspartate}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{291-312}},
Abstract = {{Invertebrate organisms that use calcium carbonate extensively in the
   formation of their hard tissues have the ability to deposit biominerals
   with control over crystal size, shape, orientation, phase, texture, and
   location. It has been proposed by our group that charged
   polyelectrolytes, like acidic proteins, may be employed by organisms to
   direct crystal growth through an intermediate liquid phase in a process
   called the polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process. Recently, it
   has been proposed that calcium carbonate crystallization, even in the
   absence of any additives, follows a non-classical, multi-step
   crystallization process by first associating into a liquid precursor
   phase before transition into solid amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and
   eventually crystalline calcium carbonates. In order to determine if the
   PILP process involves the promotion, or stabilization, of a naturally
   occurring liquid precursor to ACC, we have analyzed the formation of
   saturated and supersaturated calcium carbonate-bicarbonate solutions
   using Ca2+ ion selective electrodes, pH electrodes, isothermal titration
   calorimetry, nanoparticle tracking analysis, C-13 T-2 relaxation
   measurements, and C-13 PFG-STE diffusion NMR measurements. These studies
   provide evidence that, in the absences of additives, and at near neutral
   pH (emulating the conditions of biomineralization and biomimetic model
   systems), a condensed phase of liquid-like droplets of calcium carbonate
   forms at a critical concentration, where it is stabilized intrinsically
   by bicarbonate ions. In experiments with polymer additive, the data
   suggests that the polymer is kinetically stabilizing this liquid
   condensed phase in a distinct and pronounced fashion during the so
   called PILP process. Verification of this precursor phase and the
   stabilization that polymer additives provide during the PILP process
   sheds new light on the mechanism through which biological organisms can
   exercise such control over deposited CaCO3 biominerals, and on the
   potential means to generate in vitro mineral products with features that
   resemble biominerals seen in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its ability of delivering virtually unlimited computing power as
   a metered service, the emerging cloud computing paradigm becomes an
   attractive option for scientific communities to experiment large-scale
   resource-demanding applications traditionally deployed in high
   performance computing (HPC) centers. Planning resource rental is
   difficult in cloud environment because various parties may have
   fundamentally different interests. To accommodate such diverse
   heterogeneity, designing flexible resource rental models for multiple
   parties in the cloud market becomes a challenging issue. In this study,
   we investigate the problem of designing flexible resource rental models
   for implementing HPC-as-a-Service in cloud market. First, from the
   perspective of resource customers, we present cost-effective resource
   rental planning models to better utilize on-demand and spot resources in
   cloud. Next, we approach the problem from the perspective of resource
   providers, and propose a novel service scheduling model for a
   multi-tenant cloud resource sharing platform. The remaining work to
   complete the PhD dissertation is then presented.
   The proposed research highlights flexibility for resource rental
   planning in the following two aspects. (1) Flexibility for resource
   customers ensures them to deploy elastic HPC applications taking most
   advantage of both fixed-price on-demand resources and dynamic spot
   resources. (2) Flexibility for resource providers accommodates
   differentiated service requirements from various customers and achieves
   efficient HPC service scheduling. We believe that the proposed work
   presented in this paper offers a novel means to address the need for
   flexible resource rental models in cloud, and sheds light on future
   research in the broad area of resource management in cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{In Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, machines are wirelessly
   connected to accomplish collaborative tasks without human intervention,
   and provide ubiquitous solutions for real-time monitoring. The real-time
   monitoring application is one of the killer applications for M2M
   communications, where M2M nodes transmit sensed data to an M2M gateway,
   and then the M2M gateway can have real-time monitoring for each sensing
   region. In real-time monitoring application, the energy consumption for
   the M2M nodes to send sensed data to the M2M gateway is an important
   factor that significantly affects the performance of the system. In this
   paper, we first consider the energy consumption as well as the validity
   of sensed data to design either centralized or distributed
   energy-efficient reporting mechanisms. We then analyze the complexity of
   the reporting mechanisms. Simulation experiments are conducted to
   investigate the performance of the proposed mechanisms, and show that
   the distributed mechanism outperforms the centralized mechanism when the
   M2M nodes are mobile.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of two sources wanting to share information
   through a potentially untrustworthy intermediary node. We assume that
   the two sources transmit random symbols simultaneously and that the
   intermediary node relays the information in the amplify-and-forward
   manner. We show that under a certain sufficient condition on the
   channel, it is possible to asymptotically detect whether or not the
   intermediary node is degrading the channel by sending out manipulated
   symbols. This can be done solely by each source examining its received
   distribution conditioned on what it transmitted; thus allowing for a
   minimally invasive approach to determining if the intermediary node is
   acting maliciously. More specifically, we model the potential malicious
   action of the intermediate node by an ``attack{''} channel. An estimate
   of the attack channel is obtained from the received conditional
   distribution empirically observed by a source node. We show that the
   estimated attack channel converges in probability to the true attack
   channel if the intermediate node is not acting maliciously. Otherwise
   there is a separation between the estimated and true attacking channels
   with high probability. This result provides us a clear-cut criterion to
   determine whether the intermediate node is malicious or not.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum trading creates more accessing opportunities for secondary
   users (SUs) and economically benefits the primary users (PUs). However,
   it is challenging to implement spectrum trading in multi-hop cognitive
   radio networks (CRNs) due to harsh cognitive radio (CR) requirements on
   SUs' devices and complex conflict and competition relationship among
   different CR sessions. Unlike the per-user based spectrum trading
   designs in previous studies, in this paper, we propose a novel session
   based spectrum trading system, spectrum clouds, in multi-hop CRNs. In
   spectrum clouds, we introduce a new service provider, called secondary
   service provider (SSP), to harvest the available spectrum bands and
   facilitate the accessing of SUs without CR capability. The SSP also
   conducts spectrum trading among CR sessions w.r.t. their conflicts and
   competitions. Leveraging a 3-dimensional (3-D) conflict graph, we
   mathematically describe the conflicts and competitions among the
   candidate sessions for spectrum trading. Given the rate requirements and
   bidding values of candidate trading sessions, we formulate the optimal
   spectrum trading into the SSP's revenue maximization problem under
   multiple cross-layer constraints in multi-hop CRNs. In view of the
   NP-hardness of the problem, we have also developed heuristic algorithms
   to pursue feasible solutions. Through extensive simulations, we show
   that the solutions found by the proposed algorithms are close to the
   optimal one.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor-enabled RFID technology has generated a lot of interest from
   industries lately. Integrated with miniaturized sensors, RFID tags could
   provide not only the IDs but also valuable real-time information about
   the state of the corresponding objects or the surrounding environment,
   which is beneficial to many practical applications, such as warehouse
   management and inventory control. In this paper, we study the problem on
   how to design efficient protocols to collect such sensor information
   from numerous tags in a large-scale RFID system with a number of readers
   deployed. Different from information collection in the small RFID system
   covered by only one reader, in the multi-reader scenario, each reader
   has to first find out which tags located in its interrogation region in
   order to read information from them. We start with two categories of
   warm-up solutions that are directly extended from the existing
   information collection protocols for single-reader RFID systems, and
   show that all of them do not work well for the multi-reader information
   collection problem due to their inefficiency of identifying the
   interrogated tags. Then, we propose a novel solution, called the Bloom
   filter based Information Collection protocol (BIC). In BIC, the
   interrogated tag identification can be efficiently achieved with a
   distributively constructed Bloom filter, which significantly reduces the
   communication overhead and thus the protocol execution time. Extensive
   simulations show that BIC performs better than all the warm-up solutions
   and its execution time is within 3 times of the lower bound.}},

Abstract = {{Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology has been adopted in
   many applications, such as inventory control, object tracking, theft
   prevention, and supply chain management. Privacy-preserving
   authentication in RFID systems is a very important problem. Existing
   protocols employ tree structures to achieve fast authentication. We
   observe that these protocols require a tag to transmit a large amount of
   data in each authentication, which costs significant bandwidth and
   energy overhead. Current protocols also impose heavy computational
   demand on the RFID reader. To address these issues, we design two
   privacy-preserving protocols based on a new technique called
   cryptographical encoding, which significantly reduces both
   authentication data transmitted by each tag and computation overhead
   incurred at the reader. Our analysis shows that the new protocols are
   able to reduce authentication data by more than an order of magnitude
   and reduce computational demand by about an order of magnitude, when
   comparing with the best existing protocol.}},

Abstract = {{We propose joint channel sensing, probing, and accessing schemes for
   secondary users in cognitive radio networks. Our method has time and
   space complexity O(N center dot k) for a network with N channels and k

   adversary (thus non-stochastic), it results in a total regret uniformly
   upper bounded by Theta(root TN log N), w.h.p, for communication lasts
   for T timeslots. Our protocol can be implemented in a distributed manner
   due to the nonstochastic channel assumption. Our experiments show that
   our schemes achieve almost optimal throughput compared with an optimal
   static strategy, and perform significantly better than previous methods
   in many settings.}},

   per-packet processing overhead to accommodate future routers that have
   extremely high packet rates. In terms of accuracy, we want to generate
   precise measurement results with small bias and standard deviation. To
   meet these challenges, we design a new measurement method that employs a
   compact data structure for packet information storage and uses a novel
   statistical inference approach for OD-flow size estimation. We perform

Abstract = {{We study distributed link scheduling for throughput maximization in
   wireless networks. The majority of results on link scheduling assume
   binary interference models for simplicity. While the physical

   problem becomes notoriously harder under the physical interference
   model. There have been just a few existing results on centralized link
   scheduling under the physical interference model, though distributed
   schedulings are more practical. In this paper, by leveraging the
   partition and shifting strategies and the pick-and-compare scheme, we
   present the first distributed link scheduling algorithm that can achieve
   a constant fraction of the optimal capacity region subject to physical
   interference constraints in the linear power setting for multihop

Abstract = {{In this work, we address the problem of finding experts using chains of
   social referrals and profile matching with only local information in
   online social networks. By assuming that users are selfish, rational,
   and have privately known cost of participating in the referrals, we
   design a novel truthful efficient mechanism in which an expert-finding
   query will be relayed by intermediate users. When receiving a referral
   request, a participant will locally choose among her neighbors some user
   to relay the request. In our mechanism, several closely coupled methods
   are carefully designed to improve the search performance, including,
   profile matching, social acquaintance prediction, score function for
   locally choosing relay neighbors, and budget estimation. We conduct
   extensive experiments on several datasets of online social networks. The
   extensive study of our mechanism shows that the success rate of our
   mechanism is about 90\% in finding closely matched experts using only
   local search and limited budget, which significantly improves the
   previously best rate 20\%. The overall cost of finding an expert by our
   truthful mechanism is about 20\% of the untruthful method and only about
   2\% of the method that always selects high-degree neighbors. The median
   length of social referral chains is 6 using our localized search
   decision, which surprisingly matches the well-known small-world
   phenomenon of global social structures.}},

Title = {{Photoacoustic tomography can detect cerebral hemodynamic alterations in

Journal = {{ACTA NEUROBIOLOGIAE EXPERIMENTALIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the most recognized
   causes of neurological deficits in children. Cerebral blood flow (CBF)
   reductions, as seen with HIE, resulting in neuronal injury have not been
   evaluated in real-time. Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) is a form of
   optical imaging which can detect cerebral hemodynamic alterations in a
   non-invasive, non-ionizing fashion via changes in hemoglobin optical
   absorption. Further, this technology has the potential to capture
   cerebral blood volume (CBV) fluctuations and perhaps CBF changes in
   real-time. We hypothesized that PAT can detect a reduction in cerebral
   hemoglobin optical absorption, and therefore CBF, in a neonatal model of
   hypoxia-ischemia. To investigate, P7 rats underwent right carotid artery
   ligation and exposure to 8\% oxygen for 60 minutes while imaged with PAT
   every 20 minutes. Cerebral hemodynamic alterations, as measured by mean
   optical absorption (MOA), were calculated as a change from baseline.
   Global and regional MOA was analyzed using a linear mixed model. Global
   MOA was reduced within the right hemisphere as compared to the left
   during hypoxia. Regional differences in MOA were detected between the
   left and right sides for the middle and posterior cortical regions.
   Injury was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. We conclude that a
   reduction in global and regional MOA, and hence CBF, could be identified
   by PAT in a neonatal rat model of HIE. This is the first study described
   in the literature utilizing a neonatal rat model of HIE to demonstrate
   in vivo alterations in cerebral hemodynamics in a non-invasive and near
   real-time fashion.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in use of conducting oxide materials in new
   forms of transparent, flexible or wearable electronics on cheap
   substrates, including paper. While Si-based thin film transistors (TFTs)
   are widely used in displays, there are some drawbacks such as light
   sensitivity and light degradation and low field effect mobility (<1
   cm(2)/Vs). For example, virtually all liquid crystal displays (LCDs) use
   TFTs imbedded in the panel itself. One of the promising alternatives to
   use of Si TFTs involves amorphous or nanocrystalline n-type oxide
   semiconductors. There have been promising results with zinc oxide,
   indium gallium oxide and zinc tin oxide channels. In this paper, recent
   progress in these new materials for TFTs on substrates such as paper is
   reviewed. In addition, InGaZnO transistor arrays show promise for
   driving laminar electroluminescent, organic light-emitting diode (OLED)
   and LCD displays. These transistors may potentially operate at up to an
   order of magnitude faster than Si TFTs. We have fabricated bottom-gate
   amorphous (alpha-) indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (InGaZnO4) thin film
   transistors (TFTs) on both paper and glass substrates at low processing
   temperature (<= 100 degrees C). As a water and solvent barrier layer,
   cyclotene (BCB 3022-35 from Dow Chemical) was spin-coated on the entire
   paper substrate. TFTs on the paper substrates exhibited saturation
   mobility (mu(sat)) of 1.2 cm(2).V-1.s(-1), threshold voltage (V-TH) of
   1.9V, subthreshold gate-voltage swing (S) of 0.65V.decade(-1), and drain
   current on-to-off ratio (I-ON/I-OFF) of similar to 10(4). These values
   were only slightly inferior to those obtained from devices on glass
   substrates (mu(sat)similar to 2.1 cm(2).V-1.s(-1), V-TH similar to 0 V,
   S similar to 0.74 V.decade(-1), and I-ON/I-OFF = 10(5)-10(6)). The
   uneven surface of the paper sheet led to relatively poor contact
   resistance between source-drain electrodes and channel layer. Future
   areas for development are identified.}},

Abstract = {{Improved fire management of savannas and open woodlands requires better
   understanding of the fundamental connection between fuel heterogeneity,

   predicting fire behaviour at the submetre scale, including measurements
   of forest understorey fuels using ground-based LIDAR (light detection
   and ranging) coupled with infrared thermography for recording precise
   fire temperatures. We used ensemble classification and regression trees
   to examine the relationships between fuel characteristics and fire
   temperature dynamics. Fire behaviour was best predicted by
   characterising fuelbed heterogeneity and continuity across multiple
   plots of similar fire intensity, where impacts from plot-to-plot
   variation in fuel, fire and weather did not overwhelm the effects of
   fuels. The individual plot-level results revealed the significance of
   specific fuel types (e.g. bare soil, pine leaf litter) as well as the
   spatial configuration of fire. This was the first known study to link
   the importance of fuelbed continuity and the heterogeneity associated
   with fuel types to fire behaviour at metre to submetre scales and
   provides the next step in understanding the complex responses of

Abstract = {{Stochastic Clustering Auctions (SCAs) constitute a class of cooperative
   auction methods that enable improvement of the global cost of the task
   allocations obtained with fast greedy algorithms. Prior research had
   developed Contracts Sequencing Algorithms (CSAs) that are deterministic
   and enable transfers, swaps, and other types of contracts between team
   members. In contrast to CSAs, SCAs use stochastic transfers or swaps
   between the task clusters assigned to each team member and have
   algorithm parameters that can enable trade-offs between optimality and
   computational and communication requirements. The first SCA was based on
   a ``Gibbs Sampler{''} and constrained the stochastic cluster
   reallocations to simple single transfers or swaps; it is applicable to
   heterogeneous teams. Subsequently, a more efficient SCA was developed,
   based on the generalized Swendsen-Wang method; it achieves the increased
   efficiency by connecting tasks that appear to be synergistic and then
   stochastically reassigning these connected tasks, hence enabling more
   complex and efficient movements between clusters than the first SCA.
   However, its application was limited to homogeneous teams. The
   contribution of this work is to present an efficient SCA for
   heterogeneous teams; it is based on a modified Swendsen-Wang method. For
   centralized auctioning and homogeneous teams, extensive numerical
   experiments were used to provide a comparison in terms of costs and
   computational and communication requirements of the three SCAs and a
   baseline CSA. It was seen that the new SCA maintains the efficiency of
   the second SCA and can yield similar performance to the baseline CSA in
   far fewer iterations. The same metrics were used to evaluate the
   performance of the new SCA for heterogeneous teams. A distributed
   version of the new SCA was also evaluated in numerical experiments. The
   results show that, as expected, the distributed SCA continually improves
   the global performance with each iteration, but converges to a lower
   cost solution than the centralized SCA.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a general methodology for energy estimation of
   bus-based multi-core processors assuming that DVS can be used for both
   buses and cores. Our formulation can provide tradeoffs between DVS
   setting for buses and cores. We examine this methodology using various
   parallel matrix multiplication algorithms that are suitable for shared
   memory multicore machines with L1 and L2 caches.
   Our simulation results show that the simultaneously changing the voltage
   of buses along with cores can result in 10 - 20\% reduction in the
   overall energy requirements as compared to only changing the core
   voltages. This is under the assumption that sufficient slack is
   available for DVS to be able to work at lower voltages to save energy.
   The methods proposed in this paper demonstrate the usefulness of
   multiple element optimization in multicore architectures. The
   experiments show that a good understanding of the overall tradeoffs
   between the effect of these elements in the overall performance and
   energy requirements can lead to improved results in the energy
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 20 to 30 years, the analysis of tandem mass spectrometry
   data generated from protein fragments has become the dominant method for
   the identification and classification of unknown protein samples. With
   wide ranging application in numerous scientific disciplines such as
   pharmaceutical research, cancer diagnostics, and bacterial
   identification, the need for accurate protein identification remains
   important, and the ability to produce more accurate identifications at
   faster rates would be of great benefit to society as a whole. As a key
   step towards improving the speed, and thus achievable accuracy, of
   protein identification algorithms, this paper presents a FPGA-based
   solution that considerably accelerates the Isotope Pattern Calculator, a
   computationally intense subroutine common in de novo protein
   identification. Although previous work shows incremental progress in the
   acceleration of software-based IPC (mainly by sacrificing accuracy for
   speed), to the best of our knowledge this is the first work to consider
   IPC on FPGAs. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation
   of an efficient and configurable IPC kernel. The described design
   provides 23 customization parameters allowing for general use within
   many protein identification algorithms. We discuss several parameter
   tradeoffs and demonstrate experimentally their effect on performance
   when comparing execution of optimized IPC software with various
   configurations of our hardware IPC solution; we demonstrate between 72
   and 566 speedup on a single Stratix IV E530 FPGA. Finally, a favorable
   IPC configuration is scaled to multiple FPGAs, where a best-case speedup
   of 3340 on 16 FPGAs is observed when experimentally evaluated on a
   single node of Novo-G, the reconfigurable supercomputer in the NSF CHREC
   Center at Florida.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimization problem of minimizing resource
   rental cost for running elastic applications in cloud while meeting
   application service requirements. Such a problem arises when excessive
   generated data incurs significant monetary cost on transfer and
   inventory in cloud. The goal of planning is to make resource rental
   decisions in response to varying application progress in the most
   cost-effective way. To address this problem, we first develop a
   Deterministic Resource Rental Planning (DRRP) model, using a mixed
   integer linear program, to generate optimal rental decisions given fixed
   cost parameters. Next, we systematically analyze the predictability of
   the time-varying spot instance prices in Amazon EC2 and find that the
   best achievable prediction is insufficient to provide a close
   approximation to the actual prices. This fact motivates us to propose a
   Stochastic Resource Rental Planning (SRRP) model that explicitly
   considers the price uncertainty in rental decision making. Using
   empirical spot price data sets and realistic cost parameters, we conduct
   simulations over a wide range of experimental scenarios. Results show
   that DRRP achieves as much as 50\% cost reduction compared to the
   no-planning scheme. Moreover, SRRP consistently outperforms its DRRP
   counterpart in terms of cost saving, which demonstrates that SRRP is
   highly adaptive to the unpredictable nature of spot price in cloud
   resource market.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, eHealth systems have replaced paper based medical system due
   to its prominent features of convenience and accuracy. Also, since the
   medical data can be stored on any kind of digital devices, people can
   easily obtain medical services at any time and any place. However,
   privacy concern over patient medical data draws an increasing attention.
   In the current eHealth networks, patients are assigned multiple
   attributes which directly reflect their symptoms, undergoing treatments,
   etc. Those life-threatened attributes need to be verified by an
   authorized medical facilities, such as hospitals and clinics. When there
   is a need for medical services, patients have to be authenticated by
   showing their identities and the corresponding attributes in order to
   take appropriate healthcare actions. However, directly disclosing those
   attributes for verification may expose real identities. Therefore,
   existing eHealth systems fail to preserve patients' private attribute
   information while maintaining original functionalities of medical
   services. To solve this dilemma, we propose a framework called PAAS
   which leverages users' verifiable attributes to authenticate users in
   eHealth systems while preserving their privacy issues. In our system,
   instead of letting centralized infrastructures take care of
   authentication, our scheme only involves two end users. We also offer
   authentication strategies with progressive privacy requirements among
   patients or between patients and physicians. Based on the security and
   efficiency analysis, we show our framework is better than existing
   eHealth systems in terms of privacy preservation and practicality.}},

Title = {{Pathways for C-H bond cleavage of propane sigma-complexes on PdO(101)}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{12202-12212}},
Abstract = {{We used dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3)
   calculations to investigate the initial C-H bond cleavage of propane
   sigma-complexes adsorbed on the PdO(101) surface. The calculations
   predict that propane molecules adsorbed in eta(1) configurations can
   undergo facile C-H bond cleavage on PdO(101), where the energy barrier
   for C-H bond activation is lower than that for desorption for each
   molecular complex. The preferred pathway for propane dissociation on
   PdO(101) corresponds to cleavage of a primary C-H bond of a so-called
   staggered p-2 eta(1) complex which initially coordinates with the
   surface by forming two H-Pd dative bonds, one at each CH3 group. Among
   all of the adsorbed propane complexes, the staggered p-2 eta(1) complex
   has the highest binding energy and must overcome the lowest energy
   barrier for C-H bond scission. Analysis of the atomic charges reveals
   that propane C-H bond cleavage occurs heterolytically on PdO(101), and
   suggests that primary C-H bond activation is favored because a more
   stabilizing charge distribution develops within the 1-propyl transition
   state structures. Lastly, we conducted kinetic simulations using
   microkinetic models derived from the DFT-D3 structures, and find that
   the models reproduce the apparent activation energy for propane

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the use of relative attitude sharing between two
   spacecraft. The first, sharing, spacecraft, has an inertial attitude
   sensor. The second, receiving, spacecraft lacks an attitude sensor. The
   sharing spacecraft is able to sense relative attitude, enabling
   determination of the inertial attitude of the receiving spacecraft
   composed with the inertial attitude of the sharing spacecraft. Relative
   attitude is assumed to be available only under certain alignment
   conditions consistent with proper orientation of a passive relative
   attitude sensor on the sharing spacecraft and attitude fiducials on the
   receiving spacecraft. It is shown that an uncertainty-based metric
   derived from the Extended Kalman Filter can be used to autonomously
   determine when the spacecraft should modify their pointing objectives to
   accommodate resource sharing. This uncertainty-based decision parameter
   enables the spacecraft to share information more efficiently than a
   fixed-measurement update schedule, by switching the tracking objective
   from a target mode to a sharing mode, only when needed. It is shown that
   a star tracker, or equivalent attitude determination system on the
   sharing spacecraft can accommodate the attitude measurement requirements
   of multiple spacecraft.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale computing systems such as data centers are facing increasing
   pressure to cap their carbon footprint. Integrating emerging clean
   energy solutions into computer system design therefore gains great
   significance in the green computing era. While some pioneering work on
   tracking variable power budget show promising energy efficiency, they
   are not suitable for data centers due to lack of performance guarantee
   when renewable generation is low and fluctuant. In addition, our
   characterization of wind power behavior reveals that data centers
   designed to track the intermittent renewable power incur up to 4X
   performance loss due to inefficient and redundant load matching
   activities. As a result, mitigating operational overhead while still
   maintaining desired energy utilization becomes the most significant
   challenge in managing server clusters on intermittent renewable energy
   generation. In this paper we take a first step in digging into the
   operational overhead of renewable energy powered data center. We propose
   iSwitch, a lightweight server power management that follows renewable
   power variation characteristics, leverages existing system
   infrastructures, and applies supply/load cooperative scheme to mitigate
   the performance overhead. Comparing with state-of-the-art renewable
   energy driven system design, iSwitch could mitigate average network
   traffic by 75\%, peak network traffic by 95\%, and reduce 80\% job
   waiting time while still maintaining 96\% renewable energy utilization.
   We expect that our work can help computer architects make informed
   decisions on sustainable and high-performance system design.}},

   HVS}},
Journal = {{ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{518-533}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that age-hardening is a major deteriorating factor for
   cracking in the asphalt pavement, while healing may play a beneficial
   role in enhancing pavement fatigue life, though healing potential of hot
   mix asphalt (HMA) mixture may decrease with ageing. However, there is
   limited direct evidence and understanding of the combined effects of
   these two factors on cracking performance, particularly in full-scale
   pavements. In this article, the effects of ageing and healing on
   top-down cracking performance were evaluated on the basis of three
   full-scale tests conducted in the Florida Department of Transportation's
   accelerated pavement testing (APT) facility using the heavy vehicle
   simulator (HVS). The test results showed that ageing and potential
   healing appeared to have played key roles in the cracking performance of
   the asphalt pavement in the APT facility. When the pavement was
   subjected to slight-to-moderate ageing, it may be able to maintain a
   relatively high level of healing which helped to effectively recover
   damage due to HVS loading. The extensively aged pavement might have
   completely lost the ability to heal, which made it more susceptible to
   cracking. In addition, the analysis of cracking using the enhanced HMA
   fracture model (HMA-FM-E) showed that the predictions of the model
   agreed well with the observations from the tests, which further
   demonstrated that the loss of healing potential with ageing must be
   considered to better understand cracking performance of asphalt
   pavements.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative methods for
   communicating and acting on the world, since messages or commands are
   conveyed from the brain to an external device without using the normal
   output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles. Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) patients in the most advanced stages, who have lost the ability to
   communicate verbally, could benefit from a BCI that may allow them to
   convey basic thoughts (e. g., ``yes{''} and ``no{''}) and emotions.
   There is currently no report of such research, mostly because the
   cognitive deficits in AD patients pose serious limitations to the use of
   traditional BCIs, which are normally based on instrumental learning and
   require users to self-regulate their brain activation. Recent studies
   suggest that not only self-regulated brain signals, but also involuntary
   signals, for instance related to emotional states, may provide useful
   information about the user, opening up the path for so-called
   ``affective BCIs{''}. These interfaces do not necessarily require users
   to actively perform a cognitive task, and may therefore be used with
   patients who are cognitively challenged. In the present hypothesis
   paper, we propose a paradigm shift from instrumental learning to
   classical conditioning, with the aim of discriminating ``yes{''} and
   ``no{''} thoughts after associating them to positive and negative
   emotional stimuli respectively. This would represent a first step in the
   development of a BCI that could be used by AD patients, lending a new
   direction not only for communication, but also for rehabilitation and
   diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Another application of group testing that we would like to introduce is
   to against reactive jamming attacks, which has emerged as a great
   security threat to wireless sensor networks, due to its mass destruction
   to legitimate sensor communications and difficulty to be disclosed and
   defended. There exist many studies against these attacks, however, these
   methods, i.e., frequency hopping or channel surfing, require excessive
   computational capabilities on wireless devices. To overcome the
   shortcomings, we present here an interference free group-testing based
   solution by identifying the trigger nodes, whose transmissions activate
   any reactive jammers. The identification of these trigger nodes can help
   us to (1) carefully design a better routing protocol by switching these
   nodes into only receivers to avoid activating jammers and (2) locate the
   jammers based on the trigger nodes, thus providing an alternative
   mechanism against reactive jamming attacks. The theoretical analysis and
   experimental results show that this advanced scheme performs well in
   terms of time and message complexities.}},

Abstract = {{Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with varying Ni content

Abstract = {{Radiative flux measurements at the focal plane of solar concentrators
   are typically performed using digital cameras in conjunction with
   Lambertian targets. To accurately predict flux distributions on
   arbitrary receiver geometries directional information about the
   radiation is required. Currently, the directional characteristics of
   solar concentrating systems are predicted via ray tracing simulations.
   No direct experimental technique to determine intensities of
   concentrating solar systems is available. In the current paper, multiple
   parallel flux measurements at varying distances from the focal plane
   together with a linear inverse method and Tikhonov regularization are
   used to identify the directional and spatial intensity distribution at
   the solution plane. The directional binning feature of an in-house Monte
   Carlo ray tracing program is used to provide a reference solution. The
   method has been successfully applied to two-dimensional concentrators,
   namely parabolic troughs and elliptical troughs using forward Monte
   Carlo ray tracing simulations that provide the flux maps as well as
   consistent, associated intensity distribution for validation. In the
   two-dimensional case, intensity distributions obtained from the inverse
   method approach the Monte Carlo forward solution. In contrast, the
   method has not been successful for three dimensional and circular
   symmetric concentrator geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in graphene nanoribbon (GNR) electronic devices provide
   a concrete context for developing simulation methods, comparing theories
   to experiments, and using simulations to explore device physics. We
   present a review on modeling of graphene nanoribbon devices, with an
   emphasis on electronic and magnetoresistive devices. Device modeling is
   reviewed in a synergistic perspective with GNR material properties,
   device characteristics, and circuit requirements. Similarity with and
   difference to carbon nanotube devices are discussed. Device modeling and
   simulation results are compared to experimental data, which underlines
   the importance of theory-experiment collaborations in this field.
   Importance of the GNR edges, which have a negative impact on the carrier
   mobility due to edge roughness but offer new possibilities of spintronic
   devices and edge doping, is emphasized. Advanced device modeling of GNRs
   needs to have the capability to describe GNR device physics, including
   three-dimensional electrostatics, quantum and atomistic scale effects,
   elastic and inelastic scattering processes, electron-electron
   interaction, edge chemistry, magnetic field modulation, and spintronic
   and thermoelectric device phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Extended coverage digital elevation models (DEMs) including topographic

   provides important intermediate-scale information between coarse

   cause errors in the height of SRTM data, the measurement error is given
   as a single value for the entire area. The filter residuals in an
   adaptive multi-scale fusion algorithm were used to evaluate the
   landscape-dependent accuracy of SRTM elevations over the Florida coastal
   urban area. With accuracy and employing a stochastic framework to
   optimally fuse National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) data, SRTM data
   and high-resolution light detection and ranging data, single seamless
   fused DEMs at multiple scales were derived for the coastal area and
   improved DEM quality at 30 m scale for coastal flood prediction was

Abstract = {{Optimal water management in proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells at lower
   temperatures requires the efficient removal of liquid water from the
   cell. This pathway is intimately linked with liquid-water-droplet
   removal from the surface of the gas-diffusion layer (GDL) and into the
   flow channel. In this study, these liquid-water phenomena are
   investigated experimentally to improve the understanding of water
   transport through, and removal from, the GDL. Specifically, an
   experiment using a sliding-angle measurement is designed and used to
   quantify and measure directly the adhesion force for liquid-water
   droplets and to understand the droplets' growth and detachment from the
   GDL. The results show that unlike the static contact angle, the adhesion
   force, as measured by sliding angles, provides a good indicator of
   water-droplet removal as it is a direct measure of the dominating force
   that is holding a droplet on the GDL surface and preventing its
   detachment. It is also observed that injection through the GDL, as is
   representative of operating fuel cells, results in a higher adhesion
   force than a droplet placed on the top surface. Finally, it is shown
   that aged GDLs demonstrate higher adhesion forces, which dominate GDL
   degradation response and fuel-cell water holdup. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{We investigate the usage of an adaptive method, the Iterative Adaptive
   Approach (IAA), in combination with a maximum a posteriori (MAP)
   estimate to reconstruct high resolution SAR images that are both sparse
   and accurate. IAA is a nonparametric weighted least squares algorithm
   that is robust and user parameter-free. IAA has been shown to
   reconstruct SAR images with excellent side lobes suppression and high
   resolution enhancement. We first reconstruct the SAR images using IAA,
   and then we enforce sparsity by using MAP with a sparsity inducing
   prior. By coupling these two methods, we can produce a sparse and
   accurate high resolution image that are conducive for feature
   extractions and target classification applications. In addition, we show
   how IAA can be made computationally efficient without sacrificing
   accuracies, a desirable property for SAR applications where the size of
   the problems is quite large. We demonstrate the success of our approach
   using the Air Force Research Lab's ``Gotcha Volumetric SAR Data Set
   Version 1.0{''} challenge dataset. Via the widely used FFT, individual
   vehicles contained in the scene are barely recognizable due to the poor
   resolution and high side lobe nature of FFT. However with our approach
   clear edges, boundaries, and textures of the vehicles are obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Recent terrorist attacks have sprung a need for a large scale explosive
   detector. Our group has developed differential reflection spectroscopy
   which can detect explosive residue on surfaces such as parcel, cargo and
   luggage. In short, broad band ultra-violet and visible light is shone
   onto a material (such as a parcel) moving on a conveyor belt. Upon
   reflection off the surface, the light intensity is recorded with a
   spectrograph (spectrometer in combination with a CCD camera). This
   reflected light intensity is then subtracted and normalized with the
   next data point collected, resulting in differential reflection spectra
   in the 200-500 nm range. Explosives show spectral finger-prints at
   specific wavelengths, for example, the spectrum of 2,4,6,
   trinitrotoluene (TNT) shows an absorption edge at 420 nm. Additionally,
   we have developed an automated software which detects the characteristic
   features of explosives. One of the biggest challenges for the algorithm
   is to reach a practical limit of detection. In this study, we introduce
   our automatic detection software which is a combination of principal
   component analysis and support vector machines. Finally we present the
   sensitivity and selectivity response of our algorithm as a function of
   the amount of explosive detected on a given surface.}},

Abstract = {{A series of tin(II) amide alkoxides ({[}(OR) Sn(NMe2)](n)) and tin(II)
   alkoxides ({[}Sn(OR)(2)](n)) were investigated as precursors for the
   production of tin oxide (SnOx) nanowires. The precursors were
   synthesized from the metathesis of tin dimethylamide
   ({[}Sn(NMe2)(2)](2)) and a series of aryl alcohols \{H-OAr =
   H-OC6H4(R)-2: R = CH3 (H-oMP), CH(CH3)(2) (H-oPP), C(CH3)(3) (H-oBP)] or
   {[}H-OC6H3(R)(2)-2,6: R = CH3 (H-DMP), CH(CH3)(2) (H-DIP), C(CH3)(3)
   (H-DBP)]\}. The 1 : 1 products were all identified as the dinuclear
   species {[}(OAr) Sn(mu-NMe2)](2) where OAr = oMP (1), oPP (2), oBP (3),
   DMP (4), DIP (5), DBP (6). The 1 : 2 products were identified as either
   a polymer ({[}Sn(mu-OAr)(2)](infinity) (where OAr = oMP (7), oPP (8)),
   dinuclear {[}(OAr) Sn(mu-OAr)](2) (where OAr = oBP (9), DMP (10) or
   DIP/HNMe2 (11)), or mononuclear {[} Sn(DBP)(2)] (12) complexes. These
   novel families of compounds (heteroleptic 1-6, and homoleptic 7-12) were
   evaluated for the production of SnOx nanowires using solution
   precipitation (SPPT; oleylamine/octadecene solvent system) or
   electrospinning (ES; THF solvent) processing conditions. The SPPT route
   that employed the heteroleptic precursors yielded mixed phases of Sn-o :
   romarchite {[}1 (100 : 0); 2 (80 : 20); 3 (68 : 32); 4 (86 : 14); 5 (66
   : 35); 6 (88 : 12)], with a variety of spherical sized particles {[}1
   (350-900 nm); 2 (150-1200 nm); 3 (250-950 nm); 4 (20-180 nm); 5 (80-400
   nm); 6 (40-200 nm)]. For the homoleptic precursors, similar phased {[}7
   (80 : 20); 8 (23 : 77); 9 (15 : 85); 10 (34 : 66); 11 (77 : 23); 12 (77
   : 23)] spherical nanodots were isolated {[}7 (50-300 nm); 8:
   (irregular); 10 (200-800 nm); 11 (50-150 nm); 12 (50-450 nm)], except
   for 9 which formed polycrystalline rods {[}Sn-o : romarchite (15 : 85)]
   with aspect ratios >100. From ES routes, the heteroleptic species were
   found to form `tadpole-shaped' materials whereas the homoleptic species
   formed electrosprayed nanodots. The one exception noted was for 7,
   where, without use of a polymer matrix, nanowires of Sno, decorated with
   micron sized `balls' were observed. Due to the small amount of material
   generated, PXRD patterns were inconclusive to the identity of the
   generated material; however, cyclic voltammetry on select samples was
   used to tentatively identify the final Sno (from 7) with the other
   sample identified as SnOx (from 1).}},

   course top-down cracking performance}},
Journal = {{ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{56-75}},
Abstract = {{Top-down cracking is a distress mode that is of particular concern for
   pavements with Open-Graded Friction Course (OGFC) because open-graded
   mixture has considerably lower resistance to fracture (lower fracture
   energy limit and lower resistance to damage) than dense-graded mixture.
   This particular cracking phenomenon initiates on the pavement surface
   and propagates downward; so because the OGFC layer is thin, cracking
   performance relies on the properties and characteristics of three
   components near the pavement surface: OGFC, underlying structural layer,
   and the interface between. For this reason, to increase the durability
   of pavements surfaced with OGFC, it is significant to ensure a quality
   fracture resistant bond between OGFC and the structural layer. This
   research investigated top-down cracking performance of OGFC with
   different tack coats using a newly developed composite specimen
   interface cracking (CSIC) test. In addition, X-ray computed tomography
   (CT) was employed to analyze the interface characteristics between OGFC
   and dense-graded HMA. HMA fracture mechanics was employed to quantify
   the effect of polymer modified asphalt emulsion (PMAE) on pavement
   top-down cracking resistance enhancement. Results clearly indicated that
   PMAE-created bonded interface conditions greatly increased pavement
   top-down cracking resistance as compared with conventional tack coat.}},

Abstract = {{This study was mainly focused on identifying appropriate relationships
   between asphalt mixture component characteristics and asphalt mixture
   properties known to control cracking performance. The current lack of
   material property models that can accurately describe the changes in
   material properties over time in the field is probably the greatest
   deficiency in our ability to accurately predict pavement performance.
   Therefore, there is a need to evaluate existing material property
   models, and develop improved models for use in the prediction of
   pavement performance. Relationships able to predict initial fracture
   energy and creep rate, which are the properties known to govern the
   change in material property over time and are also required for
   performance model predictions, were developed in this study. In
   addition, conceptual relationships were identified to describe changes
   in these properties over time ( aging) by including the effect of the
   non-healable permanent damage related to load and moisture. This can
   serve as the foundation for further development of improved models to
   predict mixture properties as a function of age in the field based on
   additional field data and laboratory studies using more advanced
   laboratory conditioning procedures. The verified relationships will also
   serve to provide reliable inputs for prediction of service life using
   pavement performance prediction models.}},

Abstract = {{Cells sense and respond to their environment. Mechanotransduction is the
   process by which mechanical forces, stress, and strains are converted
   into biochemical signals that control cell behavior. In recent decades
   it has been shown that appropriate mechanical signals are essential to
   tissue health, but the role of friction and direct contact shearing
   across cell surfaces has been essentially unexplored. This, despite the
   obvious existence of numerous biological tissues whose express function
   depends on sliding contacts. In our studies on frictional interactions
   of corneal cells we find that the friction coefficients are on the order
   of m 0.03-0.06 for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Additionally, we
   observe cell death after single cycles of sliding at contact pressures
   estimated to be similar to 12 kPa. These experimental results suggest
   that frictional contact forces produce mechanical stresses and strains
   that are in the cellular mechanosensing ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Network coverage is one of the most decisive factors for determining the

   sensors in order to cope with coverage hole issues in a hybrid WSN
   containing both static and mobile sensors. To this end, we introduce a
   new metric, namely to maximise the minimum remaining energy of all moved
   sensors since the more energy remains, the longer the network can
   operate. Based on this metric, we propose an efficient coverage healing
   algorithm that always determines an optimal location for each mobile
   sensor in order to heal all coverage holes, after all mobile sensors
   locations and coverage holes are located. When the target area is too
   big, we present a scalable area-based algorithm which returns a near
   optimal solution. Furthermore, we also present a lightweight-distributed
   scheduling strategy for mobile sensors in case of small sensor failures.}},

   stability margins of the coupled-ordinary differential equations (ODE)
   model and its partial differential equation (PDE) approximation, which
   we call the approximation error. The stability margin is defined as the
   absolute value of the real part of the least stable pole. The PDE model
   has proved useful in the design of distributed control schemes (Barooah
   et al. 2009; Hao et al. 2011); it provides insight into the effect of
   gains of local controllers on the closed-loop stability margin that is
   lacking in the coupled-ODE model. Here we show that the ratio of the
   approximation error to the stability margin is O(1/N), where N is the
   number of vehicles. Thus, the PDE model is an accurate approximation of
   the coupled-ODE model when N is large. Numerical computations are
   provided to corroborate the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The Capon Beamforming algorithm is an optimal spatial filtering
   algorithm used in various signal processing applications where excellent
   interference rejection performance is required, such as Radar and Sonar
   systems, Smart Antenna systems for wireless communications. Its lack of
   robustness, however, means that it is vulnerable to array calibration
   errors and other model errors. To overcome this problem, numerous robust
   Capon Beamforming algorithms have been proposed, which are much more
   promising for practical applications. In this paper, an FPGA
   implementation of a robust Capon Beamforming algorithm is investigated
   and presented. This realization takes an array output with 4 channels,
   computes the complex-valued adaptive weight vectors for beamforming with
   an 18 bit fixed-point representation and runs at a 100 MHz clock on
   Xilinx V4 FPGA. This work will be applied in our medical imaging project
   for breast cancer detection.}},

Title = {{The SOA formation model combined with semiempirical quantum chemistry

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{9058-9066}},
Abstract = {{A new model for predicting the UV-visible absorption spectra of
   secondary organic aerosols (SOA) has been developed. The model consists
   of two primary parts: a SOA formation model and a semiempirical quantum
   chemistry method. The mass of SOA is predicted using the PHRCSOA
   (Partitioning Heterogeneous Reaction Consortium Secondary Organic
   Aerosol) model developed by Cao and Jang {[}Environ. Sci. Technol.,
   2010, 44, 727]. The chemical composition is estimated using a
   combination of the kinetic model (MCM) and the PHRCSOA model. The
   absorption spectrum is obtained by taking the sum of the spectrum of
   each SOA product calculated using a semiempirical NDDO (Neglect of
   Diatomic Differential Overlap)-based method. SOA was generated from the
   photochemical reaction of toluene or alpha-pinene at different NOx
   levels (low NOx: 24-26 ppm, middle NOx: 49 ppb, high NOx: 104-105 ppb)
   using a 2 m(3) indoor Teflon film chamber. The model simulation
   reasonably agrees with the measured absorption spectra of a-pinene SOA
   but underestimates toluene SOA under high and middle NOx conditions. The
   absorption spectrum of toluene SOA is moderately enhanced with
   increasing NOx concentrations, while that of alpha-pinene SOA is not
   affected. Both measured and calculated UV-visible spectra show that the
   light absorption of toluene SOA is much stronger than that of a-pinene
   SOA.}},

Title = {{Hardness Complexity of Optimal Substructure Problems on Power-Law Graphs}},
Booktitle = {{HANDBOOK OF OPTIMIZATION IN COMPLEX NETWORKS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS}},
Series = {{Springer Series in Optimization and Its Applications}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{255-277}},
Abstract = {{The remarkable discovery of many large-scale real networks is the
   power-law distribution in degree sequence: the number of vertices with
   degree i is proportional to i for some constant beta > 1. A lot of
   researchers believe that it may be easier to solve some optimization
   problems in power-law graphs. Unfortunately, many problems have been
   proved NP-hard even in power-law graphs as Ferrante proposed in Ferrante
   et al. (Theoretical Computer Science 393(1-3):220-230, 2008).
   Intuitively, a theoretical question is raised: Are these problems on
   power-law graphs still as hard as on general graphs? The chapter shows
   that many optimal substructure problems, such as minimum dominating set,
   minimum vertex cover and maximum independent set, are easier to solve in
   power-law graphs by illustrating better inapproximability factors. An
   optimization problem has the property of optimal substructure if its
   optimal solution on some given graph is essentially the union of the
   optimal subsolutions on all maximal connected components. In particular,
   the above problems and a more general problem (rho-minimum dominating
   set) are proven to remain APX-hard and their constant inapproximability
   factors on general power-law graphs by using the cycle-based embedding
   technique to embed any d-bounded graphs into a power-law graph. In
   addition, the corresponding inapproximability factors of these problems
   are further proven in simple power-law graphs based on the graphic
   embedding technique as well as that of maximum clique and minimum
   coloring using the embedding technique in Ferrante et al. (Theoretical
   Computer Science 393 (1-3):220-230, 2008). As a result of these
   inapproximability factors, the belief that there exists some (1 +
   o(1))-approximation algorithm for these problems on power-law graphs is
   proven not always true. In addition, this chapter contains the in-depth
   investigations in the relationship between the exponential factor beta
   and constant greedy approximation algorithms. The last part includes
   some minor NP-hardness results on simple power-law graphs for small beta
   < 1.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{2739-2750}},
Abstract = {{Background: Theranostic nanomaterials composed of fluorescent and
   photothermal agents can both image and provide a method of disease
   treatment in clinical oncology. For in vivo use, the near-infrared (NIR)
   window has been the focus of the majority of studies, because of greater
   light penetration due to lower absorption and scatter of biological
   components. Therefore, having both fluorescent and photothermal agents
   with optical properties in the NIR provides the best chance of improved
   theranostic capabilities utilizing nanotechnology.
   Methods: We developed nonplasmonic multi-dye theranostic silica
   nanoparticles (MDT-NPs), combining NIR fluorescence visualization and
   photothermal therapy within a single nanoconstruct comprised of
   molecular components. A modified NIR fluorescent heptamethine cyanine
   dye was covalently incorporated into a mesoporous silica matrix and a
   hydrophobic metallonaphthalocyanine dye with large molar absorptivity
   was loaded into the pores of these fluorescent particles. The imaging
   and therapeutic capabilities of these nanoparticles were demonstrated in
   vivo using a direct tumor injection model.
   Results: The fluorescent nanoparticles are bright probes (300-fold
   enhancement in quantum yield versus free dye) that have a large Stokes
   shift (>110 nm). Incorporation of the naphthalocyanine dye and exposure
   to NIR laser excitation results in a temperature increase of the
   surrounding environment of the MDT-NPs. Tumors injected with these NPs
   are easily visible with NIR imaging and produce significantly elevated
   levels of tumor necrosis (95\%) upon photothermal ablation compared with
   controls, as evaluated by bioluminescence and histological analysis.
   Conclusion: MDT-NPs are novel, multifunctional nanomaterials that have
   optical properties dependent upon the unique incorporation of NIR
   fluorescent and NIR photothermal dyes within a mesoporous silica
   platform.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a collection of energy constrained
   sensor node forming a network which lacks infrastructure or any kind of
   centralized management. In such networks, virtual backbone has been
   proposed as the routing infrastructure which can alleviate the
   broadcasting storm problem occurring due to consistent flooding
   performed by the sensor node, to communicate their sensed information.
   As the virtual backbone nodes needs to carry other nodes' traffic, they
   are more subject to failure. Hence, it is desirable to construct a fault
   tolerant virtual backbone. Most of recent research has studied this
   problem in homogeneous networks. In this chapter, we propose solutions
   for efficient construction of a fault tolerant virtual backbone in a WSN
   where the sensor nodes have different transmission ranges. Such a
   network can be modeled as a disk graph (DG), where link between the two
   nodes is either unidirectional or bidirectional. We formulate the fault
   tolerant virtual backbone problem as a k-Strongly Connected m-Dominating
   and Absorbing Set (k, in) SCDAS problem. As the problem is NP-hard, we
   propose an approximation algorithm along with the theoretical analysis
   and conjectured its approximation ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter presents a canonical dual approach for solving a general
   sum of fourth-order polynomial minimization problem. This problem arises
   extensively in engineering and science, including database analysis,
   computational biology, sensor network communications, nonconvex
   mechanics, and ecology. We first show that this global optimization
   problem is actually equivalent to a discretized minimal potential
   variational problem in large deformation mechanics. Therefore, a general
   analytical solution is proposed by using the canonical duality theory
   developed by the first author. Both global and local extremality
   properties of this analytical solution are identified by a triality
   theory. Application to sensor network localization problem is
   illustrated. Our results show when the problem is not uniquely
   localizable, the ``optimal solution{''} obtained by the SDP method is
   actually a local maximizer of the total potential energy. However, by
   using a perturbed canonical dual approach, a class of Euclidean distance
   problems can be converted to a unified concave maximization dual problem
   with zero duality gap, which can be solved by well-developed convex
   minimization methods. This chapter should bridge an existing gap between
   nonconvex mechanics and global optimization.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter focuses on multi-sensor fusion for navigation in difficult
   environments where none of the existing navigation technologies can
   satisfy requirements for accurate and reliable navigation if used in a
   stand-alone mode. A generic multi-sensor fusion approach is presented.
   This approach builds the navigation mechanization around a
   self-contained inertial navigator, which is used as a core sensor. Other
   sensors generally derive navigation-related measurements from external
   signals, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and
   signals of opportunity (SoOP), or external observations, for example,
   features extracted from images of laser scanners and video cameras.
   Depending on a specific navigation mission, these measurements may or
   may not be available. Therefore, externally-dependent sources of
   navigation information (including GNSS, SoOP, laser scanners, video
   cameras, pseudolites, Doppler radars, etc.) are treated as secondary
   sensors. When available, measurements of a secondary sensor or sensors
   are utilized to reduce drift in inertial navigation outputs. Inertial
   data are applied to improve the robustness of secondary sensors' signal
   processing. Applications of the multi-sensor fusion approach are
   illustrated in detail for two case studies: (1) integration of Global
   Positioning System (GPS), laser scanner, and inertial navigation; and,
   (2) fusion of laser scanner, video camera, and inertial measurements.
   Experimental and simulation results are presented to illustrate
   performance of multi-sensor fusion algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, aerosol acidity was measured using colorimetry integrated
   with a Reflectance UV-Visible spectrometer (C-RUV). An inorganic aerosol
   comprising NH4+-H+-SO42--H2O was generated using an atomizer and
   introduced into a 2-m(3) indoor Teflon film chamber. The produced
   aerosol was collected on the Teflon-coated glass fiber filter dyed with
   metanil yellow (MY) as an indicator for measuring proton concentrations
   in aerosol. A calibration curve for measuring aerosol acidity using the
   C-RUV technique was obtained through the relationship between the
   absorbance of the UV-Visible spectrum of the filter sample vs.
   theoretically calculated proton concentrations using the E-AIM Model II.
   To develop the C-RUV method under various humidities, the aerosol filter
   sample was mounted inside a small optical flow chamber controlled for
   humidity in situ. The humidity effect on the equilibrium thermodynamics
   of the indicator was theoretically described by inclusion of excess
   acidity (X) into the calibration curve. The calibration curve obtained
   from relatively highly acidic aerosols (e.g., H2SO4, NH4H3(SO4)(2),
   and(NH4)(7)H-13(SO4)(10)) was extrapolated to estimate proton
   concentrations for weakly acidic aerosols (e.g., NH4HSO4 and
   (NH4)(3)H(SO4)(2)), which is more relevant to the ambient aerosol
   acidity but has been poorly predicted with typical inorganic
   thermodynamic models due to the limited experimental data. The C-RUV
   technique of this study permits one to estimate aerosol acidity for a
   variety of compositions of the NH4+-H+-SO42--H(2)Osystem including both
   ammonia-poor and ammonia-rich sulfate aerosols.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method is developed to prepare PVDF based graphene oxide (GO)

   Nanocomposite films are prepared by solution casting the GO-PVDF
   solution. TEM images of these nanocomposites show better dispersion of
   GO in the PVDF prepared using the co-solvents as compared to the films
   made only using DMF. Following solvent evaporation, GO/PVDF
   nanocomposites are hot pressed at 150 degrees C, well below the melting
   temperature of PVDF, to maintain the dispersion of GO fillers while
   partially reducing the GO to functionalized graphene sheets. Dielectric
   constant and electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites show
   remarkable increase compared to values for PVDF for a low 0.005 weight
   fraction. The effect of the presence of GO and the hot press on the
   morphology of PVDF are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{High energy density capacitors are critically important in advanced
   electronic devices and electric power systems due to their reduced
   weight, size and cost to meet desired applications. Nanocomposites hold
   strong potential for increased performance, however, the energy density
   of most nanocomposites is still low compared to commercial capacitors
   and neat polymers. Here, high energy density nanocomposite capacitors
   are fabricated using surface-functionalized high aspect ratio barium
   titanate (BaTiO3) nanowires (NWs) in a poly(vinylidene
   fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE-CFE))
   matrix. These nanocomposites have 63.5\% higher dielectric permittivity
   compared to previous nanocomposites with BaTiO3 nanoparticles and also
   have high breakdown strength. At a 17.5\% volume fraction, the
   nanocomposites show more than 145.3\% increase in energy density above
   that of the pure P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) polymer (10.48 J/cm(3) compared to 7.21
   J/cm(3)). This value is significant and exceeds those reported for the
   conventional polymer-ceramic composites; it is also more than two times
   larger than high performance commercial materials. The findings of this
   research could lead to broad interest due to the potential for
   fabricating next generation energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{The development of effective structural health monitoring (SHM)
   strategies is critical as aging infrastructure remains a national
   concern with widespread impact on the quality of our daily lives.
   Wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs) are an attractive alternative to
   traditional SHM systems for their lower deployment cost and their
   ability to enable new methods of distributed data processing. While
   acceleration has been the primary measurement utilized in most WSSN SHM
   applications, practically and accurately capturing structural
   deflections has been proven much more challenging. Displacement sensors
   produce reliable low-frequency measurements but are often difficult to
   implement in long-term field deployments. Conventional technologies for
   measuring deflection, both dynamic and static, are either too bulky or
   expensive to be integrated into WSSNs or lack sufficient accuracy. This
   paper presents the validation and characterization of a network of
   low-cost, wireless radar-based sensors for the enhancement of
   low-frequency vibration-based bridge monitoring and the measurement of
   static bridge deflections. Experimental results utilizing a
   laboratory-scale truss bridge are presented and the performance of the
   wireless radar sensors is compared to conventional vibration and
   displacement transducers. In addition, challenges associated with
   detection distance, interference rejection and signal processing are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence of accelerator devices such as multicores,
   graphics-processing units (GPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays
   (FPGAs), application designers are confronted with the problem of
   searching a huge design space that has been shown to have widely varying
   performance and energy metrics for different accelerators, different
   application domains, and different use cases. To address this problem,
   numerous studies have evaluated specific applications across different
   accelerators. In this paper, we analyze an important domain of
   applications, referred to as sliding-window applications, when executing
   on FPGAs, GPUs, and multicores. For each device, we present optimization
   strategies and analyze use cases where each device is most effective.
   The results show that FPGAs can achieve speedup of up to 11x and 57x
   compared to GPUs and multicores, respectively, while also using orders
   of magnitude less energy.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid organic-inorganic solar cells, as an alternative to all-organic
   solar cells, have received significant attention for their potential
   advantages in combining the solution-processability and versatility of
   organic materials with high charge mobility and environmental stability
   of inorganic semiconductors. Here we report efficient and air-stable
   hybrid organic-inorganic solar cells with broad spectral sensitivity
   based on a low-gap polymer
   poly{[}2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta{[}2,1-b;
   3,4-b']-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and
   spherical CdSe nanoparticles. The solvents used for depositing the
   hybrid PCPDTBT: CdSe active layer were shown to strongly influence the
   film morphology, and subsequently the photovoltaic performance of the
   resulted solar cells. Appropriate post-deposition annealing of the
   hybrid film was also shown to improve the solar cell efficiency. The
   inclusion of a thin ZnO nanoparticle layer between the active layer and
   the metal cathode leads to a significant increase in device efficiency
   especially at long wavelengths, due to a combination of optical and
   electronic effects including more optimal light absorption in the active
   layer and elimination of unwanted hole leakage into the cathode.
   Overall, maximum power conversion efficiencies up to 3.7 +/- 0.2\% and
   spectral sensitivity extending above 800 nm were achieved in such
   PCPDTBT: CdSe nanosphere hybrid solar cells. Furthermore, the devices
   with a ZnO nanoparticle layer retained similar to 70\% of the original
   efficiency after storage under ambient laboratory conditions for over 60
   days without any encapsulation.}},

Abstract = {{Open-source software (OSS) encourages computer programmers to reuse
   software components written by others. In evolutionary bioinformatics,
   OSS comes in a broad range of programming languages, including C/C++,
   Pen, Python, Ruby, Java, and R. To avoid writing the same functionality
   multiple times for different languages, it is possible to share
   components by bridging computer languages and Bio{*} projects, such as
   BioPerl, Biopython, BioRuby, BioJava, and R/Bioconductor. In this
   chapter, we compare the two principal approaches for sharing software
   between different programming languages: either by remote procedure call
   (RPC) or by sharing a local call stack. RPC provides a
   language-independent protocol over a network interface; examples are
   RSOAP and Rscrve. The local call stack provides a between-language
   mapping not over the network interface, but directly in computer memory;
   examples are R bindings, RPy, and languages sharing the Java Virtual
   Machine stack. This functionality provides strategies for sharing of
   software between Bio{*} projects, which can be exploited more often.
   Here, we present cross-language examples for sequence translation, and
   measure throughput of the different options. We compare calling into R
   through native R, RSOAP, Rserve, and RPv interfaces, with the
   performance of native BioPerl, Biopython, BioJava, and BioRuby
   implementations, and with call stack bindings to BioJava and the
   European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite. In general, call stack
   approaches outperform native Bio{*} implementations and these, in turn,
   outperform RPC-based approaches. To test and compare strategies, we
   provide a downloadable BioNode image with all examples, tools, and
   libraries included. The BioNode image can be run on
   Virtual-Box-supported operating systems, including Windows, OSX, and
   Linux.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advances in telehealth systems are primarily focused on
   sensing and monitoring. However, these systems are limited in that they
   only rely on sensors and medical devices to obtain vital signs. New
   research and development are urgently needed to offer more effective and
   meaningful interactions between patients, medical professionals and
   other individuals around the patients. Social networking with Web 2.0
   technologies and methods can meet these demands, and help to develop a
   more complete view of the patient. Also many people, including the
   elderly, may be resistant to change, which can reduce the efficacy of
   telehealth systems. Persuasive technology and mechanisms are urgently
   needed to counter this resistance and promote healthy lifestyles. In
   this paper, we propose the participatory and persuasive telehealth
   system as a solution for these two limitations. By integrating connected
   health solutions with social networking and adding persuasive influence,
   we increase the chances for effective interventions and behavior

Abstract = {{I have studied the shear mixing of bidisperse collections of cohesive
   particles in an effort to develop models that would allow one to predict
   and control the homogeneity of particle composites. The focus has been
   on the effects of inter-particle cohesion and shear rate on the
   microstructure of particle composites. As a model problem, the cohesion
   resulting from the van der Waals force acting between particles is
   considered. Discrete element method simulations were performed in which
   initially segregated bidisperse collections of particles featuring a 7:
   1 diameter ratio were subjected to plane shear under constant applied
   stress. Simulations were performed with and without gravity and with a
   variety of shear rates and particle cohesion strengths for both the
   large and small particles. The homogeneity of the resultant mixtures was
   quantified using two order statistics: the spatial variance of the
   relative concentrations of the different particles and the average size
   of clusters of small particles. Results indicate that the small
   particles needed to be sufficiently cohesive for the mixtures to be
   noticeably more inhomogeneous than mixtures of non-cohesive particles.
   Without gravity, the particles were most mixed when the big particles
   were moderately cohesive, while with gravity, mixing worsened as the big
   particles became more cohesive.}},

Abstract = {{Particle interaction with shock/detonation waves is a fundamental
   phenomenon. In many practical applications, shock/detonation waves
   interact with a very large number of particles and the scales of
   interest are typically much larger than particle size. Therefore, fully
   resolving the flow around all the particles is impractical. Therefore,
   rigorous models for momentum and energy exchange in the interaction is
   very important. Detonation/shock-particle interaction is strongly
   time-dependent, so unsteady mechanisms play important roles in momentum
   and energy transfer. A model that includes unsteady contributions to
   force and heating is proposed. The model is used to investigate the
   interaction between an aluminum particle and a nitromethane CJ
   detonation wave. The results computed by the present model show good
   agreement with DNS results. The standard drag and heat-transfer
   correlations that ignore unsteady mechanisms lead to significant errors.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of new microvasculature is essential for a tumor mass to
   grow. Vascular targeting agents (VTAs), including anti-angiogenic drugs
   and vascular disrupting agents, aim to either inhibit new vasculature
   growth or destroy existing vasculature, respectively. Because the
   mechanisms for anti-angiogenic drugs and vascular disrupting agents are
   complementary, analysis of these drugs used together is under
   investigation for the enhanced treatment of tumors in comparison to each
   treatment alone. The preclinical evaluation of the effects of VTAs on
   tumor growth in small animal models is vital for the development of
   effective drugs for clinical use. In vivo hyperspectral imaging
   microscopy of hemoglobin saturation has been used previously to
   investigate the efficacy of VTAs through analysis of tumor microvessel
   oxygenation after drug administration. Combining this imaging modality
   with first-pass fluorescence angiographic imaging can give additional
   important information about the vessel morphology and blood flow changes
   that occur after VTA treatment, thus elucidating the relationship
   between microvessel structure changes and oxygenation. In this study, we
   report the combined use of hyperspectral and first pass fluorescence
   angiographic imaging to examine the relationship between vessel
   morphology and oxygenation of human prostate cancer tumors in mice
   following treatment with vascular disrupting agents, OXi4503, and
   anti-VEGF angiogenesis inhibitor, cediranib. Imaging of the tumors is
   completed before treatment as well as in the days following treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a quantization approach, as an alternative of
   sparsification, to curb the growth of the radial basis function
   structure in kernel adaptive filtering. The basic idea behind this
   method is to quantize and hence compress the input (or feature) space.
   Different from sparsification, the new approach uses the ``redundant{''}
   data to update the coefficient of the closest center. In particular, a
   quantized kernel least mean square (QKLMS) algorithm is developed, which
   is based on a simple online vector quantization method. The analytical
   study of the mean square convergence has been carried out. The energy
   conservation relation for QKLMS is established, and on this basis we
   arrive at a sufficient condition for mean square convergence, and a
   lower and upper bound on the theoretical value of the steady-state
   excess mean square error. Static function estimation and short-term
   chaotic time-series prediction examples are presented to demonstrate the
   excellent performance.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Granger causality has become a popular method in a
   variety of research areas including engineering, neuroscience, and
   economics. However, despite its simplicity and wide applicability, the
   linear Granger causality is an insufficient tool for analyzing exotic
   stochastic processes such as processes involving non-linear dynamics or
   processes involving causality in higher order statistics. In order to
   analyze such processes more reliably, a different approach toward
   Granger causality has become increasingly popular. This new approach
   employs conditional independence as a tool to discover Granger
   non-causality without any assumption on the underlying stochastic
   process. This paper discusses the concept of discovering Granger
   non-causality using measures of conditional independence, and proposes a
   novel measure of conditional independence. In brief, the proposed
   approach estimates the conditional distribution function through a
   kernel based least square regression approach. This paper also explores
   the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method compared to other
   available methods, and provides a detailed comparison of these methods
   using a variety of synthetic data sets.}},

Abstract = {{A new generation of `behaviour-aware' services are emerging, defining

   models to capture mobile users' behavioural characteristics and also

   Recent work in mobility modelling focused on replicating metrics of
   encounter statistics and spatio-temporal preferences. In this study, we
   attempt to show the sufficiency (or inadequacy) of these mobility
   metrics in reproducing realistic performance of networking protocols. We
   provide three main findings: (a) careful parameterisation of the models
   can replicate mobility metrics; (b) a rich set of communities in real
   mobile societies exist with distinct behavioural clusters of users; (c)
   even carefully crafted models surprisingly result in structural dynamics
   and protocol performance that is dramatically different from the
   trace-driven performance. These findings strongly suggest a need to
   re-visit mobility modelling to incorporate accurate behavioural
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal decomposition pathways of the tungsten dimethylhydrazido
   complexes Cl-4(RCN)W(NNMe2) (1a: R= CH3; 1b: R=Ph), precursors for

   of experiments and calculations. Raman scattering studies were performed
   in an impinging-jet, up-flow, aerosol-assisted CVD reactor to identify
   reaction intermediates. Density Functional Theory calculations
   (B3LYP/LanL2DZ) were used to estimate Raman active frequencies and
   explore the reaction surface. Dimethylamine and methylmethyleneimine,
   products from N-N cleavage of the hydrazido ligand, were observed under
   deposition conditions and identified by comparison with previously
   reported Raman shifts and calculated frequencies. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Sensitivity of wheat yield and soil nitrogen (N) losses to stepwise
   changes in means and variances of climatic variables were determined
   using the FASSET model. The LARS-WG was used to generate climate
   scenarios using observed climate data (1961-90) from two sites in
   Denmark, which differed in climate and soil conditions. Scenarios
   involved changes to (i) mean temperature alone, (ii) mean and
   variability of temperature, (iii) winter and summer precipitation
   amounts and (iv) duration of dry and wet series.
   The model predicted lower grain yield and N uptake in response to
   increases in mean temperatures, caused by early maturity, with little
   change in variability. This, however, increased soil mineral N causing
   increased N losses. On sandy loam, larger temperature variability
   lowered grain yields and increased N losses coupled with higher
   variability at all the mean temperature ranges. On coarse sand, grain
   yields either remained unaltered or were slightly reduced when larger
   temperature variability was introduced to increase in mean temperatures
   of up to +2 degrees C above baseline. However, introducing variability
   to further increase in mean temperatures lowered yields without any
   change in variability. Larger temperature variability did not affect
   soil mineral N and N2O emissions, but increased N leaching on coarse
   sand.
   Large response in grain yield, N uptake and soil N cycling, and in their
   variability was predicted when summer precipitation was varied, whereas
   only N leaching responded to changes in winter precipitation. Doubling
   the duration of dry series lowered grain yield and N removed by grain,
   but increased N leaching, whereas doubling the duration of wet series
   showed opposite effect. Predicted responses to changes in precipitation
   patterns were larger on coarse sand than on sandy loam. This study
   illustrates the importance of considering effects of changes to mean
   climatic factors, climatic variability and soil types on both crop yield
   and soil N losses.}},

Title = {{Fractionated photothermal antitumor therapy with multidye nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{351-357}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Photothermal therapy is an emerging cancer treatment paradigm
   which involves highly localized heating and killing of tumor cells, due
   to the presence of nanomaterials that can strongly absorb near-infrared
   (NIR) light. In addition to having deep penetration depths in tissue,
   NIR light is innocuous to normal cells. Little is known currently about
   the fate of nanomaterials post photothermal ablation and the
   implications thereof. The purpose of this investigation was to define
   the intratumoral fate of nanoparticles (NPs) after photothermal therapy
   in vivo and characterize the use of novel multidye theranostic NPs
   (MDT-NPs) for fractionated photothermal antitumor therapy.
   Methods: The photothermal and fluorescent properties of MDT-NPs were
   first characterized. To investigate the fate of nanomaterials following
   photothermal ablation in vivo, novel MDT-NPs and a murine mammary tumor
   model were used. Intratumoral injection of MDT-NPs and real-time
   fluorescence imaging before and after fractionated photothermal therapy
   was performed to study the intratumoral fate of MDT-NPs. Gross tumor and
   histological changes were made comparing MDT-NP treated and control
   tumor-bearing mice.
   Results: The dual dye-loaded mesoporous NPs (ie, MDT-NPs; circa 100 nm)
   retained both their NIR absorbing and NIR fluorescent capabilities after
   photoactivation. In vivo MDT-NPs remained localized in the intratumoral
   position after photothermal ablation. With fractionated photothermal
   therapy, there was significant treatment effect observed macroscopically
   (P = 0.026) in experimental tumor-bearing mice compared to control
   treated tumor-bearing mice.
   Conclusion: Fractionated photothermal therapy for cancer represents a
   new therapeutic paradigm enabled by the application of novel functional
   nanomaterials. MDT-NPs may advance clinical treatment of cancer by
   enabling fractionated real-time image guided photothermal therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy is a standard treatment for metastatic cancer. However drug
   toxicity limits the dosage that can safely be used, thus reducing
   treatment efficacy. Drug carrier particles, like liposomes, can help
   reduce toxicity by shielding normal tissue from drug and selectively
   depositing drug in tumors. Over years of development, liposomes have
   been optimized to avoid uptake by the Reticuloendothelial System (RES)
   as well as effectively retain their drug content during circulation. As
   a result, liposomes release drug passively, by slow leakage, but this
   uncontrolled drug release can limit treatment efficacy as it can be
   difficult to achieve therapeutic concentrations of drug at tumor sites
   even with tumor-specific accumulation of the carriers. Lipid membranes
   can be photochemically lysed by both Type I (photosensitizer-substrate)
   and Type II (photosensitizer-oxygen) reactions. It has been demonstrated
   in red blood cells (RBCs) in vitro that these photolysis reactions can
   occur in two distinct steps: a light-initiated reaction followed by a
   thermally-initiated reaction. These separable activation steps allow for
   the delay of photohemolysis in a controlled manner using the irradiation
   energy, temperature and photosensitizer concentration. In this work we
   have translated this technique from RBCs to liposomal nanoparticles. To
   that end, we present in vitro data demonstrating this delayed bolus
   release from liposomes, as well as the ability to control the timing of
   this event. Further, we demonstrate for the first time the improved
   delivery of bioavailable cargo selectively to target sites in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to sorbate diffusion inside pore networks of microporous
   crystals, the properties of transport of sorbate molecules near and
   through the margins of these crystals are of a significant interest for
   understanding diffusion properties of micropore-containing membranes and
   catalysts. Such interest is related to the fact that under typical
   conditions of applications of membranes and catalysts sorbate molecules
   pass multiple times through the external surface of microporous
   crystals. This review focuses on several selected aspects of molecular
   transport near and at the external crystal surface as well as on
   selected issues related to diffusion inside of microporous crystals far
   away from their boundaries. The cases of both normal, i.e., Fickian
   diffusion and single-file diffusion are discussed. The interplay between
   molecular transport inside microporous crystals and that inside
   mesopores surrounding the crystals in a membrane is also briefly
   considered at the end of the paper. The discussed results are obtained
   by computer simulations and by analytical treatment.}},

Title = {{Approximating Symmetric Positive Semidefinite Tensors of Even Order}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{434-464}},
Abstract = {{Tensors of various orders can be used for modeling physical quantities
   such as strain and diffusion as well as curvature and other quantities
   of geometric origin. Depending on the physical properties of the modeled
   quantity, the estimated tensors are often required to satisfy the
   positivity constraint, which can be satisfied only with tensors of even
   order. Although the space P-0(2m) of 2mth-order symmetric positive
   semidefinite tensors is known to be a convex cone, enforcing positivity
   constraint directly on P-0(2m) is usually not straightforward
   computationally because there is no known analytic description of
   P-0(2m) for m > 1. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
   enforcing the positivity constraint on even-order tensors by
   approximating the cone P-0(2m) for the cases 0 < m < 3, and presenting
   an explicit characterization of the approximation Sigma(2m) subset of
   Omega(2m) for m >= 1, using the subset Omega(2m) subset of P-0(2m) of
   semidefinite tensors that can be written as a sum of squares of tensors
   of order m. Furthermore, we show that this approximation leads to a
   nonnegative linear least-squares optimization problem with the
   complexity that equals the number of generators in Sigma(2m). Finally,
   we experimentally validate the proposed approach and present an
   application for computing 2mth-order diffusion tensors from diffusion
   weighted magnetic resonance images.}},

Title = {{Algorithms for multi-item procurement planning with case packs}},
Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{181-198}},
Abstract = {{A distribution case pack contains an assortment of varying quantities of
   different stock keeping units (SKUs) packed in a single box or pallet,
   with a goal of reducing handling requirements in the distribution chain.
   This article studies case pack procurement planning problems that
   address the trade-off between reduced order handling costs and higher
   inventory-related costs under dynamic, deterministic demand. The
   properties of optimal solutions for special cases of the problem
   involving one and two case packs are first established and these
   properties are used to solve the problem via dynamic programming. For
   the general model with multiple predefined case packs, which is shown to
   be strongly NP-hard, the exact approach is generalized to solve the
   problem in pseudopolynomial time for a fixed number of case packs. In
   addition, for large-size problems, the problem formulation is strengthed
   using valid inequalities and a family of heuristic solutions is
   designed. Computational tests show that these heuristic approaches
   performvery well compared to the commercial mixed-integer programming
   solver CPLEX. In addition to providing detailed methods for solving
   problems with deterministic demand, strategies for addressing problems
   with uncertain demands are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A simulation model was developed to predict on-target spray deposition
   in citrus tree canopies when using an air-carrier sprayer. It was
   developed as a compartment model in which the space between the sprayer
   and tree and within the canopy was divided into small elements to
   achieve the needed simplification for simulation purposes. This article
   presents the initial part of the model, which considers no tree canopy
   (i.e., spray dispersion between the sprayer and tree boundary or where
   there is a missing tree situation), and its validation with a field
   experiment. The experiment involved the use of a conventional airblast
   sprayer and absorbent paper targets to sample airborne spray at five
   distances and four heights. Spray treatments consisting of combinations
   of two nozzles (Albuz ATR Lilac and Blue) and two forward speeds (2.4
   and 4.8 km h(-1)) were applied in four replications. Spray liquid was a
   solution of Pyranine 10G fluorescent dye; samples were analyzed by
   fluorometry. The results showed good agreements between the model output
   and the experimental data, with the best predictions yielding modeling
   efficiencies and correlation coefficients of 78\% and 0.90 for airborne

Abstract = {{A model was developed to simulate spray dispersion and predict pesticide

   first part of this article. This second part presents details of the
   deposition component of the model and validation with data from a field
   experiment. The experiment involved spray application of a fluorescent
   dye solution to orange trees using a conventional airblast sprayer, and
   sampling leaves at two heights and four canopy depths. The spray

   underpredicted by more than three orders of magnitude and were not
   considered appropriate. This shortcoming notwithstanding, the model has

Abstract = {{Pastures in beef cattle ranches are identified as one of the major land

   N contributions from groundwater to a 170 m ditch section within a beef
   cattle ranch located in the LO basin from June 2005 to May 2009.
   Groundwater depths and total N (TN) and total P (TP) concentrations
   measured in five wells, installed on each side (bank) of the ditch
   section, were combined with the ditch stage and N and P concentrations
   to quantify groundwater flow and nutrient loads. The Dupuit equation was
   used to estimate the groundwater flow to and from the ditch. The average
   net groundwater flow to the ditch section, estimated from a range (low
   and high) of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) values, ranged
   from 765 to 1,729 m(3) per year. Annual groundwater flow contributions
   were positive (to the ditch) for all four years, while the groundwater
   nutrient contributions were positive for three years and negative (from
   the ditch) for one year (drought year). Average net annual TP loads to
   the ditch section ranged from 0.1 (low) to 0.2 (high) kg, while TN loads
   ranged from 2.1 (low) to 4.5 (high) kg. Extrapolating the results from

Abstract = {{Huanglongbing (HLB) is an important citrus disease greatly affecting the
   citrus industry in Florida and other parts of the world. Early disease
   detection would control the spread of this disease through the
   application of suitable management measures. This study evaluates the
   application of fluorescence sensing for HLB detection of citrus leaves.
   A commercial handheld fluorescence sensor was used to collect yellow,
   red, and far-red fluorescence at ultraviolet (UV), blue, green, and red
   excitations from healthy, nutrient-deficient, and HLB-infected leaves of
   two different sweet orange cultivars, Hamlin and Valencia. Evaluation of
   the fluorescence sensing was performed under laboratory (controlled) and
   field conditions. The Naive-Bayes and the bagged decision tree
   classifiers were trained and tested to assess their performance in
   classifying the healthy and stressed (nutrient-deficient) leaves.
   Results revealed that the Naive-Bayes classifier yielded high
   classification accuracy under laboratory conditions (higher than 85\%),
   while the bagged decision tree classifier yielded high overall
   classification accuracy under both laboratory and field conditions
   (higher than 94\%). The bagged decision tree classifier performed better
   than the Naive-Bayes classifier; resulting in higher classification
   accuracy, although the computation time was at least 10 times greater
   than that of the Naive-Bayes classifier. In addition, feature extraction
   using forward feature selection indicated that fluorescence features
   such as yellow fluorescence (UV excitation) and simple fluorescence
   ratio (green excitation) contributed toward differentiating healthy
   leaves from nutrient-deficient and HLB-infected leaves.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of various environmental exposure conditions
   on concrete beams externally reinforced with carbon-fiber-reinforced
   polymer (CFRP) composites were studied. To evaluate the overall
   environmental effects on the durability of the interfacial bonding
   between concrete and CFRP, different commercial composite systems were
   investigated under various exposure conditions by using a new test
   method suggested previously. Results showed that the flexural strength
   of the beam specimens was reduced with environmental exposure. The
   commercial systems showed significant differences in the relative
   strength loss, although they were all intended for the same application,
   suggesting that durability is highly dependent on the epoxy system used
   in the composite. Under exposure to water and other fluids with
   different temperatures, CFRP systems employing wet lay-up composites
   showed high durability with the exception that one system revealed a
   considerable loss in strength with elevated temperature and time. A
   system using a precured laminate exhibited a large reduction in strength
   with exposure. Exposure to brackish water caused an increase in the
   flexural strength by virtue of buildup of barnacles, which protected the
   specimens from deterioration and increased the strength by acting as an
   additional reinforcement. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0000233. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent studies on multidisciplinary design optimization of
   truss-braced-wing airplane configurations have indicated that these
   airplanes offer significant potential for performance improvements in
   terms of fuel efficiency. The typical truss-braced-wing configurations
   obtained from these multidisciplinary design optimization studies have
   wing half-span on the order of 170 ft with low wing-chord and
   thickness-to-chord ratios, which makes the wings very flexible in
   nature. This paper presents a set of parametric studies of
   truss-braced-wing configurations to understand the influence of the wing
   geometry parameters on the wing structural and aeroelastic
   characteristics. The primary parameters considered here are the wing
   half-span, strut sweep, spanwise location of wing-strut joint, and
   number of truss members in the wing configuration. Each
   truss-braced-wing parametric configuration is sized based on strength
   considerations and studied for aeroelastic behavior. The results
   indicate strong influence of all the parameters considered here. For
   most cases, increasing the half-span monotonically increases the wing
   weight and reduces both the natural frequencies and the flutter speed. A
   larger difference between the wing- and strut sweep angles is seen to
   increase wing weight, but with a positive influence on flutter speed for
   various truss-braced-wing configurations. The spanwise intersection
   location has distinct optima for wing weight and flutter speed, which
   typically lie in between 55 and 70\%. These results are expected to
   provide guidance for future multidisciplinary design optimization
   studies for truss-braced-wing configurations.}},

Title = {{A minimally coloured dioxypyrrole polymer as a counter electrode
   material in polymeric electrochromic window devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4953-4962}},
Abstract = {{As the colour palette of solution processable electrochromic conjugated
   polymers has extended from hues of purple and blue to vibrant colours
   such as yellow, orange, red, green, and cyan, the need for a counter
   electrode material that provides charge balance in electrochromic
   devices, but lends minimal colour, has become increasingly necessary.
   Nowhere is this more true than in absorptive/transmissive window-type
   devices where a high level of transparency and near colourlessness is
   needed in the device bleached state. This argument can also be extended
   to absorptive/ reflective display-type devices where an ``on''
   (coloured) and ``off'' (bleached or white) state is desired. Here, we
   report the development of a highly electroactive, low colouration
   efficiency propylenedioxypyrrole-based polymer that exhibits a low redox
   potential and minimal colour saturation in both fully neutralised and
   fully oxidised states. Thin films of the polymer, spray-cast onto
   transparent electrodes exhibited relatively low composite colouration
   efficiencies at 555 nm of 35 cm(2) C-1, contrasted with the the high
   colouration efficiency ECP-Magenta that exhibits 633 cm(2) C-1. we
   further demonstrate the utilisation of this polymer as an effective
   charge balancing counter electrode material in an absorptive/
   transmissive window-type device wherein the vibrantly coloured state and
   highly transmissive, near colourless bleached state of ECP-Magenta is
   maintained giving an overall device contrast of 61\% at 540 nm.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of fluid flow at the interface between elastic solids with
   rough surfaces depends sensitively on the area of real contact, in
   particular close to the percolation threshold, where an irregular
   network of narrow flow channels prevails. In this paper, numerical
   simulation and experimental results for the contact between elastic
   solids with isotropic and anisotropic surface roughness are compared
   with the predictions of a theory based on the Persson contact mechanics
   theory and the Bruggeman effective medium theory. The theory predictions
   are in good agreement with the experimental and numerical simulation
   results and the (small) deviation can be understood as a finite-size
   effect. The fluid squeeze-out at the interface between elastic solids
   with randomly rough surfaces is studied. We present results for such
   high contact pressures that the area of real contact percolates, giving
   rise to sealed-off domains with pressurized fluid at the interface. The
   theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data for a simple
   model system (a rubber block squeezed against a flat glass plate), and
   for prefilled syringes, where the rubber plunger stopper is lubricated
   by a high-viscosity silicon oil to ensure functionality of the delivery
   device. For the latter system we compare the breakloose (or static)
   friction, as a function of the time of stationary contact, to the theory
   prediction.}},

   the reforming reaction is supplied either internally using a heating rod
   placed along the center of the reformer or externally by a heat flux
   applied at the reformer outer wall. Our results show that the thermal
   resistance from the heat source to the reformer environment plays an
   important role in the reformer performance. This thermal resistance
   depends on the reformer geometry, wall material and heat transfer
   coefficients inside the catalyst bed and outside the reformer. Based on
   our numerical results, it is suggested that better methanol conversion
   and hydrogen yield can be obtained using reformer wall material with low
   thermal conductivity and thin thickness. For both internal and external
   heating under the same heat rate supply, no significant difference in
   reformer performance was found.
   A water gas shift (WGS) reaction model was included in the present
   numerical model. In the reformer low-temperature zone the forward WGS
   reaction was clearly demonstrated, resulting in a decrease in carbon
   monoxide (CO) selectivity. In the high temperature zone the backward WGS
   reaction was also clearly demonstrated in which CO selectivity increases
   with the increase in temperature. For both internal and external heating
   under the same heat rate supply, our results indicated that CO
   selectivity is about thirty times lower when the WGS reaction is
   neglected. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Effects of mineral nutrient imbalance, DNA lesion and DNA-protein
   crosslink on growth of Vicia faba L. seedlings hydroponically cultivated
   in concentrations of extraneous lanthanum (La) for 20 days were
   investigated in the present experiment. The results showed that contents
   of La, Cu or K elements in roots generally changed synchronously with
   those in leaves, while Ca, Fe, Zn, Mg, Mn or P in the roots altered
   inversely to those in the leaves. Thus, the extraneous La led to
   redistribution and imbalance of mineral nutrient elements in the roots
   and leaves. DNA lesion and DNA-protein crosslink were investigated by
   single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) and sodium dodecyl
   sulfate/potassium (SDS/K+) precipitation methods, respectively. The
   results demonstrated that the increasing La induced DNA break and
   DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in the seedlings. These results suggested
   that mineral nutrient imbalance, DNA lesion and DNA-protein crosslink
   were involved in the growth retardation and growth alteration of the
   seedlings, which may help to understand the mechanisms of rare earth
   elements (REEs) on plant growth.}},

Abstract = {{Given the spatial complexity of urban drainage systems, the numerous
   system appurtenances and unit operations are a maintenance challenge.
   Maintenance can be the Achilles heel for best management practices
   (BMPs), and washout is of crucial importance for hydrodynamic separators
   (HS) that commonly function as preliminary unit operations to separate
   coarse particulate matter (PM) in urban systems. This study combines
   physical and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to quantify
   washout from two common HS types; screened (SHS) and baffled (BHS).
   Washout of particle size distributions (PSDs) for a range of flows is
   examined. Trajectory analysis of PM illustrates entrainment and washout
   as a function of PSDs and PM deposit depth. Velocity distributions
   identify washout-critical PM sizes and areas. Bed profiles are modeled
   by integrating velocity distributions across washout areas. A Shields
   washout criterion contradicts physical and CFD results, illustrating the
   portability challenges of open-channel approaches to nonuniform complex
   flows in BMPs. The driving parameter for washout is flow intensity at
   the PM deposit interface. The physically validated CFD model reproduces
   washout as a function of PSD and flow rate. A baffled HS provides
   volumetric isolation of deposited PM and generates low washout as tested
   with a fine hetero-disperse PSD. In comparison to the low washout of the
   baffled HS for a finer and hydraulically isolated PM deposit, a screened
   HS generates higher washout for a coarse monodisperse PM deposit, and
   over 50\% of the volumetric domain has an upward velocity vector. DOI:

Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Rain sensors are devices that connect to automatic irrigation systems to
   interrupt scheduled irrigation events as a result of rainfall. The
   accuracy of expanding-disk rain sensors over nearly five years was
   evaluated at a research site in north central Florida. Seven rain sensor
   model/rainfall set point combinations were evaluated. The seven
   configurations are as follows: Wireless Rain-Clik (WL) rain sensor,
   Mini-Clik rain sensors with rainfall set point of, 3, 6, 6, and 13 mm
   (3MC, 6MC, Hunter, and 13MC), Irritrol RFS 1000 at a 6-mm set point
   (Irritrol), and Toro TWRS at a 6-mm set point (Toro). The MC and WL
   configurations were evaluated for 1,182 days with four replicates. The
   Hunter, Irritrol, and Toro configurations were monitored 1,150 days with
   eight replicates. Data were collected for each configuration to
   determine the total time in interrupt mode. This information was
   compared with measured rainfall data on site. On average, the WL, 3MC,
   6MC, 13MC, Hunter, Irritrol, and Toro required 3.2, 1.9, 1.6, 6.6, 3.8,
   4.3, and 5.8 mm of rainfall for interrupt mode, respectively. Accuracy
   ranged from 27 to 97\%. Rain sensor accuracy had percentile point
   changes from -23 to 25 over the study period, where a negative value
   indicated a decrease in accuracy. In general, rain sensors at 6-mm
   thresholds or less become more accurate after 560 days of installation,
   because they became less sensitive over time. However, rain sensors with
   newer expanding-disk hygroscopic material seemed to result in more
   accurate response and were less erratic than sensors in the field in
   most cases for over a year. Hygroscopic material that had been installed
   longer had more erratic behaviors such as going into interrupt mode with
   little or no rainfall. For the best accuracy and most consistent
   behavior, Hunter Mini-Clik and Hunter Wireless Rain-Clik rain sensors
   should be replaced after 1 year while Irritrol RSF 1000 and Toro TWRS
   rain sensors do not need to be replaced for at least three years. Rain
   sensors could increase water savings to homeowners and have
   environmental benefits but should not be used in applications requiring
   consistent accuracy greater than 70\%. DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study that incorporates computer
   simulations in teaching linear scheduling concepts and techniques, in a
   civil engineering course, ``Construction Planning and Scheduling.{''}
   The effect of the use of computer simulations in the course shows that
   the students who were taught with simulation gained a better
   understanding of linear scheduling concepts and techniques than those
   students taught without simulation. The data and analysis leading to
   this finding are presented and discussed in this paper. Two groups of
   students were considered in this research: (1) civil engineering
   students from the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the
   University of Florida and (2) civil engineering students from the
   Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Chile. Each group
   was randomly separated into two subgroups: one subgroup was taught by
   using the traditional method of linear scheduling (without the use of
   computer simulation) and the other subgroup was taught by using
   simulations. At the end of the teaching period, the students in both
   subgroups answered an objective test-type questionnaire specifically
   designed to address their understanding of linear scheduling techniques.
   They were also required, in a more subjective way, to provide their
   evaluation of the teaching method involved. To assess the effect of
   incorporating computer simulation in teaching linear scheduling, the
   students' evaluations and answers to the questionnaire were
   statistically compared. The analysis of the responses showed significant
   differences between the students' understanding of the subject by using
   the two teaching methods, with the use of computer simulation shown to
   be a more effective teaching tool for linear scheduling techniques. DOI:

Abstract = {{Combined wastewater collection systems continue to serve as a common
   urban conveyance method in urban areas of Europe and older urban areas
   of the United States. This study uses combined wastewater collection
   system monitoring data from the urbanizing Liguori catchment and channel
   in Cosenza (Italy) to illustrate event-based delivery and distribution
   of conveyed pollutant indices. Motivated by recent European Union (EU)
   discharge control legislation, this study specifically differentiates
   the event-based delivery of these indices between dry and wet-weather
   flows. Although the relatively steady to diurnal-variable delivery
   phenomena in dry weather flows are known, transport limiting phenomena
   for wet-weather hydrology and mass delivery typically are not known for
   the same catchment. Limiting categories of transport for a pollutant
   phase are generated by variables such as flow volume and duration,
   stream power, hydrograph parameters, and previous dry hours (PDH).
   Transport limitations of wet and dry weather events from the 414-ha
   catchment were analyzed and characterized as limited by mass indices
   (first-order, first flush transport) or limited by flow (zero-order
   transport). Results indicated significant concentration differences
   between mass-and flow-limited events. Higher concentrations were
   associated with mass-limited events. Frequency distributions of flow,
   total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and five-day
   biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) were consistently exponential for
   wet-weather and mass-limited events. In contrast, flow, TSS, and BOD5
   concentrations were distributed normally for flow-limited events.
   Results indicated a reasonable linear relationship between discharged
   TSS, COD, and BOD5 (biochemical oxygen demand) for Liguori Channel
   discharges into the Crati River. Wet-weather event transport was
   predominately mass-limited for TSS, COD, and BOD5. Water Environ. Res.,

   mineralization of the collagen matrix. In this study, densifted collagen
   films (up to 100 mu m thick) were fabricated by a plastic compression
   technique and cross-linked using carbodiimide. Then,
   collagen-hydroxyapatite composites were prepared by using a
   polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) mineralization process. Compared
   to traditional methods that produce only extrafibrillar hydroxyapatite
   (HA) clusters on the surface of collagen scaffolds, by using the PILP
   mineralization process, homogeneous intra- and extrafibrillar minerals
   were achieved on densified collagen films, leading to a similar
   nanostructure as bone, and a woven microstructure analogous to woven
   bone. The role of collagen cross links on mineralization was examined
   and it was found that the cross linked collagen films stimulated the
   mineralization reaction, which in turn enhanced the mechanical
   properties (hardness and modulus). The highest value of hardness and
   elastic modulus was 0.7 +/- 0.1 and 9.1 +/- 1.4 GPa in the dry state,
   respectively, which is comparable to that of woven bone. In the wet
   state, the values were much lower (177 +/- 31 and 8 +/- 3 MPa) due to
   inherent microporosity in the films, but still comparable to those of
   woven bone in the same conditions. Mineralization of collagen films with
   controllable mineral content and good mechanical properties provide a
   biomimetic route toward the development of bone substitutes for the next
   generation of biomaterials. This work also provides insight into
   understanding the role of collagen fibrils on mineralization.}},

Abstract = {{We report the chemical etching characteristics of Ga-face and N-face GaN
   using phosphoric acid (H3PO4) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) solutions.
   Hexagonal pyramids, which consisted of the \{10-1-1\} planes, were
   present on the N-face after KOH (2M, 100 degrees C) etching. By
   contrast, using the H3PO4 (85 wt.\%, 100 degrees C) solutions, the
   nitrogen surface of GaN showed dodecagonal pyramids. Dodecagonal and
   hexagonal pyramids repeatedly appear on the etched surface when using
   the H3PO4 or KOH solutions, respectively. A low concentration of H3PO4
   (H3PO4 : deionized water = 1:32, 1:64) produced a roughened surface with
   coexistence of dodecagonal and hexagonal pyramids. The photoluminescence
   (PL) intensity of the etched surfaces significantly increased due to
   multiple scattering events compared to the non-etched surface. Thus, the
   etching techniques developed in this study were shown to improve the
   light extraction efficiency of light emitting diodes (LEDs), avoiding
   the damage to the GaN typically created by plasma etching methods. (C)

Abstract = {{A finite element simulation was used to estimate the temperature
   distributions within AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors
   (HEMTs) during the laser lift-off process. The time-dependent simulation
   showed that a thin layer of GaN at the GaN/sapphire interface was heated
   up to around 1600 K in less than 25 ns by a pulsed laser exposure with a
   duration of 25 ns and a fluence of 800 mJ/cm(2) to decompose this GaN
   layer into Ga and nitrogen. Experimentally, there was a threshold
   fluence around 550 mJ/cm(2), corresponding to 1300 K at the GaN/sapphire
   interface, for partially lifting off the HEMT structure from the
   sapphire. The simulated temperature at the GaN/sapphire interface with a
   fluence of 420 mJ/cm(2) never reached above 1000 K, however, the HEMT
   structure was lifted-off by multiple laser exposures at this fluence.
   Therefore, instead of thermally induced decomposition, the lift-off
   mechanism could also be through the Ga-N bond breaking during the
   multiple lower-fluence high-energy 193 nm laser exposures. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The authors report the proton energy dependence of the degradation of
   AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) with GaN cap layers
   from 5 to 15 MeV at a fixed dose of 5 x 10(15) cm(-2). All the samples
   degraded after proton irradiation. However, higher damage in dc
   electrical properties was observed at lower proton energies. Saturation
   currents at V-DS = 6V and V-GS = 0 V reduced by 47\% after proton
   irradiation at 5 MeV energy, but the reduction was less by 25\% and 9\%
   at 10 and 15 MeV, respectively. Similar trends were observed in other
   electrical properties {[}transconductance (g(m)) and gate leakage
   currents]. This energy dependence from 5 to 15 MeV can be explained by
   the energy-dependent penetration depth of the proton. Protons with
   higher kinetic energy can penetrate deeper while creating less numbers
   of defects at shallow depths where the active layers of the HEMTs are
   located. These results are in good agreement with stopping and range of
   ions in matter results. The optimization of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure

Abstract = {{We model a very large, tunable magnetoresistance (MR) in a graphene
   nanoribbon field-effect transistor, without artificial engineering of
   ferromagnetic contacts. A high MR of nearly 100\% (about 50\%) is
   obtained at low temperature (room temperature). We show that the MR
   ratio can be further tuned by using conventional electric field, in
   agreement with a recent experiment. The simulation results indicate that
   the large MR of GNRs stems from reduction of the bandgap of GNRs in the
   presence of applied magnetic field related to the 0th Landau level in
   graphene. Interestingly, in a more realistic device with edge roughness,
   the MR ratio is not degraded but rather enhanced, caused by the magnetic
   field induced spatial separation of the transport states. The large,
   tunable MR of GNRs resistant to edge roughness is attractive to device
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Knee forces are highly significant in osteoarthritis and in the survival
   and function of knee arthroplasty. A large number of studies have
   attempted to estimate forces around the knee during various activities.
   Several approaches have been used to relate knee kinematics and external
   forces to internal joint contact forces, the most popular being inverse
   dynamics, forward dynamics, and static body analyses. Knee forces have
   also been measured in vivo after knee arthroplasty, which serves as
   valuable validation of computational predictions. This review summarizes
   the results of published studies that measured knee forces for various
   activities. The efficacy of various methods to alter knee force
   distribution, such as gait modification, orthotics, walking aids, and
   custom treadmills are analyzed. Current gaps in our knowledge are
   identified and directions for future research in this area are outlined.}},

Title = {{Self-assembly of alkoxysilanized humic substances into multidomain

   molecular structure of the adsorbate}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{2452-2459}},
Abstract = {{Self assembly of natural organic materials (e. g., humic substances) on
   mineral surfaces leads to the formation of adlayers with physically
   different domains. However, direct evidence to explain the molecular
   interactions responsible for the formation of these domains is still
   missing. Here, we developed alkoxysilanized humic probes capable of
   self-assembling onto hydroxylated surfaces. Using modified humic
   substances from vastly differed sources (peat, water, coal) and DNA
   array glass slides as a flat surrogate for mineral surfaces, we create
   humic adlayers under aqueous conditions and show them to be homogeneous
   on the macroscale, but consisted of nanosize domains in coal and water
   humics and submicron-size domains in peat humics. The surface charge and
   hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of humic associates were proposed as
   major molecular drivers of the self-assembly with the former causing the
   formation of thin adlayers composed of separated nanosize domains (e.
   g., coal humics) and the latter enhancing the formation of thicker
   adlayers composed of interconnected domains linked in chains up to the
   submicron-size (e. g., peat humic materials). To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first time alkoxysilanized humic probes were used
   to examine how humic adsorbates and their molecular structure influences
   the surface morphology of assembled adlayers. In this fashion, the humic
   adlayer with molecularly-defined functional elements can be assembled on
   any hydroxylated surface in situ, at the water-solid interface.}},

Abstract = {{The acoustic communication channel is frequency selective with long
   memory, leading to severe intersymbol interference (ISI). To mitigate
   ISI, equalizer becomes an indispensable module in the receiver
   structure. However, the time-varying nature of the underwater acoustic
   environment imposes unique challenges to the design of an effective
   equalizer. First, the equalization process needs to be performed on a
   block basis and the block length could be short. Second, concerning that
   the dynamic acoustic medium makes the newly acquired channel information
   readily outdated, it is desirable that the equalizer performance is
   robust against the inaccuracy of the channel information when the
   transmission scheme involves cross-block reference. In this paper, we
   consider a statistical semiblind equalizer implemented by the Gibbs
   sampler techniques. The proposed equalizer conducts channel estimation
   and symbol detection in a joint manner, and it is robust to the accuracy
   of the channel information. The effectiveness of the proposed semiblind
   equalizer is demonstrated using both simulated and the 2008 Surface
   Processes and Communications Experiment (SPACE08, Martha's Vineyard, MA)
   in-water experimentation examples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper quantifies and comparatively validates functional
   connectivity between neurons by measuring the statistical dependence
   between their firing rates. Based on statistical analysis of the
   pairwise functional connectivity, we estimate, exclusively from neural
   data, the neural assembly functional connectivity given a behavior task,
   which provides a quantifiable representation of the dynamic nature
   during the behavioral task. Because of the time scale of behavior
   (100-1000 ms), a statistical method that yields robust estimators for
   this small sample size is desirable. In this work, the temporal
   resolutions of four estimators of functional connectivity are compared
   on both simulated data and real neural ensemble recordings. The
   comparison highlights how the properties and assumptions of
   statistical-based and phase-based metrics affect the interpretation of
   connectivity. Simulation results show that mean square contingency (MSC)
   and mutual information (MI) create more robust quantification of
   functional connectivity under identical conditions than cross
   correlation (CC) and phase synchronization (PhS) when the sample size is
   1 s. The results of the simulated analysis are extended to real neuronal
   recordings to assess the functional connectivity in monkey's cortex
   corresponding to three movement states in a food reaching task and
   construct the assembly graph given a movement state and the activation
   degree of a state-related assembly over time using the statistical test
   exclusively from neural data dependencies. The activation degree of a
   given state-related assembly reaches the peak repeatedly when the
   specific movement states occur, which also reveals the network of
   interactions among the neurons are key for the operation of a specific
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{There is a well-established literature indicating a relationship between
   iron in brain tissue and Alzheimer's disease (AD). More recently, it has
   become clear that AD is associated with neuroinflammatory and oxidative
   changes which probably result from microglial activation. In this study,
   we investigated the correlative changes in microglial activation,
   oxidative stress, and iron dysregulation in a mouse model of AD which
   exhibits early-stage amyloid deposition. Microfocus X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy analysis of intact brain tissue sections prepared from A
   beta PP/PS1 transgenic mice revealed the presence of magnetite, a
   mixed-valence iron oxide, and local elevations in iron levels in tissue
   associated with amyloid-beta-containing plaques. The evidence indicates
   that the expression of markers of microglial activation, CD11b and CD68,
   and astrocytic activation, GFAP, were increased, and were
   histochemically determined to be adjacent to amyloid-beta-containing
   plaques. These findings support the contention that, in addition to
   glial activation and oxidative stress, iron dysregulation is an early
   event in AD pathology.}},

   maleimide containing red emitting donor-acceptor-donor dopant molecule,
   bE-BTD(X). It was initially intended that a blend of these three
   components would afford a system where the dopant concentration could be
   increased to the point where complete energy transfer from the host
   polymer to the emissive dopant would be achieved. Because such systems
   often suffer from quenching and shifts in emission maxima indicative of
   emitter aggregation, it was hypothesized that crosslinking the emissive
   dopant with the host polymer would lead to de-aggregation of the dopant
   emitter. In thin films of PFO (X) and bE-BTD(X), a 16 nm bathochromic
   shift is observed in the emission maximum when the dopant concentration
   is increased from 1\% to 8\%, suggesting that the dopant is aggregating.
   In similar films where PC is included and the film is heated to affect
   crosslinking, a comparable 16 nm shift in the emission maximum is
   observed indicating that aggregation is still occurring and not affected
   by the heating step. Similar decreases in luminance are observed
   independent of whether the heating step is included. Not unexpectedly,
   however, crosslinking does afford an insoluble network that allows for
   the subsequent solution deposition of additional layers. When an
   electron transport layer (ETL) is used in PFO(X)/PC devices, increases
   of 190\% and 490\% are observed in luminance and luminous efficiency,
   respectively, relative to devices without an ETL indicating that this
   Diels-Alder crosslinkable system is amenable to multilayer deposition by
   solution methods. When bE-BTD(X) is included as the dopant emitter,
   similar increases in luminance and luminous efficiency are observed with
   the ETL included compared to devices where this layer is omitted.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput ballistic injection nanorheology is a method for the
   quantitative study of cell mechanics. Cell mechanics are measured by
   ballistic injection of submicron particles into the cytoplasm of living
   cells and tracking the spontaneous displacement of the particles at high
   spatial resolution. The trajectories of the cytoplasm-embedded particles
   are transformed into mean-squared displacements, which are subsequently
   transformed into frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli and
   time-dependent creep compliance of the cytoplasm. This method allows for
   the study of a wide range of cellular conditions, including cells inside
   a 3D matrix, cell subjected to shear flows and biochemical stimuli, and
   cells in a live animal. Ballistic injection lasts <1 min and is followed
   by overnight incubation. Multiple particle tracking for one cell lasts
   <1 min. Forty cells can be examined in <1 h.}},

Abstract = {{Bioactive glasses having chemical compositions between
   1Na(2)O-2CaO-3SiO(2) (1N2C3S) and 1.5Na(2)O-1.5CaO-3SiO(2) (1N1C2S)
   containing 0, 4 and 6 wt.\% P2O5 were crystallized through two stage
   thermal treatments. By carefully controlling these treatments we
   separately studied the effects on the mechanical properties of two
   important microstructural features not studied before, crystallized
   volume fraction and crystal size. Fracture strength, elastic modulus and
   indentation fracture toughness were measured as a function of
   crystallized volume fraction for a constant crystal size. Glass-ceramics
   with a crystalline volume fraction between 34\% and 60\% exhibited a
   three-fold improvement in fracture strength and an increase of 40\% in
   indentation fracture toughness compared with the parent glass. For the
   optimal crystalline concentration (34\% and 60\%) these mechanical
   properties were then measured for different grain sizes, from 5 to 21 mu
   m. The glass-ceramic with the highest fracture strength and indentation
   fracture toughness was that with 34\% crystallized volume fracture and
   13 mu m crystals. Compared with the parent glass, the average fracture
   strength of this glass-ceramic was increased from 80 to 210 MPa, and the
   fracture toughness from 0.60 to 0.95 MPa.m(1/2). The increase in
   indentation fracture toughness was analyzed using different theoretical
   models, which demonstrated that it is due to crack deflection.
   Fortunately, the elastic modulus E increased only slightly: from 60 to
   70 GPa (the elastic modulus of biomaterials should be as close as
   possible to that of cortical bone). In summary, the flexural strength of
   our best material (215 MPa) is significantly greater than that of
   cortical bone and comparable with that of apatite-wollastonite (A/W)
   bioglass ceramics, with the advantage that it shows a much lower elastic
   modulus. These results thus provide a relevant guide for the design of
   bioactive glass-ceramics with improved microstructure. (C) 2011 Acta

Abstract = {{The cellular actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in the ability of
   cells to properly sense, propagate, and respond to external stresses and
   other mechanical stimuli. Calponin, an actin-binding protein found both
   in muscle and non-muscle cells, has been implicated in actin
   cytoskeletal organization and regulation. In this work, we studied the
   mechanical and structural interaction of actin with basic calponin, a
   differentiation marker in smooth muscle cells, on a single filament
   level. We imaged fluorescently labeled thermally fluctuating actin
   filaments and found that at moderate calponin binding densities, actin
   filaments were more flexible, evident as a reduction in persistence
   length from 8.0 to 5.8 mu m. When calponin-decorated actin filaments
   were subjected to shear, we observed a marked reduction of filament
   lengths after decoration with calponin, which we argue was due to
   shear-induced filament rupture rather than depolymerization. This
   increased shear susceptibility was exacerbated with calponin
   concentration. Cryo-electron microscopy results confirmed previously
   published negative stain electron microscopy results and suggested
   alterations in actin involving actin subdomain 2. A weakening of F-actin
   intermolecular association is discussed as the underlying cause of the
   observed mechanical perturbations. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Parasitic contact resistance increasingly limits modern CMOS
   performance. Atomistic scale features and quantum effects play an
   important role in determining silicide-silicon contact properties. We
   develop ab initio quantum transport simulation capabilities for
   silicide-silicon contacts, which provide first principle descriptions of
   interfacial structural, electronic, and transport properties. It is
   found that transmission through the CoSi2-Si contact of the primed
   valleys can be distinctively different from that of the unprimed
   valleys, due to the size of the CoSi2 Fermi surface. Interfacial
   atomistic doping can modulate the barrier height, but, at the same time,
   lower the transmission and induce localized bandgap states. The primary
   effect of strain is to modulate the barrier height instead of quantum
   transmission. The physical insights obtained here would not have been
   possible by tight binding simulations, where reliable interface binding
   parameters lack. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   realistic simulation of occupancy dynamics in non-emergency situations.
   Comparison of the model's prediction of distributions of random

   those estimated from measurements in commercial buildings. We also
   propose a lower complexity graphical model of occupancy evolution in
   multi-zone buildings. The graphical model captures information on mean
   occupancy and correlation among occupancy at various zones in the
   building. The agent-based model can be used in conjunction with building
   performance simulation tools, while the graphical model is more suitable

Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Multifunctional tribological coatings rely on combinations of materials
   to improve properties, such as lubricity and wear resistance. For
   example, some polymer composites exhibit favorable tribological
   performance as solid lubricants. Here, classical molecular dynamics
   simulations are used to investigate the tribological behaviors of a
   mixed system of polyethylene (PE) sliding over polytetrafluoroethylene
   (PTFE) with the results compared with the sliding of the relevant
   homogeneous systems. In particular, oriented cross-linked PTFE and PE
   surfaces are slid in several relative sliding directions such that the
   surface chains are in-registry or out-of-registry and at various applied
   normal loads. The simulation results quantify the ways in which the
   mixed PTFE-PE system behaves differently than either of the homogeneous
   systems due to the lack of interlocking phases at the interface. These
   findings are compared with experimental production of
   polyetheretherketone (PEEK)-PTFE composites that have unusually low wear
   rates of 7.0 x 10(-8) mm(3)/Nm, coupled with a steady, low friction
   coefficient of mu = 0.11 for over two million sliding cycles. The
   simulation results explain the atomic-scale origins of the frictional

Abstract = {{An instrument has been developed that allows in situ optical analysis
   and tribological measurements for contacts between solid bodies; an
   interferometric optical analysis can be used to measure and observe
   contact size, contact geometry, near contact topography, tribofilm
   formation, tribofilm motion, tribofilm thickness, wear debris formation,
   and wear debris morphology. The optical arrangement is in such a way
   that a 0th order interference fringe highlights the real contact area of
   contact, while near contact regions are height-mapped with higher order
   Newton's rings interference fringes. Images synchronized with force and
   position measurements allow for the potential to test and validate
   models for contact mechanics, adhesion, and sliding. The contact and
   friction measurement between a rough rubber sphere and a polished glass
   counterface were studied over a range of loads from 1 to 50 mN.}},

Abstract = {{The growing interest in micro aerial vehicles has brought attention to
   the need for an improved understanding of the aerodynamics of
   low-aspect-ratio wings at low Reynolds numbers. In this study, flat
   plate wings with rectangular and tapered planforms were fabricated with
   aspect ratios of 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 3, and the aerodynamic loading was
   measured at Reynolds numbers between 5 x 10(4) and 1 x 10(5). Surface
   tuft visualization was used to observe the interactions between the tip
   vortices and the leading-edge vortex. The tests were initially conducted
   at a sideslip angle of 0 degrees and were then repeated for beta = 10,
   20, and 35 degrees with and without winglets. Measurements made with a
   six-component force balance showed that a decrease in aspect ratio
   caused an increase in alpha(stall) and C(Lmax) due to the nonlinear lift
   induced by the interacting flow on the upper wing surface. In addition,
   the detachment of tip vortices after stall leads to a sudden decrease in
   drag coefficient as the magnitude of the induced drag drops
   significantly. At increasing sideslip angles, the effects of the
   crossflow still contribute to an increase in lift but significantly
   reduce the pitching moment about the quarter-chord, thus decreasing the
   wing's ability to recover from angle-of-attack perturbations. These
   results show that, while the effects of tip vortices and the
   leading-edge vortex complicate the flowfield around a low-aspect-ratio
   wing, particularly at increased sideslip angles, their impact tends to
   improve the aerodynamic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Online analysis of nutrients in soil would be beneficial in soil and
   agronomic sciences as it could lead to real-time adjustment of the level
   of nutrients in soils. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)
   yields a real-time signal that could be correlated with the total
   elemental concentration in soils, and, hopefully, to the available
   fraction of the element in soils. As a first step in developing a
   technique for the real-time evaluation of the nutrient concentration in
   soils, in this study LIBS was applied to the evaluation of total element
   concentrations in mixtures of soils and fertilizers. Two fertilizers
   were mixed with soil in several concentrations, and loose powder samples
   of these mixtures were analyzed using LIBS. Calibration curves for three
   macroelements, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P), and two
   microelements, iron (Fe) and sodium (Na), in the samples allowed
   determination of detection and quantification limits for total elements
   in soils. The correlation coefficients (r(2)) between total element
   concentrations and the LIBS signal were above 0.85 for all elements;
   however, we note that Ca showed evidence of self-absorption. The
   quantification limits were below typical total element concentration in
   soils; however, matrix effects demanded one calibration curve for each
   element and for each soil/fertilizer mixture.}},

   dimethyl sulfide and isoprene}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{271-278}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) created from the photooxidation of a
   mixture of isoprene and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was studied at different
   NOx concentrations (40-220 ppb) and humidities (12\%, 42\% and 80\%)
   using a Teflon film indoor chamber. To study the effect of isoprene on
   DMS products, the major DMS photooxidation products, such as sulfuric
   acid, methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and methanesulfinic acid (MSIA), were
   quantified in both the presence and the absence of isoprene using a
   Particle-Into-Liquid-Sampler coupled with Ion Chromatography (PILS-IC).
   The resulting PILS-IC data showed that the DMS aerosol yield
   significantly decreased due to the photooxidation of isoprene. A 35.2\%
   DMS aerosol yield reduction was observed due to 800 ppb isoprene in 185
   ppb NOx and 140 ppb DMS. Among the aerosol-phase DMS oxidation products,
   MSA was the most sensitive to the presence of isoprene (e.g., 46\%
   reduction). The DMS aerosol product analysis indicates that isoprene
   oxidation affects the pathways of MSA formation on the aerosol surface.
   Using a new approach that implements an Organic Carbon (OC) analyzer,
   the isoprene SOA yield (Y-iso) in the DMS/isoprene/NOx system was also
   estimated. The OC data showed that Y-iso increased significantly with
   DMS compared to the Y-iso without DMS. For example, Y-iso with 80 ppb
   NOx and 840 ppb isoprene was increased by 124.6\% due to 100 ppb DMS at
   RH = 42\%. Our study suggests that the heterogeneous reactions of
   isoprene oxidation products with the highly acidic products (e.g., MSA
   and sulfuric acid) from DMS photooxidation can considerably contribute
   to the Y-iso increase. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in massively parallel sequencing technology have created
   new opportunities to probe the hidden world of microbes.
   Taxonomy-independent clustering of the 16S rRNA gene is usually the
   first step in analyzing microbial communities. Dozens of algorithms have
   been developed in the last decade, but a comprehensive benchmark study
   is lacking. Here, we survey algorithms currently used by
   microbiologists, and compare seven representative methods in a
   large-scale benchmark study that addresses several issues of concern. A
   new experimental protocol was developed that allows different algorithms
   to be compared using the same platform, and several criteria were
   introduced to facilitate a quantitative evaluation of the clustering
   performance of each algorithm. We found that existing methods vary
   widely in their outputs, and that inappropriate use of distance levels
   for taxonomic assignments likely resulted in substantial overestimates
   of biodiversity in many studies. The benchmark study identified our
   recently developed ESPRIT-Tree, a fast implementation of the average
   linkage-based hierarchical clustering algorithm, as one of the best
   algorithms available in terms of computational efficiency and clustering
   accuracy.}},

   surface defects and in the absence of any preferred plane propagates
   perpendicular to the surface. The presence of surface defects on the

Abstract = {{Poor adhesion and delamination of diamond-like carbon(DLC) films due to
   high residual stresses has been a long standing challenge for thick (> 1
   mu m) DLC films. In this study, delamination-free and low stress DLC
   films were deposited using multi-cycle pulsed laser deposition (MCPLD)
   from a graphite target. Residual stress values of a micron thick film
   prepared by MCPLD was 2 GPa, as compared to 9 GPa in films deposited by
   conventional or single cycle pulsed laser deposition (SCPLD). Adhesion
   failure was completely absent in the DLC films prepared by the MCPLD
   process owing to such low residual stress. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{Four representative Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) highway
   sign support trusses were evaluated analytically and in the field to
   assess their design load capacity and fatigue resistance when subjected

   dynamic field testing with strain gages and accelerometers to collect
   structural behavior data when subjected to manual excitation, wind
   loading, and truck gust excitation. Companion analytical models were
   developed and calibrated to represent the structures in the field, after
   which these were then used to assess the response of the trusses at full
   design wind loads. Current IDOT and AASHTO highway sign support
   structure design loading and resistance approaches with respect to both
   strength and fatigue have been critically assessed in light of the

Abstract = {{The success of nanotechnology will undoubtedly lead to the increased
   introduction of nanoparticles (NPs) into natural systems, and aquatic
   systems will likely act as sinks for these new pollutants. Differences
   in the chemistry of these aquatic systems will control changes in
   surface properties of NPs and therefore could impact their environmental
   fate and toxicity. A series of batch experiments was conducted to
   determine the effect of natural waters with different solution
   chemistries on nanosilver (nAg) particle dispersion, stability, and
   toxicity. Toxicity assays were performed in tested natural waters as
   well as in traditional growth media. Briefly, nAg suspended in a natural
   water with a low ionic strength/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ratio had
   an average particle size of 76.8 +/- 0.4nm and was less toxic to
   Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (median lethal
   concentration {[}LC50]=221ppb and median inhibition concentration
   {[}IC50]=1,600ppb, respectively), whereas a natural water with a high
   ionic strength/DOC ratio had an average particle size of 192 +/- 5.1nm
   and produced a much higher toxicity response (LC50=0.433ppb and
   IC50=22.6ppb, respectively). These findings help to establish needed
   correlations between water-matrix-dependent nAg particle properties and
   toxicity implications and indicate that the use of traditional growth
   media in toxicity assays concerning engineered NPs might not always be
   appropriate. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012;31:168175. (C) 2011 SETAC}},

   This study assessed the biological effects of a number of commonly used

   organism, NM toxicity can be mitigated by use of nontoxic surfactants,
   and that a multispecies approach is necessary to account for the
   sensitivity of different organisms. In addition to the intrinsic
   physicochemical properties of NMs, exposure studies should take into

Abstract = {{A reduced order nonlinear observer is proposed for the problem of

   observed by a moving calibrated camera. In comparison to existing work
   which requires some knowledge of the Euclidean geometry of an observed
   object or full knowledge of the camera motion, the developed reduced
   order observer only requires one camera linear velocity and
   corresponding acceleration to asymptotically identify the Euclidean
   coordinates of the feature points attached to an object (with proper
   scale reconstruction) and the remaining camera velocities. The unknown
   linear velocities are assumed to be generated using a model with unknown
   parameters. The unknown angular velocities are determined from a robust
   estimator which uses a standard Homography decomposition algorithm
   applied to tracked feature points. A Lyapunov analysis is provided to
   prove the observer asymptotically estimates the unknown states under a

Abstract = {{Purpose: The biological response of tissue exposed to radiations emitted
   by internal radioactivity is often correlated with the mean absorbed
   dose to a tissue element. However, experimental studies show that even
   when the mean absorbed dose to the tissue element is constant, the
   response of the cell population within the tissue element can vary
   significantly depending on the distribution of radioactivity at the
   cellular and multicellular levels. The present work develops theoretical
   models to simulate these observations.
   Materials and methods: Two theoretical models were created to simulate
   experimental three-dimensional cell culture models with homogeneous and
   inhomogeneous tissue environments. The cells were assigned activities
   according to lognormal distributions of an alpha particle emitter or a
   monoenergetic electron emitter. Absorbed doses to the cell nuclei were
   assessed with point-kernel geometric-factor and Electron Gamma Shower
   version nrc (EGSnrc) Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations,
   respectively. The self-and cross-dose to individual cell nuclei were
   calculated and a Monte Carlo method was used to determine their fate.
   Survival curves were produced after tallying the live and dead cells.
   Results: Both percent cells labeled and breadth of lognormal
   distribution affected the dose distribution at the cellular level, which
   in turn, influenced the shape of the cell survival curves.
   Conclusions: Multicellular Monte Carlo dosimetry-models offer improved
   capacity to predict response to radiopharmaceuticals compared to
   approaches based on mean absorbed dose to the tissue.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a mathematical model and two solution
   methodologies for efficiently predicting the equilibrium paths of an
   arbitrarily shaped, precurved, clamped beam. Such structures are common
   among multistable microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). First, a novel
   polynomial-based solution approach enables simultaneous solution of all
   equilibrium configurations associated with an arbitrary mechanical
   loading pattern. Second, the normal flow algorithm is used to negotiate
   the particularly complex nonlinear equilibrium paths associated with
   electrostatic loading and is shown to perform exceptionally well.
   Overall, the techniques presented herein provide designers with general
   and efficient computational frameworks for studying the effects of
   loading, shape, and imperfections on beam behavior. Sample problems
   motivated from switch and actuator applications in the literature
   demonstrate the methodologies' utility in predicting the nonlinear
   equilibrium paths for structures of practical importance. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Orthopedic surgeons and their patients continue to seek better

   flexion and stair activities using fluoroscopy and model-image
   registration. In 20 patients with 25 BCS knees, we observed average
   implant flexion of 128 degrees during kneeling and consistent posterior
   condylar translations with knee flexion. Tibial rotations were
   qualitatively similar to those observed in the arthritic natural knee.
   Knee kinematics with BCS arthroplasty were qualitatively more similar to
   arthritic natural knees than knees with either posterior
   cruciate-retaining or posterior-stabilized arthroplasty.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Collisional heat transfer between two contacting curved surfaces is
   investigated computationally using a finite difference method and
   analytically using various asymptotic methods. Transformed coordinates
   that scale with the contact radius and the diffusion length are used for
   the computations. Hertzian contact theory of elasticity is used to
   characterize the contact area as a function of time. For an axisymmetric
   contact area, a two-dimensional self-similar solution for the thermal
   field during the initial period of contact is obtained, and it serves as
   an initial condition for the heat transfer simulation throughout the
   entire duration of collision. A two-dimensional asymptotic heat transfer
   result is obtained for small Fourier number. For finite Fourier numbers,
   local analytical solutions are presented to elucidate the nature of the
   singularity of the thermal field and heat flux near the contact point.
   From the computationally determined heat transfer during the collision,
   a closed-form formula is developed to predict the heat transfer as a
   function of the Fourier number, the thermal diffusivity ratio, and the
   thermal conductivity ratio of the impacting particles. {[}DOI:

   KLFE enjoys nice properties such as low computational complexity, and
   high probability of identifying relevant features; this is because KLFE
   is a nonlinear wrapper feature extraction method and consists of solving
   a simple convex optimization problem. The experimental results have

Abstract = {{The work hardening response during shakedown phase for case hardened
   M50-NiL bearing steel in rolling contact fatigue (RCF) is presented.
   Rolling contact fatigue testing is performed using a ball rod tester for
   varying cycles and Hertzian stress of 5.5 GPa on multiple test tracks of
   a case hardened rod. Longitudinal sectioning and polishing of the test
   rod reveal the RCF affected zones. Micro-Vickers indentation mapping of
   the subsurface zones is used to measure workhardening. A maximum
   increase in hardness from 7.4 to 8.3 GPa was observed at similar to 13.5
   x 10(6) cycles, after which hardness saturated. A finite element
   simulation of the RCF test was performed to predict the increase in
   hardness. It is hypothesised that plastic strain accumulation around the
   hard carbide inclusions results in increased hardness. Cyclic hardening
   likely saturates when the ratchet strain per cycle approaches zero.
   Plastic shakedown follows with no further accumulation of plastic strain
   and marks the beginning of steady state response.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene consists of a monolayer of sp(2) bonded carbon atoms and has
   attracted considerable interest over recent years due to its extreme
   mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Graphene nanocomposites
   have naturally begun to be studied to capitalize upon these properties.
   A range of complex chemical and physical processing methods have been
   devised that achieve isolated graphene sheets that attempt to prevent
   aggregation. Here we demonstrate that the simple casting of a polymer
   solution containing dispersed graphene oxide, followed by thermal
   reduction, can produce well-isolated monolayer reduced-graphene oxide.
   The presence of single layer reduced-graphene oxide is quantitatively
   demonstrated through transmission electron microscopy and selected area
   electron diffraction studies and the reduction is verified by
   thermogravimetric, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectrum,
   and electrical conductivity studies. These findings provide a simple,
   environmentally benign and commercially viable process to produce
   reduced-graphene oxide reinforced polymers without complex
   manufacturing, dispersion or reduction processes.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-45}},

Abstract = {{Submarine turbidity currents are controlled by gravity acting on
   suspended sediments that pull water downslope along with them(1). In
   addition to suspended sediments, turbidity currents also transport
   sediments at the base of the flow(2), which causes the reorganization of
   basal sediments prior to the settling of suspended grains(3-6). However,
   as turbidity currents reach areas with minimal slope, they cross a
   fall-velocity threshold beyond which the suspended sediments begin to
   stratify the flow. This process extinguishes the turbulence near the
   bed(7,8). Here we use direct numerical simulation of turbidity currents
   to show that this extinction of turbulence eliminates the ability of the
   flow to re-entrain sediment and rework the sediment at the base of the
   flow. Our simulations indicate that deposits from flows without basal
   reworking should lack internal structures such as laminations. Under
   appropriate conditions, then, sustained delivery of fine sediments will
   therefore result in the emplacement of massive turbidites. We suggest
   that this mechanism can explain field observations of massive
   deposits(9) that were emplaced gradually by dilute but powerful
   turbidity currents. We also conclude that turbulence in submarine
   turbidity currents is more fragile than river systems, and more
   sensitive to damping by the stratification of suspended sediment in the
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of current velocity profiles during and after cresting of
   the Suwannee River in Northern Florida, USA, were used to investigate
   the effects of increased river discharge on subtidal flows near the
   estuarine transition with the Gulf of Mexico. Three moored velocity
   profilers were deployed across a lower estuary cross-section. The
   cross-section bathymetry consisted of a channel (similar to 5.5 m deep)
   near the western bank of the estuary that shoaled monotonically
   eastward. Two-layer gravitational exchange developed only in the deepest
   part of the cross-section during the river cresting and persisted for
   similar to 20 days. After this similar to 20-day period, the net flow
   decreased and was seaward throughout the water column. Net flows outside
   the channel were seaward throughout the observation period and were
   modulated by the river pulse. By comparing the estuarine response in the
   5.5-m channel to theoretical responses driven by a dynamic balance
   between pressure gradient and stress divergence, a condition required
   for two-layered flow was proposed. Gravitational exchange flow should be
   expected when the ratio of density-driven flow to river-induced flow is
   greater than 0.23 to 0.28. Smaller values of this ratio should produce
   unidirectional, seaward flows after a river pulse. Two-layered flows
   restricted to the channel can be explained also with this ratio because
   of the sensitivity of density-driven flows to local depth and eddy
   viscosity. These findings need to be tested against observations in
   other systems affected by extreme freshwater pulses.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that a crystalline pentacene molecular templating layer
   considerably changes the morphology of the subsequently deposited lead

   triclinic phase. For bilayer PbPc (20 nm)/C-60 (40 nm) organic solar
   cells with or without the pentacene templating layer, the use of the
   pentacene templating layer leads to a 48\% enhancement in the
   short-circuit current without noticeably affecting the solar cell
   open-circuit voltage or fill factor. A copper or zinc phthalocyanine
   molecular templating layer also leads to enhanced photovoltaic response
   from the PbPc/C-60 cells, though less significant than the pentacene
   template. The improved device performance originates from stronger
   absorption by the triclinic PbPc phase in the near infrared and the
   enhanced internal quantum efficiency over the entire spectrum where PbPc

Abstract = {{In structural health monitoring, crack identification using scattered
   ultrasonic waves from a crack is one of the most active research areas.
   Crack size estimation is important for judging the severity of the
   damage. If measurements are frequently performed as the crack grows,
   then a better estimation of crack size may be possible by analyzing
   sensor signals for the same crack location with different sizes. The
   objective of this article is to explore the relationship between the
   sensor signal amplitude and crack size through experiments and
   simulation for estimating the size. Cracks are machined into an aluminum
   plate and measurements are carried out with ultrasound excitation using
   piezoelectric transducer arrays that alternate their role as actuators
   or sensors. Initially, a hole of 2.5 mm diameter is drilled in the
   plate, and it is gradually machined to a crack with a size up to 50 mm.
   Signal amplitude is measured from the sensor arrays. The migration
   technique is used to image the crack and to find the crack location. The
   maximum received signal amplitude is found to vary linearly with size
   from simulation and this agrees with measurements with crack size up to
   30 mm. The deviation between the simulation and experiment increases as
   the crack grows.}},

Title = {{Mean and fluctuating components of drag and lift forces on an isolated

Journal = {{THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1-4}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We perform fully resolved direct numerical simulations of an isolated
   particle subjected to free-stream turbulence in order to investigate the
   effect of turbulence on the drag and lift forces at the level of a
   single particle, following Bagchi and Balachandar's work (Bagchi and
   Balachandar in Phys Fluids 15:3496-3513, 2003). The particle Reynolds
   numbers based on the mean relative particle velocity and the particle
   diameter are Re = 100, 250 and 350, which covers three different regimes
   of wake evolution in a uniform flow: steady axisymmetric wake, steady
   planar symmetric wake, and unsteady planar symmetric vortex shedding. At
   each particle Reynolds number, the turbulent intensity is 5-10\% of the
   mean relative particle velocity, and the corresponding diameter of the
   particle is comparable to or larger than the Kolmogorov scale. The
   simulation results show that standard drag values determined from
   uniform flow simulations can accurately predict the drag force if the
   turbulence intensity is sufficiently weak (5\% or less compared to the
   mean relative velocity). However, it is shown that for finite-sized
   particles, flow non-uniformity, which is usually neglected in the case
   of the small particles, can play an important role in determining the
   forces as the relative turbulence intensity becomes large. The influence
   of flow non-uniformity on drag force could be qualitatively similar to
   the Faxen correction. In addition, finite-sized particles at sufficient
   Reynolds number are inherently subjected to stochastic forces arising
   from their self-induced vortex shedding in addition to lift force
   arising from the local ambient flow properties (vorticity and strain
   rate). The effect of rotational and strain rate of the ambient
   turbulence seen by the particle on the lift force is explored based on
   the conditional averaging using the generalized representation of the
   quasi-steady force proposed by Bagchi and Balachandar (J Fluid Mech
   481:105-148, 2003). From the present study, it is shown that at Re =
   100, the lift force is mainly influenced by the surrounding turbulence,
   but at Re = 250 and 350, the lift force is affected by the wake
   structure as well as the surrounding turbulence. Thus, for a
   finite-sized particle of sufficient Reynolds number supporting
   self-induced vortex shedding, the lift force will not be completely
   correlated with the ambient flow. Therefore, it appears that in order to
   reliably predict the motion of a finite-sized particle in turbulence, it
   is important to incorporate both a deterministic component and a
   stochastic component in the force model. The best deterministic
   contribution is given by the conditional average. The influence of
   ambient turbulence at the scale of the particle, which are not accounted
   for in the deterministic contribution, can be considered in stochastic
   manner. In the modeling of lift force, additional stochastic
   contribution arising from self-induced vortex shedding must also be
   included.}},

Abstract = {{Deterministic algorithms such as A{*} and D{*} have been applied with
   great success to autonomous robotic path planning. However, as search
   space size increases numerous problem domains will likely become
   intractable when reactive behavior is desired. This is extremely
   relevant when considering the exponential increase in search space sizes
   due to any linear addition of degrees of freedom. Over the last few
   decades, Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have been shown to be particularly
   applicable to extremely large search spaces. However, it is often
   assumed that generational convergence is the only measure of quality for
   an EA. A novel combination of the Anytime Planning (AP) criteria with
   multi-resolution search spaces is explored for application to high-level
   semi-reactive path planning. Separate populations are evolved in
   parallel within different abstractions of the search space while low
   cost solutions from each population are exchanged among the populations.
   Generational evaluations in low-resolution search spaces can be
   evaluated quickly generating seed candidate solutions that are likely to
   speed convergence in the high-resolution search spaces. Convergence
   rates up to 4x were achieved along with modest decreases in path cost.
   Parallel GPU computation was then applied to allow reactive searching up
   to 40Hz in search grids up to 8192x8192 cells.}},

Abstract = {{A hyperspectral endmember detection and spectral unmixing algorithm that
   finds multiple sets of endmember distributions is presented. If
   endmembers are represented as random vectors, then they can be
   characterized by a multivariate probability distribution. These
   distributions are referred to as endmember distributions. The proposed
   method combines the Piece-wise Convex Multiple Model Endmember Detection
   (PCOMMEND) algorithm, the Sparsity Promoting Iterated Constrained
   Endmembers (SPICE) algorithm, and the Competitive Agglomeration (CA)
   algorithm to estimate endmember distributions. The goal is to produce
   distributions that are suitable for inclusion into the Normal
   Compositional Model (NCM). PCOMMEND forms a fuzzy partition of the
   spectral pixels into a collection of fuzzy convex sets. Each convex set
   is defined by a set of endmembers and the linear mixing model. In this
   way, non-convex hyperspectral data are more, accurately characterized.
   The SPICE algorithm estimates the number of endmembers, the endmembers,
   and the abundances for each convex set. This process is repeated several
   times; each time a set of endmembers is produced. The collection of all
   such sets is merged into a single set of endmembers. This set is
   clustered using the CA algorithm, which estimates the number of
   endmembers by estimating the number of clusters and prototypes for each
   cluster in the single set of endmembers. These prototypes are taken to
   be the means of endmember distributions. The covariances are estimated
   by assigning each endmember to the closest prototype and estimating the
   covariance of that set. The resulting distributions are suitable for the
   NCM model. Results are shown for the PAVIA data set.}},

Abstract = {{Linear networks consisting of finite-buffer nodes in tandem are
   considered. In particular, throughput properties of such networks are
   investigated, as their size increases. Using an approximation, we
   establish an asymptotic critical loading regime in which the ratio of
   the throughput to the input arrival rate is strictly within (0, 1). Such
   a regime is desirable from the point of view of both the throughput and
   network cost. Our results indicate that the qualitative behavior of the
   achievable throughput under the critical regime depends on whether the
   buffer size is greater than 1.}},

Abstract = {{The statement ``energy is not storable{''} is heard in energy conference
   lectures around the world, even though each person in the audience is
   sitting in a vast energy storage device. The heat storage in buildings
   is an enormous untapped resource for providing regulation services. This
   will be especially important as the grid is subject to more and more
   volatility from the introduction of power from renewable energy sources.
   This paper describes how regulation services can be obtained by
   exploiting the inherent flexibility of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air
   Conditioning) systems in commercial buildings. A particular simulation
   test case is considered - A large commercial building at the University
   of Florida. The conclusions of this research demonstrate that, 1) A
   simplified model of the building that is adequate for control can be
   obtained from input-output measurements. In this study, the only control
   input considered is the supply fan power. 2) Control synthesis to
   regulate the building air temperature while simultaneously providing
   regulation to the grid can be cast as an LQR problem that admits a
   simple closed form solution. 3) Numerical experiments show that for this
   HVAC system, 15\% of fan power capacity can be provided for regulation,
   while maintaining indoor temperature deviation to no more than +/- 0.2.
   degrees C.
   Based on these results, we conclude that the HVAC systems in 90, 000
   medium-sized commercial buildings can provide the entire regulation
   service needed by PJM today, without any noticeable change in indoor air
   quality. The total regulation services that can be potentially provided
   by all the commercial buildings in the U. S. that have the necessary
   equipment in place are much higher. Our results indicate that supply
   fans in existing commercial buildings can provide about 70\% of the
   current regulation capacity needed in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{Research on engineering undergraduate retention shows that a few
   programmatic solutions, such as the summer bridge programs that focus
   primarily on underrepresented populations, can significantly improve
   college retention rates. Although summer bridge programs are a common
   solution to engineering colleges' retention and diversity issues, more
   initiatives that enroll students of all demographics are needed to
   combat high engineering student attrition rates. Therefore, the
   development and institutionalization of retention solutions that can
   offer a larger population of undergraduate students a more effective
   solution is the next evolution in contributing to increased engineering
   retention.
   The dual model summer bridge program includes a traditional summer
   bridge program designed for underrepresented populations and a summer
   bridge program open to all students. The programs run simultaneously
   during the summer semester and are both comprised of the same
   components; however, some differences do exist due to funding issues.
   The six-week programs are comprised of supplemental instruction in
   chemistry and calculus, courses on the fundamentals of engineering
   design, AutoCAD, and Labview and a course designed to foster student
   success. Additionally, both programs involve assigned peer mentors to
   assist transitioning incoming students into the engineering student role
   throughout the students' first year. Other support provided includes
   corporate presentations, a final design competition, and a poster
   presentation.
   This paper will discuss the dual model summer bridge program that is
   currently offered to all entering engineering students at the University
   of Florida, a large public land grant institution located in the
   southeast. Additionally, quantitative results of the programs, including
   improved retention, which is the primary objective of the dual model
   programs, will be presented. Further, the less tangible benefits of the
   programs, such as involvement, independence, leadership and community,
   will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Social and linguistic representational systems, also known as
   Discourses, shape how individuals perceive their social worlds,
   including their own identities. Within an engineering context,
   Discourses shape how students perceive their roles as engineers and
   provide a window into which social forces shape students' emerging
   professional lives. In this paper. we investigate Discourses present in
   engineering education by examining how students approach problem
   solving.
   We focus on data from interviews with eight senior materials science and
   engineering students at a large southeastern university. Participants
   solved four engineering problems in a think aloud session and then were
   interviewed afterward about their problem solving approaches. A
   modification of Gee's Discourse analysis method was used to analyze the
   interview data. First, we analyzed students' motifs and identified their
   top three I-statements. Next, we developed each participant's identities
   and associated characteristics based on the dominant motifs and
   I-statements found in the interviews. Finally, Discourses that
   influenced the identities that emerged from each participant's interview
   were identified in order to draw connections to wider influences in the
   social and political landscape.
   From this analysis process, six Discourses were identified: pedagogical,
   economic, individualistic, peer collaboration, math, and research.
   Pedagogical Discourses were the most frequent in students' interviews
   (excluding discourses directly related to solving the problems). Many of
   the Discourses highlighted the practices, expectations, and language
   uses associated with being a student. We interpreted these findings to
   indicate that these students perceived themselves mainly as students
   (i.e., navigating the realm of their academic majors with professors and
   classmates), rather than as emerging engineers (whose practices are
   affected by conditions of industry). Our results suggest that problem
   solving in an academic setting does not encourage students to consider
   alternative Discourses related to industry and may fail to promote
   connections to social worlds beyond the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{The civil engineering curriculum at Tongji University and University of
   Florida should help students to be qualified civil engineers. And they
   should meet today's civil engineering requirements.
   Universities spare no effort to plan and design their courses and
   curriculums and have the same final objectives to cultivate their
   students to be talented, skillful civil engineers. This paper will
   describe admission, civil engineering curriculum, tests and grading
   methods at two universities. The objective is to study and analyze these
   two programs and find out the differences in order to understand today's
   civil engineering requirements.
   Tongji University is now a comprehensive university with seven
   disciplines in engineering, science, medicine, management, arts, law and
   economics with strength in the area of architecture, civil engineering
   and oceanography. Tongji University has 22 national key laboratories and
   engineering research centers and over 50,000 students. The university
   offers diverse courses in its 82 Bachelor's Degrees, 218 Masters, 94 PhD
   programs and 16 post doctoral mobile stations.
   Bachelor of civil engineering degree at the Tongji University includes
   diverse subjects such as Pavement Engineering, Underground Building
   Engineering, Construction Disaster Reduction \& Risk Evaluation
   Engineering, Traffic Engineering, Building Construction, Construction
   Equipment Engineering, Bridge Engineering and Geotechnical Engineering.
   The University of Florida is a major, public, and land-grant research
   university that has 16 colleges and more than 100 research, service and
   education centers.
   The civil engineering program at the University of Florida is a four
   year program including three semesters a year. Students are required to
   acquire 63 credits of lower division and engineering fundamentals within
   the first two years, 53 credits of required civil engineering course
   work and 15 credits of advanced electives including 3 credits of design
   course and 3 credits of capstone design course within last two years for
   a total of 131 credits.
   Curriculum structure, number of courses, tests requirement and grading
   methods and graduation requirements are some of the differences exist
   between the two programs at both universities.
   However, both of the programs aim at cultivating their students to be
   qualified and skillful engineers in civil engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Capstone design courses are common across engineering programs
   nationwide. Yet, many departments and programs rely on one faculty
   member or a small handful of faculty members to teach their capstone
   design course. As a result these faculty members find themselves
   isolated, with limited mechanisms for sharing ideas and networking with
   peers who have similar responsibilities and concerns. This paper reports
   on the ongoing efforts to support the broader capstone design community
   through the development of the Capstone Design Hub (CDHub) as a web
   resource for capstone design programs. The features and structure of the
   CDHub are being developed through capstone faculty input, including
   results from a survey of the capstone community. To build awareness of
   the CDHub as well as to solicit additional feedback from the community,
   this paper describes development of the hub to meet community needs,
   initial population of the hub with resources focused on communication,
   and plans for continued expansion of the hub.}},

Abstract = {{Civil engineering is a discipline that amalgamates art and science to
   create and refine infrastructure work, provides solutions according to
   the needs of modern civilization, and protects the environment. The
   dynamics of the current global marketplace suggests that civil engineers
   are among the best-positioned professionals to be able to utilize the
   cutting edge technology. Civil engineers find numerous opportunities in
   industry, be it through consulting practices, research or development.
   However, for civil engineering to maintain its importance in a global
   business setting, it is imperative that institutions' curricula be
   regularly revised to meet the world's perpetual evolving social and
   environmental needs.
   Both the civil engineering programs leading to a bachelor's of science
   degree are four-year programs. The College of Engineering at the
   University of Florida has 11 academic departments, while the College of
   Engineering at the Anna University has 31. Civil engineering is one of
   the departments in the College of Engineering at both universities.
   However, the required credits required between the programs are quite
   varied. The curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science in Civil
   Engineering degree at the University of Florida consists of 131 credits,
   while that of the Anna University consists of a minimum of 191 credits.
   The University of Florida allows for 52 general education credits while
   the Anna University provides for 54. In terms of core engineering
   credits, the University of Florida requires 79 engineering-based
   credits, while Anna University requires 137.
   This paper compares and analyzes the current civil engineering
   undergraduate curriculum at the Anna University with that of the
   University of Florida's. The results of this study indicate that both
   curricula meet the educational requirements of both the United States
   and that of the Republic of India.}},

   that is a primary goal of higher education. However, there is
   surprisingly little in the literature regarding critical thinking in

   study found that graduate engineering students performed worse than
   undergraduate students on a standard critical thinking instrument. This
   difference is explained through the two groups' familiarity with
   test-taking. In a qualitative study, engineering undergraduates were
   interviewed about how they use critical thinking. It was found that
   their descriptions were more complex than typical definitions in the
   literature. Overall, the results point to a need to further investigate
   what critical thinking means for engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Animals have shown the ability to climb vertical surfaces with high
   speed and stability. Utilizing the underlying dynamics of these animals,
   robotic platforms have been developed that climb vertical surfaces with
   similar speed. It is hypothesized that the pre-incidence angle of the
   legs, commonly referred to as sprawl angle, for these robotic platforms
   can significantly affect vertical velocities, efficiency, and stability
   as well as passively controlling body oscillations. To date, little
   empirical work has been conducted on the effect of sprawl angle and wall
   inclination on the performance of dynamic climbing platforms. This paper
   presents initial research utilizing a biologically inspired dynamical
   climbing platform to understand the effect of sprawl angle and wall
   inclination on dynamic climbing. Simulations have shown that a sprawl
   angle of 30 degrees maximizes vertical velocity overall, while
   experimental results show that a sprawl angle of approximately 10
   degrees maximizes vertical velocity, while in both increasing sprawl
   angle increases lateral velocities over all wall inclinations.}},

Abstract = {{Top-down cracking is a distress mode that is of particular concern for
   pavement with Open-Graded Friction Course (OGFC) because open-graded
   mixture has considerably lower resistance to fracture (lower fracture
   energy limit and lower resistance to damage) than dense-graded mixture.
   This particular cracking phenomenon initiates on the pavement surface
   and propagates downward; so because the OGFC layer is thin, cracking
   performance relies on the properties and characteristics of three
   components near the pavement surface: OGFC, underlying structural layer,
   and the interface between. For this reason, to increase the durability
   of pavements surfaced with OGFC, it is important to ensure a quality
   fracture resistant bond between the OGFC and the structural layer. This
   research investigated top-down cracking performance of OGFC with
   different tack coats using a newly developed composite specimen
   interface cracking (CSIC) test. In addition, X-ray computed tomography
   (CT) was employed to analyze the interface characteristics between OGFC
   and dense-graded HMA. HMA fracture mechanics was employed to quantify
   the effect of polymer modified asphalt emulsion (PMAE) on pavement
   top-down cracking resistance enhancement. Results clearly indicated that
   PMAE-created bonded interface conditions greatly increased pavement
   top-down cracking resistance as compared with conventional tack coat.}},

Abstract = {{This study was mainly focused on identifying appropriate relationships
   between asphalt mixture component characteristics and asphalt mixture
   properties known to control cracking performance. The current lack of
   material property models that can accurately describe the changes in
   material properties over time in the field is probably the greatest
   deficiency in our ability to accurately predict pavement performance.
   Therefore, there is a need to evaluate existing material property models
   and develop improved models for use in the prediction of pavement
   performance. Relationships able to predict initial fracture energy and
   creep rate, which are the properties known to govern the change in
   material property over time and are also required for performance model
   predictions, were developed in this study. In addition, conceptual
   relationships were identified to describe changes in these properties
   over time (aging) by including the effect of the non-healable permanent
   damage related to load and moisture. This can serve as the foundation
   for further development of improved models to predict mixture properties
   as a function of age in the field based on additional field data and
   laboratory studies using more advanced laboratory conditioning
   procedures. The verified relationships will also serve to provide
   reliable inputs for prediction of service life using pavement
   performance prediction models.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in Raman spectroscopy have generated a surge of interest
   in biomedical applications particularly in the field of oncology. As
   cancer is predicted to become the number one cause of death by the end
   of the decade, Raman spectroscopy has the potential to significantly aid
   in the research, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Biomedical
   applications of Raman spectroscopy currently under investigation range
   from the research laboratory bench-top to the clinical setting at the
   patients bedside. Raman spectroscopic analysis of biological specimens
   is advantageous as it provides a spectral fingerprint, rich in molecular
   compositional information without disrupting the biological environment
   allowing in-situ biochemical observations to be made. The information
   dense spectra generate vast sets of complex data in which subtle
   variations may provide critical clues in data interpretation. Thus the
   investigation and implementation of advanced data mining and
   optimization techniques is imperative for complete, rapid and accurate
   data extraction. Clinical applications of Raman spectroscopy are on the
   horizon as optical technology progresses, but to fulfill this
   realization of a new class of biomedical instrumentation, the
   development of an optimized, fully integrated data processing
   methodology will be required. In this paper, we describe several methods
   for pre-processing raw Raman Spectra, followed by data mining techniques
   used for classifying spectra of cancerous cells based on cell type,
   environments and mechanisms of cell death.}},

Abstract = {{Although neuropsychiatric (NP) disorders are among the top causes of
   disability worldwide with enormous financial costs, they can still be
   viewed as part of the most complex disorders that are of unknown
   etiology and incomprehensible pathophysiology. The complexity of NP
   disorders arises from their etiologic heterogeneity and the concurrent
   influence of environmental and genetic factors. In addition, the absence
   of rigid boundaries between the normal and diseased state, the
   remarkable overlap of symptoms among conditions, the high
   inter-individual and inter-population variations, and the absence of
   discriminative molecular and/or imaging biomarkers for these diseases
   makes difficult an accurate diagnosis. Along with the complexity of NP
   disorders, the practice of psychiatry suffers from a ``top-down{''}
   method that relied on symptom checklists. Although checklist diagnoses
   cost less in terms of time and money, they are less accurate than a
   comprehensive assessment. Thus, reliable and objective diagnostic tools
   such as biomarkers are needed that can detect and discriminate among NP
   disorders. The real promise in understanding the pathophysiology of NP
   disorders lies in bringing back psychiatry to its biological basis in a
   systemic approach which is needed given the NP disorders' complexity to
   understand their normal functioning and response to perturbation. This
   approach is implemented in the systems biology discipline that enables
   the discovery of disease-specific NP biomarkers for diagnosis and
   therapeutics. Systems biology involves the use of sophisticated computer
   software ``omics{''}-based discovery tools and advanced performance
   computational techniques in order to understand the behavior of
   biological systems and identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
   specific for NP disorders together with new targets of therapeutics. In
   this review, we try to shed light on the need of systems biology,
   bioinformatics, and biomarkers in neuropsychiatry, and illustrate how
   the knowledge gained through these methodologies can be translated into
   clinical use providing clinicians with improved ability to diagnose,
   manage, and treat NP patients.}},

Abstract = {{Coherence of neural activity between circumscribed brain regions has
   been implicated as an indicator of intracerebral communication in
   various cognitive processes. While neural activity can be volitionally
   controlled with neurofeedback, the volitional control of coherence has
   not yet been explored. Learned volitional control of coherence could
   elucidate mechanisms of associations between cortical areas and its
   cognitive correlates and may have clinical implications. Neural
   coherence may also provide a signal for brain-computer interfaces (BCI).
   In the present study we used the Weighted Overlapping Segment Averaging
   method to assess coherence between bilateral magnetoencephalograph
   sensors during voluntary digit movement as a basis for BCI control.
   Participants controlled an onscreen cursor, with a success rate of 124
   of 180 (68.9\%, sign-test p < 0.001) and 84 out of 100 (84\%, sign-test
   p < 0.001). The present findings suggest that neural coherence may be
   volitionally controlled and may have specific behavioral correlates.}},

Abstract = {{Critical thinking is generally recognized as an important skill, and one
   that is a primary goal of higher education. However, there is
   surprisingly little in the literature regarding critical thinking in
   engineering. This paper describes two pilot studies. A mixed methods
   study found that graduate engineering students performed worse than
   undergraduate students on a standard critical thinking instrument. This
   difference is explained through the two groups' familiarity with
   test-taking. In a qualitative study, engineering undergraduates were
   interviewed about how they use critical thinking. It was found that
   their descriptions were more complex than typical definitions in the
   literature. Overall, the results point to a need to further investigate
   what critical thinking means for engineering. (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the energy
   discontinuity in the valence band (Delta E-V) and conduction band (Delta
   E-C) of various dielectric/IGZO heterostructures. Delta E-V values of
   0.48 +/- 0.025 eV for HfO2/IGZO, 0.44 +/- 0.21 eV for Y2O3/IGZO, 0.81
   +/- 0.17 eV for MgO/IGZO, 0.95 +/- 0.17 eV for the Al2O3/IGZO, and 1.43
   +/- 0.15 eV for the SiO2/IGZO heterojunctions were obtained,
   respectively. The bandgap differences between these dielectrics and IGZO
   would lead to corresponding conduction band offset (Delta E-C) values of
   2.39-4.74 eV. These results are important for designing structures with
   good carrier confinement in transparent thin film transistors based on

   properties of the film. Maximum out-of-plane intrinsic coercivity (H-ci)
   of 330 kA/m and squareness (M-r/M-s) of 0.9 were obtained for films 15 -

Abstract = {{People-centric sensing is a novel apporach that exploits the sensing
   capabilities offered by smartphones and the mobility of users to sense
   large scale areas without requiring the deployment of sensors in-situ.
   Given the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, people-centric sensing is a
   viable and efficient solution for crowdsourcing data. In this work, we
   propose a fully distributed, opportunistic sensing framework that
   involves two main components which both work in an ad hoc fashion:
   Recruitment and Data Collection. We analyzed the feasibility of our
   distributed approach for both components through preliminary
   simulations. The results show that our recruitment method is able to
   select 66\% of the nodes that are appropriate for the sensing activity
   and 88\% of the messages sent by these selected nodes reach the sink by
   using our data collection method.}},

   semiconductor layers and a built-in metal grating layer. The interface
   between the metal layer and its neighboring semiconductor layer has
   sinusoidal corrugation geometry. To compute the coupling coefficient of

Abstract = {{Alq(3) is widely used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) as
   emission and electron transport layer. Commercial Alq(3) is normally
   used in the fabrication of OLEDs. In this study nano sized Alq(3) was
   synthesized using a co-precipitation method and it was purified using
   temperature gradient sublimation. The Alq(3) was then used to fabricate
   a simple two layer OLED with a device structure:
   ITO/NPB/Alq(3)/Cs2CO3:Al. The electroluminescence (EL) spectrum of the
   device consisted of a broadband with a maximum at similar to 520 nm and
   was similar to the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum observed from the
   synthesized Alq(3) powder. The luminance (L)-current density (J)-voltage
   (V) characteristics of the device showed a turn on voltage of similar to
   2V, which was lower than the current density of the device fabricated
   using the commercial Alq(3). The external quantum efficiency (eta(EQE))
   and the luminous power conversion efficiency (eta(P)) of the device were
   1\% and 2 lm/W, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of online social networks (OSNs) has brought a
   revolutionary change in the way geographically dispersed people interact
   and cooperate with each other towards achieving some common goals.
   Recently, some new ways of adhoc cooperation have been demonstrated
   during the hurricane Irene and the earthquake in Japan. In such
   emergency situations, OSNs have already taken a significant role as
   alternative social media that support altruistic information sharing and
   cooperation among people. However, existing cooperation approaches have
   not been well-organized and are highly vulnerable to security threats
   such as a disclosure of users' identities and the leakage of other
   private data due to the lack of secure cooperation mechanisms. To
   support secure and effective cooperation in OSNs, in this paper, we
   propose the Social CRiBAC (Community-centric Role interaction Based
   Access Control) model, which extends the existing CRiBAC model {[}1] for
   use in OSNs to support cooperation among users. To verify the
   feasibility of the proposed model, we have implemented a prototype

Abstract = {{The urban environs are a complex constructed interface that
   significantly alters rainfall-runoff relationships, and through the
   generation of anthropogenic and biogenic constituents results in
   significant transport of chemical, thermal, microbiological and.
   particulate matter (PM) loads. These loads are largely coupled with the
   altered rainfall-runoff relationship. In North American cities with
   municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) the load of volumetric
   runoff, chemicals and PM are equal to or greater than the untreated
   influent loads to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) yet the
   management of urban runoff loads is at least a half century behind
   municipal wastewater management yet is greater in scale and cost. Urban
   runoff management is very challenging; in part due to PM
   hetero-dispersivity, interactions between aqueous and PM phases,
   stochastic hydrology and highly unsteady hydrodynamics. Such challenges
   and associated costs with resolving such challenges have led to the
   relatively common historical. examination of a spectrum of urban
   constituent control systems as black-box systems and rainfall-runoff
   chemistry utilizing lumped measurements; and many indices and
   measurement methods adopted from wastewater treatment.
   Experience over the last several decades has demonstrated that there
   continues to be a gap in knowledge transfer between the design, analysis
   and monitoring of what are nominally called ``Best Management
   Practices{''} (BMPs), fundamental unit operations and processes (UOP)
   concepts, sustainability requirements for BMPs, as well as new
   developments in the behavior of green urban infrastructure. Despite such
   disparity, tools such as UOP concepts, monitoring tools such as laser
   diffraction, and continuous simulation modeling are removing stormwater
   controls from the category of ``black-boxes{''}. With such tools we can
   now demonstrate treatment viability as a function of the hydrologic,
   physical, chemical, biological and thermal phenomena for rainfall-runoff
   or snowmelt. Stormwater systems that do not provide some level of
   hydrologic restoration, for example through ``green{''} infrastructure
   materials; are not sustainable. Additionally given the particulate
   matter, gross solids and pollutant load inventories that build up in
   urban areas, source control practices and load credits must be an
   integral part of any management plan that includes restoration,
   treatment, control and reuse. Stormwater treatment, urban maintenance
   and green infrastructure will play an increasingly critical role in the
   entire urban water cycle and therefore we must develop maintenance
   practices such as pavement cleaning, source control and near-Source
   control. Further advances with respect to sustainability of urban water
   require tools such as continuous simulation models, smart sensors and
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a focus on fundamental UOP
   concepts. This,paper examines the role of our constructed environs and
   activities therein on-the urban water cycle and coupled delivery of
   constituent loads that impact the environment and ecology including
   human ecology.
   This paper examines these constituent loads fundamentally and recommends
   management tools such as continuous simulation of hydrologic restoration
   to restore sustainability of the urban water cycle. Results illustrate
   the current practice of MS4s with thousands of BMPs is not sustainable.
   The future will require these advanced management tools, centralized
   treatment and frequent maintenance practices. Sustainability will
   ultimately require source control of loads, green infrastructure and
   hydrologic restoration. An emerging challenge in North America is the
   use of reclaimed wastewater back onto the urban interface with
   commensurate volumetric benefits yet chemical legacy concerns. State of
   the art tools, specifically computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are
   introduced to illustrate the role of CFD in examining treatment of urban
   water.}},

Abstract = {{Data about moving objects is being collected in many different
   application domains with the help of sensor networks, and GPS-enabled
   devices. In most cases, the moving objects are not free to move, they
   are usually restricted by some spatial constraints such as Spatial
   Networks. Spatial networks are ubiquitous and have been widely used in
   transportation, traffic planning, navigation as well as in Geographical
   Information System (GIS) applications. In most scenarios, moving objects
   such as vehicles move along predefined spatial networks like
   transportation networks. Unfortunately, the concepts for modeling and
   querying objects in unconstrained spaces like an outdoor space cannot be
   transferred to constrained spaces like a road network due to the
   different features of the environments in which the spatial objects
   move. Further, modern positioning devices as well as mobile and sensor
   technology have led to large volumes of moving objects in spatial
   networks. Therefore, we need a database-friendly data model to
   explicitly model spatial networks and, more importantly, describe
   relative movements in these networks. In this paper, we propose a new
   two-layered data model called MONET (Moving Objects in NETworks) model.
   The lower layer is a data model for spatial networks. This data model is
   the prerequisite for the upper model that represents moving objects in
   these networks. This layered model fits well to formulate relationships
   between moving objects and a network in queries. A query language,
   called MONET QL (MONET Query Language), allows a clear description of
   and access to moving objects in spatial networks and to provides
   high-level operations on them.}},

Abstract = {{In the rapidly evolving field of high-powered electronics, hardware
   continues to become smaller and more powerful. The consequence of this
   trend is tightly packed electronic components and high heat generation
   rates that demands more efficient thermal management techniques. In this
   paper, digitized heat transfer using electrowetting on a dielectric is
   examined as a potential solution. A numerical simulation of translating
   microdroplets in a parallel plate and axisymmetric pipe is studied. From
   previous studies, it is known that translating microdroplets have
   improved heat transfer over continuous flow that is highly dependent on
   the height to length ratio of the droplet. This paper finds that in
   addition to the height to length ratio, Reynolds numbers has a
   significant effect on droplet velocity profile as well as droplet
   temperature distribution. At high Reynolds numbers, the center line
   velocity increases beyond what is predicted in a Poiseuille flow, thus
   increasing circulation and the Nusselt number of the droplet.
   Additionally, it is found that the center line velocity enhancement is
   accompanied by the development of inflection points in the velocity
   profile, indicating more susceptibility to instability development and
   potential transition to turbulence. Nevertheless, the change in Reynolds
   number was found to not have a significant effect on the location of the
   Nusselt number peaks along the channel length which is correlated with
   the circulation length of the droplet.}},

Abstract = {{Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is an effective rehabilitation
   tool for gait retraining for individuals suffering from various
   neurological disorders. Traditionally, FES is only delivered to activate
   ankle dorsiflexor muscles during the swing phase of the gait to correct
   ``foot drop{''}. Recent research indicates that improved functional
   ambulation can be achieved by delivering FES to both the plantarflexor
   and dorsiflexor muscles during gait. Closed-loop electrical stimulation
   has the potential to yield positive rehabilitative outcomes by enabling
   accurate and precise limb motions during gait retraining. Naturally, the
   motion of ankle during gait is an event-driven system combining
   continuous evolution of the angle between the foot and shank, alternate
   moving segments of the foot and shank, and alternate activation of the
   plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles. A switched sliding mode based
   controller is developed to ensure that the ankle tracks a designed or
   recorded normal trajectory during gait which can be used for gait
   retraining. Semi-global asymptotic tracking of the hybrid controller is
   analyzed using multiple Lyapunov functions and the performance is
   illustrated through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a technique that is
   widely used as a tool for rehabilitation and restoration of basic
   functions for people suffering from upper motor neuron lesion (UMNL).
   Closed-loop methods have shown a potential for improving the
   effectiveness of NMES. In this paper, uncertainties in the muscle
   contraction dynamics are taken into consideration when compensating for
   the muscle contraction dynamics. Accounting for the muscle contraction
   dynamics is a challenge because of uncertainty, nonlinearity and the
   fact that the contraction states are not measurable. A neural-network
   (NN)-based controller together with a dynamic NN-based identifier is
   designed to enable semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded tracking of
   a desired limb trajectory and on-line estimation of the limb
   acceleration. The overall stability of the identifier-controller system
   is analyzed through Lyapunov methods. Simulation results are provided to
   illustrate the controller performance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on multifunctional materials has shown that a functionally
   graded interface between the fiber and matrix of a composite material
   can lead to improved strength and stiffness while simultaneously
   affording piezoelectric properties to the composite. However the
   modeling of this functional gradient is difficult through micromechanics
   models without discretizing the gradient into numerous layers of varying
   properties. In order to facilitate the design of these multi-phase
   piezoelectric composites, accurate models are required. In this work,
   multi-inclusion models are extended to predict the effective
   electroelastic properties of multiphase piezoelectric composites. The
   presented formulation will provide a general framework for modeling
   other coupled fields of heterogeneous materials. To evaluate the
   micromechanics modeling results, a three dimensional finite element
   model of a four-phase piezoelectric composite was created in the
   commercial finite element software ABAQUS with different volume
   fractions and aspect ratios. The simulations showed excellent agreement
   for predicting the electroelastic properties of the multiphase

Abstract = {{The healing process exhibited by biological structures has inspired the
   creation of engineered materials capable of mimicking this behavior,
   providing adaption to impeding crack propagation and subsequently
   healing it. Recently, a new approach to self-healing was devised in
   which a sensing network was combined with shape memory polymers (SMPs)
   to allow the controlled response of the material to damage. The system
   was designed such that in the presence of a crack the polymer locally
   modified its modulus to toughen the damaged region and arrest crack
   growth. This process is followed by the shape memory response, closing
   the crack and healing the system. This paper will study the mechanics of
   the toughening portion of this self-healing system and specifically
   develop models to predict the stress intensity factor of a crack tip in
   a nonhomogeneous inclusion. The models will be formulated using finite
   element analysis (FEA) and a single inclusion model based on Eshelby's
   equivalent theory with the elastic gradient defined by a point source
   thermal load. It will be shown that as the temperature of the crack tip
   passes the glass transition temperature of the polymer, the stress
   intensity factor at crack tip decreases to 95\% of the original material
   stress intensity factor. This is due to the formed elastic gradient and
   deflection of the stress concentration away from the crack tip into the
   bulk polymer.}},

Abstract = {{A new variable stiffness suspension system based on a recent variable
   stiffness mechanism is proposed. The overall system is composed of the
   traditional passive suspension system augmented with a variable
   stiffness mechanism. The main idea is to improve suspension performance
   by varying stiffness in response to road disturbance. The system is
   analyzed using a quarter car model. The passive case shows much better
   performance in ride comfort over the tradition counterpart. Analysis of
   the invariant equation shows that the car body acceleration transfer
   function magnitude can be reduced at both the tire-hop and rattle space
   frequencies using the lever displacement transfer function thereby
   resulting in a better performance over the traditional passive
   suspension system. An H-infinity controller is designed to correct for
   the performance degradation in the rattle space thereby providing the
   best trade-off between the ride comfort, suspension deflection and road
   holding.}},

Abstract = {{Extended finite element method (or XFEM) locally enriches the finite
   element solution using a priori known analytical solution. XFEM has been
   used extensively in fracture mechanics to compute stress concentration
   at crack tips. It is a mesh independent method that allows crack to be
   represented as an equation instead of using the mesh to approximate it.
   When this approach is used along with Implicit Boundary Finite Element
   Method (IBFEM) to apply boundary conditions, a fully mesh independent
   approach for studying crack tip stresses can be implemented. An
   efficient scheme for blending the enriched solution structure with the
   underlying finite element solution is presented. A ramped step function
   is introduced for modeling discontinuity or a crack within an element.
   Exact analytical solution is used as enrichment at the crack tip element
   to obtain the stress intensity factor (SIF) directly without any post
   processing or contour integral computation. Several examples are used to
   study the convergence and accuracy of the solution.}},

Abstract = {{An approach for stress based topology optimization is studied here where
   stress constraints for continuum structures are imposed using a
   conservative global stress measure. A relation between the mean
   compliance and Von-Mises stress is used to construct an objective
   function that minimizes mass until stress constraints are activated.
   This approach is implemented in a mesh independent finite element
   framework where the feasible region is defined using boundary equations
   while analysis and topology optimization are performed on a background
   mesh. The SIMP approach is used for topology optimization and nodal
   values of density are treated as the design variables. The density field
   is interpolated over the elements to obtain a continuous distribution.
   To ensure smooth boundaries a smoothing term is also added to the
   objective function which minimizes gradient of the density function. The
   optimization problem is then solved using Moving Barrier Method (MBM).
   Several examples are studied to evaluate this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Tensegrity systems have been used in several disciplines such as
   architecture, biology, aerospace, mechanics and robotics during the last
   fifty years. However, just a few references in literature have stated
   the possibility of using tensegrity systems in ocean or energy-related
   applications. This work addresses the kinematic and dynamic analyses of
   a planar tensegrity mechanism for ocean wave energy harvesting. A planar
   tensegrity mechanism is proposed based on a planar morphology known as
   ``X-frame{''} that was developed by Kenneth Snelson in 1960s. A
   geometric approach is used to solve the forward and reverse displacement
   problems. The theory of screws is used to perform the forward and
   reverse velocity analyses of the device. The Lagrangian approach is used

Abstract = {{This work shows the process of computing coupling coefficients of
   first-order distributed feedback (DFB) metal-semiconductor quantum-well
   lasers. For the gas sensing of carbon dioxide (CO2), the
   antimonite-based (Sb-based) DFB lasers at the wavelength of 2 mu m are
   discussed. The optical waveguide structure, for each laser, has a
   built-in grating interface between the metal and semiconductor layers.
   This work considers the interface with sinusoidal corrugation geometry
   for preliminary modeling and computation. To compute the coupling
   coefficient of the metal-grating waveguide, a photonic method,
   Floquet-Bloch method (FB), is used for the waveguide with such a
   corrugated semiconductor-metal interface. The optical method, the
   Ray-optics method (RO), is also used for computation. Both the photonic
   and the optical methods have close results.}},

Abstract = {{The residual implanted dose of ultra-shallow B+ implants in Ge was
   characterized using elastic recoil detection and was determined to
   correlate well with simulations with a dose loss of 23\% due to ion
   backscattering for 2 keV implants in Ge. The electrical characterization
   of ultra-shallow B+ implants at 2 keV to a dose of 5.0x10(14) cm(-2) at
   beam currents ranging from 0.4 to 6.4 mA has been studied using micro
   Hall effect measurements after annealing at 400 degrees C for 60 s. It
   has been shown that the sheet number increases with beam current across
   the investigated range with electrical activation being 76\% higher at
   6.4 mA as compared to 0.4mA. However, at 6.4 mA, the electrically active
   fraction remained low at 11.4\%. Structural characterization revealed
   that the implanted region remained crystalline and amorphization is not
   able to explain the increased activation. The results suggest the
   presence of a stable B: Ge cluster whose formation is altered by point
   defect recombination during high flux implantation which results in
   increased B activation.}},

   techniques as implemented in the Florida object oriented process
   simulator (FLOOPS) to propagate regrowth fronts with variable
   crystallographic orientation patterned material is presented. Apart from
   the inherent orientation dependence of the SPEG velocity, it is
   established that nitride induced stress can affect mask edge defect
   formation for patterned samples. Data acquired from TEM experiments
   matches well with simulations, thus providing a stable model for
   simulating 2D regrowth and mask edge defect formation in Ge.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing need for fault tolerance capabilities in logic
   devices brought about by the scaling of transistors to ever smaller
   geometries. This paper presents a hypervisor-based replication approach
   that can be applied to commodity hardware to allow for virtually
   lockstepped execution. It offers many of the benefits of hardware-based
   lockstep while being cheaper and easier to implement and more flexible
   in the configurations supported. A novel form of processor state
   fingerprinting is also presented, which can significantly reduce the
   fault detection latency. This further improves reliability by triggering
   rollback recovery before errors are recorded to a checkpoint. The
   mechanisms are validated using a full prototype and the benchmarks
   considered indicate an average performance overhead of approximately 14
   percent with the possibility for significant optimization. Finally, a
   unique method of using virtual lockstep for fault injection testing is
   presented and used to show that significant detection latency reduction
   is achievable by comparing only a small amount of data across replicas.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoplastics have been increasingly used for fabricating microfluidic
   devices because of their low cost, mechanical/biocompatible attributes,
   and well-established manufacturing processes. However, there is
   sometimes a need to integrate such a device with components made from
   other materials such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Bonding
   thermoplastics with PDMS to produce hybrid devices is not
   straightforward. We have reported our method to modify the surface
   property of a cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrate by using corona
   discharge and grafting polymerization of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl
   methacrylate; the modified surface enabled strong bonding of COC with
   PDMS. In this paper, we report our studies on the surface modification
   mechanism using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurement. Using this bonding
   method, we fabricated a three-layer (COC/PDMS/COC) hybrid device
   consisting of elastomer-based valve arrays. The microvalve operation was
   confirmed through the displacement of a dye solution in a fluidic
   channel when the elastomer membrane was pneumatically actuated.
   Valve-enabled microfluidic handling was demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Inspection of citrus canker is crucial due to its fast spread, high
   damage potential, and massive impact on export and domestic trade. This
   research was aimed to develop a prototype for real-time citrus canker
   detection. An inspection module was developed on a one-line commercial
   fruit sorting machine. Twenty tungsten halogen spotlights coupled with
   an aluminum dome painted with white diffuse paint provided reflectance
   illumination to the fruits in the detection chamber. The camera unit was
   a two-band spectral imaging system, which mainly consisted of a
   beamsplitter, two bandpass filters with central wavelengths at 730 and
   830 nm, and two identical monochrome cameras. Using an exposure time of
   10 ms, the imaging system can capture narrowband images without blurring
   from samples moving at a speed of 5 fruits/5. Spatial resolution of the
   acquired images was 2.3 pixels/mm. Real-time image processing and
   classification algorithms were developed based on a two-band ratio
   approach (i.e., R830/R730). The system was tested using 360 grapefruits
   with normal surface, canker lesions, and other peel diseases and
   defects. The overall classification accuracy was 95.3\%, demonstrating
   that the methodology as well as the hardware and the software are
   effective and suitable for real-time citrus canker detection. Greasy
   spot, melanose, and sooty mold could generate false positive errors for
   the fruits without canker. The current system setup was limited to a
   single perspective view of the fruits. Future work will be conducted
   with an emphasis on whole surface inspection of each fruit. (C) 2011
