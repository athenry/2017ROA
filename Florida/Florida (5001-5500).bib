Title = {{On the altitude of the ELF/VLF source region generated during
   ``beat-wave{''} HF heating experiments}},

Abstract = {{Modulated high frequency (HF, 3-10 MHz) heating of the ionosphere in the
   presence of the auroral electrojet currents is an effective method for
   generating extremely low frequency (ELF, 3-3000 Hz) and very low
   frequency (VLF, 3-30 kHz) radio waves. The amplitudes of ELF/VLF waves
   generated in this manner depend sensitively on the auroral electrojet
   current strength, which varies with time. In an effort to improve the
   reliability of ELF/VLF wave generation by ionospheric heating, recent
   experiments at the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program
   (HAARP) facility in Gakona, Alaska, have focused on methods that are
   independent of the strength of the auroral electrojet currents. One such
   potential method is so-called ``beat-wave{''} ELF/VLF generation. Recent
   experimental observations have been presented to suggest that in the
   absence of a significant D-region ionosphere (similar to 60-100 km
   altitude), an ELF/VLF source region can be created within the F-region
   ionosphere (similar to 150-250 km altitude). In this paper, we use a
   time-of-arrival analysis technique to provide direct experimental
   evidence that the beat-wave source region is located in the D-region
   ionosphere, and possibly the lower E-region ionosphere (similar to
   100-120 km altitude), even when ionospheric diagnostics indicate a very
   weak D-layer. These results have a tremendous impact on the
   interpretation of recent experimental observations. Citation: Moore, R.

Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{We report on the magnetic properties of MoS2 measured from room
   temperature down to 10K and magnetic fields up to 5T. We find that
   single crystals of MoS2 display ferromagnetism superimposed onto large
   temperature-dependent diamagnetism and have observed that ferromagnetism
   persists from 10K up to room temperature. We attribute the existence of
   ferromagnetism partly to the presence of zigzag edges in the magnetic
   ground state at the grain boundaries. Since the magnetic measurements
   are relatively insensitive to the interlayer coupling, these results are
   expected to be valid in the single layer limit. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{There are increasing concerns over the environmental impact and health
   risks of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) because they may be released into soil
   and groundwater systems. The present work systematically investigated
   the transport, deposition, and mobilization behaviors of multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in saturated columns packed with acid-cleaned
   glass beads and quartz sand of two different grain sizes. Combined
   effects of pH (5.6 and 10) and ionic strength (IS: DI water, 1 mM, and
   10 mM) on the fate and transport of the MWNTs in the columns were
   examined. MWNTs were relatively mobile in all the tested conditions with
   DI water as the experimental solution. Their deposition in the saturated
   porous media, however, was very sensitive to solution chemistry,
   particularly IS. Slight increase in solution IS (1 mM) caused strong
   deposition of MWNTs in both quartz sand (>44\%) and glass beads (>39\%).
   Mobilization experimental results indicated that most of the MWNT
   attachment (>73\%) to the porous media was irreversible and reduction in
   solution IS only caused a small portion of re-entrainment (<27\%) of
   deposited MWNT for all the tested conditions. This indicates that more
   MWNTs are trapped in the primary minimum, although the deposition of
   MWNTs in saturated porous media occurs in both primary and secondary
   minimum. It is suggested that, under unfavorable conditions, weak
   associated MWNTs in the secondary minimum may be transferred into the
   primary minimum due to the effect of hydrodynamic force and/or local
   favorable sites associated with surface heterogeneity. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Identifying the mechanisms that drive development of self-organized
   patterned landscapes is essential for guiding ecosystem management and
   restoration. In this work, we modeled flow through real and
   geostatistically simulated landscapes to test the hypothesis that
   feedbacks between patch anisotropy and hydroperiod may be sufficient to
   explain development of the flow-parallel ridge-slough mosaic of the
   Everglades (Florida, USA). Results show patch anisotropy to be a strong
   predictor of hydroperiod, with ecologically significant increases in
   flooding duration (> 40 days/year) in isotropic landscapes compared with
   areas of the Everglades with the best-conserved anisotropic patterning.
   Notably, hydroperiod differences among landscapes were largest in dry
   years, suggesting that low flow periods may be most influential in
   landscape pattern development, contrary to alternative models of pattern
   formation. This study demonstrates the potential for coupled feedbacks
   between landscape geometry and hydrology to drive anisotropic pattern
   formation via inundation frequency without requiring velocity-driven
   erosion and redistribution of particulates. Citation: Kaplan, D. A., R.

Abstract = {{This Letter describes the synthesis and photophysical characterization
   of a Ru(II) assembly consisting of metal polypyridyl complexes linked
   together by a polyfluorene scaffold. Unlike many scaffolds incorporating
   saturated linkages, the conjugated polymer in this system acts as a
   functional light-harvesting component. Conformational disorder breaks
   the conjugation in the polymer backbone, resulting in a chain composed
   of many chromophore units, whose relative energies depend on the segment
   lengths. Photoexcitation of the polyfluorene by a femtosecond laser
   pulse results in the excitation of polyfluorene, which then undergoes
   direct energy transfer to the pendant Ru(II) complexes, producing
   Ru(II){*} excited states within 500 fs after photoexcitation.
   Femtosecond transient absorption data show the presence of electron
   transfer from PF{*} to Ru(II) to form charge-separated (CS) products
   within 1-2 ps. The decay of the oxidized and reduced products, PF+center
   dot and Ru(I), through back electron transfer are followed using

Abstract = {{In this study, the complex hygrothermal behavior of two epoxy systems
   used for strengthening applications was studied. In these systems,
   property loss by plasticization simultaneously occurred with property
   gain during additional curing. A comparison of the changes in the
   glass-transition temperature (Tg) and crosslink density with water
   immersion at different temperatures clearly showed that the two effects
   of additional curing by a postcuring reaction and plasticization by
   water absorption were in competition with each other during the
   exposure. The changes in the conversion with different exposure
   conditions suggested that water accelerated the postcuring reaction,
   even at low temperatures; this resulted in a significant difference in
   the postcuring reaction between unexposed and exposed epoxies. The
   construction of the plot of Tg versus conversion for the unexposed
   system and the placement of the Tg for exposed systems onto this master
   plot provided a method for evaluating the plasticization effect while
   excluding the influence of additional curing. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{In this laboratory study, an experimental method was developed for the
   quantitative analyses of gas fluxes in soil during advective air flow.
   One-dimensional column and two- and three-dimensional flow chamber
   models were used in this study. For the air flux measurement, n-octane
   vapor was used as a tracer, and it was introduced in the air flow
   entering the physical models. The tracer (n-octane) in the gas effluent
   from the models was captured for a finite period of time using a pack of
   activated carbon, which then was analyzed for the mass of n-octane. The
   air flux was calculated based on the mass of n-octane captured by the
   activated carbon and the inflow concentration. The measured air fluxes
   are in good agreement with the actual values for one- and
   two-dimensional model experiments. Using both the two- and
   three-dimensional models, the distribution of the air flux at the soil
   surface was measured. The distribution of the air flux was found to be
   affected by the depth of the saturated zone. The flux and flux
   distribution of a volatile contaminant (perchloroethene) was also
   measured by using the two-dimensional model. Quantitative information of
   both air and contaminant flux may be very beneficial for analyzing the
   performance of gas-driven subsurface remediation processes including
   soil vapor extraction and air sparging.}},

Abstract = {{The generalized capital asset pricing model based on mixed conditional
   value-at-risk (CVaR) deviation is used for calibrating the risk
   preferences of investors. Risk preferences are determined by
   coefficients in the mixed CVaR deviation. The corresponding new
   generalized beta is designed to capture the tail performance of S\&P 500
   returns. Calibration of the coefficients is done by extracting
   information about risk preferences from put-option prices on the S\&P
   500. Actual market option prices are matched with the estimated prices
   from the pricing equation based on the generalized beta. Calibration is
   done for 153 moments in time with intervals of approximately one month.
   Results demonstrate that the risk preferences of investors change over
   time, reflecting investors' concern about potential tail losses. A new
   index of fear is introduced, calculated as a sum of several coefficients

Abstract = {{An initial startup method for a spacecraft actuated by a pyramidal

   The method provides closed-loop internal momentum tracking control to

   The proposed controller functioning as a variable-speed control moment
   gyroscope steering law is developed in terms of the gimbal rates and the
   flywheel accelerations, which are weighted by a singularity measure.
   Specifically, using null motion, a strategy is developed to
   simultaneously perform gimbal reconfiguration for singularity avoidance
   and internal momentum management for flywheel startup. A Lyapunov-based
   stability analysis is used to prove asymptotic attitude tracking and
   exponential internal momentum tracking despite the effects of uncertain,
   time-varying satellite inertia properties and uncertain actuator inertia
   properties. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the

   inversion results from actual data are consistent with the cross-hole,
   standard penetration test N-value, and material log results. Based on

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Beam-on time is an important measure of the delivery efficiency in
   intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Traditionally, minimizing
   beam-on time has been postponed until the leaf sequencing stage, where
   the treatment plan quality is already determined and fixed. However,
   there is a trade-off between the beam-on time and the treatment plan
   quality. The aim of this study is to incorporate the beam-on time into
   the treatment plan optimization stage using a direct aperture
   optimization approach that allows for explicitly quantifying the
   trade-off. The proposed approach can provide clinicians with valuable
   information for each patient case so that they can design clinically
   attractive yet efficient treatment plans. Using the special structure of
   the problem, we propose an exact solution approach that sequentially
   characterizes segments of the Pareto-efficient frontier. In addition, an
   approximate solution technique that is applicable to more classes of
   evaluation criteria is developed. Our approximate technique is tested on
   clinical cancer cases, and its performance is compared with the general
   approximation techniques that are available for convex bicriteria
   optimization problems. The results of our experiments validate that our
   approach can achieve a more accurate representation of the
   Pareto-efficient frontier with less computational effort.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of the spray patterns is essential for making adjustments to
   an agricultural sprayer that would result in less chemical usage, less
   spray run-off onto the ground, and increased spray targeting accuracy.
   Therefore, in this study, a vertical patternator was fabricated to
   evaluate an axial-fan airblast sprayer The airblast sprayer was
   retrofitted with variable rate nozzles and adjustable air-assist flow
   control, for citrus tree-specific precision spraying. Tests involved
   evaluating spray patterns at different nozzle flow rates and air-assist
   settings. Also, the air-assist measurements between the pair of nozzles
   were measured while the sprayer was stationary (no spray).
   The patternator was useful in identifying the non-symmetric spray
   distribution due to counter-clockwise rotation of the axial-fan, i.e.,
   more spray from the right than from the left side of the sprayer
   (looking from the rear of a sprayer). Spray patterns from individual and
   all nozzles operating synchronously provided the overall information
   needed for further adjustments to the nozzles inclinations, and for
   developing application protocols (nozzle and air-assist combinations)
   for spraying in a citrus orchard with variable sizes of tree canopies.}},

Abstract = {{The United States cotton industry is one of the major economic drivers
   of the country accounting for more than \$25 billion in products and
   services annually The southeastern United States holds a major share of
   total cotton production in the United States. Although cotton is
   considered as a drought tolerant crop, climate variability may adversely
   impact cotton production. An effective way to reduce agricultural
   vulnerability to climate variability is through the implementation of
   effective adaptation strategies. Knowing cotton yield forecast in
   advance based on climate information such as using large scale climate
   indices, would aid the growers in making informed decisions to adapt to
   climate risk. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the
   relationships between large-scale climate indices and cotton yield and
   to evaluate the skill of cotton yield forecasts. Seven January and
   February month oceanic and atmospheric climate indices were correlated
   with May-September temperature, precipitation, and county average cotton
   yield for 64 counties in Georgia and Alabama. All climate indices were
   then summarized using a principal component analysis and regressed
   against historic cotton yield for 64 counties to obtain empirical models
   for cotton yield forecasting. The yield forecasts were evaluated using
   leave one out cross validation. Results indicated that January and
   February monthly climate indices exhibited statistically significant
   correlations with climate during the cotton growing season as well as
   with cotton yields. With a lead time of approximately 2 months before
   the typical planting period on the southeastern United States, about
   77\% of the counties in Georgia and 70\% of the counties in Alabama
   showed statistically significant correlations between observed and
   forecasted cotton yields. Climate indices showed potential to forecast
   cotton yield in the southeastern United States with significant lead
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Soluble solids contents (SSC) and titratable acidity (TA) are the two
   major components in the citrus industry that have a direct impact on the
   crop value and the juice quality. It is crucial for growers to know the
   stage of maturity infield before harvesting and to know the fruit
   quality for the juice processing in the processing plant. This study
   presents an application of a commercially available visible-near
   infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroradiometer for estimating SSC and TA of Hamlin
   and Valencia orange, and Thompson Red grapefruit. The Vis-NIR spectra of
   the juice were acquired using a portable spectroradiometer within the
   wavelength range of 350 to 2,500 nm in transmission mode. The absorbance
   spectra were compared to the values of SSC and TA as analyzed using a
   bench top refractrometer and chemical titration, respectively.
   Calibration models relating the Vis-NIR spectra of the juice to its SSC
   and TA were developed based on two different regression analyses:
   principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares
   regression (PLS-R). Selected combinations of spectral preprocessing such
   as derivatives, mean centering, multiplicative signal correction,
   standard normal variate, and detrending were applied to evaluate the
   performance of the calibration models. Performance of five different
   models in predicting the SSC and TA using the Vis-NIR ranges were
   compared. The best R-2 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP)
   for SSC were 0.91 and 0.47 degrees Brix developed by Valencia orange
   absorbance spectra (Model 5), respectively. Meanwhile, the combination
   of Hamlin and Valencia absorbance spectra (Model 2) predicted the
   maximum TA with an R-2 of 0.73 and an RMSEP of 0.25\%. The results
   concluded that portable Vis-NIR spectroradiometer-based technique can
   provide basic information on the levels of SSC and TA in-field as a
   preliminary analysis before harvesting.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Image registration is a fundamental task in computer vision and it
   significantly contributes to high-level computer vision and benefits
   numerous practical applications. Although many image registration
   techniques have been proposed in the past, there is still a need for
   further research because many issues such as the parallax problem remain
   to be solved. The traditional image registration algorithms suffer from
   the parallax problem due to their underlying assumption that the scene
   can be regarded approximately planar which is not satisfied when large
   depth variations exist in the images with high-rise objects. To address
   the parallax problem, we present a new strategy for two-dimensional (2D)
   image registration by leveraging the depth information from a 3D image
   reconstruction. The novel idea is to recover the depth in the image
   region with high-rise objects to build an accurate transform function
   for image registration. We use a geometric segmentation algorithm to

Abstract = {{Vegetation plays a central role in forming and maintaining an
   ecosystem's physical conditions, which in turn strongly influence
   vegetation function. These bidirectional feedbacks may be particularly
   evident during an ecosystem succession following large-scale
   disturbances. Clay settling areas (CSAs) are large elevated impoundments
   that receive clay slurry as a by-product of phosphate mining in Florida.
   As CSAs mature, a limited seed source arrests ecological succession,
   resulting in the dominance of Salix caroliniana, which is likely further
   supported by altered abiotic conditions. The dominance of this wetland
   pioneer species and its interactions with soil and hydrology may largely
   determine the future ecosystem state. To identify how interactions
   between groundwater levels, soil water availability, and vegetation
   response regulate the succession of CSA ecosystems, we measured
   groundwater levels, vertical soil moisture profiles, soil water
   potentials, and root biomass allocation and transpiration of
   S.?caroliniana at two sites. Fine soil texture in the CSAs resulted in
   capillary fringe heights greater than 1?m, which maintained soil
   moisture near saturation well above the water table. Rooting depths over
   1?m in the clay soils provided sufficient water availability, which,
   along with high residual phosphorus concentrations, explained the
   dominance and high transpiration rates of S.?caroliniana across CSAs.
   Capillary rise-induced water availability created wetland soil
   conditions far upgradient from inundated areas, underscoring the role of
   soil texture in determining wetland extent. The strong coupling between
   water table and S.?caroliniana transpiration, however, suggests that
   beyond soil development, this pioneer phreatophyte may also drive
   succession through systematic dewatering. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The crystal structure and property changes of sodium bismuth titanate
   (Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3, NBT) piezoelectric ceramics are reported as a function
   of La modification (0.5-2.0 at. \%) and increasing temperature using
   high resolution x-ray diffraction, permittivity, depolarization, and
   polarization and strain hysteresis measurements. La substitution is
   found to decrease the depolarization temperature of NBT (e.g., 1.5 at.
   \% La substitution lowers the depolarization temperature by 60 degrees C
   relative to the unmodified composition) with little impact on the room
   temperature polarization and strain hysteresis. The room temperature
   structures of the various NBT compositions were modeled using a mixture
   of the monoclinic Cc space group and the cubic Pm (3) over barm phase,
   where the Pm (3) over barm phase is used to model local regions in the
   material which do not obey the long range Cc space group. With
   increasing La substitution, the lattice parameter distortions associated
   with the Cc phase approached that of the prototypical cubic unit cell
   and the fraction of the Pm (3) over barm phase increased. The
   relationship between these crystallographic changes and the
   depolarization behavior of La-modified NBT is discussed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{To increase the moisture content of waste disposed in a bioreactor
   landfill, it is critical to secure the moisture source. In this study,
   industrial wastewater was evaluated as a potential moisture source for a
   bioreactor landfill with respect to the impact on methane generation.
   Industrial wastewater samples were collected from fishery, brewery and
   dairy industries. These samples were tested for basic water chemistry
   parameters, heavy metals, and methane generation using the regular and
   modified biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays. Despite high sodium
   and total phosphate concentrations in the fishery wastewater, a
   significant methane yield was observed (0.313 m(3) CH4/kg COD). However,
   a relatively large amount of fishery wastewater added at the phase of
   methane generation acceleration adversely affected microbial activity.
   Samples from the brewery and dairy wastewater did not indicate
   significant inhibitory effects on methane generation in either the
   regular or the modified BMP assay. This study demonstrates the utility
   of wastewater as an alternative to traditional moisture sources when
   used to enhance methane production in a bioreactor landfill.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental characterization of microstructure evolution in three

   theory and multiparticle diffusion simulations, which predict late-stage
   phase-coarsening kinetics. Particle size distributions, growth kinetics
   and maximum particle sizes obtained using quantitative, centered
   dark-field transmission electron microscopy are compared quantitatively
   with theoretical and computational predictions. We also demonstrate the
   dependence on delta' precipitate volume fraction of the rate constant
   for coarsening and the microstructure's maximum particle size, both of
   which remained undetermined for this alloy system for nearly a half
   century. Our experiments show quantitatively that the
   diffusion-screening theoretical description of phase coarsening yields
   reasonable kinetic predictions, and that useful simulations of
   microstructure evolution are obtained via multiparticle diffusion. The
   tested theory and simulation method will provide useful tools for future
   design of two-phase alloys for elevated temperature applications. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study the hydrogen production for a laboratory scale iron-based
   magnetically stabilized porous structure is experimentally investigated
   for temperature and steam superficial velocities ranging from 600 to 800
   degrees C and 5-25 cm/s, respectively. A reaction kinetic model is
   proposed, and the important non-dimensional parameters describing the
   physical characteristics of the reactor are determined. A numerical code
   is developed to solve the species transport and the substrate
   conservation equations along the reactor in order to calibrate the
   kinetic model. A parametric study of the model is conceived and the
   activation energy, order of the reaction, and the best form of the
   reaction rate model are determined from experiments. The calibrated
   model shows very good agreements between the predicted and measured
   hydrogen production rates. A dimensionless parameter is introduced as
   the reactor effectiveness, and is utilized to find the operating
   conditions for which the reactor effectiveness is the highest. This
   highly reactive structure is very suitable for industrial applications,
   and the model can provide an excellent tool for designing and
   controlling larger scale reactors. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{In this study, we report on a demonstration of hydrogen sensing at low
   temperature using SnO2 functionalized AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility
   transistors (HEMT). The SnO2 dispersion was synthesized via a
   hydrothermal method and selectively deposited on the gate region of a
   HEMT device through a photolithography process. The high electron sheet
   carrier concentration of nitride HEMTs provides an increased sensitivity
   relative to simple Schottky diodes fabricated on GaN layers. The
   morphology and crystalline properties of the SnO2-gate, together with
   the texture of the multilayer films on the device were investigated by
   SEM, HRTEM, EDS and XRD. The effects of annealing treatment on the
   crystalline properties of the SnO2-gate, and gas sensing properties of
   SnO2-gated HEMT sensors were studied. The SnO2-gated HEMT sensor showed
   fast and reversible hydrogen gas sensing response at low temperature.

Abstract = {{Novel aerosol therapeutic modalities have been investigated for lung
   cancer. Inhaled gene therapy has presented safety and effectiveness
   previously in cystic fibrosis. However, safety concerns have been raised
   regarding the safety of non-viral vectors for inhaled gene therapy in
   lung cancer, and therefore small steps have been made towards this
   multifunctional treatment modality. During the last decade, numerous new
   nanocomplexes have been created and investigated as a safe gene delivery
   nano-vehicle. These formulations are multifunctional; they can be used
   as either local therapy or carrier for an effective inhaled gene therapy
   for lung cancer. Herein, we present current and future perspectives of
   nanocomplexes for inhaled gene therapy treatment in lung cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Antibacterial coating approaches are being investigated to modify
   implants to reduce bacterial adhesion and viability in order to reduce
   implant-associated infection. Nanostructured materials possess unique
   surface properties, and nanotopographic surfaces have been reported to
   modulate bacterial adhesion. Zinc oxide (ZnO) films presenting
   well-controlled nanorod surface structures have recently been developed.
   To assess the efficacy of ZnO nanorod surfaces as an anti-bacterial
   coating, we evaluated bacterial adhesion and viability, compared to
   sputtered ZnO substrates (a relatively flat control) and glass
   substrates (as a reference). Common implant-associated pathogens,
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were investigated.
   The number of adherent P aeruginosa on ZnO nanorod surfaces was found to
   be reduced compared to glass and sputtered ZnO, while the adherent
   number of S. epidermidis on the ZnO nanorods was equivalent to glass.
   Regarding bacteria viability, the ZnO nanorod and sputtered ZnO surfaces
   demonstrated a modest, but significant bactericidal effect on adherent P
   aeruginosa, killing 2.5-fold and 1.7-fold more over the number of dead P
   aeruginosa on glass, respectively. A greater bactericidal effect of ZnO
   substrates on S. epidermidis was found, with sputtered ZnO and ZnO
   nanorod substrates killing similar to 20-fold and 30-fold more over the
   number of dead S. epidermidis on glass, respectively. These data support
   the further investigation and optimization of ZnO nanorod coatings with
   potential for bacterial adhesion resistance and bactericidal properties.}},

Abstract = {{GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were grown on a patterned

   Free-standing LED structures were obtained by removing the PSS using

   concave hemisphere structures, which had been located between the
   sapphire and the GaN film, was then exposed and photo-electrochemically
   etched using a 2M KOH solution to create nano-sized pyramids. Aluminum
   was deposited on the roughened N-face GaN as a reflective layer. The
   roughened aluminum reflectors, consisting of micron-sized hemisphere
   structures and nano-sized pyramids, enhanced the light extraction
   efficiency through multiple scattering events of photons and randomized
   the directions of the photons. The subsequent enhancement in
   electroluminescence was 13\% compared with an untextured control LED.

Abstract = {{The correlation between the luminescent properties and structural
   characteristics of ZnGa2O4:Mn phosphor thin films has been investigated.
   The ZnGa2O4: Mn films have been prepared by radio frequency planar
   magnetron sputter deposition from a 2 mol. \% Mn-doped ZnGa2O4 target in
   an Ar-O-2 gas mixture whose pressure ranged between 2 and 20 mTorr.
   Films deposited at gas pressures above 10 mTorr showed a random
   crystallographic orientation, while the films deposited <= 10 mTorr
   exhibited a preferential orientation of the {[}110] direction
   perpendicular to the film surface. Internal stress in the ZnGa2O4: Mn
   films became increasingly compressive upon decreasing the gas pressure,
   reaching a value of similar to 1.7 x 10(10) dyne/cm(2) at 2 mTorr. The
   observed change in internal stress correlated with the changes in the
   crystalline structure of the films. After a post-deposition anneal at
   800 degrees C, the crystallinity of the films was improved. The rms
   surface roughness of the annealed ZnGa2O4: Mn films did not
   systematically depend on the gas pressure. Both photoluminescence (PL)
   and cathodoluminescence (CL) resulted in green light, and the emission
   peaked at similar to 505 nm. This was attributed to the Mn2+ 3d-3d
   intrashell T-4(1) -> (6)A(1) transition. The intensities of both PL and
   CL emission increased as the gas pressure decreased, presumably due to
   the better crystalline quality with a highly {[}110]-textured structure
   and a more densely-packed microstructure in the ZnGa2O4: Mn films
   deposited at lower pressures. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{AlGaN/GaN HEMTs grown on both-side-polished sapphire substrates were
   successfully lifted-off with a 193-nm UV excimer laser system. The
   photon energy of the 193 nm laser is larger than the band gap of AlN and
   thus it can be used to lift-off AlGaN HEMT structures with AlN or AlGaN
   interfacial layers grown on sapphire substrates prior to growth of the
   GaN buffer layers. The lifted-off HEMT chip was warped and showed
   25-42\% reduction of the saturation drain current. There was no
   degradation observed either in the forward or reverse gate
   current-voltage (I-V) characteristics or on the drain punch-through
   voltage. Based on comparisons of cross-sectional electron micrographs,
   no additional dislocations were created in the HEMT structures after the
   laser lift-off process. Reduction in saturation drain current was
   attributed to relaxation of the lifted-off HEMT structures. Newton's
   rings and Raman spectrum E2 peak shifts were used to estimate the strain
   relaxation of the laser lifted-off samples.}},

   the liquid depths are small compared to the vapor depths. The cellular
   patterns give way to long wavelength modes when the liquid depths are
   large because the solutal convection is dominant. When heated from

Abstract = {{The Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS) is
   celebrating its 60th anniversary this year. Since its inception, the
   Society has widely disseminated the advancements in the field of
   modeling and simulation (M \& S) through its peer-reviewed journals. In
   this paper we profile research that has been published in the journal
   SIMULATION: Transactions of the Society for Modeling and Simulation
   International from the turn of the millennium to 2010; the objective is
   to acknowledge the contribution of the authors and their seminal
   research papers, their respective universities/departments and the
   geographical diversity of the authors' affiliations. Yet another
   objective is to contribute towards the understanding of the overall
   evolution of the discipline of M \& S; this is achieved through the
   classification of M \& S techniques and its frequency of use, analysis
   of the sectors that have seen the predomination application of M \& S
   and the context of its application. It is expected that this paper will
   lead to further appreciation of the contribution of the Society in
   influencing the growth of M \& S as a discipline and, indeed, in

Abstract = {{Researchers have made significant progress in recent years towards
   realizing effective structural health monitoring (SHM) utilizing
   wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). These efforts have focused on
   improving the performance and robustness of such networks to achieve
   high quality data acquisition and distributed, in-network processing.
   One of the primary challenges still facing the use of smart sensors for
   long-term monitoring deployments is their limited power resources.
   Periodically accessing the sensor nodes to change batteries is not
   feasible or economical in many deployment cases. While energy harvesting
   techniques show promise for prolonging unattended network life, low
   power design and operation are still critically important. This research
   presents the WiSeMote: a new, fully integrated ultra-low power wireless
   smart sensor node and a flexible base station, both designed for
   long-term SHM deployments. The power consumption of the sensor nodes and
   base station has been minimized through careful hardware selection and
   the implementation of power-aware network software, without sacrificing
   flexibility and functionality.}},

Abstract = {{The compressive electromechanical response of aligned carbon nanotube
   (CNT) arrays is evaluated for use as an artificial hair sensor (AHS)
   transduction element. CNT arrays with heights of 12, 75, and 225 mu m
   are examined. The quasi-static and dynamic sensitivity to force,
   response time, and signal drift are examined within the range of applied
   stresses predicted by a mechanical model applicable to the conceptual
   CNT array-based AHS (0-1 kPa). Each array is highly sensitive to
   compressive loading, with a maximum observed gauge factor of 114. The
   arrays demonstrate a repeatable response to dynamic cycling after a
   break-in period of approximately 50 cycles. Utilizing a four-wire
   measurement electrode configuration, the change in contact resistance
   between the array and the electrodes is observed to dominate the
   electromechanical response of the arrays. The response time of the CNT
   arrays is of the order of 10 ms. When the arrays are subjected to
   constant stress, mechanical creep is observed that results in a signal
   drift that generally diminishes the responsiveness of the arrays,
   particularly at stress approaching 1 kPa. The results of this study
   serve as a preliminary proof of concept for utilizing CNT arrays as a
   transduction mechanism for a proposed artificial hair sensor. Such a low
   profile and light-weight flow sensor is expected to have application in
   a number of applications including navigation and state awareness of
   small air vehicles, similar in function to natural hair cell receptors
   utilized by insects and bats.}},

Abstract = {{The Cropping System Model (CSM)-CROPGRO-Cotton model simulates growth,
   development, and yield for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and requires a
   large number of parameters and inputs. It is practically impossible to
   estimate all the parameters with a high level of accuracy. The
   objectives of this study were to estimate values and uncertainties of
   the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model genotype parameters and resulting
   uncertainties in the cotton growth and development model and to evaluate
   the model performance by comparing model predictions based on the
   estimated parameters using generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation
   (GLUE) with those based on a prior distribution and the default model
   parameters. Observations for this study were collected from four
   experiments at Quincy, FL, Citra, FL, and Griffin, GA, for Delta Pinc
   555 cotton. The results show that the estimated parameters improved
   model performance compared with default parameters. There was a
   noticeable reduction in parameter uncertainties and resulting model
   output uncertainties. Resulting uncertainty in model predictions of leaf
   area index, leaf weight, stem weight, and boll weight were reduced to 4
   to 13\% with posterior and 29 to 56\% prior parameters, partially due to
   improved estimates and a considerable reduction in the uncertainty of
   the important model parameters such as the light extinction coefficient
   and specific leaf area. The GLUE technique improved the model
   performance by improving estimated values of model parameters, reducing
   model parameter uncertainties, and reducing model output uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid advances in non-fouling surface technology have pushed the
   performance of novel coatings toward the detection limit of established
   protein density quantification techniques. Hence, there is an urgent
   need for more sensitive detection strategies. Previously we demonstrated
   that landing rate measurements of microtubules can reveal kinesin
   surface coverages between 0.1 and 10 mu m(-2). In this report, we
   quantify the binding kinetics of highly fluorescent markers to
   surface-adhered proteins and demonstrate the of protein surface
   densities in the range of 0.1-1000 mu m(-2). We utilize this technique
   to measure kinesin densities on casein-coated glass surfaces and
   fibrinogen densities on non-fouling polyethylene glycol methacrylate
   (PEGMA) surfaces. The use of nanospheres (i) potentially permits the
   detection of a variety of adsorbed proteins, (ii) facilitates the
   determination of the landing rate due to their uniformity, and (iii)
   extends the dynamic range of the method due to their small size.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the treatment of cancer involving therapeutic agents
   have shown promising results. However, treatment efficacy can be limited
   due to inadequate and uneven uptake in solid tumors, thereby making the
   prediction of drug transport important for developing effective
   therapeutic strategies. In this study, a patient-specific computational
   porous media model (voxelized model) was developed for predicting the
   interstitial flow field and distribution of a systemically delivered
   magnetic resonance (MR) visible tracer in a tumor. The benefits of a
   voxel approach include less labor and less computational time
   (approximately an order of magnitude reduction compared to the
   traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach developed
   earlier by our group). The model results were compared with that
   obtained from a previous approach based on unstructured meshes along
   with MR-measured tracer concentration data within tumors, using
   statistical analysis and qualitative representations. The statistical
   analysis indicated the similarity between the structured and
   unstructured models' results with a low root mean square error (RMS) and
   a high correlation coefficient. The voxelized model captured features of
   the flow field and tracer distribution such as high interstitial fluid
   pressure inside the tumor and the heterogeneous distribution of the
   tracer. Predictions of tracer distribution by the voxelized approach
   also resulted in low RMS error when compared with MR-measured data over
   a 1 h time course. The similarity in the voxelized model results with
   experiment and the nonvoxelized model predictions were maintained across
   three different tumors. Overall, the voxelized model serves as a
   reliable and swift alternative to approaches using unstructured meshes
   in predicting extracellular transport within tumors. {[}DOI:

   LQF algorithm achieves the full capacity region, Lambda, when the
   interference graph satisfies the so-called local pooling condition. For
   a general graph G, LQF achieves (i.e., stabilizes) a part of the
   capacity region, sigma{*} (G)Lambda, where sigma{*}(G) is the overall
   local pooling factor of the interference graph G and sigma{*}(G) <= 1.
   It has been shown later that LQF achieves a larger rate region, Sigma{*}
   (G)Lambda, where Sigma{*} (G) is a diagonal matrix. The contribution of
   this paper is to describe three new achievable rate regions, which are
   larger than the previously known regions. In particular, the new regions
   include all the extreme points of the capacity region and are not convex
   in general. We also discover a counterintuitive phenomenon in which
   increasing the arrival rate may sometime help to stabilize the network.
   This phenomenon can be well explained using the theory developed in this
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the fabrication, characterization and modeling of
   microelectromechanical inductor (MEMI) devices, which employ
   electrodynamic coupling and mechanical energy storage to boost the
   apparent electrical inductance of electrical conductors. The
   microfabricated MEMI devices comprise an electrically conducting,
   mechanically suspended clamped-clamped copper beam that is placed in a
   transverse static magnetic field. Under an ac current excitation, the
   beam is forced to vibrate via the electrodynamic interactions between
   the electrical current and the static magnetic field. This
   electromechanical coupling results in a large apparent electrical
   inductance. The microfabrication and subsequent characterization of a
   variety of test structures is presented. The devices exhibit a peak
   quality factor up to 5.6 and net areal inductance densities of up to 3.5
   mu H mm(-2). The experimentally observed behavior is compared against

Abstract = {{Because of its wide applications, nanosized titanium dioxide may become
   a potential environmental risk to soil and groundwater system. It is
   therefore important to improve current understanding of the
   environmental fate and transport of titanium oxides nanoparticles
   (TONPs). In this work, the effect of solution chemistry (i.e., pH, ionic
   strength, and natural organic matter (NOM) concentration) on the
   deposition and transport of TONPs in saturated porous media was examined
   in detail. Laboratory columns packed with acid-cleaned quartz sand were
   used in the experiment as porous media. Transport experiments were
   conducted with various chemistry combinations, including four ionic
   strengths, three pH levels, and two NOM concentrations. The results
   showed that TONP mobility increased with increasing solution pH, but
   decreased with increasing solution ionic strength. It is also found that
   the presence of NOM in the system enhanced the mobility of TONPs in the
   saturated porous media. The Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO)
   theory was used to justify the mobility trends observed in the
   experimental data. Predictions from the theory agreed excellently with
   the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Emphasis on effective demand management is becoming increasingly
   recognized as an important factor in operations performance. Operations
   models that account for supply costs and constraints as well as a
   supplier's ability to influence demand characteristics can lead to an
   improved match between supply and demand. This paper presents a class of
   optimization models that allow a supplier to select, from a set of
   potential markets, those markets that provide maximum profit when
   production/procurement economies of scale exist in the supply process.
   The resulting optimization problem we study possesses an interesting
   structure and we show that although the general problem is -complete, a
   number of relevant and practical special cases can be solved in
   polynomial time. We also provide a computationally very efficient and
   intuitively attractive heuristic solution procedure that performs
   extremely well on a large number of test instances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops exact and heuristic algorithms for a stochastic
   knapsack problem where items with random sizes may be assigned to a
   knapsack. An item's value is given by the realization of the product of
   a random unit revenue and the random item size. When the realization of
   the sum of selected item sizes exceeds the knapsack capacity, a penalty
   cost is incurred for each unit of overflow, while our model allows for a
   salvage value for each unit of capacity that remains unused. We seek to
   maximize the expected net profit resulting from the assignment of items
   to the knapsack. Although the capacity is fixed in our core model, we
   show that problems with random capacity, as well as problems in which
   capacity is a decision variable subject to unit costs, fall within this
   class of problems as well. We focus on the case where item sizes are
   independent and normally distributed random variables, and provide an
   exact solution method for a continuous relaxation of the problem. We
   show that an optimal solution to this relaxation exists containing no
   more than two fractionally selected items, and develop a customized
   branch-and-bound algorithm for obtaining an optimal binary solution. In
   addition, we present an efficient heuristic solution method based on our
   algorithm for solving the relaxation and empirically show that it
   provides high-quality solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a promising local delivery
   technique for overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and treating
   diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). For CED, therapeutics are
   infused directly into brain tissue and the drug agent is spread through
   the extracellular space, considered to be highly tortuous porous media.
   In this study, 3D computational models developed using magnetic
   resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging data sets were used to predict
   CED transport in the rat ventral hippocampus using a voxelized modeling
   previously developed by our group. Predicted albumin tracer
   distributions were compared with MR-measured distributions from in vivo
   CED in the ventral hippocampus up to 10 mu L of Gd-DTPA albumin tracer
   infusion. Predicted and measured tissue distribution volumes and
   distribution patterns after 5 and 10 mu L infusions were found to be
   comparable. Tracers were found to occupy the underlying landmark
   structures with preferential transport found in regions with less fluid
   resistance such as the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Also,
   tracer spread was bounded by high fluid resistance layers such as the
   granular cell layer and pyramidal cell layer of dentate gyrus. Leakage

Abstract = {{A machine vision system for estimation of citrus fruit mass, fruit
   count, and fruit size during postharvest processing was investigated
   with the aim of developing of an advanced citrus yield mapping system.
   Such yield mapping system enables the citrus growers to efficiently
   manage the in-grove spatial variability factors such as: soil type, soil
   fertility, moisture content, etc., and can help increase yield and
   profits. Thus, a machine vision system was developed and installed in a
   citrus debris cleaning machine, which removes debris from mechanically
   harvested loads. An image processing algorithm was developed to identify
   fruit from images of the postharvest citrus from a commercial citrus
   grove. For fruit detection, logistic regression model based pixel
   classification algorithms were developed. To avoid misclassification due
   to highly saturated area on fruit and non-fruit regions, a highly
   saturated area recovering (HSAR) algorithm was developed that obviated
   use of a ``filling holes{''} operation. A mass calibration process was
   conducted, and fruit mass was estimated, which turned out to be
   reasonably good. The highest coefficient of determination (R-2) value
   between the measured fruit mass and the estimated fruit mass was
   observed to be 0.945 and the root mean square error was 116.1 kg. A
   H-minima transform based watershed algorithm was used to separate the
   joined fruit and enabled an estimation of fruit counting and fruit size.
   Fruit mass estimation using the fruit size information was also
   conducted and these results were compared with that of the mass
   estimation based on fruit pixel area. (C) 2012 IAgrE. Published by

Title = {{Air-assisted sprayer adapted for precision horticulture: Spray patterns

Abstract = {{An axial-fan air-assisted sprayer, adapted with variable rate nozzles
   and adjustable air-assist flow control, for citrus tree-specific
   precision spraying, was tested. Static experiments were conducted to
   determine spray patterns at varied nozzle flow rates and air-assistance
   settings. Spray patterns confirmed that the sprayer delivered variable
   liquid flow rates and the air-diverting louvre controlled the
   air-assistance providing targeted spray delivery. Field experiments were
   conducted to determine suitable air-assistance and nozzle combinations
   needed in the future for sensor-controlled spraying in young
   (small-sized) citrus canopies. Experiments involved two nozzle
   treatments, a) nozzles 1-6, and b) nozzles 2-3 at 100\% output rates and
   three (40\%, 70\%, and 100\%) levels of air assistance selected based on
   spray patterns. The sprayer was operated at a travel speed of 4.5 km
   h(-1) and the water-soluble tracer deposition on biological and
   artificial targets, at 0.6 m and 1.4 m above ground and laterally at the
   canopy front, middle, and back, respectively were measured using
   fluorimetry. Results suggested that within nozzles 1-6 treatments with
   varied air-assist, 70\% air-assistance was more effective for small
   sized canopies than 100\% air-assistance; it appeared that the latter
   propelled the spray beyond the canopy and reduced the spray deposition
   efficiency. Also, for the citrus canopies studied, the use of two or
   three nozzles instead of the lower six nozzles (i.e. the control
   treatment) might be more suitable since they would result in 50\% or
   less chemical usage while having comparable spray deposition to that of
   the control. (C) 2012 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Gene therapy can be defined as the transfer of genetic material into a
   cell for therapeutic purposes. Cytosine deaminase (CD) transferred into
   tumor cells by an adenoviral vector (Ad. CD), can convert the antifungal
   drug fluorocytosine (5-FC) to the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
   which kills not only the transfected tumor cells but also their
   neighbors by the so-called `bystander effect'. After testing a protocol
   for Ad. CD transfer and lung tumor burden control in a Lewis mouse
   model, we used this technique in the management of lung cancer patients
   with malignant pleural effusion (MPE): two cases are presented
   investigating the possible enhancement of anticancer effect in both
   non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) by
   local activation of the pro-drug 5-FC. Results were discussed in
   parallel to a literature review on the topic. 5-FC and Ad. CD were
   administered intratumorally to Lewis mouse lung carcinoma and the effect
   was monitored by tumor size and electromicroscopy. Two patients with
   advanced stage lung cancer (1SCLC, 1NSCLC), which developed MPE during
   first-line treatment were administered 1012 plaque-forming unit (pfu)
   Ad. CD by intrapleural instillation, in two doses (day1 and day7).
   Instillation was performed when the pleural fluid was <= 200 ml. In
   addition, they received 5-FC 500 mg four times daily for 14 days. Lung
   tumor regression and successful transfer of adenoviral particles were
   observed in treated animals. Patients presented complete regression of
   pleural effusion as monitored by computerized tomography scan.
   Neutrapenia and anemia were the most severe adverse effect presented
   (grade III/grade IV 100\%). The increased toxicity followed by the
   intrapleural gene therapy indicates the augmentation of anticancer
   effect of transformed pro-drug 5-FC to active 5-FU. The obtained data
   indicate that intrapleural gene therapy may be a useful tool, adjunct to
   chemotherapy, in the management of MPE related to lung cancer.}},

Title = {{Carbon modeling and emergy evaluation of grassland management schemes in

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{49-57}},

Abstract = {{There is relatively little research on how management affects carbon
   storage and the carbon cycle in grasslands of China, and how this in
   turn affects regional development and natural capital conservation.
   Inner Mongolia has 25\% of the total grassland area of China and about
   60 million livestock. Productivity of the traditional grazing schemes in
   this area is very low; in addition frequent natural disasters greatly
   affect livestock production. The grasslands of northern China form a
   very important eco-economic community belt, thus we ask, ``What is the
   future of this region and what will be its role in the carbon cycle
   under development pressure and the new conditions caused by climate
   change?{''} Using the emergy synthesis method, carbon models are
   constructed of the natural grasslands under different animal grazing
   pressures and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and
   the ecological-economic benefits of several different grassland
   utilization schemes are compared using emergy evaluation. The result
   shows that in grazing scheme total C emission will be 4087 kg/ha in one
   hundred years which supports the conclusion that over the long run
   grasslands can be a carbon source due to overgrazing. We estimate that
   the natural capital of these grasslands is around 13,303 em\$/ha and
   that is provides 106 em\$/ha/yr in ecosystem services. If 90\% of the
   natural grassland can be reserved by using small-scale intensive grazing
   systems, we estimated these natural grasslands can provide 7.6 billion
   ern\$/yr of ecosystem services and preserve 955 billion em\$ in natural
   capital, which is helpful information for proper policy making and in
   establishing a scientific strategy for sustainable development of the
   grasslands in north China, not only from the perspective of the
   indigenous nomadic culture, but also from an economic-ecological
   perspective. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{DNA damage and changes in enzyme activities were used as biomarkers to
   evaluate the genotoxicity and oxidative stress of tetracycline and

   that both antibiotics induced significant genotoxicity on earthworms in

   stronger effect than tetracycline in the short term. The tests on the
   activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes
   further indicated biochemical stresses induced by the antibiotics. An
   N-shaped activity pattern was noted with the enzyme activities being
   stimulated first, then inhibited, and stimulated again with increasing
   concentration. The induced activity of SOD or CAT could scavenge oxygen
   free radicals and protect the organisms against oxidative stress by
   alleviating the corresponding DNA damage. Compared to enzyme activities.
   DNA damage as a biomarker was more sensitive and is thus more suitable
   for detecting low concentration exposure and diagnosing the genotoxicity
   of contaminants in terrestrial environment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Adsorption of natural organic matter (NOM) on nanoparticles can have
   dramatic impacts on particle dispersion resulting in altered fate and
   transport as well as bioavailability and toxicity. In this study, the
   adsorption of Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) on silver nanoparticles
   (nano-Ag) was determined and showed a Langmuir adsorption at pH 7 with
   an adsorption maximum of 28.6 mg g(-1) nano-Ag. It was also revealed
   that addition of <10 mg L-1 total organic carbon (TOC) increased the
   total Ag content suspended in the aquatic system, likely due to
   increased dispersion. Total silver content decreased with concentrations
   of NOM greater than 10 mg TOC L-1 indicating an increase in nanoparticle
   agglomeration and settling above this concentration. However, SRHA did
   not have any significant effect on the equilibrium concentration of
   ionic Ag dissolved in solution. Exposure of Daphnia to nano-Ag particles
   (50 mu g L-1 and pH 7) produced a linear decrease in toxicity with
   increasing NOM. These results clearly indicate the importance of water
   chemistry on the fate and toxicity of nanoparticulates. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has been a very effective technique for
   processor energy reduction. It adjusts processor voltage and frequency
   level during runtime. In this article, we propose a general and flexible
   processor voltage scaling algorithm for real-time multitasking systems.
   Our approach focuses on exploiting dynamic slack that is created when a
   task finishes earlier than its estimated worst-case execution time
   (WCET). Our algorithm is efficient enough to execute at runtime and can
   be configured flexibly to make tradeoffs between running time and energy
   savings. By rescheduling tasks effectively, we can achieve almost as
   much energy savings as if there is no arrival time constraints.
   Furthermore, our approach can effectively incorporate both leakage power
   consumption as well as variable scaling overhead. Also, it is relatively
   independent of task characteristics and scheduling policy. Experimental
   results show that our technique can achieve significant energy savings
   at runtime over statically generated schedules and up to 12\% more
   savings compared to the state-of-art techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Thermal-aware scheduling of parallel jobs is becoming an increasingly
   critical issue in software design for computing platforms ranging from
   embedded systems to large servers and entire data centers. In addition
   to the obvious implications of unrestricted temperature, such as thermal
   emergencies resulting in hardware failure, effective thermal management
   reduces the cost of thermal packaging for processors while achieving
   long-term savings from reduced secondary cooling costs. In embedded
   systems, hardware temperature control mechanisms in conjunction with
   software and other dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques have been
   effectively utilized to avoid overheating. Server systems can also
   optimally take advantage of advanced DTM and efficient task scheduling
   to exert a positive impact on overall cooling costs as well as on
   prolonging the life of system components. The aim of this paper is to
   provide a comprehensive survey of recent research on thermal-aware task
   scheduling techniques for multi-core systems. The paper starts with the
   motivation behind managing temperature through task mapping and
   scheduling and then addresses the problems faced in such an approach,
   while providing commonly used thermal and task models as well as
   contemporary temperature control mechanisms of modern multi-core
   processors. A number of objectives of optimization with different
   combinations of temperature and performance constraints are elaborated.
   Also described in the context of above mentioned issues is a structured
   coverage of recently published research work. This leads to grouping of
   existing techniques in a taxonomical manner as well as to some
   conclusive observations that can help in identifying possible new
   research directions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides the methodology for an energy-based progressive
   collapse assessment of multistory buildings. The progressive collapse of
   steel-framed buildings is analyzed based on an energy flow perspective.
   The energy based assessment of structural members is introduced, and
   compared with conventional force and deformation approaches discussed in
   the literature. Consecutively, the advantages of energy flow analysis in
   interpretation of extreme dynamic events are discussed. On the global
   level, a building can arrest the collapse, and achieve its stable
   configuration only if the kinetic energy is completely dissipated by the
   structure. Otherwise, the remaining kinetic energy will cause the
   collapse to continue. In a conventional building, kinetic energy is
   dissipated within structural members by the transformation into their
   deformation energy. Structural members can dissipate finite amounts of
   energy before becoming unstable. The column deformation energy was shown
   to be a better stability indicator under dynamic loading than the
   maximum dynamic force. The energy flow analysis is illustrated with a
   collapse assessment of a typical steel building. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Recently intensive efforts have been made on the transformation of the
   world's largest physical system, the power grid, into a ``smart grid{''}
   by incorporating extensive information and communication
   infrastructures. Key features in such a ``smart grid{''} include high
   penetration of renewable and distributed energy sources, large-scale
   energy storage, market-based online electricity pricing, and widespread
   demand response programs. From the perspective of residential customers,
   we can investigate how to minimize the expected electricity cost with
   real-time electricity pricing, which is the focus of this paper. By
   jointly considering energy storage, local distributed generation such as
   photovoltaic (PV) modules or small wind turbines, and inelastic or
   elastic energy demands, we mathematically formulate this problem as a
   stochastic optimization problem and approximately solve it by using the
   Lyapunov optimization approach. From the theoretical analysis, we have
   also found a good tradeoff between cost saving and storage capacity. A
   salient feature of our proposed approach is that it can operate without
   any future knowledge on the related stochastic models (e. g., the
   distribution) and is easy to implement in real time. We have also
   evaluated our proposed solution with practical data sets and validated

Pages = {{221-226}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the deformation and failure behavior of a model
   nanocomposite that mimics the wood cell wall layer is studied using
   molecular dynamics simulation. The effect of microfibril angle (MFA) on
   the mechanical properties of the cellulose microfibril-reinforced
   nanocomposite is investigated. The measured elastic modulus in the
   simulations is found to be comparable with the estimation based on
   experimental measurements. Further more, the simulation results show
   that it is the local buckling of cellulose microfibril that causes the
   initiation of failure of the fiber-reinforced nanocomposites, i.e., the
   wood cell wall layers. Since kink band formation is the compressive
   failure mode of wood cell walls as well as the macroscopic wood, this
   suggests that the compressive failure of the micron-scale wood cell wall
   as well as the macroscopic wood may originate at the nanoscale as a
   consequence of the bulking of microfibrils. The effect of water on the
   mechanical properties of wood cell wall is also studied. (C) 2012

Title = {{A model of the lateral line of fish for vortex sensing}},
Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the lateral line trunk canal (LLTC) of a fish is modeled
   to investigate how it is affected by an external flow field. Potential
   flow theory is adopted to model the flow field around a fish's body in
   the presence of a Karman vortex street. Karman and reverse Karman
   streets represent the flow patterns behind a bluff body and a traveling
   fish, respectively. An analytical solution is obtained for a flat body,
   while a fish-like body is modeled using a Joukowski transformation and
   the corresponding equations are solved numerically. The pressure
   distribution on the body surface is then computed employing Bernoulli's
   equation. For a known external flow, the flow inside the LLTC is driven
   by the pressure gradient between a pair of consecutive pores, which can
   be solved analytically. Governing dimensionless parameters are obtained
   from this analytical solution, and the effects of these numbers on the
   amplitude or features of the velocity distribution inside the canal are
   studied. The results show that the main characteristics of a vortex
   street including the magnitude of vortices, their translational speed,
   their spacing, their distance from the fish's body and the angle of the
   vortex street axis can all be recovered by measuring the velocity
   distribution along the canal and its changes with time. To this end, the
   proposed LLTC model could explain how a fish identifies the
   characteristics of a Karman vortex street shed by a nearby object or a
   traveling fish. It is also demonstrated that while this model captures
   the ac (alternating current) component of the external velocity signal,

Abstract = {{A position tracking control system is developed for a rotorcraft-based
   unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) using robust integral of the signum of
   the error (RISE) feedback and neural network (NN) feedforward terms.
   While the typical NN-based adaptive controller guarantees uniformly
   ultimately bounded stability, the proposed NN-based adaptive control
   system guarantees semi-global asymptotic tracking of the RUAV using the
   RISE feedback control. The developed control system consists of an
   inner-loop and outer-loop. The inner-loop control system determines the
   attitude of the RUAV based on an adaptive NN-based linear dynamic model
   inversion (LDI) method with the RISE feedback. The outer-loop control
   system generates the attitude reference corresponding to the given
   position, velocity, and heading references, and controls the altitude of
   the RUAV by the LDI method with the RISE feedback. The linear model for
   the LDI is obtained by a linearization of the nonlinear RUAV dynamics
   during hover flight. Asymptotic tracking of the attitude and altitude
   states is proven by a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, and a numerical
   simulation is performed on the nonlinear RUAV model to validate the
   effectiveness of the controller.}},

Abstract = {{Multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) and multiway partial least
   squares (MPLS) were applied to unfolded fermentation data, and compared
   for early recognition of problematic behavior in wine fermentations,
   such as late onset, slow or stuck (premature termination of
   fermentation). Information from 17 industrial wine fermentations
   (batches) were used, consisting of measured values for 32 variables,
   consisting of sugars, density, alcohols, organic acids and nitrogen
   compounds (including all amino acids). Curve smoothing and curve fitting
   techniques were applied as necessary pre-treatment of the data. Then,
   MPCA and MPLS were applied to four different data sets with different
   combinations of variables to identify the principal components
   responsible for the problematic behavior. Density, sugars, alcohols and
   selected organic acids were identified as the principal components. The
   MPCA application detected only 67\% of problematic batches in the data
   sets after 72 h into the fermentation process. Whereas, the MPLS
   application was able to predict all of the problematic batches (100\%)
   using the same variables and at the same time into the fermentation
   process. The ability to identify a problematic fermentation within 72 h
   can have significant economic impact on operating costs in a commercial

Title = {{Variable-Gap Conjugated Oligomers Grafted to CdSe Nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3143-3152}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Three linear asymmetrically functionalized conjugated molecules composed
   of five or six aromatic rings were synthesized, bearing a terminal
   phosphonic acid group, with the objective of enabling their grafting
   onto inorganic CdSe nanocrystals. These chromophores-oligo(phenylene
   ethynylenes), oligothiophenes, or donor acceptor donor oligothiophenes
   with a benzothiadiazole acceptor-were designed with decreasing HOMO-LUMO
   energy gaps such that increasing amounts of light could be absorbed
   toward the longer wavelengths up to 600 nm. Electrochemical measurements
   show that the energy offsets between the HOMO and LUMO energies of the
   organic molecules and the energy bands of the CdSe nanocrystals are
   well-suited for charge transfer between the organic and inorganic
   components. The characteristics of each component's excited state are
   studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and the interaction between the
   conjugated molecules and the CdSe nanocrystals in dilute solutions is
   monitored, by photoluminescence quenching. In the latter experiments,
   where ester and acid derivatives are compared, the pronounced difference
   in luminescence quenching supports the ability of the phosphonic acid
   groups to strongly anchor onto the surface of. the nanocrystals.
   Moreover, these results suggest that charge transfer likely occurs
   between the organic and the inorganic compounds, and appropriate ratios
   for the corresponding organic/inorganic hybrids preparation are
   identified. The preparation by direct ligand exchange and the
   photophysical properties of the hybrids are described, and spectroscopic
   analysis estimates that the nanocrystals are covered, on average, with
   100-200 electroactive organic molecules. The incident photon-to-electron
   conversion efficiency reflects the solution absorption of the hybrids
   because it shows the response from both organic and inorganic
   components.}},

   subsequent strokes in natural lightning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{X-ray emissions associated with leaders of natural cloud-to-ground
   lightning are examined. For 23 (8 first and 15 subsequent) strokes
   within 2 km of the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville, the occurrence
   of detectable X-rays was 88\% and 47\% for the first and subsequent
   strokes, respectively. Some subsequent-stroke leaders, retracing
   previously formed, low-density channels, are more prolific producers of
   detectable X-rays than their corresponding first-stroke leaders,
   developing in the virgin air. The energy of some photons was in the MeV
   range (in one case possibly in excess of 5 MeV); that is, in the
   gamma-ray range. There was a significant difference between first and
   subsequent leaders in terms of the distribution of estimated X-ray
   source heights. For first leaders, the maximum source height did not
   exceed 800 m, whereas for subsequent leaders the source height
   distribution appeared to extend to about 3.6 km. Not all leaders within
   a flash produced detectable X-rays. For the same leader near ground,
   some steps were accompanied by detectable X-ray emissions, while others
   were not. One possible explanation is that electric field enhancements
   (>30 MV/m or so for the case of normal air density), needed for the cold
   runaway breakdown, are very brief and highly localized, so that in many
   cases a sufficiently energetic electron from the tail of the bulk
   distribution may be unavailable to start the runaway process. This
   implies that the cold runaway breakdown is not a necessary feature of
   lightning leaders, even if the required fields do occur.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness

   Leachate from three different landfills was collected and characterized
   as stabilized leachate with a ratio of biochemical oxygen demand to
   chemical oxygen demand in the range of 0.02-0.11. Batch jar-tests were
   conducted to determine the effectiveness of FeCl3 and MIEX. A maximum
   reduction of 71\% and 34\% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 94\% and
   48\% UV-254 absorbing organic matter (OM) was observed using FeCl3 and
   MIEX. respectively. Effective doses of FeCl3 (22 mmol L-1) and MIEX (5
   mL L-1) were selected for leachate pretreatment before membrane
   operation. Batch RO and NF membrane experiments were conducted with raw
   and pretreated leachates to study the change in permeate flux for each
   type of membrane and leachate. Even though the pretreated leachate
   contained over 45\% less UV-254 absorbing OM than raw leachate, leachate
   pretreatment did not increase the permeate flux as compared to raw
   leachate during RO and NF membrane treatment. The potential cause of the
   decrease in permeate flux in pretreated leachate as compared to raw
   leachate was hypothesized as the change in characteristics of pretreated
   leachate and membrane surfaces caused by the continuous increase in pH
   of pretreated leachate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbe transmission via surfaces is a common mode for the spreading of
   infectious diseases. A simple way to combat disease transmission via
   surfaces is to apply antimicrobial coatings. We have developed a thin,
   transparent, photocatalytic coating for rapid destruction of microbes.
   The coating uses polyhydroxy fullerene (PHF) as an enhancer for nano
   TiO2 photocatalysis. A nanocomposite of PHF and TiO2 was synthesized
   through physical mixing of the two components in aqueous suspension. The
   nanocomposite was characterized by dynamic light scattering, zeta
   potential and Langmuir adsorption isotherm. A coating of the PHF/TiO2
   nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy.
   Photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite coating, as indicated by
   degradation of organic dye (Procion red MX-5B) under UVA illumination,
   was optimal at a PHF/TiO2 ratio of 0.01. The nanocomposite coating
   degraded the organic dye twice as fast as a coating of TiO2 that
   contained no PHF. The nanocomposite coating was then applied to
   photocatalytically inactivate spores of Aspergillus niger, a household
   fungus commonly implicated in asthma. The nanocomposite inactivated
   spores three times as fast as a coating of TiO2 containing no PHF.
   Changes to the morphology of A. niger spores due to photocatalysis were
   investigated using scanning electron microscopy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Little research has been conducted to investigate the fate and transport
   of colloids in shallow overland flow through dense vegetation under
   unfavorable chemical conditions. In this work, the single collector
   attachment efficiency (a) of colloid capture by a simulated plant stem
   (i.e., cylindrical collector) in laminar overland flow was measured
   directly in laboratory flow chamber experiments. Fluorescent
   microspheres of two sizes were used as experimental colloids. The
   colloid suspensions flowed toward a glass cylindrical rod installed in a
   small size flow channel at different laminar flow rates. Different
   solution ionic strengths (IS) were used in the experiments to simulate
   unfavorable attachment conditions. Our results showed that a increased
   with IS and decreased with flow velocity. Existing theoretical and
   empirical models of colloid attachment efficiency for porous media were
   used to simulate the experimental measurements in a and found to fall
   short in matching the experimental data. A new dimensionless
   (regression) equation was proposed that predicts the a of colloid
   capture by a cylindrical collector in laminar overland flow with
   reasonable accuracy. In addition, the equation was also effective in
   predicting the attachment efficiency of colloid deposition in porous

Abstract = {{The remarkable discovery of many large-scale real networks is the
   power-law distribution in degree sequence: the number of vertices with
   degree i is proportional to i(-beta) for some constant beta > 1. A lot
   of researchers believe that it may be easier to solve some optimization
   problems in power-law graphs. Unfortunately, many problems have been
   proved NP-hard even in power-law graphs. Intuitively, a theoretical
   question is raised: are these problems on power-law graphs still as hard
   as on general graphs?
   In this paper, we show that many optimal substructure problems, such as
   MINIMUM DOMINATING SET, MINIMUM VERTEX COVER and MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT
   SET, are easier to solve in power-law graphs by illustrating better
   inapproximability factors. An optimization problem has the property of
   optimal substructure if its optimal solution on some given graph is
   essentially the union of the optimal sub-solutions on all maximal
   connected components. In particular, we prove the above problems and a
   more general problem (rho-MINIMUM DOMINATING SET) remain APX-hard and
   their constant inapproximability factors on general power-law graphs by
   using the cycle-based embedding technique to embed any d-bounded graphs
   into a power-law graph. In addition, in simple power-law graphs, we
   further prove the corresponding inapproximability factors of these
   problems based on the graphic embedding technique as well as that of
   MAXIMUM CLIQUE and MINIMUM COLORING using the embedding technique in
   {[}1]. As a result of these inapproximability factors, the belief that
   there exists some (1 + o(1))-approximation algorithm for these problems
   on power-law graphs is proven to be not always true. At last, we do
   in-depth investigations in the relationship between the exponential
   factor beta and constant greedy approximation algorithms. (c) 2011

Title = {{Hydrogen peroxide modification enhances the ability of biochar
   (hydrochar) produced from hydrothermal carbonization of peanut hull to
   remove aqueous heavy metals: Batch and column tests}},

Abstract = {{Biochar converted from agricultural residues can be used as an
   alternative adsorbent for removal of aqueous heavy metals. In this work,
   experimental and modeling investigations were conducted to examine the
   effect of H2O2 treatment on hydrothermally produced biochar (hydrochar)
   from peanut hull to remove aqueous heavy metals. Characterization
   measurements showed that H2O2 modification increased the
   oxygen-containing functional groups, particularly carboxyl groups, on
   the hydrochar surfaces. As a result, the modified hydrochar showed
   enhanced lead sorption ability with a sorption capacity of 22.82 mg
   g(-1), which was comparable to that of commercial activated carbon and
   was more than 20 times of that of untreated hydrochar (0.88 mg g(-1)).
   When used as filter media in a packed column, the modified hydrochar was
   also much more effective in filtering lead than the unmodified one. The
   lead removal capacity of the modified hydrochar packed column was about
   20 times of that containing untreated hydrochar. In a multi-metal
   system, the modified hydrochar column still effectively removed lead, as
   well as other heavy metals (i.e., Cu2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+) from water flow.
   Model results indicated that the heavy metal removal ability of the
   modified hydrochar follows the order of Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+ > Ni2+.
   Findings from this work suggest that H2O2-modified hydrochar may be an
   effective, less costly, and environmentally sustainable adsorbent for
   many environmental applications, particularly with respect to metal
   immobilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A convenient and efficient deiodination polycondensation method for the

   N-Halosuccinimides, iodine, and bromine were evaluated as halogenating

   of 3,4-dioxypyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acids, which were then polymerized
   at 60 degrees C using dichloromethane or chloroform as solvent. When
   iodine and N-iodosuccinimide were employed as electrophilic halogen
   sources, the methodology produced macromolecules (M-n = 6.2-22.9 kDa) in
   satisfactory yields (55-71\%) for two
   N-alkyl-3,4-dialkyloxypyrrole-based monomers that were tested. This
   method can be employed to produce a variety of XDOP-based homopolymers
   and regioregular copolymers starting from discrete oligomers under

Title = {{Epistemic uncertainty in predicting shorebird biogeography affected by
   sea-level rise}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Accurate spatio-temporal predictions of land-cover are fundamentally
   important for assessing geomorphological and ecological patterns and
   processes. This study quantifies the epistemic uncertainty in the
   species distribution modeling, which is generated by spatio-temporal
   gaps between the biogeographical data, model selection and model
   complexity. Epistemic uncertainty is generally given by the sum of
   subjective and objective uncertainty. The subjective uncertainty
   generated by the modeler-choice in the manipulation of the environmental
   variables was analyzed. The Snowy Plover in Florida (Charadrius
   alexandrinus nivosus, SP), a residential shorebird whose geographic
   range is extended along the Panhandle-Big Bend-Peninsula Gulf coast was
   considered as case-study. The first fundamental step for studying the
   species distribution and how it will be affected by climate change is to
   obtain an accurate description of the shorebird coastal habitat. The
   land-cover was translated into ecosystem classes using a land-cover
   model that predicts the evolution of coastal ecosystems affected by
   sea-level rise scenarios. The best land-cover map decreased the
   objective uncertainty (intrinsically present in data or models) in
   representing the spatial structure of the coastal ecosystem, reduced the
   temporal gaps with the occurrence data, and diminished the subjective
   uncertainty due to the conversion from land-cover to model-classes.
   Multimodeling was performed to reduce the uncertainty in the prediction
   of the species distribution related to model uncertainty. The best
   representation of the species distribution was performed by MAXENT. The
   area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the
   omission/commission test, the similarity index of the response curves,
   and the jackknife test were used simultaneously as indicators of the
   predictability of each species distribution model. The availability of
   updated high-resolution biogeoclimatological data was proven to be
   necessary in order to properly predict the species ranges for
   conservation purposes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively high rates of loosening and implant failure have been
   reported after total ankle arthroplasty. Abnormal kinematics and
   incongruency of the articular surface may cause increased contact
   pressure and rotational torque applied to the implant, leading to
   loosening and implant failure. We measured in vivo kinematics of
   two-component total ankle arthroplasty (TNK ankle), and assessed
   congruency of the articular surface during the stance phase of gait.
   Eighteen ankles of 15 patients with a mean age of 75 +/- 6 years (mean
   +/- standard deviation) and follow-up of 44 +/- 38 months were enrolled.
   Lateral fluoroscopic images were taken during the stance phase of gait.
   3D-2D model-image registration was performed using the fluoroscopic
   image and the implant models, and three-dimensional kinematics of the
   implant and incongruency of the articular surface were determined. The
   mean ranges of motion were 11.1 +/- 4.6 degrees, 0.8 +/- 0.4 degrees,
   and 2.6 +/- 1.5 degrees for dorsi-/plantarflexion, inversion/eversion,
   and internal/external rotation, respectively. At least one type of
   incongruency of the articular surface occurred in eight of 18 ankles,
   including anterior hinging in one ankle, medial or lateral lift off in
   four ankles, and excessive axial rotation in five ankles. Among the four
   ankles in which lift off occurred during gait, only one ankle showed
   lift off in the static weightbearing radiograph. Our observations will
   provide useful data against which kinematics of other implant designs,
   such as three-component total ankle arthroplasty, can be compared. Our
   results also showed that evaluation of lift off in the standard
   weightbearing radiograph may not predict its occurrence during gait. (C)

Abstract = {{Conventional organic light emitting devices have a bottom buffer
   interlayer placed underneath the hole transporting layer (HTL) to
   improve hole injection from the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. In
   this work, a substantial enhancement in hole injection efficiency is
   demonstrated when an electron accepting interlayer is evaporated on top
   of the HTL in an inverted device along with a top hole injection anode
   compared with the conventional device with a bottom hole injection
   anode. Currentvoltage and space-charge-limited dark injection (DI-SCLC)
   measurements were used to characterize the conventional and inverted
   N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis(1-naphthyl)(1,1'biphenyl)-4,4'diamine (NPB)
   hole-only devices with either molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) or
   1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) as the
   interlayer. Both normal and inverted devices with HAT-CN showed
   significantly higher injection efficiencies compared to similar devices
   with MoO3, with the inverted device with HAT-CN as the interlayer
   showing a hole injection efficiency close to 100\%. The results from
   doping NPB with MoO3 or HAT-CN confirmed that the injection efficiency
   enhancements in the inverted devices were due to the enhanced charge
   transfer at the electron acceptor/NPB interface.}},

Abstract = {{Culturomics was recently introduced as the application of
   high-throughput data collection and analysis to the study of human
   culture. Here, we make use of these data by investigating fluctuations
   in yearly usage frequencies of specific words that describe social and
   natural phenomena, as derived from books that were published over the
   course of the past two centuries. We show that the determination of the
   Hurst parameter by means of fractal analysis provides fundamental
   insights into the nature of long-range correlations contained in the
   culturomic trajectories, and by doing so offers new interpretations as
   to what might be the main driving forces behind the examined phenomena.
   Quite remarkably, we find that social and natural phenomena are governed
   by fundamentally different processes. While natural phenomena have
   properties that are typical for processes with persistent long-range
   correlations, social phenomena are better described as non-stationary,
   on-off intermittent or Levy walk processes.}},

Abstract = {{Solid solutions of NdxCe1-xO2-delta(0.05 <= x <= 055) are prepared via
   solid-state reactions and the grain ionic conductivity is measured using
   a two-probe ac impedance spectroscopy technique. The lattice parameters
   increased linearly with Nd content for 0.05 <= x <= 0.45. Both XRD and
   neutron diffraction analyses indicate at x = 0.50 the highly defective
   fluorite stabilizes into a C-type rare earth oxide structure with an
   associated doubling of the unit cell. The conductivity of the compounds
   follows an Arrhenius-type behavior showing a maximum conductivity of
   0.054(1)S cm(-1) for Nd0.15Ce0.85O1.925 at 700 degrees C with an
   associated activation energy of 0.726(5) eV. The activation energy
   increases significantly during the phase transition from 35\% to 40\% Nd
   due to the stabilization of oxygen vacancies. The pre-exponential factor
   increased as well, resulting in an effective gradual decrease of
   conductivity across the phase transition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{472-490}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Mesh independent analysis is motivated by the desire to use accurate
   geometric models represented as equations rather than approximated by a
   mesh. The trial and test functions are approximated or interpolated on a
   background mesh that is independent of the geometry. This background
   mesh is easy to generate because it does not have to conform to the
   geometry. Essential boundary conditions can be applied using the
   implicit boundary method where the trial and test functions are
   constructed utilizing approximate step functions such that the boundary
   conditions are guaranteed to be satisfied. This approach has been
   demonstrated for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
   structural analysis and is extended in this paper to model shell-like
   structures. The background mesh consists of 3D elements that use uniform
   B-spline approximations, and the shell geometry is assumed to be defined
   as parametric surfaces to allow arbitrarily complex shell-like
   structures to be modeled. Several benchmark problems are used to study
   the validity of these 3D B-spline shell elements. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{A variable charge reactive empirical potential for carbon-based
   materials, hydrocarbons, organometallics, and their interfaces is
   developed within the framework of charge optimized many-body (COMB)
   potentials. The resulting potential contains improved expressions for
   the bond order and self-energy, which gives a flexible, robust, and
   integrated treatment of different bond types in multicomponent and
   multifunctional systems. It furthermore captures the dissociation and
   formation of the chemical bonds and appropriately and dynamically
   determines the associated charge transfer, thus providing a powerful
   method to simulate the complex chemistry of many-atom systems in
   changing environments. The resulting COMB potential is used in a
   classical molecular dynamics simulation of the room temperature, low
   energy deposition of ethyl radicals on the Cu (111) surface (a system
   with similar to 5000 atoms) to demonstrate its capabilities at
   describing organic-metal interactions in a dynamically changing

Abstract = {{Self-diffusion and related short-time dynamic and structural properties

   {[}bmim](+){[}Tf2N](-) for a broad range of carbon dioxide molar
   fractions and at different temperatures. The studies were performed by a
   novel multinuclear pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR technique, which
   combines the advantages of a high magnetic field (17.6 T) and a high
   magnetic field gradient (up to 30 T/m), in combination with molecular
   dynamics simulations. In general, a satisfactory agreement was observed
   between the experimental and simulation diffusion data. Under all
   conditions examined, the self-diffusion coefficients of carbon dioxide
   were found to be approximately an order of magnitude larger than the
   corresponding self-diffusion coefficients of the ions. It was observed
   that an increase in temperature and in the amount of carbon dioxide in
   the ionic liquid led to an increase in the ion self-diffusivities
   without changing the relationship between the self-diffusion
   coefficients of the cations and anions. An observation of a slightly
   higher diffusivity of the cations in comparison to that of the anions is
   attributed to the preferential mobility of the cations in the direction
   of the ring plane. The diffusion activation energies of the ions were
   found to decrease gradually with an increase of the carbon dioxide
   content in the ionic liquid. The activation energy of the carbon dioxide
   diffusion in all cases was found to be smaller than those of the ions.}},

Abstract = {{Energetic radiation is known to be produced by lightning. To investigate
   these emissions, ground-based observations are being conducted at the
   International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp
   Blanding, FL where measurements of energetic radiation from both natural
   and rocket-triggered lightning discharges are recorded. In the present
   study, data from two natural negative cloud-to-ground stepped leaders
   and one rocket-triggered ``chaotic{''} dart leader are analyzed in
   detail to investigate X-ray energy spectra and spatial X-ray
   distributions around the source. These measurements are compared with
   Monte Carlo simulations of runaway electron propagation with the goal of
   understanding the underlying mechanism of runaway electron production
   and their role in lightning initiation and propagation. We show that the
   energetic electrons that produce X-rays exhibit a characteristic energy
   less than 3 MeV for two natural and one rocket-triggered leaders
   investigated. In addition to studying these three leaders, energetic
   electron luminosity, total energy, and energetic electron per meter are
   compared to the following return stroke currents for 28 leaders from 12
   different triggered flashes. Electron luminosity is found to increase
   exponentially with return stroke current up to about 10 kA and to be
   roughly constant for larger currents. The maximum electron luminosity,
   which is determined indirectly through X-ray luminosities, is on the
   order of 10(17) electrons/s, which is less than the value found from
   theoretical calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of lightning channel tortuosity and tilt on lightning electric
   fields and voltages induced on overhead conductors are examined. Overall
   inclination of the bottom few hundred meters of the lightning channel
   can appreciably change both the ground-level vertical electric field at
   distances less than 1 km or so and induced voltage peak relative to the
   vertical-channel assumption. Smaller-scale tortuosity is responsible for
   the fine structure of field and induced voltage waveforms. This fine
   structure can be pronounced at some hundreds of meters and beyond, but
   is insignificant at shorter ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy is a rapidly growing source of renewable energy generation.
   However, the current extra-market approach to its assimilation into the
   electric grid will not scale at deep penetration levels. In this paper,
   we investigate how an independent wind power producer might optimally
   offer its variable power into a competitive electricity market for
   energy. Starting with a stochastic model for wind power production and a
   model for a perfectly competitive two-settlement market, we derive
   explicit formulae for optimal contract offerings and the corresponding
   optimal expected profit. As wind is an inherently variable source of
   energy, we explore the sensitivity of optimal expected profit to
   uncertainty in the underlying wind process. We also examine the role of
   forecast information and recourse markets in this setting. We quantify
   the role of reserves in increasing reliability of offered contracts and
   obtain analytical expressions for marginal profits resulting from
   investments in improved forecasting and local auxiliary generation. The
   formulae make explicit the relationship between price signals and the
   value of such firming strategies.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance computing systems increasingly combine multi-core
   processors and heterogeneous resources such as graphics-processing units
   and field-programmable gate arrays. However, significant application
   design complexity for such systems has often led to untapped performance
   potential. Application designers targeting such systems currently must
   determine how to parallelize computation, create device-specialized
   implementations for each heterogeneous resource, and determine how to
   partition work for each resource. In this paper, we present the RACECAR
   heuristic to automate the optimization of applications for multi-core
   heterogeneous systems by automatically exploring implementation
   alternatives that include different algorithms, parallelization
   strategies, and work distributions. Experimental results show
   RACECAR-specialized implementations achieve speedups up to 117x and
   average 11x compared to a single CPU thread when parallelizing
   computation across multiple cores, graphics-processing units, and
   field-programmable gate arrays.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the mixture of
   experts (ME). We discuss the fundamental models for regression and
   classification and also their training with the expectation-maximization
   algorithm. We follow the discussion with improvements to the ME model
   and focus particularly on the mixtures of Gaussian process experts. We
   provide a review of the literature for other training methods, such as
   the alternative localized ME training, and cover the variational
   learning of ME in detail. In addition, we describe the model selection
   literature which encompasses finding the optimum number of experts, as
   well as the depth of the tree. We present the advances in ME in the
   classification area and present some issues concerning the
   classification model. We list the statistical properties of ME, discuss
   how the model has been modified over the years, compare ME to some
   popular algorithms, and list several applications. We conclude our
   survey with future directions and provide a list of publicly available
   datasets and a list of publicly available software that implement ME.
   Finally, we provide examples for regression and classification. We
   believe that the study described in this paper will provide quick access
   to the relevant literature for researchers and practitioners who would
   like to improve or use ME, and that it will stimulate further studies in
   ME.}},

Abstract = {{The process dependence of 1/f noise in p-type piezoresistors was
   investigated in this work using both electrical and materials
   characterization approaches. P-type piezoresistors were fabricated with
   20 keV and 40 keV boron implants with and without implant oxide and
   varying isochronal 900 degrees C inert anneals. The devices were
   characterized electrically using I-V, Hall Effect, and power spectral
   density (PSD) noise measurements. The defects were visualized using
   cross-section transmission electron microscopy and plane view TEM The
   measured 1/f noise PSDs in the p-type piezoresistors are systematically
   compared to the number and dimension of bulk defect densities measured
   with TEM after each annealing condition of the piezoresistors. The 1/f
   noise PSDs of the piezoresistors implanted with 20 keV boron track the
   TEM defect number densities while those implanted with 40 keV boron
   through SiO2 with inert and oxidizing anneals track the faulted loop

   Response to Temperature}},
Journal = {{HORTSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Parameterizing crop models for more accurate response to climate factors
   such as temperature is important considering potential temperature
   increases associated with climate change, particularly for tomato
   (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), which is a heat-sensitive crop. The
   objective of this work was to update the cardinal temperature parameters
   of the CROPGRO-Tomato model affecting the simulation of crop
   development, daily dry matter (DM) production, fruit set, and DM
   partitioning of field-grown tomato from transplanting to harvest. The
   main adaptation relied on new literature values for cardinal temperature
   parameters that affect tomato crop phenology, fruit set, and fruit
   growth. The new cardinal temperature values are considered reliable
   because they come from recent published experiments conducted in
   controlled-temperature environments. Use of the new cardinal
   temperatures in the CROPGRO-Tomato model affected the rate of crop
   development compared with prior default parameters; thus, we found it
   necessary to recalibrate genetic coefficients that affect life cycle
   phases and growth simulated by the model. The model was recalibrated and
   evaluated with 10 growth analyses data sets collected in field
   experiments conducted at three locations in Florida (Bradenton, Quincy,
   and Gainesville) from 1991 to 2007. Use of modified parameters
   sufficiently improved model performance to provide accurate prediction
   of crop and fruit DM accumulation throughout the season. Overall, the
   average root mean square error (RMSE) over all experiments was reduced
   44\% for leaf area index, 71\% for fruit number, and 36\% for both
   aboveground biomass and fruit dry weight simulations with the modified
   parameters compared with the default. The Willmott d index was higher
   and was always above 0.92. The CROPGRO-Tomato model with these modified
   cardinal temperature parameters will predict more accurately tomato
   growth and yield response to temperature and thus be useful in model
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Urban water quality management is becoming an increasingly complex and
   widespread problem. The long-term viability of aquatic ecosystems
   draining urban watersheds can be addressed through both regulatory and
   nutrient and water management initiatives. This review focuses on U.S.
   regulatory (federal, state, and local) and management (runoff,
   atmospheric deposition, and wastewater) impacts on urban water quality,
   specifically emphasizing programs in Florida. Because of rapid
   population growth in recent decades, and projected increases in the
   future, appropriate resource management in Florida is essential. Florida
   enacted stormwater regulations in 1979, before the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (USEPA) amended the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate
   stormwater discharges. However, in the United States, more research has
   been conducted on larger structural best management practices (BMPs)
   (e.g., wet ponds, detention basins, etc.) compared with smaller onsite
   alternatives (e.g., green roofs, permeable pavements, etc.). For
   atmospheric deposition, research is needed to investigate processes
   contributing to enhanced deposition rates. Wastewater (from septic
   systems, treatment plants, and landfills) management is especially
   important in urban watersheds. Failing septic systems, elevated nutrient
   concentrations in discharged effluent, and landfill leachate can all
   potentially degrade water quality. Proposed numeric nutrient criteria
   from the USEPA and innovative technologies such as bioreactor landfills
   are emergent regulatory and management strategies for improved urban
   water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Network capacity investigation has been intensive in the past few years.
   A large body of work on wireless network capacity has appeared in the
   literature. However, so far most of the effort has been made on
   two-dimensional (2-D) wireless networks only. With the great development
   of wireless technologies, wireless networks are envisioned to extend
   from 2-D space to three-dimensional (3-D) space. In this paper, we
   investigate the throughput capacity of 3-D regular ad hoc networks
   (RANETs) and of 3-D nonhomogeneous ad hoc networks (NANETs),
   respectively, by employing a generalized physical model. In 3-D RANETs,
   we assume that the nodes are regularly placed, while in 3-D NANETs, we
   consider that the nodes are distributed according to a general
   Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NPP). We find both lower and upper
   bounds in both types of networks in a broad power propagation regime,
   i.e., when the path loss exponent is no less than 2.}},

   typical H-2 densities, but protons can dominate at high H-2 densities.
   The rate of the interface trap reaction, in which protons that are

Abstract = {{The carboxylic acid proton and the lithium coordination environments for
   precise and random Li-neutralized polyethylene acrylic acid P(E-AA)
   ionomers were explored using high speed solid-state H-1 and Li-7 MAS
   NMR. While the Li-7 NMR revealed only a single Li coordination
   environment, the chemical shift temperature variation was dependent on
   the precise or random nature of the P(E-AA) ionomer. The H-1 MAS NMR
   revealed two different carboxylic acid proton environments in these
   materials. By utilizing H-1-Li-7 rotational echo double resonance
   (REDOR) MAS NMR experiments, it was demonstrated that the proton
   environments correspond to different average H-1-Li-7 distances, with
   the majority of the protonated carboxylic acids having a close through
   space contact with the Li. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that
   the shortest H-1-Li-7 distance corresponds to un-neutralized carboxylic
   acids directly involved in the coordination environment of Li clusters.
   These solid-state NMR results show that heterogeneous structural motifs
   need to be included when developing descriptions of these ionomer
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Although respirators and filters are designed to prevent the spread of
   pathogenic aerosols, a stockpile shortage is anticipated during the next
   flu pandemic. Contact transfer and reaerosolization of collected
   microbes from used respirators are also a concern. An option to address
   these potential problems is UV irradiation, which inactivates microbes
   by dimerizing thymine/uracil in nucleic acids. The objective of this
   study was to determine the effects of transmission mode and
   environmental conditions on decontamination efficiency by UV. In this
   study, filters were contaminated by different transmission pathways
   (droplet and aerosol) using three spraying media (deionized water
   {[}DI], beef extract {[}BE], and artificial saliva {[}AS]) under
   different humidity levels (30\% {[}low relative humidity \{LRH\}], 60\%
   {[}MRH], and 90\% {[}HRH]). UV irradiation at constant intensity was
   applied for two time intervals at each relative humidity condition. The
   highest inactivation efficiency (IE), around 5.8 logs, was seen for DI
   aerosols containing MS2 on filters at LRH after applying a UV intensity
   of 1.0 mW/cm(2) for 30 min. The IE of droplets containing MS2 was lower
   than that of aerosols containing MS2. Absorption of UV by high water
   content and shielding of viruses near the center of the aggregate are
   considered responsible for this trend. Across the different media, IEs
   in AS and in BE were much lower than in DI for both aerosol and droplet
   transmission, indicating that solids present in AS and BE exhibited a
   protective effect. For particles sprayed in a protective medium, RH is
   not a significant parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Elemental enrichment behavior on the surface of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3
   (LSCF) was investigated in order to understand potential degradation
   mechanism of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes. Surface morphological
   changes were examined using scanning electron microscopy after heat
   treatment in the temperature range of 600-900 degrees C. Submicron-sized
   precipitates were formed on grain surfaces after heat treatment. Their
   shapes appeared to be aligned along the surface orientations of the
   underlying grains. Auger electron spectroscopy and transmission electron
   microscopy characterization revealed that the precipitate was strontium
   (Sr)-oxygen (O) based. The formation of Sr-O precipitates was found to
   increase with increasing temperature and oxygen partial pressure. A
   defect chemistry model is presented based on the observed phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Emission factors (EFs) for hazardous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs), carbonyls, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as well as
   other species such as PM2.5, elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC),
   and tracer compounds (e.g., levoglucosan (LG) and other sugars) were
   investigated for sugarcane pre-harvest burning in Florida. A combustion
   chamber was used to simulate field burning conditions for determining
   EFs of both dry leaf and whole stalk biomass burning. Samples were
   collected from the chamber's exhaust duct following EPA sampling
   methods. The total PAH EFs were 7.13 +/- 0.94 and 8.18 +/- 3.26 mg
   kg(-1) for dry leaf and whole sugarcane stalk burning, respectively.
   Carbonyl EFs were 201 +/- 39 and 942 +/- 539 mg kg(-1) for dry leaf and
   whole stalk burning, respectively. PAH and carbonyl emissions were
   dominated by lower molecular weight compounds (e.g., naphthalene and
   formaldehyde, respectively). Of the aromatic VOCs studied, benzene was
   the predominant species. The PM2.5 EF was 2.49 +/- 0.66 g kg(-1), which
   is in range of the current published AP-42 EFs for particulate matter
   emissions from sugarcane burning and other sugarcane studies. The OC, EC
   and LG EFs were 0.16 +/- 0.09 g kg(-1), 0.71 +/- 0.22 g kg(-1), and 7.87
   +/- 5.42 mg kg(-1), respectively. EFs of gaseous pollutants were
   generally lower than EFs from studies of agricultural residue
   combustion, likely due to the high combustion efficiency observed in
   this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Barium titanate-20wt\% cobalt ferrite (BaTiO3-20wt\%CoFe2O4)
   nanocomposites were sintered from nanocrystalline BaTiO3 and CoFe2O4
   powders using spark plasma sintering (SPS) and pressureless sintering
   (PS) techniques. Using SPS, dense polycrystalline composites were
   obtained at a sintering temperature as low as 860 degrees C and a time
   of 5 similar to min whereas PS required a higher sintering temperature
   (1150 degrees C) and time (120 similar to min) to obtain similarly dense
   composites. Microstructural analysis of the composites showed that both
   the techniques retained nanocrystalline grain sizes after sintering.
   High resolution X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the
   BaTiO3-20wt\%CoFe2O4 composites sintered by the SPS technique did not
   exhibit formation of any new phase(s) due to reaction between the BaTiO3
   and CoFe2O4 phases during sintering. However, the PS technique resulted
   in the formation of additional phases (other than the BaTiO3 and CoFe2O4
   phases) in the composites. While the composites synthesized by SPS were
   of superior phase-purity, evidence of Fe diffusion from the spinel to
   the perovskite phase was found from X-ray diffraction and permittivity
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleation, texture development, and phase equilibria were observed
   during templated grain growth (TGG) of (Na0.5K0.5)0.98Li0.02NbO3 (NKLN)
   via in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). Initially, NaNbO3 templates and
   NKLN matrix powder exist as distinct phases with unique lattice
   parameters. Above 850 degrees C, the templates and matrix begin to react
   via interdiffusion as characterized by an increase in diffuse scattering
   between the NaNbO3 and NKLN peaks. This process intensifies immediately
   prior to template growth, leading to merging of diffraction peaks for
   these two phases. TGG in this system is thus homoepitaxial in nature as
   it occurs after the NKLN matrix and NaNbO3 templates form a solid
   solution. The degree of alignment in the matrix phase is quantified in
   situ using the MarchDollase parameters r and f. The degree of
   orientation of the textured NKLN mirrors the initial alignment of the
   template particles (r similar to 0.3), while the texture fraction f
   increases from 0.04 to similar to 0.67 after 3 similar to h at 1138
   degrees C. This increase in texture fraction follows n similar
   to=similar to 1/3 power law kinetics consistent with
   liquid-phase-assisted normal grain growth on plate-like templates. As
   the observed templatematrix interdiffusion and the onset of texture
   development proceed extremely rapidly, this work demonstrates the
   utility of in situ XRD for observing details of TGG that cannot easily
   be seen via ex situ methods.}},

Abstract = {{Due to power limitations and escalating cooling costs, high-performance
   computing systems can no longer rely solely on faster clock frequencies
   and numerous microprocessor nodes to meet increasing performance
   demands. As an alternative approach, high-performance systems are
   increasingly integrating multi-core processors and heterogeneous
   accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs. However, usage of such hybrid
   systems has been limited largely to device experts due to significantly
   increased application design complexity. To enable more transparent
   usage of hybrid systems, we introduce elastic computing, which is an
   optimization framework where application designers invoke specialized
   elastic functions that contain a knowledge-base of implementation
   alternatives and parallelization strategies. For each elastic function,
   a collection of optimization tools analyze numerous possible
   implementations which enables dynamic and transparent optimization for
   different resources and run-time parameters. In this paper, we present
   the enabling technologies of elastic computing, and evaluate those
   technologies on four different hybrid systems, including the Novo-G FPGA
   supercomputer. The results include detailed case studies of using
   elastic computing for time-domain convolution and sum of absolute
   difference image retrieval, which achieved speedups up to 206x. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The reaction pathways and phase evolution during synthesis of CuInSe2
   (CIS) by a novel bilayer approach were investigated using in situ
   high-temperature X-ray diffraction. Two bilayer precursor structures,
   glass/Mo/?-In2Se3/beta-CuSe?+?beta-Cu2Se/Se and
   glass/Mo/gamma-In2Se3/beta-Cu2Se/Se, were examined in this study.
   Temperature ramp experiments revealed that the phase transformation
   sequence for each bilayer precursor qualitatively follows that predicted
   by the phase diagram and that the onset temperatures for decomposition
   of the sub-binary compounds depend on the Se partial pressure.
   Measurement of the isothermal rate of formation of CuInSe2 at six
   temperatures in the range 260 to 310?degrees C for the
   gamma-In2Se3/beta-CuSe?+?beta-Cu2Se/Se bilayer suggests relatively slow
   nucleation followed by diffusion-limited reaction with estimated
   activation energy of 162(+/- 7) and 225 (+/- 16)?kJ/mol from Avrami and
   parabolic models, respectively. Interestingly, the measured activation
   energy for the same precursor in a 4?mol \% H2/He ambient (108 (+/-
   8)?kJ/mol) was lower than that observed in pure N2 (158 (+/-
   16)?kJ/mol). The results of isothermal measurements in the temperature
   range 250 to 300?degrees C for the gamma-In2Se3/beta-Cu2Se/Se precursor
   film in an inert ambient are consistent with one-dimensional
   diffusion-limited growth with estimated activation energy from the

Abstract = {{B-splines are attractive basis functions for the continuous-domain
   representation of biomedical images and volumes. In this paper, we prove
   that the extended family of box splines are closed under the Radon
   transform and derive explicit formulae for their transforms. Our results
   are general; they cover all known brands of compactly-supported box
   splines (tensor-product B-splines, separable or not) in any number of
   dimensions. The proposed box spline approach extends to non-Cartesian
   lattices used for discretizing the image space. In particular, we prove
   that the 2-D Radon transform of an N-direction box spline is generally a
   (nonuniform) polynomial spline of degree N - 1. The proposed framework
   allows for a proper discretization of a variety of tomographic
   reconstruction problems in a box spline basis. It is of relevance for
   imaging modalities such as X-ray computed tomography and cryo-electron
   microscopy. We provide experimental results that demonstrate the
   practical advantages of the box spline formulation for improving the
   quality and efficiency of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Infusate backflow or leak-back along the cannula track can occur during
   intraparenchymal infusions resulting in non-specific targeting of
   therapeutic agents. The occurrence of backflow depends on several
   variables including cannula radius, infusate flow rate, and tip
   location. In this study, polymer coatings that swell in situ were
   developed and tested with in vitro hydrogel experiments for backflow
   reduction. Coatings were applied to the external cannula surface in a
   dual layer arrangement with a poly(vinyl alcohol) outer layer atop an
   inner poly(ethylene oxide) and alginate layer. Once these coated
   cannulas were inserted and allotted an 8-10 min waiting period for
   hydration, backflow during infusions of 4.0 mu l of a macromolecular
   tracer (Evans Blue labeled albumin) was reduced significantly under flow
   rates of 0.3-0.6 mu l/min, allowing for more effective distribution
   within targeted regions. Polymer coating thicknesses before and after
   hydrations were 0.035 and 0.370 mm, respectively. Also, backflow data
   was fit to a model to estimate the effective local compressive stress
   caused by the hydrated polymers. After withdrawal of the cannula from
   the insertion site, the hydrated polymer coatings remained within the
   cavity left in the hydrogel tissue phantom and formed a seal at the
   infusion site that prevented further backflow during needle withdrawal.
   Ex vivo infusions in excised porcine brain tissues also showed
   significant backflow reduction while also demonstrating the ability to
   leave a polymer seal in the tissue cavity after cannula removal. Thus,
   application of these polymers as needle or cannula coatings offers a
   potentially simple method to improve targeting for local drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Steady increases in healthcare costs and obesity have inspired recent
   studies into cost-effective, assistive systems capable of monitoring
   dietary habits. Few researchers, though, have investigated the use of
   video as a means of monitoring dietary activities. Video possesses
   several inherent qualities, such as passive acquisition, that merits its
   analysis as an input modality for such an application. To this end, we
   propose a method to automatically detect chewing events in surveillance
   video of a subject. Firstly, an Active Appearance Model (AAM) is used to
   track a subject's face across the video sequence. It is observed that
   the variations in the AAM parameters across chewing events demonstrate a
   distinct periodicity. We utilize this property to discriminate between
   chewing and non-chewing facial actions such as talking. A feature
   representation is constructed by applying spectral analysis to a
   temporal window of model parameter values. The estimated power spectra
   subsequently undergo non-linear dimensionality reduction. The
   low-dimensional embedding of the power spectra are employed to train a
   binary Support Vector Machine classifier to detect chewing events. To
   emulate the gradual onset and offset of chewing, smoothness is imposed
   over the class predictions of neighboring video frames in order to deter
   abrupt changes in the class labels. Experiments are conducted on a
   dataset consisting of 37 subjects performing each of five actions,
   namely, open- and closed-mouth chewing, clutter faces, talking, and
   still face. Experimental results yielded a cross-validated percentage
   agreement of 93.0\%, indicating that the proposed system provides an
   efficient approach to automated chewing detection.}},

Abstract = {{Our research evaluated current cone penetration test (CPT) pile design
   methodologies (Schmertmann, Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussees

   accomplished by evaluating 14 pile-capacity-design methods based on CPT
   data. Furthermore, load and resistance factor design (LRFD) resistance
   factors for each method were calculated using 21 cases from Florida and
   28 from Louisiana. The resulting resistance factors were not
   satisfactory for any of these methods. A new design method - the
   University of Florida (UF) method - was proposed taking into account
   cementation, soil type, and historical data. The LRFD resistance factor
   was also assessed for this new method. The proposed UF method provides
   better LRFD resistance factors for both Florida and Louisiana soils. It
   could be a promising alternative for improving pile design.}},

Abstract = {{A novel forensic tool used for assessing the authenticity of digital
   audio recordings is known as the electric network frequency (ENF)
   criterion. It involves extracting the embedded power line (utility)
   frequency from said recordings and matching it to a known database to
   verify the time the recording was made, and its authenticity. In this
   paper, a nonparametric, adaptive, and high resolution technique, known
   as the time-recursive iterative adaptive approach, is presented as a
   tool for the extraction of the ENF from digital audio recordings. A
   comparison is made between this data dependent (adaptive) filter and the
   conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Results show that the
   adaptive algorithm improves the ENF estimation accuracy in the presence
   of interference from other signals. To further enhance the ENF
   estimation accuracy, a frequency tracking method based on dynamic
   programming will be proposed. The algorithm uses the knowledge that the
   ENF is varying slowly with time to estimate with high accuracy the
   frequency present in the recording.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal communities in the southeast United States have regularly
   experienced severe hurricane impacts. To better facilitate recovery
   efforts in these communities following natural disasters, state and
   federal agencies must respond quickly with information regarding the
   extent and severity of hurricane damage and the amount of tree debris
   volume. A tool was developed to detect downed trees and debris volume to
   better aid disaster response efforts and tree debris removal. The tool
   estimates downed tree debris volume in hurricane affected urban areas
   using a Leica Airborne Digital Sensor (ADS40) and very high resolution
   digital images. The tool employs a Sobel edge detection algorithm
   combined with spectral information based on color filtering using 15
   different statistical combinations of spectral bands. The algorithm
   identified downed tree edges based on contrasts between tree stems,
   grass, and asphalt and color filtering was then used to establish
   threshold values. Colors outside these threshold values were replaced
   and excluded from the detection processes. Results were overlaid and an
   ``edge line{''} was placed where lines or edges from longer consecutive
   segments and color values within the threshold were met. Where two lines
   were paired within a very short distance in the scene a polygon was
   drawn automatically and, in doing so, downed tree stems were detected.
   Tree stem diameter-volume bulking factors were used to estimate
   post-hurricane tree debris volumes. Images following Hurricane Ivan in
   2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008 were used to assess the error of the tool
   by comparing downed tree counts and subsequent debris volume estimates
   with post-hurricane photo-interpreted downed tree counts and actual
   field measured estimates of downed tree debris volume. The errors
   associated with the use of the tool and potential applications are also
   presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel extended kernel recursive least squares algorithm
   is proposed combining the kernel recursive least squares algorithm and
   the Kalman filter or its extensions to estimate or predict signals.
   Unlike the extended kernel recursive least squares (Ex-KRLS) algorithm
   proposed by Liu, the state model of our algorithm is still constructed
   in the original state space and the hidden state is estimated using the
   Kalman filter. The measurement model used in hidden state estimation is
   learned by the kernel recursive least squares algorithm (KRLS) in
   reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The novel algorithm has more
   flexible state and noise models. We apply this algorithm to vehicle
   tracking and the nonlinear Rayleigh fading channel tracking, and compare
   the tracking performances with other existing algorithms. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Cu/ZnO heterogeneous systems are used to catalyze the CO2 hydrogenation
   to methanol, but questions remain about the nature of the active site
   and the role of Cu-ZnO interactions in the catalyst performance. The way
   in which ZnO surfaces support Cu clusters and stabilize their active
   sites is a key factor for maintaining catalyst activity. Processes such
   as sintering, alloying and encapsulation may play an important role in
   the activity of the catalyst but are difficult to model directly with
   density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we report the development
   of charge-optimized many-body (COMB) potentials to model the Cu/ZnO
   system. This potential is then used in conjugation with the dimer
   method, which uses the first derivative of the potential energy and the
   initial state of the transition to find saddle points, to examine the
   migration barriers of Cu adatoms on Cu and ZnO surfaces. These findings
   are validated against the results of density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations and published experimental data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Lane-changing behavior has received increasing attention during the
   recent years in traffic flow modeling. Researchers have developed
   various algorithms to model the maneuvers on both highways and urban
   streets. However, the majority of these models was derived and validated
   using data such as vehicle trajectories, without many considerations of
   driver characteristics. In this study, an instrumented vehicle-based
   experiment was carefully designed to observe the drivers action under
   various urban lane-changing scenarios. The personal background data, and
   in-vehicle driver behavior and trajectory data were obtained from the
   experiment, and used to classify 40 drivers into four general groups
   according to the lane-changing maneuvers performed in an urban street
   environment. Additional comparisons and analysis were conducted to
   confirm the categorization results. The article concludes by providing
   recommendations related to the implementation of study findings into
   micro-simulators, such as using only four driver types in CORSIM instead
   of the existing 10 types, to better replicate driver behavior in urban
   street networks.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium has recently received an increased amount of interest due to
   its potential use in biodegradable implant applications. The rapid
   degradation of conventional Mg is, however, a major limitation that
   needs to be addressed in the design of these materials, along with
   consideration of toxicity in selection of alloying elements. In this
   study, five alloys in the Mg-xCa-ySr system (x = 0.57.0 wt \%; y =
   0.53.5 wt \%) were prepared and characterized for their suitability as
   degradable orthopedic implant materials. The alloys were characterized
   using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, degradation
   measurements in Hanks' solution at 37 degrees C, compression testing,
   and in vitro cytotoxicity testing with a mouse osteoblastic cell line.
   The results indicate that the Mg-1.0Ca-0.5Sr alloy is the most promising
   alloy for orthopedic implant applications since it showed the lowest
   degradation rate in Hanks' solution (0.01 mL cm-2 h-1) along with no
   significant toxicity to MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and a compressive strength
   of 274 +/- 4 MPa. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

Abstract = {{Several mixed integer programming formulations have been proposed for
   modeling capacitated multi-level lot sizing problems with setup times.
   These formulations include the so-called facility location formulation,
   the shortest route formulation, and the inventory and lot sizing
   formulation with (a{''}{''}, S) inequalities. In this paper, we
   demonstrate the equivalence of these formulations when the integrality
   requirement is relaxed for any subset of binary setup decision
   variables. This equivalence has significant implications for
   decomposition-based methods since same optimal solution values are
   obtained no matter which formulation is used. In particular, we discuss
   the relax-and-fix method, a decomposition-based heuristic used for the
   efficient solution of hard lot sizing problems. Computational tests
   allow us to compare the effectiveness of different formulations using
   benchmark problems. The choice of formulation directly affects the
   required computational effort, and our results therefore provide
   guidelines on choosing an effective formulation during the development
   of heuristic-based solution procedures.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this paper a method to build a computer model that mimic
   the mineral-protein composite structure of a nacre tablet. Motivated by
   the interesting observations in AFM experiments of nacre, protein chains
   stretching out from grain boundaries are simulated by steered molecular
   dynamics (SMD) to gain an insight into the effect of protein-aragonite
   interaction on the mechanical properties of nacre and the molecular
   mechanisms of the sawtooth behavior. Force-extension curves are obtained
   and the key characteristics of sawtooth behavior are observed in SMD
   simulations in agreement with existing AFM experiments of nacre. The
   effect of water on protein-mineral interaction is investigated through
   including and excluding water molecules in the grain boundaries of the
   models. Different from the existing belief that protein unfolding is the
   origin of the ``sawtooth{''} behavior, we have found that the
   electrostatic interactions between the protein and aragonite mineral are
   responsible for the sawtooth behavior and hence the high toughness of
   nacre. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   was shown to increase the plateau stress in the aged condition, whereas
   the formation of coarse-grained intermetallic phases caused the
   embrittlement of the microstructure, reducing its ductility. The

Title = {{Analysis of rainfall distribution on spatial and temporal patterns of
   wheat yield in Mediterranean environment}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{52-65}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Wheat yield production in Mediterranean environment is highly affected
   by rainfall and amount of soil water stored into the soil before and
   during the growing season. Agricultural fields have been always
   considered as uniform entities and managed accordingly. However, uniform
   agronomic management in fields where spatial variability is present, is
   economically and environmentally inefficient. The objectives of this
   study were to: (i) identify spatially and temporally stable areas
   throughout the field, (ii) understand the influence of fallow and
   growing season rainfall on spatial and temporal variability of wheat
   yield. The study was carried out on a 12 ha field located in Foggia,
   Southern Italy during five years wheat monoculture. One hundred
   geo-referenced points were sampled for deriving spatial maps of soil
   texture and organic carbon. Spatial maps of grain yield, normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil electrical resistivity
   tomography (ERT) were collected non-destructively. Total growing season
   rainfall was correlated with grain yield after dividing it into long
   fallow (June-November), short fallow (September-November), growing
   season (December-May), vegetative (December-February), reproductive
   (March-May). The spatial maps were used to define spatial and temporal
   yield variability and to identify three stable zones within the field,
   ``low yield stable{''} (LS), ``average yield stable{''} (AS), ``high
   yield stable{''} (HS). Long and short fallow rainfall was highly
   correlated with grain yield of HS zone with correlation coefficients
   ranging between 0.5 and 1. Growing season rainfall was mostly correlated
   with the AS zone. The crop response to rainfall was a result of dynamic
   interaction of spatial static properties such as soil texture, position
   in the landscape and dynamic properties (soil water content,
   infiltration and crop water use). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In vivo the vasculature provides an effective delivery system for
   cellular nutrients; however, artificial scaffolds have no such
   mechanism, and the ensuing limitations in mass transfer result in
   limited regeneration. In these investigations, the regional mass
   transfer properties that occur through a model scaffold derived from the
   human umbilical vein (HUV) were assessed. Our aim was to define the
   heterogeneous behavior associated with these regional variations, and to
   establish if different decellularization technologies can modulate
   transport conditions to improve microenvironmental conditions that
   enhance cell integration. The effect of three decellularization methods
   {[}Triton X-100 (TX100), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and
   acetone/ethanol (ACE/EtOH)] on mass transfer, cellular migration,
   proliferation, and metabolic activity were assessed. Results show that
   regional variation in tissue structure and composition significantly
   affects both mass transfer and cell function. ACE/EtOH decellularization
   was shown to increase albumin mass flux through the intima and
   proximate-medial region (0250 mu m) when compared with sections
   decellularized with TX100 or SDS; although, mass flux remained constant
   over all regions of the full tissue thickness when using TX100.
   Scaffolds decellularized with TX100 were shown to promote cell migration
   up to 146\% further relative to SDS decellularized samples. These
   results show that depending on scaffold derivation and expectations for
   cellular integration, specificities of the decellularization chemistry
   affect the scaffold molecular architecture resulting in variable effects
   on mass transfer and cellular response. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{Exploratory tools that are sensitive to arbitrary statistical variations
   in spike train observations open up the possibility of novel
   neuroscientific discoveries. Developing such tools, however, is
   difficult due to the lack of Euclidean structure of the spike train
   space, and an experimenter usually prefers simpler tools that capture
   only limited statistical features of the spike train, such as mean spike
   count or mean firing rate. We explore strictly positive-definite kernels
   on the space of spike trains to offer both a structural representation
   of this space and a platform for developing statistical measures that
   explore features beyond count or rate. We apply these kernels to
   construct measures of divergence between two point processes and use
   them for hypothesis testing, that is, to observe if two sets of spike
   trains originate from the same underlying probability law. Although
   there exist positive-definite spike train kernels in the literature, we
   establish that these kernels are not strictly definite and thus do not
   induce measures of divergence. We discuss the properties of both of
   these existing nonstrict kernels and the novel strict kernels in terms
   of their computational complexity, choice of free parameters, and
   performance on both synthetic and real data through kernel principal
   component analysis and hypothesis testing.}},

   Data mining and materials informatics methods are used here to generate
   a predictive model that enables efficient high-throughput screening of

   solid-state lubricants. Through the combination of principal component
   analysis and recursive partitioning using a small dataset comprised of
   intrinsic material properties, we develop a decision tree-based model
   comprised of if-then rules which estimates the friction coefficients of
   a wide range of materials. This data-driven model has a high degree of
   accuracy with an R (2) value of 0.8904 and provides a range of possible
   friction coefficients that accounts for the possible variability of a

Title = {{An ex situ evaluation of TBA- and MTBE-baited bio-traps}},

Abstract = {{Aquifer microbial communities can be investigated using Bio-traps(R)
   ({''}bio-traps{''}), passive samplers containing Bio-Sep(R) beads
   ({''}bio-beads{''}) that are deployed in monitoring wells to be
   colonized by bacteria delivered via groundwater flow through the well.
   When bio-beads are ``baited{''} with organic contaminants enriched in
   C-13, stable isotope probing allows assessment of the composition and
   activity of the microbial community. This study used an ex situ system
   fed by groundwater continuously extracted from an adjacent monitoring
   well within an experimentally-created aerobic zone treating a tert-butyl
   alcohol (TBA) plume. The goal was to evaluate aspects of bio-trap
   performance that cannot be studied quantitatively in situ. The measured
   groundwater flow through a bio-trap housing suggests that such traps
   might typically ``sample{''} about 1.8 L per month. The desorption of
   TBA or methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) bait from bio-traps during a
   typical deployment duration of 6 weeks was approximately 90\% and 45\%,
   respectively, of the total initial bait load, with initially high rate
   of mass loss that decreased markedly after a few days. The concentration
   of TBA in groundwater flowing by the TBA-baited bio-beads was estimated
   to be as high as 3400 mg/L during the first few days, which would be
   expected to inhibit growth of TBA-degrading microbes. Initial inhibition
   was also implied for the MTBE-baited bio-trap, but at lower
   concentrations and for a shorter time. After a few days, concentrations
   in groundwater flowing through the bio-traps dropped below inhibitory
   concentrations but remained 4-5 orders of magnitude higher than TBA or
   MTBE concentrations within the aquifer at the experimental site.
   Desorption from the bio-beads during ex situ deployment occurred at
   first as predicted by prior sorption analyses of bio-beads but with
   apparent hysteresis thereafter, possibly due to mass transfer
   limitations caused by colonizing microbes. These results suggest that
   TBA- or MTBE-baited bio-traps could be baited at lower initial total
   mass loading with no detriment to trapping ability. The bio-traps were
   able to collect detectable amounts of microbial DNA and thus allow some
   insight into the sparse microbial community present in the aquifer
   during remediation of the low concentration plume. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) shows promise in treating
   neurological diseases due to its ability to circumvent the blood-brain
   barrier (BBB) and deliver therapeutics directly to the parenchyma of the
   central nervous system (CNS). Such a drug delivery method may be useful
   in treating CNS disorders involving the hippocampus such as temporal
   lobe epilepsy and gliomas; however, the influence of anatomical
   structures on infusate distribution is not fully understood. As a
   surrogate for therapeutic agents, we used gadolinium-labeled-albumin
   (Gd-albumin) tagged with Evans Blue dye to observe the time dependence
   of CED infusate distributions into the rat dorsal and ventral
   hippocampus in vivo with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
   imaging (DCE-MRI). For finer anatomical detail, final distribution
   volumes (V-d) of the infusate were observed with high-resolution
   T-1-weighted MR imaging and light microscopy of fixed brain sections.
   Dynamic images demonstrated that Gd-albumin preferentially distributed
   within the hippocampus along neuroanatomical structures with less fluid
   resistance and less penetration was observed in dense cell layers.
   Furthermore, significant leakage into adjacent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   spaces such as the hippocampal fissure, velum interpositum and midbrain
   cistern occurred toward the end of infusion. V-d increased linearly with
   infusion volume (V-i) at a mean V-d/V-i ratio of 5.51 +/- 0.55 for the
   dorsal hippocampus infusion and 5.30 +/- 0.83 for the ventral
   hippocampus infusion. This study demonstrated the significant effects of
   tissue structure and CSF space boundaries on infusate distribution
   during CED. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Towards a universal criteria for turbulence suppression in dilute
   turbidity currents with non-cohesive sediments}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{Turbidity currents exhibit fascinating physics as their sustained
   propagation depends on a tight interplay between the suspended sediments
   and turbulence. If resuspension dominates over deposition the intensity
   of the flow will increase, while if deposition dominates the flow
   turbulence can be completely damped inducing rapid settling of sediments
   and, eventually, flow extinction. This work explores the phenomenon
   whereby turbulence in a dilute turbidity current with non-cohesive
   sediments is abruptly extinguished owing to increased suspended sediment
   stratification. Three parameters control the flow dynamics: Reynolds
   number (Re-tau), Richardson number (Ri(tau)) and sediment settling
   velocity ((V) over tilde (z)). The condition for complete turbulence
   suppression can be expressed as a critical value for Ri(tau)(V) over
   tilde (z). Based on simulations, limited experiments and limited field
   data, the critical value appears to have a logarithmic dependence on
   Re-tau. Citation: Cantero, M. I., M. Shringarpure, and S. Balachandar

Abstract = {{Molecular recognition is fundamental to the specific interactions
   between molecules, of which the best known examples are antibody antigen
   binding and cDNA hybridization. Reversible manipulation of the molecular
   recognition events is still a very challenging topic, and such studies

   is the collection of changes at the molecular level to provide
   macroscopic observables. This research makes use of photoresponsive
   molecular recognition for the fabrication of novel photoregulated
   dynamic materials. Specifically, a dynamic hydrogel was prepared by
   grafting azobenzene-tethered ssDNA and its cDNA to the hydrogel network.
   The macroscopic volume Of the hydrogel can be manipulated through the
   photoreversible DNA hybridization controlled by alternate irradiation of
   UV and visible light. The effects of synthetic parameters including the
   concentration of DNA, polymer monomer, and permanent cross-linker are
   also discussed.}},

Volume = {{452}},
Pages = {{259-281}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Annual, seasonal, and monthly trends in precipitation, mean temperature,
   maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and temperature range were
   evaluated using stations from the United States Historical Climatology
   Network (USHCN) for the time periods 1895-2009 and 1970-2009 for the
   state of Florida. The significance and magnitude of station trends were
   determined using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope,
   respectively. The collective, field significance of trends were
   evaluated using a Monte Carlo permutation procedure. Field significant
   trends in seasonal precipitation were found in only the June-August and
   March-May seasons for the 1895-2009 and 1970-2009 time periods,
   respectively. Significant decreasing trends in monthly precipitation
   were found in the months of October and May for the 1895-2009 and
   1970-2009 time periods, respectively. Field significant trends were
   found for all temperature variables for both time periods, with the
   largest number of stations with significant trends occurring in the
   summer and autumn months. Trends in mean, maximum, and minimum
   temperature were generally positive with a higher proportion of positive
   trends in the 1970-2009 period. The spatial coherence of trends in
   temperature range was generally less compared to other temperature
   variables, with a larger proportion of stations showing negative trends
   in the summer and positive trends at other times of the year and more
   negative trends found in the 1970-2009 period. Significant differences
   in temperature trends based on the surrounding land use were found for
   minimum temperature and temperature range in the 1970-2009 period
   indicating that data homogenization of the USHCN temperature data did
   not fully remove this influence. The evaluation of trends based on
   station exposure ratings show significant differences in temperature
   variables in both the 1895-2009 and 1970-2009 time periods. Systematic
   changes in trends can be seen in the 1980s, the period of widespread
   conversion from liquid-in-glass to electronic measurement, indicating
   that some of the differences found may be due to uncorrected
   inhomogeneities. Since notable differences were found between
   differently rated stations pre-1940, a time which the present-day rating
   should have little to no influence, attribution of differences based on
   station rating should be done with caution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We report that the oxidation of graphene-based highly transparent
   conductive layers to AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN ultra-violet (UV) light-emitting
   diodes (LEDs) was suppressed by the use of SiNX passivation layers.
   Although graphene is considered to be an ideal candidate as the
   transparent conductive layer to UV-LEDs, oxidation of these layers at
   high operating temperatures has been an issue. The oxidation is
   initiated at the un-saturated carbon atoms at the edges of the graphene
   and reduces the UV light intensity and degrades the current-voltage
   (I-V) characteristics. The oxidation also can occur at defects,
   including vacancies. However, GaN-based UV-LEDs deposited with SiNX by
   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition showed minimal degradation of
   light output intensity and I-V characteristics because the
   graphene-based UV transparent conductive layers were shielded from the
   oxygen molecules. This is a simple and effective approach for
   maintaining the advantages of graphene conducting layers as electrodes
   on UV-LEDs. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Efficiency determination of an electrostatic lunar dust collector by
   discrete element method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Lunar grains become charged by the sun's radiation in the tenuous
   atmosphere of the moon. This leads to lunar dust levitation and particle
   deposition which often create serious problems in the costly system
   deployed in lunar exploration. In this study, an electrostatic lunar
   dust collector (ELDC) is proposed to address the issue and the discrete
   element method (DEM) is used to investigate the effects of electrical
   particle-particle interactions, non-uniformity of the electrostatic
   field, and characteristics of the ELDC. The simulations on 20-mu m-sized
   lunar particles reveal the electrical particle-particle interactions of
   the dust particles within the ELDC plates require 29\% higher
   electrostatic field strength than that without the interactions for
   100\% collection efficiency. For the given ELDC geometry, consideration
   of non-uniformity of the electrostatic field along with electrical
   interactions between particles on the same ELDC geometry leads to a
   higher requirement of similar to 3.5 kV/m to ensure 100\% particle
   collection. Notably, such an electrostatic field is about 10 3 times
   less than required for electrodynamic self-cleaning methods. Finally, it
   is shown for a ``half-size{''} system that the DEM model predicts
   greater collection efficiency than the Eulerian-based model at all
   voltages less than required for 100\% efficiency. Halving the ELDC
   dimensions boosts the particle concentration inside the ELDC, as well as
   the resulting field strength for a given voltage. Though a lunar
   photovoltaic system was the subject, the results of this study are
   useful for evaluation of any system for collecting charged particles in
   other high vacuum environment using an electrostatic field. (C) 2012

Title = {{Domain wall and interphase boundary motion in a two-phase morphotropic

   piezoelectric and dielectric properties}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{In ferroelectric materials, enhanced dielectric and piezoelectric
   property coefficients are found in compositions near morphotropic phase
   boundaries (MPBs). The material response in these compositions may be
   contributed by enhanced intrinsic piezoelectric distortions or increased
   interface motion, e.g., contributions from domain wall and interphase
   boundary motion, though the relative effect of these mechanisms in
   different materials is not yet well understood. One of the major
   challenges to developing this understanding is the availability and
   sensitivity of in situ characterization techniques, particularly during
   the application of cyclic electric fields of subcoercive or weak
   amplitude, conditions at which the property coefficients are measured.
   Here, we use time-resolved neutron diffraction to resolve the subtle
   electric-field-induced crystallographic strain mechanisms in a
   prototypical MPB composition, 36\%BiScO3-64\%PbTiO3, that contains
   coexisting monoclinic and tetragonal phases. We observe multiple
   cooperative electromechanical effects including domain wall motion in
   both the monoclinic and tetragonal phases, interphase boundary motion
   between the two phases, and electric-field-induced lattice strains. The
   measured effects span four orders of magnitude in frequency,
   facilitating the discrimination of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions
   to properties. Domain wall motion in the monoclinic phase dominates the
   response, leading to shifts of diffraction peaks as high as 2300 pm/V;
   these shifts reflect the field-induced changes in average pseudocubic
   (00h) lattice spacing of the monoclinic phase parallel to the electric
   field. Domain wall motion in the tetragonal phase is also readily
   apparent and exhibits a degree of frequency dispersion similar to that
   measured in both the relative permittivity and piezoelectric
   coefficients at similar conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the performance of nine widely used and accessible crop
   growth simulation models (APES-ACE, CROPSYST, DAISY, DSSAT-CERES,
   FASSET, HERMES, MONICA, STICS and WOFOST) was compared during 44 growing
   seasons of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L) at seven sites in Northern
   and Central Europe. The aims of this model comparison were to examine
   how different process-based crop models perform at multiple sites across
   Europe when applied with minimal information for model calibration of
   spring barley at field scale, whether individual models perform better
   than the multi-model mean, and what the uncertainty ranges are in
   simulated grain yields. The reasons for differences among the models and
   how results for barley compare to winter wheat are discussed.
   Regarding yield estimation, best performing based on the root mean
   square error (RMSE) were models HERMES, MONICA and WOFOST with lowest
   values of 1124, 1282 and 1325 (kg ha(-1)), respectively. Applying the
   index of agreement (IA), models WOFOST, DAISY and HERMES scored best
   having highest values (0.632, 0.631 and 0.585, respectively). Most
   models systematically underestimated yields, whereby CROPSYST showed the
   highest deviation as indicated by the mean bias error (MBE) (-1159 kg
   ha(-1)). While the wide range of simulated yields across all sites and
   years shows the high uncertainties in model estimates with only
   restricted calibration, mean predictions from the nine models agreed
   well with observations. Results of this paper also show that models that
   were more accurate in predicting phenology were not necessarily the ones
   better estimating grain yields. Total above-ground biomass estimates
   often did not follow the patterns of grain yield estimates and, thus,
   harvest indices were also different. Estimates of soil moisture dynamics
   varied greatly.
   In comparison, even though the growing cycle for winter wheat is several
   months longer than for spring barley, using RMSE and IA as indicators,
   models performed slightly, but not significantly, better in predicting
   wheat yields. Errors in reproducing crop phenology were similar, which
   in conjunction with the shorter growth cycle of barley has higher
   effects on accuracy in yield prediction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are promising materials for
   energy efficient separations of light gases. In this work, we report a
   detailed microscopic study of carbon dioxide and methane self-diffusion
   in three CMS membrane derived from 6FDA/BPDA(1:1)-DAM and Matrimid
   polymers. In addition to diffusion of one-component sorbates, diffusion
   of a carbon dioxide/methane mixture was investigated. Self-diffusion
   studies were performed by the multinuclear (i.e., H-1 and C-13) pulsed
   field gradient (PFG) NMR technique which combines the advantages of high
   field (17.6 T) NMR and high magnetic field gradients (up to 30 T/m).
   Diffusion measurements were carried out at different temperatures and
   for a broad range of the root-mean-square displacements of gas molecules
   inside the membranes. The diffusion data obtained from PFG NMR are
   compared with the corresponding results of membrane permeation
   measurements reported previously for the same membrane types. The
   observed differences between the transport diffusivities and
   self-diffusion coefficients of carbon dioxide and methane are discussed.}},

   attributes and water storage were evaluated by comparing a standard 10-m
   U. S. Geological Survey DEM and a 10-m DEM derived from Light Detection

   storage environmental services program in South Florida. Elevation
   differences between the two DEMs ranged from -0.73 m to 1.6 m with a low
   (31\%) correlation. Frequency analysis showed that 64\% of the grids in
   the study area had elevation differences of 0.8 m or greater. Spatial
   distribution of wetlands and ditches were better represented by the
   LIDAR than the USGS DEM. Surface water storage in the study area and an
   isolated wetland was 49\% and 21\% more, respectively, for the USGS DEM
   than LIDAR DEM in wet seasons. In dry seasons, the LIDAR DEM resulted in
   28\% higher storage than the USGS DEM. Annually, the USGS DEM resulted
   in an average 44\% more storage than LIDAR DEM. For a major rainstorm in
   2008, the USGS showed 92\% inundation of the study area and 44\% for the

Journal = {{WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{This paper explored recent land use and land cover change in western
   central Florida, examining both socioeconomic and biophysical influences
   on land transformation and the impacts of that change. Between 1995 and
   2006, a growth in population resulted in the conversion of agricultural
   areas, grasslands, and upland forests to urban areas. Additionally, the
   amount of extractive land uses (e.g., mining) increased by 21.8\%, water
   reservoirs by 19.9\%, and recreation areas by 13.3\%. Regional climate
   modeling experiments suggest that the overall effects of land use change
   (LUC) on mesocale climates in summer days resulted in modified
   temperatures that were modulated by the new LU characteristics, local
   and synoptic atmospheric circulations, and the distance of rural and
   urban land uses from the shoreline. The difference between the extreme
   and actual LU simulations for temperature, wind speed, wind direction,
   and precipitation presented higher variability in the inland urbanized
   and rural zones. Results can be used to better understand the basic
   influences of LUC and urbanization on key climate parameters, and urban
   heat island effects in peninsular Florida under typical weather

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1479-1489}},

Abstract = {{MIKE SHE is a physically based, integrated water resources model that
   simulates both surface and subsurface water dynamics. These dynamics
   include interception, evapotranspiration, overland flow, channel flow,
   unsaturated flow, and saturated zone flow. The model can also simulate
   limited surface water quality processes using the advection dispersion
   equation and groundwater quality with a random-walk tracking method.
   This article is intended to describe the components of MIKE SHE and its
   calibration, validation, and applications. Given the deterministic,
   physically based characteristics of MIKE SHE and the large number of
   processes it simulates simultaneously, the number of parameters to
   calibrate can be large. A combination of user experience with the model,
   knowledge of the problem being solved, and an automatic calibration
   feature help in selecting the most sensitive parameters to calibrate. A
   case study describing the use of the MIKE SHE model, coupled with the
   hydraulic MIKE 11 model, to solve water flow in agricultural reservoirs
   in south Florida is presented. The problem required the use of the MIKE
   SHE model due to the high groundwater and overland flow interactions as
   well as the complex flow patterns inside the reservoir The horizontal
   and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivities and the leakage
   coefficient were identified as the calibration parameters. The model was
   calibrated and evaluated for two reservoirs using two different time
   periods. Results showed matching between measured and simulated data for
   both reservoirs for the calibration and validation periods. The coupled
   MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model has the capabilities to simulate complex
   hydrological processes and their interactions, which few other watershed
   models can match, and is suitable for current problems, such as the
   effects of climate change and land use change.}},

Abstract = {{A simple method for locating optimal positions for UV lamps used in the
   curing of curvilinear composite components manufactured with the resin
   infusion between double flexible tooling process is proposed. A
   multivariate optimisation model, consisting of continuously
   differentiable and two-dimensional integral domain parts, was developed.
   This model has UV lamp positions, dimensions of the manufactured
   composite component and UV power source as input parameters. The optimum
   positions of the UV lamps are the output. The two-dimensional
   integration yields the difference between the required and actual
   intensities that the composite component receives. A Gauss quadrature
   numerical integration method was used to numerically evaluate the
   surface integral, and the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm was used for
   predicting optimum positions for the lamps. The mechanical and
   rheological properties of the UV cured laminates were compared with
   catalytically cured laminates. Ultraviolet cured components compared
   well with the catalytic cured composites.}},

Title = {{Automatic RTL Test Generation from SystemC TLM Specifications}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{SystemC transaction-level modeling (TLM) is widely used to enable early
   exploration for both hardware and software designs. It can reduce the
   overall design and validation effort of complex system-on-chip (SOC)
   architectures. However, due to lack of automated techniques coupled with
   limited reuse of validation efforts between abstraction levels, SOC
   validation is becoming a major bottleneck. This article presents a novel
   top-down methodology for automatically generating register
   transfer-level (RTL) tests from SystemC TLM specifications. It makes two
   important contributions: i) it proposes a method that can automatically
   generate TLM tests using various coverage metrics, and (ii) it develops
   a test refinement specification for automatically converting TLM tests
   to RTL tests in order to reduce overall validation effort. We have
   developed a tool which incorporates these activities to enable automated
   RTL test generation from SystemC TLM specifications. Case studies using
   a router example and a 64-bit Alpha AXP pipelined processor demonstrate
   that our approach can achieve intended functional coverage of the RTL
   designs, as well as capture various functional errors and
   inconsistencies between specifications and implementations.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Cache Reconfiguration for Soft Real-Time Systems}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, efficient dynamic reconfiguration techniques have been
   widely employed for system optimization. Dynamic cache reconfiguration
   is a promising approach for reducing energy consumption as well as for
   improving overall system performance. It is a major challenge to
   introduce cache reconfiguration into real-time multitasking systems,
   since dynamic analysis may adversely affect tasks with timing
   constraints. This article presents a novel approach for implementing
   cache reconfiguration in soft real-time systems by efficiently
   leveraging static analysis during runtime to minimize energy while
   maintaining the same service level. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first attempt to integrate dynamic cache reconfiguration in
   real-time scheduling techniques. Our experimental results using a wide
   variety of applications have demonstrated that our approach can
   significantly reduce the cache energy consumption in soft real-time
   systems (up to 74\%).}},

   by capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, admittance spectroscopy, and
   deep level transient spectroscopy. C-V and admittance measurements were
   performed in the dark and after illumination. The results suggest the
   presence of high concentrations of deep negatively charged traps in the
   AlGaN barriers, producing shifts of the C-V characteristics to more
   positive voltages. The density of negatively charged centers can be
   increased by cooling at high reverse bias. These centers have a high

Abstract = {{Future systems of networked autonomous vehicles, such as unmanned aerial
   or ground vehicles, may rely on peer-to-peer wireless communication to
   coordinate their actions. The physical formation of the network may need
   to be reconfigured at times based on the specified missions. However,
   reconfiguring the physical formation also impacts the link connectivity
   and hence the connectivity of the network. If the network is
   partitioned, the autonomous vehicles can no longer coordinate their
   movements, and the mission may fail. In this article, we discuss
   techniques to transform the formation of a system of autonomous vehicles
   while preserving network connectivity. Several different approaches to
   address this problem are presented, with the focus on a method that
   utilizes ideas from routing packets in networks. We also briefly discuss
   the problem of formation selection and give an example of formation
   optimization in which communication costs are minimized under
   constraints on preserving network connectivity and the amount of
   movement required.}},

   Stochastic Clustering Auction}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS AND ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This article considers the problem of optimal task allocation for
   heterogeneous teams, for example, teams of heterogeneous robots or
   human-robot teams. It is well-known that this problem is NP-hard and
   hence computationally feasible approaches must develop an approximate
   solution. Here, we propose a solution via a Stochastic Clustering
   Auction (SCA) that uses a Markov chain search process along with
   simulated annealing. This is the first stochastic auction method used in
   conjunction with global optimization. It is based on stochastic transfer
   and swap moves between the clusters of tasks assigned to the various
   robots and considers not only downhill movements, but also uphill
   movements, which can avoid local minima. A novel feature of this
   algorithm is that, by tuning the annealing suite and turning the uphill
   movements on and off, the global team performance after algorithm
   convergence can slide in the region between the global optimal
   performance and the performance associated with a random allocation.
   Extensive numerical experiments are used to evaluate the performance of
   SCA in terms of costs and computational and communication requirements.
   For centralized auctioning, the SCA algorithm is compared to fast greedy
   auction algorithms. Distributed auctioning is then compared with
   centralized SCA.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with an adaptive state estimation problem for a
   class of nonlinear stochastic systems with unknown constant parameters.
   These nonlinear systems have a linear-in-parameter structure, and the
   nonlinearity is assumed to be bounded in a Lipschitz-like manner. Using
   stochastic counterparts of Lyapunov stability theory, we present
   adaptive state and parameter estimators with ultimately exponentially
   bounded estimator errors in the sense of mean square for both
   continuous-time and discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems.
   Sufficient conditions are given in terms of the solvability of LMIs.
   Moreover, we also introduce a suboptimal design approach to optimizing
   the upper bound of the mean-square error of parameter estimation. This
   suboptimal design procedure is also realized by LMI computations. By a
   martingale method, we also show that the related Lyapunov function has a
   non-negative Lyapunov exponent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Accurate integer frequency offset (IFO) estimation is crucial for
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, particularly
   in the presence of frequency-selective fading and residual timing offset
   (RTO). For existing algorithms, however, it is still a challenge to
   obtain a good tradeoff among the estimation performance, complexity, and
   spectrum overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel cross ambiguity
   function (CAF)-based IFO estimator using only one training sequence. By
   designing the training sequence, which has only a single sharp peak on
   its ambiguity function surface, a highly accurate and full acquisition
   range estimation of the IFO can be obtained in the presence of
   frequency-selective fading and RTO. Moreover, the adoption of the CAF
   expression in terms of time-domain signals ensures that the complexity
   of the proposed algorithm is relatively low. Simulation results verify
   its superior accuracy in frequency-selective fading channels and in the
   presence of RTO.}},

   Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.
   Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is routinely used to adjust sea-level
   trends determined from tide-gauge data to improve estimates of worldwide
   sea-level rise. This adjustment may be appropriate for formerly
   glaciated high-latitude (referred to as FGHL) areas where vertical land
   motions due to GIA are large compared with motions produced by other
   phenomena. However, since GIA is only one component of vertical motion,
   does adjusting for it outside FGHL areas improve sea-level rise
   estimates or bias them? We compare global positioning system (GPS) gauge
   measurements with the vertical land-motion component of GIA predictions
   at 147 worldwide locations that are near tide gauges and outside FGHL
   areas and find remarkably little correlation. We analyze the data in
   several ways to determine the source of the lack of correlation. We also
   find that the average vertical motion for the 147 locations measured by
   GPS is subsidence, whereas the average GIA prediction is zero.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{431-447}},

Abstract = {{The stiffness and strength properties of foams with tetrakaidecahedral
   unit cells are evaluated using both finite element-based micromechanics
   and analytical methods. The finite element analysis models the varying
   cross section of the struts exactly. The analytical methods assume the
   struts have constant cross section along the length. Equivalent constant
   cross section of the strut can be obtained by either matching the
   densities or by using harmonic averaging of the stiffness properties. A
   method in which the moment of inertia of the cross section is averaged
   is also considered. The comparison of properties obtained for the
   different equivalent constant cross-section foams shows the inability of
   the various averaging schemes to match the shear modulus and the
   strength properties, while the Young's modulus matches to some extent.
   The failure of the weakest cross section in the varying cross-section
   strut of the unit cell leads to a lower tensile strength in the actual
   foam compared to the uniform cross-section foams. The results suggest
   that although the use of simple analytical models for foam properties
   are attractive, they often lead to erroneous results, and hence exact
   modeling of the strut geometry is key to estimating the stiffness and
   strength properties of foams and other cellular solids.}},

Abstract = {{The interface between an emergency department and internal wards is
   often a hospital's bottleneck. Motivated by this interaction in an
   anonymous hospital, we analyze queueing systems with heterogeneous
   server pools, where the pools represent the wards, and the servers are
   beds. Our queueing system, with a single centralized queue and several
   server pools, forms an inverted-V model. We introduce the randomized
   most-idle (RMI) routing policy and analyze it in the quality- and
   efficiency-driven regime, which is natural in our setting. The RMI
   policy results in the same server fairness (measured by idleness ratios)
   as the longest-idle-server-first (LISF) policy, which is commonly used
   in call centers and considered fair. However, the RMI policy utilizes
   only the information on the number of idle servers in different pools,
   whereas the LISF policy requires information that is unavailable in
   hospitals on a real-time basis.}},

Abstract = {{Through detailed quantum calculations, the presence of classical
   discrete breathers and, subsequently, a two-phonon bound state (TPBS) or
   quantum breather (QB) state have already been shown in nonlinear
   photonic materials such as ferroelectrics. The latter was done in a
   periodic boundary condition in terms of the variations of TPBS
   parameters against impurity that is related to nonlinearity.
   Metamaterials are also nonlinear optical materials for applications as a
   split-ring-resonator (SRR) in antenna arrays. By using a Klein-Gordon
   approach, first multi-solitons and classical breathers are shown. For
   QBs, by using a periodic boundary condition, the variation of the TPBS
   parameters with coupling within the SRR elements is observed. Finally,
   in a non-periodic boundary condition approach, the temporal evolution of
   the number of quanta is shown eventually in order to derive the critical
   time of redistribution of quanta that is proportional to the QB's
   lifetime in femtoseconds, which also shows variation with coupling in
   the SRR system.}},

Abstract = {{The deposition of reactive and unreactive particles on polymer surfaces
   at hyperthermal incident energies is investigated using classical
   molecular dynamics simulations. The forces are calculated with the
   second-generation reactive empirical bond-order potential with modified
   parameters for C,H,O interactions. Three prototypical polymers,
   polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), are modified
   by atomic oxygen and argon that are deposited with kinetic energies of
   25, 50 and 100?eV. The non-reactive argon is predicted to primarily
   break carboncarbon bonds and remove hydrogen as a secondary process,
   while the reactive oxygen is more efficient at removing hydrogen during
   new bond formation with the polymer. The PE and PP are found to have
   similar responses to hyperthermal argon and oxygen deposition, while PS
   is found to be the most susceptible to oxygen modification.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of landfills are operated to accelerate waste
   decomposition through liquids addition (e.g., leachate recirculation) as
   a wet landfill. Landfill design and regulation often depend on utilizing
   landfill gas production models that require an estimate of a first-order
   gas generation rate constant, k. Consequently, several studies have
   estimated k using collected gas volumes from operating wet landfills.
   Research was conducted to examine an alternative approach in which k is
   estimated not from collected landfill gas but from solid waste samples
   collected over time and analyzed for remaining gas yield. To achieve
   this goal, waste samples were collected from 1990 through 2007 at two
   full-scale landfills in Florida that practiced liquids addition. Methane
   yields were measured from waste samples collected over time, including
   periods before and after leachate recirculation, and the results were
   applied to a first-order decay model to estimate rate constants for each
   of the sites. An initial, intensive processing step was conducted to
   exclude non-biodegradable components from the methane yield testing
   procedure. The resulting rate constants for the two landfills examined
   were 0.47 yr(-1) and 0.21 yr(-1). These results expectedly exceeded the
   United States Environmental Protection Agency's rate constants for dry
   and conventional landfills (0.02-0.05 yr(-1)), but they are comparable
   to wet landfill rate constants derived using landfill gas data (0.1-0.3
   yr(-1)). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To study the sublethal effects induced by ethylbenzene and the
   capability of a freshwater gastropod Bellamya aeruginosa to take up and
   depurate ethylbenzene, the snail was subjected to two treatments, a
   23-day exposure period followed by a 17-day depuration period.
   Behavioral alteration, namely retraction response, was observed during
   the exposure period, and the proportion of retracted snails increased
   under each treatment as the exposure time prolonged but there was no
   linear relationship between the retracted proportion and the exposure
   dose. Such behavioral alteration was probably due to the disturbance of
   membrane permeability stressed by ethylbenzene. Ethylbenzene uptake in
   unretracted snails was greater than in retracted snails, while the
   depuration abilities in the two different responses of snails had no
   significant difference from each other. Because of the limited
   capability of snails to detoxify ethylbenzene, the depuration was mainly
   through a slow excretion process and therefore ethylbenzene was still
   present in the tissue of snail after 17-day depuration. DNA damage was
   induced significantly in snails exposed to ethylbenzene, and the levels
   of DNA damage showed positive time-response and dose-response
   relationships, and moreover the levels of DNA damage had no difference
   between the two different responses of snails. There was no linear
   relationship between the level of DNA damage and the amount of residual
   ethylbenzene in tissue, which may be related to the adaptation mechanism
   in snail. Overall, the results suggest that the snail has high
   capability to take up ethylbenzene and low ability to depurate it, and
   ethylbenzene has potential genotoxicity to snail. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Supersonic flow over an open cavity can create intense pressure loads on
   the surfaces within the cavity. In order to combat these loads, the
   development of a control scheme to reduce them is becoming increasingly
   important for many engineering applications. The present study
   implements steady leading edge blowing through various configurations of
   spanwise-aligned rectangular leading edge slots. The effects of this
   control on the flow field were examined to determine the suppression
   mechanisms exploited by the leading edge blowing. The cavity studied
   here had a length-to-depth ratio of 6 and was placed in a freestream
   flow with a Mach number of 1.4. Actuators with one continuous slot and
   three and five segmented slots spanning the width of the cavity were
   installed at the leading edge. Surface pressure reductions of nearly
   45\% were achieved on the aft wall of the cavity using the 5-slot
   configuration. Velocity field measurements acquired through 2-component
   (streamwise-aligned measurement plane) and 3-component stereoscopic
   (cross-stream-aligned measurement plane) particle image velocimetry
   revealed the presence of streamwise-aligned vortices created by the
   segmented slots. These act to significantly alter the shear layer formed
   at the mouth of the cavity creating highly three-dimensional flow field
   features.}},

Abstract = {{We present a variational framework for the reconstruction of

   spaces. Motivated by the sampling-theoretic advantages of body centered
   cubic (BCC) lattice, this paper examines the BCC lattice and its
   associated box spline spaces in a variational setting. We introduce a
   regularization scheme for box splines that allows us to utilize the BCC
   lattice in a variational reconstruction framework. We demonstrate that
   by choosing the BCC lattice over the commonly-used Cartesian lattice, as
   the shift-invariant representation, one can increase the quality of
   signal reconstruction. Moreover, the computational cost of the
   reconstruction process is reduced in the BCC framework due to the
   smaller bandwidth of the system matrix in the box spline space compared
   to the corresponding tensor-product B-spline space. The improvements in
   accuracy are quantified numerically and visualized in our experiments
   with synthetic as well as real biomedical datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Premature tympanostomy tube (TT) occlusion frequently leads
   to TT replacement surgery. IT surface preparations have been suggested
   as a means of reducing IT occlusion. The purpose of this study is to
   determine if commercial TT compositions or surface preparations impact
   the rate of TT occlusion using an in vitro model.
   Methods: Commercial TTs composed of titanium, fluoroplastic, and
   silicone, as well as human serum albumin coated titanium,
   phosphorylcholine coated fluoroplastic, and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated
   silicone TTs, were tested for occlusion development in a previously
   validated in vitro model that simulates middle ear air and mucus flow.
   Results: Time to occlusion was longer with all coated TTs relative to
   all uncoated TTs (p = 0.038). Polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silicone TTs
   had the lowest rate of occlusion and improvement relative to silicone
   (36\% vs. 70\%). Time to occlusion was longer in all coated TTs, but
   individually, none reached statistical significance.
   Conclusion: TT composition and surface preparations do not dramatically
   impact the development of TT occlusion. All tested surface coatings seem
   to delay TT occlusion in this in vitro model. In vivo testing will be
   necessary to validate these findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Computational molecular biology has emerged as one of the most exciting
   interdisciplinary fields. It has currently benefited from concepts and
   theoretical results obtained by different scientific research
   communities, including genetics, biochemistry, and computer science. In
   the past few years it has been shown that a large number of molecular
   biology problems can be formulated as combinatorial optimization
   problems, including sequence alignment problems, genome rearrangement
   problems, string selection and comparison problems, and protein
   structure prediction and recognition. This paper provides a detailed
   description of string selection and string comparison problems. For
   finding good-quality solutions of a particular class of string
   comparison molecular biology problems, known as the far from most string
   problem, we propose new heuristics, including a Greedy Randomized
   Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA).
   Computational results indicate that these randomized heuristics find
   better quality solutions compared with results produced by the best
   state-of-the-art heuristic approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study efficient power control schemes for delay
   sensitive communication over fading channels. Our objective is to find a
   power control law that optimizes the link layer performance,
   specifically, minimizes the packet drop probability, subject to a
   long-term average power constraint. We assume the buffer at the
   transmitter is finite; hence packet drop happens when the buffer is
   full. The fading channel under our study has a continuous state, e.g.,
   Rayleigh fading. Since the channel state space is continuous, dynamic
   programming is not applicable for power control. In this paper, we
   propose a sub-optimal power control law based on a parametric approach.
   The proposed power control scheme tries to minimize the packet drop
   probability by considering the queue length, i.e., reducing the
   probability of those queue-length states that will cause full buffer.
   Simulation results show that our proposed power control scheme reduces
   the packet drop probability by one or two orders of magnitude, compared
   to the time domain water filling (TDWF) and the truncated channel
   inversion (TCI) power control. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This is the first study of the effect of topiramate on linguistic
   behavior and verbal recall using a computational linguistics system for
   automated language and speech analysis to detect and quantify
   drug-induced changes in speech recorded during discourse-level tasks.
   Healthy volunteers were administered a single, 100-mg oral dose of
   topiramate in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
   crossover studies. Subjects' topiramate plasma levels ranged from 0.23
   to 2.81 mu g/mL. We found a significant association between topiramate
   levels and impairment on measures of verbal fluency elicited during a
   picture description task, correct number of words recalled on a
   paragraph recall test, and reaction time recorded during a working
   memory task. Using the tools of clinical pharmacology and computational
   linguistics, we elucidated the relationship between the determinants of
   a drug's disposition as reflected in plasma concentrations and their
   impact on cognitive functioning as reflected in spoken language

Abstract = {{This project was designed to determine the effect of fertilizer rate and
   irrigation scheduling on water use, nutrient leaching, and fruit yield
   of young avocado trees (Persea americana Mill. cv. Simmonds). Seven
   nutrient and irrigation management practices were evaluated: (1)
   irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration (ET) with 50\% fertilizer at
   a standard rate (FSR); (2) ET irrigation with FSR (typical for avocado
   production in the area); (3) ET irrigation with 200\% FSR; (4)
   irrigation based on exceedance of 15-kPa (SW) soil water suction with
   50\% FSR; (5) SW with FSR; (6) SW with 200\% FSR; and (7) irrigation at
   a set schedule (based on timing and frequency typically used in local
   avocado production) with FSR. The SW with FSR treatment saved 87\% of
   the water volume applied and reduced total phosphorus leached by 74\%
   compared to the set schedule irrigation with FSR. The SW with FSR
   treatment had higher avocado fruit production, tree water-use
   efficiency, and fertilizer-use efficiency than the other six treatments.
   Thus, the use of soil water monitoring for irrigation management can
   substantially increase sustainability of young avocado orchards in
   southern Florida.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we proposed a two-stage hybrid reliability analysis
   framework based on the surrogate model, which combines the first-order
   reliability method and Monte Carlo simulation with a doubly-weighted
   moving least squares (DWMLS) method. The first stage consists of
   constructing a surrogate model based on DWMLS. The weight system of
   DWMLS considers not only the normal weight factor of moving least
   squares, but also the distance from the most probable failure point
   (MPFP), which accounts for reliability problems. An adaptive
   experimental design scheme is proposed, during which the MPFP is
   progressively updated. The approximate values and sensitivity
   information of DWMLS are chosen to determine the number and location of
   the experimental design points in the next iteration, until a
   convergence criterion is satisfied. In the second stage, MCS on the
   surrogate model is then used to calculate the probability of failure.
   The proposed method is applied to five benchmark examples to validate
   its accuracy and efficiency. Results show that the proposed surrogate
   model with DWMLS can estimate the failure probability accurately, while
   requiring fewer original model simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating conditional dependence between two random variables given the
   knowledge of a third random variable is essential in neuroscientific
   applications to understand the causal architecture of a distributed
   network. However, existing methods of assessing conditional dependence,
   such as the conditional mutual information, are computationally
   expensive, involve free parameters, and are difficult to understand in
   the context of realizations. In this letter, we discuss a novel approach
   to this problem and develop a computationally simple and parameter-free
   estimator. The difference between the proposed approach and the existing
   ones is that the former expresses conditional dependence in terms of a
   finite set of realizations, whereas the latter use random variables,
   which are not available in practice. We call this approach conditional
   association, since it is based on a generalization of the concept of
   association to arbitrary metric spaces. We also discuss a novel and
   computationally efficient approach of generating surrogate data for
   evaluating the significance of the acquired association value.}},

   differences in simulated regional climate patterns were found between
   the land development scenarios, which could potentially influence
   population requirements for energy and water. In our simulations, the
   aggregated effect of land cover changes over large suburban areas
   produced a more intense heat island effect than that produced by

Abstract = {{A coordinated modeling and experimental effort to investigate the shear
   stress-shear strain rate response of ballistic gelatin is presented. A
   power-law constitutive model that captures non-Newtonian
   shear-thickening behavior, the evolution of viscosity, and the momentum
   diffusion at high shear rates is adopted. A simple asymptotic
   relationship between the maximum wall shear stress and the maximum
   striking wall velocity is derived in the high diffusion rate regime for
   a shear flow between two parallel plates. Experimental investigation is
   conducted on double lap-shear test fixture with gelatin specimens of
   different thicknesses subjected to high strain rate input on the inner
   surface, generated by a polymer split Hopkinson pressure bar. This test
   fixture allows measurement of transmitted shear stress as well as
   visualization of momentum diffusion through gelatin when imaged by a
   high speed camera. Gelatin specimens of various thicknesses were used
   for extracting the power-law model parameters. It is found that
   ballistic gelatin behaves as a shear-thickening fluid at high shear
   rates with a power-law exponent of 2.22.}},

   real-time feedback performed equivalently or better than more
   experienced practitioners in the completeness and correctness of the
   exam. A second user study (n = 8) followed novices through repeated

Abstract = {{In this paper, two techniques are described for experimentally
   identifying the spindle-machine receptances required for tool point
   frequency response prediction using Receptance Coupling Substructure
   Analysis (RCSA). In the RCSA approach, the tool-holder-spindle-machine
   assembly is separated into three components: the tool, holder, and
   spindle-machine. The spindle-machine receptances are measured and
   archived. These receptances are then analytically coupled to beam models
   that represent the tool-holder. The spindle-machine dynamics are
   determined using: (1) a synthesis approach where a direct frequency
   response measurement of a standard artifact inserted in the test spindle
   is combined with a cross frequency response measurement to calculate the
   required rotational receptances: and (2) a new Euler-Bernoulli beam
   approach where the direct frequency response measurement is fit using an
   assumed (fixed-free) form of each mode within the measurement bandwidth.
   Experimental results are included for two spindles and four tool-holder
   combinations. The veracity of the new Euler-Bernoulli beam approach,
   which requires only a single measurement, reduces noise, and improves
   tool point dynamics prediction accuracy, is demonstrated. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Due to difficulties in controlling magnetic abrasive in the finishing
   area during internal magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) of capillary
   tubes, the finished length is limited in practice to just a few times
   the pole-tip width. The accumulation of multiple short finishing passes
   is necessary for long-tube finishing, which results in excessive
   finishing times. The use of a multiple pole-tip system with a tool, a
   solid rod consisting of alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic regions,
   was proposed to overcome this issue. The tool enables multiple finishing
   regions to be engaged simultaneously. This paper clarifies the finishing
   characteristics and mechanism and shows the effects of the tool's
   magnetic properties (including the intervals between magnetic and
   non-magnetic regions) on the tool and abrasive motion and the interior
   finishing characteristics of capillary tubes. This paper also proposes a
   simple method to determine the pole-tip feed length, which allows the
   MAF process to achieve a uniformly finished surface in half the time of
   the existing single pole-tip system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Reanalysis of a global soil database for crop and environmental modeling}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{163-170}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{There is an increased need for detailed soil information that can be
   used for applications of crop and environmental modeling. The goal of
   this project was to conduct a reanalysis of the ISRIC-WISE 1.1 Soil
   Profile Dataset. As part of the procedures, the soil reanalysis database
   was fitted to the standard formats of the International Consortium for
   Agricultural Systems Application (ICASA). Thus, the soil reanalysis
   database tailors dynamic crop models such as the Cropping System Model
   (CSM) of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer
   (DSSAT). During the reanalysis, the physical and chemical parameters of
   the soil profiles were revised and estimated, where necessary and
   possible, using pre-established ranges given by the literature and
   correlations among other more stable variable. To evaluate each of the
   3404 reanalyzed soil profiles, the CSM-CERES-Maize model was run for a
   standard crop management scenario using both the original and the new
   improved soil databases. Nine hundred seventy-eight soil profiles were
   considered to be not useful during the reanalysis due to missing values
   for one or more critical variables and were, therefore, not considered
   for quality control procedures. A pre-diagnostic for only nitrogen and
   soil organic carbon in the original dataset showed 70\% and 5\% of
   missing values respectively. A sensitivity analysis based on crop
   simulations comparing the original and the reanalyzed soil databases,
   showed that 1294 soil profiles yielded different results due to
   improvement of either the original data or improved conversion
   procedures. The details and considerations for detecting missing and
   erroneous values and for estimating soil variable values are presented
   in this paper for further use. The final soil reanalysis global database
   contains 3404 soil profiles and is available at

Title = {{Correlation model for composite elastic properties using only
   measurements from a single specimen}},
Journal = {{PROBABILISTIC ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{64-69}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In probabilistic design, composite material properties are often treated
   as independent random variables since correlation coefficients are not
   widely available. This is due to the paucity of experiments where
   correlation is measured. However, high material correlations are
   expected from common physical characteristics, such as variability in
   fiber volume fraction. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to
   translate known variability in composition into a correlation model for
   elastic constants. The dependence of the elastic constants on fiber
   volume fraction was estimated from simple mixture rules. The correlated
   material variability was applied to a glass/epoxy material system. The
   material variability was combined with the measurement error to obtain
   the total covariance of the elastic constants. The measurement error for
   the glass/epoxy laminate was from correlated data from a single
   vibration testing experiment. In this case of a single test, the
   variability between specimens was not captured in the measurement error,
   and the proposed correlation model provides a physical basis for
   approximating the specimen variability. The uncertainty in elastic
   properties was propagated to strain under mechanical loading in a
   pressure vessel problem using the classical lamination theory. The
   results were interpreted as a failure probability according to the
   maximum strain criterion. It was found that neglecting correlations can
   lead to an inefficient or unsafe design. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Aquitard contaminant storage and flux resulting from dense nonaqueous
   phase liquid source zone dissolution and remediation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{A one-dimensional diffusion model was used to investigate the effects of
   dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zone dissolution and
   remediation on the storage and release of contaminants from aquitards.
   Source zone dissolution was represented by a power law source depletion
   model, which served as a time variable boundary condition to the
   diffusion equation used to describe mass transport in the aquitard. Two
   key variables were used to assess source zone dissolution behavior on
   aquitard mass storage and release: the power law exponential term G,
   which reflects the influence of the source zone architecture, and a new
   variable defined herein as the source to aquitard mass transfer
   coefficient beta, which reflects the influences of both the source
   characteristics and the aquitard media properties. As G increased or as
   beta increased because of more rapid source dissolution, the aquitard
   concentrations, depth of penetration, and long-term back-diffusion flux
   decreased. However, when beta increased because of increased sorption,
   concentrations and back diffusion increased but penetration decreased.
   The duration of aquitard mass loading was found to be significantly less
   than the duration of mass release. Moreover, the mass per unit area
   stored in the aquitard was 3 or more orders of magnitude less than the
   initial DNAPL source zone mass per unit area, and the back diffusion
   flux from the aquitard was typically 4 or more orders of magnitude less
   than the initial source zone flux. Additionally, the effects of partial
   source zone remediation were investigated, and the results suggest that
   source remediation can have a favorable effect on long-term
   back-diffusion risk.}},

Title = {{Estimating Distribution of Hidden Objects with Drones: From Tennis Balls
   to Manatees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or drones, have been used widely in
   military applications, but more recently civilian applications have
   emerged (e. g., wildlife population monitoring, traffic monitoring, law
   enforcement, oil and gas pipeline threat detection). UAV can have
   several advantages over manned aircraft for wildlife surveys, including
   reduced ecological footprint, increased safety, and the ability to
   collect high-resolution geo-referenced imagery that can document the
   presence of species without the use of a human observer. We illustrate
   how geo-referenced data collected with UAV technology in combination
   with recently developed statistical models can improve our ability to
   estimate the distribution of organisms. To demonstrate the efficacy of
   this methodology, we conducted an experiment in which tennis balls were
   used as surrogates of organisms to be surveyed. We used a UAV to collect
   images of an experimental field with a known number of tennis balls,
   each of which had a certain probability of being hidden. We then applied
   spatially explicit occupancy models to estimate the number of balls and
   created precise distribution maps. We conducted three consecutive
   surveys over the experimental field and estimated the total number of
   balls to be 328 (95\% CI: 312, 348). The true number was 329 balls, but
   simple counts based on the UAV pictures would have led to a total
   maximum count of 284. The distribution of the balls in the field
   followed a simulated environmental gradient. We also were able to
   accurately estimate the relationship between the gradient and the
   distribution of balls. Our experiment demonstrates how this technology
   can be used to create precise distribution maps in which discrete
   regions of the study area are assigned a probability of presence of an
   object. Finally, we discuss the applicability and relevance of this
   experimental study to the case study of Florida manatee distribution at
   power plants.}},

Title = {{Functional Remineralization of Dentin Lesions Using Polymer-Induced
   Liquid-Precursor Process}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{It was hypothesized that applying the polymer-induced liquid-precursor
   (PILP) system to artificial lesions would result in time-dependent
   functional remineralization of carious dentin lesions that restores the
   mechanical properties of demineralized dentin matrix. 140 mm deep
   artificial caries lesions were remineralized via the PILP process for
   7-28 days at 37 degrees C to determine temporal remineralization
   characteristics. Poly-L-aspartic acid (27 KDa) was used as the polymeric
   process-directing agent and was added to the remineralization solution
   at a calcium-to-phosphate ratio of 2.14 (mol/mol). Nanomechanical
   properties of hydrated artificial lesions had a low reduced elastic
   modulus (E-R = 0.2 GPa) region extending about 70 mm into the lesion,
   with a sloped region to about 140 mm where values reached normal dentin
   (18-20 GPa). After 7 days specimens recovered mechanical properties in
   the sloped region by 51\% compared to the artificial lesion. Between
   7-14 days, recovery of the outer portion of the lesion continued to a
   level of about 10 GPa with 74\% improvement. 28 days of PILP
   mineralization resulted in 91\% improvement of E-R compared to the
   artificial lesion. These differences were statistically significant as
   determined from change-point diagrams. Mineral profiles determined by
   micro x-ray computed tomography were shallower than those determined by
   nanoindentation, and showed similar changes over time, but full mineral
   recovery occurred after 14 days in both the outer and sloped portions of
   the lesion. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray
   analysis showed similar morphologies that were distinct from normal
   dentin with a clear line of demarcation between the outer and sloped
   portions of the lesion. Transmission electron microscopy and selected
   area electron diffraction showed that the starting lesions contained
   some residual mineral in the outer portions, which exhibited poor
   crystallinity. During remineralization, intrafibrillar mineral increased
   and crystallinity improved with intrafibrillar mineral exhibiting the
   orientation found in normal dentin or bone.}},

Abstract = {{We report the plasmon-assisted photocurrent enhancement in
   Ag-nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) embedded PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM organic solar
   cells, and systematically investigate the causes of the improved optical
   absorption based on a cylindrical Ag-NPs optical model which is
   simulated with a 3-Dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD)
   method. The proposed cylindrical Ag-NPs optical model is able to explain
   the optical absorption enhancement by the localized surface plasmon
   resonance (LSPR) modes, and to provide a further understanding of Ag-NPs
   shape parameters which play an important role to determine the broadband
   absorption phenomena in plasmonic organic solar cells. A significant
   increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the plasmonic solar
   cell was experimentally observed and compared with that of the solar
   cells without Ag-NPs. Finally, our conclusion was made after briefly
   discussing the electrical effects of the fabricated plasmonic organic

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Functional validation is widely acknowledged as a major challenge for
   multicore architectures. Directed tests are promising since a
   significantly smaller number of directed tests can achieve the same
   coverage goal compared to constrained-random tests. SAT-based bounded
   model checking is effective for automated generation of directed tests
   (counterexamples). While existing approaches focus on clause forwarding
   between different bounds to reduce the test generation time, this
   article proposes a novel technique that exploits temporal, structural,
   and spatial symmetry in multicore designs at the same time. Our proposed
   technique enables the reuse of the knowledge learned from one core to
   the remaining cores in multicore architectures (structural symmetry),
   from one bound to the next for a give property (temporal symmetry), as
   well as from one property to other properties (spatial symmetry). The
   experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly
   (3-10 times) reduce overall test generation time compared to existing
   approaches.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology for coarse-grained atomistic
   simulation of inelastic material behavior including phase
   transformations in ceramics and dislocation mediated plasticity in
   metals. The methodology combines an atomistic formulation of balance
   equations and a modified finite element method. With significantly fewer
   degrees of freedom than those of a fully atomistic model and without
   additional constitutive rules but the interatomic force field, the new
   coarse-grained (CG) method is shown to be feasible in predicting the
   nonlinear constitutive responses of materials and also reproducing
   atomic-scale phenomena such as phase transformations (diamond ->
   beta-Sn) in silicon and dislocation nucleation and migration, formation
   of dislocation loops and stacking faults ribbons in single crystal
   nickel. Direct comparisons between CG and the corresponding full
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the present methodology is
   efficient and promising in modeling and simulation of inelastic material
   behavior without losing the essential atomistic features. The potential
   applications and the limitations of the CG method are also discussed.}},

Title = {{A Review of Turfgrass Fertilizer Management Practices: Implications for

Journal = {{HORTTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{280-291}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Urban watersheds include extensive turfgrass plantings that are
   associated with anthropocentric attitudes toward landscapes. Native and
   construction-disturbed urban soils often cannot supply adequate amounts
   of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) for the growth and beauty of
   landscape plants. Hence, fertilization of landscape plants is practiced.
   Mismanaged fertilization and irrigation practices represent a potential
   source of nutrients that may contribute to water quality impairment.
   This review focuses on turfgrass fertilization practices and their
   impacts on urban water quality. Research results show that fertilization
   during active growth periods enhances turfgrass nutrient uptake
   efficiencies. The major concern regarding the fertilization of turfgrass
   and landscape plants in urban watersheds, therefore, is selecting the
   proper combination of fertilizer rate, timing, and placement that
   maximizes nutrient utilization efficiency and reduces the risk for
   nutrient loss to water bodies. Encouraging individuals to adopt best
   management practices (BMPs) is a priority for watershed managers.
   Research has found that educational programs are an important part of
   changing fertilization habits and that education needs to be thorough
   and comprehensive, which is beyond the scope of many seminars and fact
   sheets currently in use.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous computing systems comprised of accelerators such as FPGAs,
   GPUs, and manycore processors coupled with standard microprocessors are
   becoming an increasingly popular solution for future computing systems
   due to their higher performance and energy efficiency. Although
   programming languages and tools are evolving to simplify device-level
   design, programming such systems is still difficult and time-consuming
   largely due to system-wide challenges involving communication between
   heterogeneous devices, which currently require ad hoc solutions. Most
   communication frameworks and APIs which have dominated parallel
   application development for decades were developed for homogeneous
   systems, and hence cannot be directly employed for hybrid systems. To
   solve this problem, this article presents the System Coordination
   Framework (SCF), which employs message passing to transparently enable
   communication between tasks described using different programming tools
   (and languages), and running on heterogeneous processing devices of
   systems from domains ranging from embedded systems to High-Performance
   Computing (HPC) systems. By hiding low-level architectural details of
   the underlying communication from an application designer, SCF can
   improve application development productivity, provide higher levels of
   application portability, and offer rapid design-space exploration of
   different task/device mappings. In addition, SCF enables custom
   communication synthesis that exploits mechanisms specific to different
   devices and platforms, which can provide performance improvements over
   generic solutions employed previously. Our results indicate a
   performance improvement of 28x and 682x by employing FPGA devices for
   two applications presented in this article, while simultaneously
   improving the developer productivity by approximately 2.5 to 5 times by
   using SCF.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely investigated as a technique
   for identifying pathological tissue; however, unrelated
   subject-to-subject variations in spectra complicate data analysis and
   interpretation. We describe and evaluate a new biosensing technique,
   differential laser-induced perturbation spectroscopy (DLIPS), based on
   deep ultraviolet (UV) photochemical perturbation in combination with
   difference spectroscopy. This technique combines sequential fluorescence
   probing (pre- and post-perturbation) with sub-ablative UV perturbation
   and difference spectroscopy to provide a new spectral dimension,
   facilitating two improvements over fluorescence spectroscopy. First, the
   differential technique eliminates significant variations in absolute
   fluorescence response within subject populations. Second, UV
   perturbations alter the extracellular matrix (ECM), directly coupling
   the DLIPS response to the biological structure. Improved biosensing with
   DLIPS is demonstrated in vivo in a murine model of chemically induced
   skin lesion development. Component loading analysis of the data
   indicates that the DLIPS technique couples to structural proteins in the
   ECM. Analysis of variance shows that DLIPS has a significant response to
   emerging pathology as opposed to other population differences. An
   optimal likelihood ratio classifier for the DLIPS dataset shows that
   this technique holds promise for improved diagnosis of epithelial
   pathology. Results further indicate that DLIPS may improve diagnosis of
   tissue by augmenting fluorescence spectra (i.e. orthogonal sensing). (C)

Abstract = {{The proper characterization of lightning electric and magnetic fields is
   very important for a number of reasons, such as the study and design of
   lightning protection and the validation of return stroke models. Also,
   an accurate late time response of the sensor used to record electric
   fields radiated by a lightning return stroke is very important to
   correctly detect, classify, and locate lightning discharges. Lightning
   fields are commonly obtained by integrating the output of antennas that
   produce replicas of the derivatives of the wanted quantities. The
   integration is carried out using either passive or active analog
   circuits that introduce a distortion in the form of a decay time
   constant that may affect the late-time response of the sensor. We derive
   the transfer function required for the reconstruction of signals
   integrated using a single-pole integrator commonly used in field and
   current waveform measurements. Making use of the convolution theorem, we
   propose an equation that changes a signal that resulted from integration
   with a given time constant, to the signal that would have been obtained
   if a different time constant had been used. Finally, we propose an
   equation to fully compensate a measured signal from an insufficient time
   constant of an analog integrator.}},

Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{77-91}},

Abstract = {{Bathymetry effects on the flow field at the transition between idealized
   estuaries and the adjacent ocean are studied with the Regional Ocean
   Modeling System (ROMS). Estuary width, depth, and channel direction at
   the shelf are used to determine flow characteristics in and out of an
   idealized estuary. The idealized estuary connects to an upstream
   boundary, where freshwater discharges, and an offshore tidal boundary.
   Tidally averaged salinity and flow structures are examined at the
   estuary mouth. A recirculation feature directly affects flow at the
   estuary mouth, especially in shallow and wide estuarine systems. The
   recirculation retards the exchange flow near the edges of the estuary
   mouth and consequently allows strengthening of the flow in the middle.
   The geometric shape of the estuarine channel affects the strength of the
   residual flow at the estuary mouth. The presence of an extended
   submarine channel on the shelf enhances the baroclinic circulation and
   stratification, and maximizes the salinity intrusion length without
   additional external forces. The direction of this submarine channel
   affects the exchange flow structures at the estuary/ocean transition
   zone in such a way that the salinity intrusion length increases with a
   left-turning channel (in the Kelvin wave sense of the fresh water flow
   direction). This is attributed to the competition between centrifugal
   and Coriolis forces. Flow characteristics described by the Kelvin and
   Ekman number, which outline channel geometric effects, are similar to
   previous studies. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{For the video retargeting problem which adjusts video content into a
   smaller display device, it is not clear how to balance the three
   conflicting design objectives: 1) visual interestingness preservation;
   2) temporal retargeting consistency; and 3) nondeformation. To
   understand their perceptual importance, we first identify that the
   latter two play a dominating role in making the retargeting results
   appealing. Then a statistical study on human response to the targeting
   scale is carried out, suggesting that the global preservation of
   contents pursued by most existing approaches is not necessary. Based on
   the newly prioritized objectives and the statistical findings, we design
   a video retargeting system which, as a refined homogeneous approach,
   addresses the temporal consistency issue holistically and is still
   capable of preserving high degree of visual interestingness. In
   particular, we propose a volume retargeting cost metric to jointly
   consider the retargeting objectives and formulate video retargeting as
   an optimization problem in graph representation. A dynamic programming
   solution is then given. In addition, we introduce a nonlinear fusion
   based attention model to measure the visual interestingness
   distribution. The experiment results from both image rendering and
   subjective tests indicate that our proposed attention modeling and video
   retargeting system outperform their conventional methods, respectively.}},

   spectral signatures. Ground inspection and management can be focused on
   these detected zones, rather than an entire grove, making it less
   labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a method to detect the
   areas of citrus groves infected with citrus greening disease
   {[}Huanglongbing (HLB)] using airborne hyperspectral and multispectral
   imaging. This would prevent further spread of infection with efficient
   management plans of infected areas. Two sets of hyperspectral images
   were acquired in 2007 and 2009, from different citrus groves in Florida.
   Multispectral images were acquired only in 2009. A comprehensive ground
   truthing based on ground measurements and visual check of the citrus
   trees was used for validating the results using 2007 images. In 2009, a
   more accurate polymerase chain reaction test for selected trees from
   ground truthing was carried out. With a handheld spectrometer, ground
   spectral measurements were obtained along with their degrees of
   infection. A hyperspectral imaging software (ENVI, ITT VIS) was used for
   the analysis. HLB infected areas were identified using image-derived
   spectral library, mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF), spectral angle
   mapping (SAM), and linear spectral unmixing. The accuracy of the MTMF
   method was greater than the other methods. The accuracy of SAM using
   multispectral images (87\%) was comparable to the results of the MTMF
   and also yielded higher accuracy when compared to SAM analysis on
   hyperspectral images. A possible inaccurate ground truthing for the
   grove in 2007 generated more false positives. (C) 2012 Society of

Abstract = {{The processing steps most responsible for yield loss in the manufacture
   of canned mussel meats are the thermal treatments of precooking to
   remove meats from shells, and thermal processing (retorting) to render
   the final canned product commercially sterile for long-term shelf
   stability. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate
   the impact of different combinations of process variables on the
   ultimate drained weight in the final mussel product (Mytilu chilensis),
   while verifying that any differences found were statistically and
   economically significant. The process variables selected for this study
   were precooking time, brine salt concentration, and retort temperature.
   Results indicated 2 combinations of process variables producing the
   widest difference in final drained weight, designated best combination
   and worst combination with 35\% and 29\% yield, respectively.
   Significance of this difference was determined by employing a Bootstrap
   methodology, which assumes an empirical distribution of statistical
   error. A difference of nearly 6 percentage points in total yield was
   found. This represents a 20\% increase in annual sales from the same
   quantity of raw material, in addition to increase in yield, the
   conditions for the best process included a retort process time 65\%
   shorter than that for the worst process, this difference in yield could
   have significant economic impact, important to the mussel canning
   industry.}},

   the enhancement to be due to the doping-induced shift in the graphene

Abstract = {{Objective. The objective of this study was to quantify the network
   complexity, information flow, and effect of critical-node failures on a
   prototypical regional anesthesia and perioperative pain medicine (RAPPM)
   service using social network analysis. Design. Pilot cross-sectional
   investigation. Setting. This study was conducted at a prototypical
   single-center, multi-location academic anesthesiology department with an
   active RAPPM service. Interventions. We constructed an empirically
   derived prototypical social network representative of a large academic
   RAPPM service. Outcome Measures. The primary objective was measurement
   of network complexity via network size, structure, and information flow
   metrics. The secondary objective identified, via network simulation,
   those nodes whose deletion via single, two-level, or three-level node
   failures would result in the greatest network fragmentation. Exploratory
   analyses measured the impact of nodal failures on the resulting network
   complexity. Results. The baseline network consisted of 84 nodes and 208
   edges with a low density of 0.03 and high Krackhardt hierarchy of 0.787.
   Nodes exhibited low average total degree centrality (mean +/- standard
   deviation {[}SD]) of 0.03 +/- 0.034 and mean eigenvector centrality of
   0.164 +/- 0.182. The RAPPM resident-on-call was identified as the
   critical node in a single-node failure, with the resulting network
   fragmentation increasing from 0 to 0.52 upon node failure. A two-level
   failure involved both the RAPPM resident-on-call as well as the RAPPM
   attending-on-call, with the resulting fragmentation expanding to 0.772.
   A three-level node failure included the RAPPM resident-on-call, the main
   block-room attending, and block room fellow with fragmentation
   increasing to 0.814. Conclusions. The RAPPM service entails considerable
   network complexity and increased hierarchy, but low centrality. The
   network is at considerable fragmentation risk from even single-node
   failure.}},

   of a compact (33 cm(3), 91 g) electrodynamic zero-net mass-flux (ZNMF)
   actuator for flow control applications. The electrodynamic actuation
   scheme employs a magnetic assembly to establish a radial magnetic field
   pattern with an imbedded current-carrying coil winding. The coil is
   attached to a composite diaphragm having a rigid center boss and
   compliant outer annular region. The magnetic field acting on the coil
   assembly is modeled using a one-dimensional magnetic circuit. The
   composite diaphragm is modeled as a transversely isotropic, annular
   clamped plate. An overall lumped-element electromechanical system model
   is obtained by combining previously developed lumped models of the
   cavity/neck structures with lumped models for the composite diaphragm
   and electrodynamic actuation. The complete lumped-element model is used
   to provide insight regarding performance characteristics and design
   limitations. The model is validated over a frequency range of 10-1000 Hz
   with hotwire anemometry measurements for both slot and orifice
   configurations for the jet. The model is useful as a design tool for
   electrodynamic ZNMF actuators.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most efficient solutions to complex and large-scale
   problems, multi-agent cooperation has been in the limelight for the past
   few decades. Recently, many research projects have focused on
   context-aware cooperation to dynamically provide complex services. As
   cooperation in the multi-agent systems (MASs) becomes more common,
   guaranteeing the security of such cooperation takes on even greater
   importance. However, existing security models do not reflect the agents'
   unique features, including cooperation and context-awareness. In this
   paper, we propose a Community-based Role interaction-based Access
   Control model (CRiBAC) to allow secure cooperation in MASs. To do this,
   we refine and extend our preliminary RiBAC model, which was proposed
   earlier to support secure interactions among agents, by introducing a
   new concept of interaction permission, and then extend it to CRiBAC to
   support community-based cooperation among agents. We analyze potential
   problems related to interaction permissions and propose two approaches
   to address them. We also propose an administration model to facilitate
   administration of CRiBAC policies. Finally, we present the
   implementation of a prototype system based on a sample scenario to
   assess the proposed work and show its feasibility. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A synthesis process for creating an iron-based magnetically stabilized
   porous structure is described in detail. The structure is used as the
   reactive substrate for a two-step water splitting, hydrogen production
   process. The stability and reactivity of a 205 g magnetically stabilized
   structure operating at 873, 973, 1023 and 1073 K over eleven consecutive
   oxidation and reduction cycles has been investigated. Applying an
   external magnetic field exploits sintering and controls the geometry of
   the matrix of particles inside the structure in a favorable manner so
   that the chemical reactivity of the structure remains intact. The
   experimental results demonstrate that this structure yields peak
   hydrogen production rates of approximately 29 cm(3)/(min g(Fe)) at 1073
   K without noticeable degradation over eleven consecutive cycles. The
   hydrogen production rate is considerably higher than those reported in
   the open literature for two-step water splitting processes. SEM images,
   hydrogen production rates, permeability of the bed, and the bed height
   confirm that the gas solid contact area and porosity of the magnetically
   stabilized porous structure is sustained after consecutive cycling at
   high reaction temperatures. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{A reduced-order nonlinear observer is developed to estimate the distance
   from a moving camera to a feature point on a static object (i.e., range
   identification), where full velocity and linear acceleration feedback of
   the calibrated camera is provided. The contribution of this work is to
   develop a global exponential range observer which can be used for a
   larger set of camera motions than existing observers. The observer is
   shown to be robust against external disturbances in the sense that the
   observer is (sic)(p)for all p is an element of {[}1, infinity] stable
   even if the target object is moving or the camera motion is perturbed.
   The presented observer identifies the range provided an observability
   condition commonly used in literature is satisfied and is shown to be
   exponentially stable even if camera motion satisfies a less restrictive
   observability condition. A sufficient condition on the observer gain is
   derived to prove stability using a Lyapunov-based analysis. Experimental
   results are provided to show robust performance of the observer using an
   autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, a visual servo control problem is formulated in the teach
   by showing framework with an objective to regulate a camera based on a
   reference (or desired) image obtained by a priori positioning the same
   camera at the desired task-space location. A new strategy is essential
   for a variety of applications where it may not be possible to position
   the camera a priori at the desired position/orientation. In this paper,
   a visual servo control approach, called ``teach by zooming{''}, is
   formulated where the objective is to position/orient a camera based on a
   reference image obtained by another camera. For example, a fixed camera
   providing a wide area view of the scene can zoom in on an object and
   record a desired image for another camera. A non-linear Lyapunov-based
   controller is designed to regulate the image features acquired by an
   on-board camera to the corresponding image feature coordinates in the
   desired image acquired by the fixed camera in the presence of uncertain
   camera calibration parameters. The proposed control formulation becomes
   identical to the well-known teach by showing controller when the
   camera-in-hand can be located a priori to the desired
   position/orientation; thus enabling control in a wide range of
   applications. Experimental results for regulation control of a 7
   degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator are provided to demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed visual servo controller. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{A modeling study on the response of Chesapeake Bay to hurricane events
   of Floyd and Isabel}},
Journal = {{OCEAN MODELLING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49-50}},
Pages = {{22-46}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The response of Chesapeake Bay to forcing from two hurricanes is
   investigated using an unstructured-grid three-dimensional hydrodynamic
   model SELFE. The model domain includes Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries,
   and the extended continental shelf in the mid-Atlantic Bight. The
   hurricanes chosen for the study are Hurricane Floyd (1999) and Hurricane
   Isabel (2003), both of which made landfall within 100 km of the mouth of
   the Bay. The model results agree reasonably well with field observations
   of water level, velocity, and salinity. From the Bay's water level
   response to the hurricanes, it was found that the storm surge in the Bay
   has two distinct stages: an initial stage set up by the remote winds and
   the second stage - a primary surge induced by the local winds. For the
   initial stage, the rising of the coastal sea level was setup by the
   remote wind of both hurricanes similarly, but for the second stage, the
   responses to the two hurricanes' local winds are significantly
   different. Hurricane Floyd was followed by down-Bay winds that canceled
   the initial setup and caused a set-down from the upper Bay. Hurricane
   Isabel, on the other hand, was followed by up-Bay winds, which
   reinforced the initial setup and continued to rise up against the head
   of the Bay. From the perspective of volume and salt fluxes, it is
   evident that an oceanic saltwater influx is pushed into the Bay from the
   continental shelf by the remote wind fields in the initial stages of the
   storm surge for both Floyd and Isabel. In the second stage after the
   hurricane made landfall, the Bay's local wind plays a key role in
   modulating the salinity and velocity fields through vertical mixing and
   longitudinal salt transport. Controlled numerical experiments are
   conducted in order to identify and differentiate the roles played by the
   local wind in stratified and destratified conditions. Down-estuary local
   wind stress (of Hurricane Floyd-type) tends to enhance stratification
   under moderate winds, but exhibits an increasing-then-decreasing stage
   when the wind stress increases. The up-estuary local wind stress (of
   Hurricane Isabel-type) tends to penetrate deeper into the water column,
   which reduces stratification by reversing gravitational circulation. To
   characterize mixing conditions in the estuary, a modified horizontal
   Richardson number that incorporates wind stress, wind direction,
   horizontal salinity gradient, and vertical eddy viscosity is used for
   both hurricanes. Finally, the direct precipitation of rainfall into the
   Bay during Hurricane Floyd appears to create not only a thin surface
   layer of low salinity but also a seaward barotropic pressure gradient
   that affects the subsequent redistribution of salinity after the storm.

Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{223}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1995-2005}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A new speciation model developed and implemented in Polymath was found
   to be successful in predicting struvite precipitation in soils. Struvite
   (NH4MgPO4) has been identified as a mineral for the recovery of nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P). Predicting struvite precipitation potential in
   soil is important for optimal quantification of nutrient species.
   Polymath and Visual Minteq models were used for prediction of several
   solid phases in the soil. One approach to immobilize P for solid-phase
   formation is by co-blending. Immobilization was achieved through the
   blending of an Al-based water treatment residual (Al-WTR) and with
   Ca-Mg-based materials {[}slag and magnesium oxide (MgO)]. The results
   suggest that Polymath model revealed solid Phases of dicalcium phosphate
   pentahydrate (DCPP), magnesium hydroxide (MHO), magnesium orthophosphate
   (v) docosahydrate (MP22), magnesium orthophosphate (v) octahydrate
   (MP8), and struvite, which were lacking in the modeling from Visual
   Minteq. Residual leachate from the co-blended amendments; Soil+WTR+Slag,
   Soil+WTR+MgO, Soil+MgO, Soil+Slag, Soil+WTR, and the control (without
   amendment) had struvite of 353, 199, 119, 90, 37, and 12 mg l(-1),
   respectively. This implies that struvite, a phosphate mineral can be
   precipitated in the soil and could be released as nutrients for plant
   uptake. Struvite precipitation in soil and for reuse may reduce cost and
   may be a safe practice for sustainable environmental nutrient
   management.}},

Title = {{Identifying irrigation and nitrogen best management practices for sweet
   corn production on sandy soils using CERES-Maize model}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{61-70}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Research based crop-specific best management practices (BMPs) must be
   developed for sweet corn (Zea mays L var. saccharata) production to
   reduce the amount of nitrogen (N) leaching. The objective of this study
   was to identify irrigation and nitrogen BMPs for sweet corn production
   on sandy soils in Florida using the calibrated CERES-Maize model of the
   Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). A total of
   24 irrigation schedules, 21 N fertilizer levels, 30 N application
   splits, and 20 N application rates per split were systematically
   evaluated in single factor simulations. Then, a set of 324 management
   scenarios composed of 6 irrigation timing/amount and 54 N fertilizer
   application strategies selected in early single factor explorations, was
   explored in a multifactor analysis.
   Irrigation frequency had a strong influence on sweet corn yield. If
   irrigation events were triggered when maximum allowable depletion (MAD)
   of soil water content was greater than 60\%, corn growth suffered water
   stress and the simulated yield was reduced. The increase in yield
   approached zero above 168 kg N ha(-1). Splitting N fertilizer
   applications did not influence yield if there was an N application
   during the small-leaf stage or large-leaf stage; however, the lowest
   amount of N leaching occurred when no N was applied during the
   small-leaf stage. Simulated yield increased when application rates
   decreased from 100 to 70 kg N ha(-1) per fertigation event, but changed
   only slightly at application rates less than 70 kg N ha(-1) per
   fertigation. Smaller application rates per fertigation decreased N
   leaching substantially, especially for rates less than 70 kg N ha(-1).
   Six potential BMPs were selected from the 324 management scenarios as
   optimizing yield while minimizing N leaching. These BMPs were composed
   of two irrigation schedules (depths of 5.0 and 7.5 mm with MAD values of
   20\% and 30\%), two N levels (196 and 224 kg N ha(-1)), two N split
   plans (0-1/4-3/4 and 0-1/3-2/3 of total N applied in the small-leaf,
   large-leaf, and ear development stages, respectively), and two N
   application rates per fertigation (30 and 40 kg N ha(-1)). It should be
   recognized that these results are recommendations based on modeling
   assumptions and should be tested in actual field production for their
   practical and economic validity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study combined chemical analyses and biological measurements
   to investigate biphasic effects of La on Cd stress in leaves of Vicia
   faba seedlings, which were hydroponically cultivated for 15 d in the
   combination of 6?mu M CdCl2 and 2 to 480?mu M La(NO3)3, respectively.
   The results showed that contents of Cd first elevated above and then
   declined below the 6?mu M single Cd treatment when 2 to 30?mu M
   extraneous La were combined. Contents of mineral nutrients altered
   differentially and became imbalanced. No distinct band was observed in
   catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), or ascorbate peroxidase (APX)
   patterns, but in superoxide dismutase (SOD) isozymes by the
   supplementation with 8 to 480?mu M of extraneous La. Superoxide
   dismutase and APX activities changed as a U-shaped curve; however, CAT
   and GPX changed as an inverted U-shaped curve along with increasing La.
   Moreover, heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) production was reduced below
   the single treatment of Cd at 2 to 8?mu M of extraneous La and enhanced
   thereafter. Thus, La at lower concentrations promoted antioxidation
   against Cd stress; La at higher concentrations turned to prooxidant
   effects, implicating potential ecological risk. Heat shock protein 70,
   combined with the antioxidant enzymes, constitutes an integrative
   defense system, which can be used to estimate the degree of
   antioxidation or prooxidation of extraneous La to Cd-induced oxidative
   stress in the seedlings. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012;31:13551362. (c)

Abstract = {{Heart function measured by electrocardiograms (ECG) is crucial for
   patient care. ECG generated waveforms are used to find patterns of
   irregularities in cardiac cycles in patients. In many cases,
   irregularities evolve over an extended period of time that requires
   continuous monitoring. However, this requires wireless ECG recording
   devices. These devices consist of an enclosed system that includes
   electrodes, processing circuitry, and a wireless communication block
   imposing constraints on area, power, bandwidth, and resolution. In order
   to provide continuous monitoring of cardiac functions for real-time
   diagnostics, we propose a methodology that combines compression and
   analysis of heartbeats. The signal encoding scheme is the time-based
   integrate and fire sampler. The diagnostics can be performed directly on
   the samples avoiding reconstruction required by the competing finite
   rate of innovation and compressed sensing. As an added benefit, our
   scheme provides an efficient hardware implementation and a compressed
   representation for the ECG recordings, while still preserving
   discriminative features. We demonstrate the performance of our approach
   through a heartbeat classification application consisting of normal and
   irregular heartbeats known as arrhythmia. Our approach that uses simple
   features extracted from ECG signals is comparable to results in the
   published literature.}},

Abstract = {{We present a geometric framework for explicit derivation of multivariate
   sampling functions (sinc) on multidimensional lattices. The approach
   leads to a generalization of the link between sinc functions and the

   approach also provides a frequency partition of the spectrum that leads
   to a nonseparable extension of the 1-D Shannon (sinc) wavelets to the
   multivariate setting. Moreover, we propose a generalization of the
   Lanczos window function that provides a practical and unbiased approach
   for signal reconstruction on sampling lattices. While this framework is
   general for lattices of any dimension, we specifically characterize all
   2-D and 3-D lattices and show the detailed derivations for 2-D hexagonal
   body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices. Both
   visual and numerical comparisons validate the theoretical expectations

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{374-385}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Current image representation schemes have limited capability of
   representing two-dimensional (2D) singularities (e.g. edges in an
   image). Wavelet transform has better performance in representing
   one-dimensional (1D) singularities than Fourier transform. Recently
   invented ridgelet and curvelet transform achieve better performance in
   resolving 2D singularities than wavelet transform. To further improve
   the capability of representing 2D singularities, this study proposes a
   new transform called ripplet transform type II (ripplet-II). The new
   transform is able to capture 2D singularities along a family of curves
   in images. In fact, ridgelet transform is a special case of ripplet-II
   transform with degree 1. Ripplet-II transform provides the freedom in
   parameter settings, which can be optimised for specific problems.
   Ripplet-II transform can be used for feature extraction because of its
   efficiency in representing edges and textures. Experiments in texture
   classification and image retrieval demonstrate that the ripplet-II
   transform-based scheme outperforms wavelet and ridgelet transform-based
   approaches.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING}},

Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{365-397}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers an important class of convex programming (CP)
   problems, namely, the stochastic composite optimization (SCO), whose
   objective function is given by the summation of general nonsmooth and
   smooth stochastic components. Since SCO covers non-smooth, smooth and
   stochastic CP as certain special cases, a valid lower bound on the rate
   of convergence for solving these problems is known from the classic
   complexity theory of convex programming. Note however that the
   optimization algorithms that can achieve this lower bound had never been
   developed. In this paper, we show that the simple mirror-descent
   stochastic approximation method exhibits the best-known rate of
   convergence for solving these problems. Our major contribution is to
   introduce the accelerated stochastic approximation (AC-SA) algorithm
   based on Nesterov's optimal method for smooth CP (Nesterov in Doklady AN
   SSSR 269:543-547, 1983; Nesterov in Math Program 103:127-152, 2005), and
   show that the AC-SA algorithm can achieve the aforementioned lower bound
   on the rate of convergence for SCO. To the best of our knowledge, it is
   also the first universally optimal algorithm in the literature for
   solving non-smooth, smooth and stochastic CP problems. We illustrate the
   significant advantages of the AC-SA algorithm over existing methods in
   the context of solving a special but broad class of stochastic
   programming problems.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal inundation from hurricane storm surges causes catastrophic
   damage to lives and property, as evidenced by recent hurricanes
   including Katrina and Wilma in 2005 and Ike in 2008. Changes in
   hurricane activity and sea level due to a warming climate, together with
   growing coastal population, are expected to increase the potential for
   loss of property and lives. Current inundation hazard maps: Base Flood
   Elevation maps and Maximum of Maximums are computationally expensive to
   create in order to fully represent the hurricane climatology, and do not
   account for climate change. This paper evaluates the coastal inundation
   hazard in Southwest Florida for present and future climates, using a
   high resolution storm surge modeling system, CH3D-SSMS, and an optimal
   storm ensemble with multivariate interpolation, while accounting for
   climate change. Storm surges associated with the optimal storms are
   simulated with CH3D-SSMS and the results are used to obtain the response
   to any storm via interpolation, allowing accurate representation of the
   hurricane climatology and efficient generation of hazard maps.
   Incorporating the impact of anticipated climate change on hurricane and
   sea level, the inundation maps for future climate scenarios are made and
   affected people and property estimated. The future climate scenarios
   produce little change to coastal inundation, due likely to the reduction
   in hurricane frequency, except when extreme sea level rise is included.
   Calculated coastal inundation due to sea level rise without using a
   coastal surge model is also determined and shown to significantly
   overestimate the inundation due to neglect of land dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
   were used to host activated carbon (aC) microparticles to fabricate
   freestanding composite electrodes without the use of polymer binders.
   The aC-SWNT composite electrodes with up to 50 wt. \% aC showed specific
   surface areas approaching 1000 m(2)/g and electrical conductivities > 36
   S/cm. The composite electrodes possessed the properties of both pure
   SWNT electrodes (e.g. low ohmic drop and rapid ion diffusion) and
   activated carbon particles (e.g. high specific capacitance). With an
   interconnected mesoporous microstructure and high electrical
   conductivity, the CNT networks provide an attractive alternative to
   polymer binders for forming freestanding electrodes for electrical
   energy storage devices. Here we show that micron-sized particles can be
   supported in this framework to utilize the performance enhancement and
   robustness provided by CNTs. Symmetric electrochemical capacitors
   fabricated with the electrodes in 6 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous

Abstract = {{Secure transmission of information over wireless channels in the
   presence of an eavesdropper has attracted much attention recently.
   Previous work assumes that a transmitter has perfect knowledge of the
   channel side information (CSI) of the legitimate channel and the
   eavesdropper's channel. To loosen this strong requirement, this paper
   considers the case where a transmitter has perfect knowledge of the CSI
   of the legitimate channel and only the average channel gain of the
   eavesdropper's channel. In this case, some information may be leaked to
   the eavesdropper because the eavesdropper's channel may have a higher
   gain than the legitimate channel. Hence, we propose, for the first time,
   to study leakage-probability-constrained secrecy capacity of a fading
   channel, that is, secrecy capacity under the constraint on leakage
   probability. We also propose an optimal power allocation strategy that
   maximizes leakage-probability-constrained secrecy capacity under average
   power constraint. Moreover, we study the impact of the bias of the
   average gain estimate of the eavesdropper's channel on
   leakage-probability-constrained secrecy capacity. Copyright (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Digital multimedia makes fabricating and copying much easier than ever
   before. Therefore, it demands efficient and automatic techniques to
   identify and verify the content of digital multimedia. Image
   authentication is such a technique to automatically identify whether the
   query image is a fabrication or a simple copy of the original one. In
   this paper, we propose a perceptual image authentication technique based
   on clustering and matching of feature points of images. Feature points
   are first extracted from images with the k-largest local total
   variations and clustered using Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. Then,
   feature points in the query image and the anchor image are matched into
   pairs in zigzag ordering along the diagonals of the images cluster by
   cluster. In the mean time, the outliers of feature points are removed.
   Then, the system decisions about the authenticity of images are
   determined by the majority vote of whether three types of distance
   between matched feature point pairs are larger than their respective
   thresholds. The three types of distance include the following: (i)
   histogram-weighted distance, which is proposed in this paper; (ii) the
   normalized Euclidean distance; and (iii) the Hausdorff distance. The
   geometric transform between the query image and the anchor image is
   estimated, and the query image is registered. The possible tampered
   image blocks are detected, and the percentage of the tampered area is
   roughly estimated. The experimental results show the effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed image authentication system. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{A simplified model of corona discharge on overhead wire has been
   proposed for propagating surge computations using the finite-difference
   time-domain method. The radial progression of corona streamers from the
   wire is represented as the radial expansion of cylindrical conducting
   region whose conductivity is several tens of microsiemens per meter. Two
   wire radii are considered: 5 and 2 mm, in order to simulate two
   experimental configurations by Noda. The critical electric field on the
   surface of a 5-mm radius wire for corona initiation is set to E-0 = 1.8
   or 2.9 MV/m. For a 2-mm radius wire, it is set to E-0 = 2.2 MV/m. The
   critical background electric field necessary for streamer propagation is
   set to E-cp = 0.5 MV/m for positive voltage application, and E-cn = 1.5
   MV/m for negative voltage application. The computed waveform of radial
   current (including both conduction and displacement currents) agrees
   well with the corresponding measured waveform. Also, the computed
   relation between the total charge (charge residing on the wire and
   emanated corona charge) and applied voltage (qV curve) agrees well with
   the corresponding measured one, except for relatively low applied
   voltages. Additionally, the increase of coupling between the energized
   wire and another one nearby due to corona discharge is well reproduced.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses issues of safety in pervasive spaces. We show how
   pervasive systems are different from traditional computer systems, and
   how their cyberphysical nature ties intimately with the users. Errors
   and conflicts in such space could have detrimental, dangerous or
   undesired effects on the user, the space, or the devices. There are no
   support systems or programming models conscious of the issue of safety.
   Unrestrained programming is the model de jour, which is inadequate. We
   need a programming model that encourages and obligates various roles
   engaged in the development of pervasive spaces to contribute to
   increasing safety. We propose a model that utilizes role-specific safety
   knowledge, and that takes advantage of the rich sensing and actuations
   capabilities of pervasive systems to detect and handle ``conflicting
   contexts{''} and prevent or detect/avert ``impermissible contexts{''}.
   We present our model and discuss how it mitigates overall safety risks
   in presence of uncertainty due to multiple independent roles.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization techniques are widely used in embedded systems design to
   improve overall area, performance and energy requirements. Dynamic cache
   reconfiguration is very effective to reduce energy consumption of cache
   subsystems which accounts for about half of the total energy consumption
   in embedded systems. Various studies have shown that code compression
   can significantly reduce memory requirements, and may improve
   performance in many scenarios. In this paper, we study the challenges
   and associated opportunities in integrating dynamic cache
   reconfiguration with code compression to retain the advantages of both
   approaches. We developed efficient heuristics to explore large space of
   two-level cache hierarchy in order to study the effect of a two-level
   cache on energy consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that
   synergistic combination of cache reconfiguration and code compression
   can significantly reduce both energy consumption (61\% on average) and
   memory requirements while drastically improve the overall performance
   (up to 75\%) compared to dynamic cache reconfiguration alone. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Inactivation of collected viral aerosols is important for preventing a
   filter medium's serving as a fomite. The focus of this study was to
   evaluate the inactivation efficiency (IE) achieved through filtration
   coupled with microwave irradiation. MS2 aerosolized through a Collison
   nebulizer was fed into the system and collected onto the filter. For
   in-flight microwave decontamination, microwave irradiation was applied
   to an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) filter supported
   on a SiC disk for three cycles of selected irradiation times per 10 min
   (i.e., 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min/10 min) at power levels ranging from 125 W
   to 375 W. The survival fraction (SF) on the substrate and the IE through
   the entire system were investigated to determine the efficacy of this
   approach. SF decreased and IE increased as microwave power level was
   increased (p = 0.02 and p < 0.01, respectively) or the application time
   was extended (p = 0.03 and p < 0.01, respectively). Both measures
   changed sharply above a threshold temperature of around 90 degrees C and
   reached 2 logs at 116 and 109 degrees C, respectively. The log SF and IE
   of -2.59 and 3.62, respectively, were observed when the operating
   condition of 375 W for 10 min/cycle was used and the SiC disk
   facilitated microwave absorption. When a quartz frit was used as a
   support instead of the SiC disk, log inactivation efficiencies of 0.8,
   1.0, and 1.3 were measured at relative humidities of 30\%, 60\% and
   90\%, respectively, under the same irradiation conditions. Relative
   humidity is a significant parameter from 50-80 degrees C (p = 0.01). The
   results demonstrate that microwave-assisted filtration systems can be
   used as an effective means for inactivating viruses.}},

Abstract = {{A critical analysis of the correction factor for the come-up time (CUT)
   introduced by Dr. C. Olin Ball in his Formula Method for thermal process
   calculations is described in this manuscript. In the General Method, the
   effect of the CUT is included in the calculated lethality value as long
   as numerical integration is carried out over the entire cold spot
   temperature-time profile from the point when the steam is turned on. The
   hypothesis of this communication is that Ball's Formula Method, just
   like the General Method, includes the effect of the CUT in its
   calculations. Ball's Formula Method utilizes a ``curve fitting{''} of
   the experimental time-temperature data regardless of where the time zero
   is placed within the come-up time. Therefore, the effect of the CUT is
   automatically included, because, as in the General Method, Ball's
   Formula Method is fitting and managing experimental data. In addition,
   the regressed time-temperature data used for lethality calculations are
   exactly the same independent of the time zero location. To evaluate the
   rationale of the CUT correction factor, computer-simulated
   time-temperature data and experimental runs were evaluated with time
   zero shifted to different locations (100, 70, 42, 20 and 0\% of the
   CUT). In addition, the effect of the CUT (shape and length) was studied
   in terms of (Heating) and accuracy compared to the General Method.
   Independent of the time shift (the location of time zero), the
   calculations according to the Formula Method for total heating time ( +
   CUT) were always the same. This work states that it is not necessary to
   shift the location of time zero in Ball's Formula Method because the
   calculations over the curve fitting time-temperature data will always
   include the effect of the CUT regardless of where time zero is placed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study correlating frictional
   behavior with in situ voltammetry for a unidirectional sliding contact
   between a hemispherical tipped alumina probe and a flat rotating copper
   counterface (maximum Hertzian contact pressure of 68 MPa and sliding
   speed of 10 mm/s). The contact was immersed in an aqueous 0.1 M Na2CO3
   solution (pH similar to 11) where the copper counterface acted as the
   working electrode in a potentiostat controlled three-electrode cell; a
   coiled Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel
   electrode (SCE) as the reference. Clear and reproducible trends were
   found between friction coefficient and published data suggesting the
   onset of particular redox reactions, graphically presented in a
   frictional voltammetry plot. At anodic potentials primarily associated
   with the formation of copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) (V vs SCE similar to
   a'0.25), the measured friction coefficient was in the range mu similar
   to 0.4-0.5. At cathodic potentials primarily associated with the
   formation of CuO, Cu(OH)(2), and CuCO3 (V vs SCE similar to a'0.10), the
   friction coefficient transitions to the range mu similar to 0.7-1.0. At
   sustained cathodic potentials associated with reduction of the native
   copper oxide, Cu2O, (V vs SCE similar to a'0.65), the friction
   coefficient is observed to fluctuate between mu similar to 0.2 and 0.5,
   arguably a result of exposure of bare copper due to non-uniform
   reduction (fractional coverage) of Cu2O.}},

Abstract = {{We present a non-dimensional analytical model for crack propagation in a
   z-pinned double cantilever beam specimen (DCB) under mode I loading.
   Effect of various design parameters on the crack bridging length and
   apparent fracture toughness are investigated using this model. The
   efficacy of the analytical model is evaluated by comparing the results
   with 3D finite element (FE) simulations of the DCB. In the FE model the
   z-pins are modeled as discrete nonlinear elements. Bi-linear cohesive
   elements are used ahead of the crack tip to account for the interlaminar
   fracture toughness of the composite material. The results for
   load-deflection and crack length obtained from the analytical model and
   the FE model are compared and found to be in good agreement. The
   proposed non-dimensional analytical model will be useful in the design
   and analysis of translaminar reinforcements for composite structures.

Abstract = {{The application of data-driven time series analysis techniques such as
   Granger causality, partial directed coherence and phase dynamics
   modeling to estimate effective connectivity in brain networks has
   recently gained significant prominence in the neuroscience community.
   While these techniques have been useful in determining causal
   interactions among different regions of brain networks, a thorough
   analysis of the comparative accuracy and robustness of these methods in
   identifying patterns of effective connectivity among brain networks is
   still lacking. In this paper, we systematically address this issue
   within the context of simple networks of coupled spiking neurons.
   Specifically, we develop a method to assess the ability of various
   effective connectivity measures to accurately determine the true
   effective connectivity of a given neuronal network. Our method is based
   on decision tree classifiers which are trained using several time series
   features that can be observed solely from experimentally recorded data.
   We show that the classifiers constructed in this work provide a general
   framework for determining whether a particular effective connectivity
   measure is likely to produce incorrect results when applied to a
   dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Anatase titanium dioxide is a promising negative electrode material for
   Li-ion batteries. However, the low intrinsic electrical conductivity and
   poor cycling performance have limited its application. In this work,
   titanium dioxide flakes have been synthesized through a simple spreading
   method that is easily scalable. The calcined titanium dioxide flakes
   exhibit larger reversible charge/discharge capacity, better rate
   capability and excellent cycling stability compared to anatase titanium
   dioxide nanoparticles. The larger surface area of the flakes leads to a
   larger electrode/electrolyte contact area, shorter solid state path
   lengths for both Li-ion and electron transport, which results in the
   better rate capability. The cycling performance was significantly
   improved by the porous structure of the calcined titanium dioxide
   flakes. Strategies for improving the volumetric energy density of the
   flakes are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A conventional flexural beam test subjected to environmental
   conditioning, especially cyclic wetting and drying, results in a
   non-uniformly damaged specimen at the cross section as well as
   non-uniform stress distributions. Some limitations for durability
   evaluation can cause an erroneous behavior of fiber pullout. To obtain a
   uniform stress distribution at the failure surface with minimized
   thickness, this paper evaluated transport properties affecting the
   movement of deleterious materials into FRC. The most common fiber types
   and volume fractions used in industry were chosen with input from the
   manufacturers. Steel fiber at 1\%, PP fiber at 0.5\%, and PVA fiber at
   0.75\% were used. The absorption test by capillary action was identified
   as the critical transport mechanism to produce an effective cyclic
   wetting conditioning and uniformly damaged specimen. It was found that a
   7-day conditioning cycle and 25 mm thickness were appropriate to
   maximize the transport of the harmful materials with a minimized
   conditioning period. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Given the fundamental differences in carrier generation and device
   operation in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and organic
   photovoltaic (OPV) devices, the material design principles to apply may
   be expected to differ. In this respect, designing organic semiconductors
   that perform effectively in multiple device configurations remains a
   challenge. Following ``donor-acceptor{''} principles, we designed and
   synthesized an analogous series of solution-processable pi-conjugated
   polymers that combine the electron-rich dithienosilole (DTS) moiety,
   unsubstituted thiophene spacers, and the electron-deficient core
   2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD). Insights into backbone geometry and wave
   function delocalization as a function of molecular structure are
   provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the
   B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Using a combination of X-ray techniques (2D-WAXS
   and XRD) supported by solid-state NMR (SS-NMR) and atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), we demonstrate fundamental correlations between the
   polymer repeat-unit structure, molecular weight distribution, nature of
   the solubilizing side-chains appended to the backbones, and extent of
   structural order attainable in p-channel OTFTs. In particular, it is
   shown that the degree of microstructural order achievable in the
   self-assembled organic semiconductors increases largely with (i)
   increasing molecular weight and (ii) appropriate solubilizing-group
   substitution. The corresponding field-effect hole mobilities are
   enhanced by several orders of magnitude, reaching up to 0.1 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1) the highest molecular weight fraction of the branched
   alkyl-substituted polymer derivative in this series. This trend is
   reflected in conventional bulk-heterojunction OPV devices using PC71BM,
   whereby the active layers exhibit space-charge-limited (SCL) hole
   mobilities approaching 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and yield improved power
   conversion efficiencies on the order of 4.6\% under AM1.5G solar
   illumination. Beyond structure performance correlations, we observe a
   large dependence of the ionization potentials of the polymers estimated
   by electrochemical methods on polymer packing, and expect that these
   empirical results may have important consequences on future material
   study and device applications.}},

Abstract = {{Pain can have a throbbing quality, especially when it is severe and
   disabling. It is widely held that this throbbing quality is a primary
   sensation of one's own arterial pulsations, arising directly from the
   activation of localized pain-sensory neurons by closely apposed blood
   vessels. We examined this presumption more closely by simultaneously
   recording the subjective report of the throbbing rhythm and the arterial
   pulse in human subjects of either sex with throbbing dental pain-a
   prevalent condition whose pulsatile quality is widely regarded a primary
   sensation. Contrary to the generally accepted view, which would predict
   a direct correspondence between the two, we found that the throbbing
   rate (44 bpm +/- 3 SEM) was much slower than the arterial pulsation rate
   (73 bpm +/- 2 SEM, p < 0.001), and that the two rhythms exhibited no
   underlying synchrony. Moreover, the beat-to-beat variation in arterial
   and throbbing events observed distinct fractal properties, indicating
   that the physiological mechanisms underlying these rhythmic events are
   distinct. Confirmation of the generality of this observation in other
   pain conditions would support an alternative hypothesis that the
   throbbing quality is not a primary sensation but rather an emergent
   property, or perception, whose ``pacemaker{''} lies within the CNS.
   Future studies leading to an improved understanding of the
   neurobiological basis of clinically relevant pain qualities, such as
   throbbing, will also enhance our ability to measure and therapeutically
   target severe and disabling pain.}},

Abstract = {{The harvest of intact cerebral microvessel yields could permit the in
   vitro characterization of mechanisms that underlie numerous
   vascular-linked central nervous system (CNS) phenomena. Here, we test
   (1) the effect of mild enzyme digestion on microvessel purity and yield;
   and then (2) the effect of variable centrifugation and filtration
   methods on microvessel yields. The brains of female Sprague-Dawley rats
   (4 weeks-old: n = 38) were removed rapidly and homogenized. In
   Experiments 1 and 2, brain homogenates were incubated in DMEM or a
   solution of papain (2.5 U/ml), DNAse I (250 U/ml) and dispase II (1
   U/ml) in DMEM for 15 min at 37 degrees C before microvessels were
   purified using differential (20\% Ficoll) and then discontinuous
   (15/20\% Dextran) centrifugation (@3500 x g) and collected with glass
   bead column filtration. Enzymatic digestion decreased microvessel yields
   (27 vs. 12k/g tissue; p = 0.053) but increased microvessel purity by
   decreasing adherent cells (p = 0.002), which included NF-L+ neurons (p <
   0.05) and GFAP(+). astrocytes (p < 0.001) and astrocyte endfeet (p <
   0.01). After one week in culture, >85\% of harvested cells
   morphologically resembled microvessels and expressed the vascular
   proteins lectin and/or RECA-1. Finally, microvessels yields decreased
   when discontinuous centrifugation was omitted or nylon mesh filtration
   was employed. In summary, we found that digesting brain homogenates
   enzymatically could improve the purity of harvested microvessels that
   could be cultured for at least a week. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed wideband electric field waveforms of 265 first and 349
   subsequent return strokes in negative natural lightning. The distances
   ranged from 10 to 330 km. Evolution of first-and subsequent-stroke field
   waveforms as a function of distance is examined. Statistics on the
   following field waveform parameters are given: initial electric field
   peak, opposite-polarity overshoot, ratio of the initial electric field
   peak to the opposite polarity overshoot, zero-to-peak risetime, initial
   half-cycle duration, and opposite polarity overshoot duration. The
   overwhelming majority of both first and subsequent return-stroke field
   waveforms at 50 to 330 km exhibit an opposite polarity overshoot. At
   distances greater than 100 km, electric field waveforms, recorded under
   primarily daytime conditions, tend to be oscillatory. Using finite
   difference time domain modeling, we interpreted the initial positive
   half-cycle and the opposite-polarity overshoot as the ground wave and
   the second positive half-cycle as the one-hop ionospheric reflection.
   The observed difference in arrival times of these two waves for
   subsequent strokes is considerably smaller than for first strokes,
   suggesting that the first-stroke electromagnetic field caused a descent
   of the ionospheric D-layer. We speculate that there may be cumulative
   effect of multiple strokes in lowering the ionospheric reflection
   height. Return-stroke peak currents estimated from the empirical
   formula, I = 1.5-0.037DE (where I is considered negative and in kA, E is
   the electric field peak considered positive and in V/m, and D is
   distance in km), are compared to those reported by the NLDN.}},

Abstract = {{We examine VHF interferometric images, channel-base currents, and
   broadband electric field waveforms of the initial stage (IS) in two
   rocket-and-wire triggered lightning flashes. Two types of negative
   leaders, termed ``long-duration{''} and ``short-duration{''} leaders,
   were imaged by the VHF interferometers during the IS of the two flashes.
   There were three leaders that had relatively long durations of more than
   a few milliseconds. These three leaders were not accompanied by a
   significant change of channel-base current during their early stages of
   development, indicating that they corresponded to intracloud (IC)
   discharges that were not connected to the grounded triggered-lightning
   channel. Two of these three leaders eventually connected to the
   triggered-lightning channel and initiated initial continuous current
   (ICC) pulses. The third long-duration leader apparently developed from
   the vicinity of an isolated negative charge region toward an upper-level
   positive charge region and toward a branch of the grounded channel; it
   served to bridge the positive charge region and the triggered-lightning
   channel, resulting in the opposite polarity portion of the bipolar ICC.
   The short-duration negative leaders had durations of some hundreds of
   microseconds. These negative leaders apparently recoiled along the
   conductive channels created by branches of the upward positive leader
   (UPL); they initiated ICC pulses when the grounded channel was
   sufficiently conductive. It follows that ICC pulses can be initiated
   either by recoil leaders or via interception of separate in-cloud
   leaders by a grounded current-carrying channel.}},

   (P3HT:PCBM) and the cathode (Al top electrode), were fabricated. The
   devices were annealed at 145 degrees C either before or after depositing
   the top electrode. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   effects of the ZnO buffer layer and pre-/post-fabrication annealing on
   the general performance of these devices. The short-circuit current
   density (J(SC)), open-circuit voltage (V-OC) and the external quantum
   efficiency (EQE) of the OPV devices were improved by the insertion of
   the ZnO layer and post-fabrication annealing. The post-fabrication
   annealed devices, with or without the ZnO layer, exhibited higher values
   of J(SC), V-OC and EQE than those of similar devices annealed before
   depositing the Al metal. This can be attributed to, among other things,
   improved charge transport across the interface between the photoactive
   layer and the Al top electrode as a result of post-annealing induced
   modification of the interface morphology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We characterize the geometrical and electrical characteristics of the
   initial stages of nine Florida triggered lightning discharges using a
   Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) and measured channel-base currents. We
   determine initial channel and subsequent branch lengths, average initial
   channel and branch propagation speeds, and channel-base current at the
   time of each branch initiation. The channel-base current is found to not
   change significantly when branching occurs, an unexpected result. The
   initial stage of Florida triggered lightning typically transitions from
   vertical to horizontal propagation at altitudes of 3-6 km, near the
   typical freezing level of 4 km and several kilometers below the expected
   center of the negative cloud-charge region at 7-8 km. The data presented
   potentially provide information on thunderstorm electrical and
   hydrometeor structure and discharge propagation physics. LMA source
   locations were obtained from VHF sources of positive impulsive currents
   as small as 10 A, in contrast to expectations found in the literature.

Title = {{The Role of Polar, Lamdba (Lambda)-Shaped Building Units in
   Noncentrosymmetric Inorganic Structures}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for the design of polar, inorganic structures is
   demonstrated here with the packing of lambda (Lambda)-shaped basic
   building units (BBUs). Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids with interesting
   physical properties can be created with BBUs that lack an inversion
   center and are likely to pack into a polar configuration; previous
   methods to construct these solids have used NCS octahedra as BBUs. Using
   this methodology to synthesize NCS solids, one must increase the
   coordination of the NCS octahedra with maintenance of the
   noncentrosymmetry of the bulk. The first step in this progression from
   an NCS octahedron to an inorganic NCS solid is the formation of a
   bimetallic BBU. This step is exemplified with the compound
   CuVOF4(H2O)(7): this compound, presented here, crystallizes in an NCS
   structure with ordered, isolated {[}Cu(H2O)(5)](2+) cations and
   {[}VOF4(H2O)](2-) anions into Lambda-shaped, bimetallic BBUs to form
   CuVOF4(H2O)(6)center dot H2O, owing to the Jahn-Teller distortion of
   Cu2+. Conversely, the centrosymmetric heterotypes with the same formula
   MVOF4(H2O)(2) (M-II = Co, Ni, and Zn) exhibit ordered, isolated
   {[}VOF4(H2O)](2-) and {[}M(H2O)(6)](2+) ionic species in a hydrogen bond
   network CuVOF4(H2O)(7) exhibits a net polar moment while the heterotypes
   do not; this demonstrates that Lambda-shaped BBUs give a greater
   probability for and, in this case, lead to NCS structures.}},

   Graphitization occurs only where ions have been implanted and without
   elevating the temperature of the surrounding substrate. Samples were
   characterized using Raman spectroscopy, ion scattering/channeling, SEM,
   and AFM, from which the degree of graphitization was determined to vary
   with implantation species, damage and dose, laser fluence, and pulsing.
   Contrasting growth regimes and graphitization mechanisms during PLA are
   discussed. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{843-848}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recent developments aiming to microsensors based on floating gate field
   effect transistors (FGFET) were investigated for application in a rodent
   cage monitoring. Given that these sensors were on the forefront of
   technology, a theoretical model was developed for the ammonia sensor to
   further understand the chemical reaction taking place on its surface.
   The sensors were tested in a controlled environment, where the air
   quality was known. The magnitude and time of the response to different
   levels of ammonia were determined in the 50-100 ppm range. The reaction
   mechanism selected for the model which was best supported by the
   literature and the experiments was molecular adsorption of ammonia on a
   titanium nitride surface. The experimental results were fitted to the
   model to obtain the adsorption and desorption rate constants, the
   equilibrium concentration constant, equilibrium constant, and Gibb's
   free energy, which were 6.28 L/mol.s, 6.43 x 10(-3) s(-1), 976.7 L/mol,
   39.04, and -9.25 kJ/mol, respectively. Based on these values, it was
   determined that the forward reaction, or adsorption, occurs
   spontaneously. There was good correlation between the theoretical model
   and the experimental results, indicating that the theoretical model was
   sufficient for this application.}},

Abstract = {{Interior damage is a significant portion of overall building damage
   caused by hurricanes. Most of the vulnerability models in the literature
   assess interior damage by expert opinion or with empirical functions of
   the envelope damage. Interior damage to buildings at low to moderate
   wind speeds is mainly caused by the ingress of water through breaches in
   the building's envelope. The parameters that govern water intrusion
   include wind speed, rain rate, rain duration, raindrop size
   distributions, exterior building damage, and shape of the building. The
   amount of ingressed water is proportional to the breach sizes as well as
   the uncertain meteorological phenomena. This paper presents a novel
   approach to estimate the interior building damage caused by hurricanes
   by simulating the co-occurrence of wind, rain and envelope damage and by
   converting ingressed water into interior damage. The simulation
   rationale is described and some preliminary qualitative results are
   introduced via a sample case. The approach presented herein has been
   implemented in the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model (FPHLM). (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Sand is a common bedding material used as a resting surface for dairy
   freestalls because it does not support bacterial growth, and it provides
   a high degree of comfort to cows. Existing techniques of assessing the
   comfort of freestall resting surface materials in the field are
   subjective, so the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a
   Clegg Impact Tester as a method to assess the comfort of sand and
   various other freestall resting surface materials. The Clegg tester was
   developed to characterize the stiffness of soils and soil-like
   materials. The Clegg tester displays a Clegg Impact Value (CIV) based on
   peak deceleration of the hammer's impact with a surface from a height of
   30 cm, which can be related to the design elastic modulus of a given
   material. A Clegg Impact Soil Tester with a 1-kg hammer was used in this
   study. Values were recorded for a rubber mat, a soft foam mat, a hard
   foam mat, and a waterbed and then were compared with values from sand
   with varying moisture content. The softest resting surface material was
   the soft foam (1.07 CIV/L) followed by dry sand (moisture content
   <0.75\%) (1.57 CIV/L). The hardest material was the rubber mat (64.23
   CIV/L). The softness of the waterbeds varied with the change in water
   pressure and volume in both the small and large chambers of the
   waterbeds.}},

Pages = {{S3-S9}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequent cause of disability in the
   United States, with the medial compartment of the knee being most
   commonly affected. The initiation and progression of knee OA is
   influenced by many factors, including kinematics. In response to loading
   during weight-bearing activity, cartilage in healthy knees demonstrates
   spatial adaptations in morphology and mechanical properties. These
   adaptations allow certain regions of the cartilage to respond to
   loading; other regions are less well suited to accommodate loading.
   Alterations in normal knee kinematics shift loading from cartilage
   regions adapted for loading to regions less well suited for loading,
   which leads to the initiation and progression of degenerative processes
   consistent with knee OA. Kinematic variables that are associated with
   the development, progression, and severity of knee OA are the adduction
   moment and tibiofemoral rotation. Because of its strong correlation with
   disease progression and pain, the peak adduction moment during gait has
   been identified as a target for treatment design. Gait modification
   offers a noninvasive option for seeking significant reductions. Gait
   modification has the potential to reduce pain and slow the progression
   of medial compartment knee OA. PM R 2012;4:S3-S9}},

Abstract = {{An incremental thermodynamic equilibrium model has been developed for
   the chemical reactions driving a clean, hydrogen producing iron/iron
   oxide looping cycle. The model approximates a well-mixed reactor with
   continuous reactant gas flow through a stationary solid matrix, where
   the gas residence time is long compared to time constants associated
   with chemical kinetics and species transport. The model, which computes
   the theoretical limit for steam-to-hydrogen conversion, has been
   experimentally validated for the oxidation reaction using an externally
   heated, 21 mm inner diameter, tubular fluidized bed reactor. Experiments
   were carried out at 660 and 960 degrees C with steam flow rates ranging
   from 0.9 to 3.5 g/min. For small flow rates, i.e., for long residence
   times, the experimentally observed cumulative steam-to-hydrogen
   conversion approaches the theoretically predicted conversion. At a 960
   degrees C operating temperature, the measured hydrogen yield approaches
   the theoretical limit (experimental yields are always within 50\% of the
   theoretical limit), and the yield is insensitive to variations in the
   steam flow rate. In contrast, the measured hydrogen yield deviates
   significantly from the theoretical limit at a 660 degrees C operating
   temperature, and strong variations in hydrogen yield are observed with
   variations in steam flow rate. This observation suggests that the
   reaction kinetics are significantly slower at lower temperature, and the
   model assumption is not satisfied. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{The problem of unsteady motion of a spherical bubble or drop is analyzed
   in the limit of vanishing Mach and Reynolds numbers. Linearized viscous
   compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved inside and outside of
   the spherical bubble/drop and an expression of the transient force is
   first obtained in the Laplace domain and then transformed to the time
   domain. The total force is separated into the quasi-steady, the inviscid
   unsteady, and the viscous unsteady contributions. The new force
   expression reduces to known results in the limits of a drop in an
   incompressible flow or a rigid particle in a compressible flow. We
   observe that in all compressible flow cases, the viscous unsteady kernel
   shows a 1/root t decay at sufficiently short times. This is in contrast
   to the behavior in an incompressible flow where the viscous unsteady
   kernel on the bubble reaches a constant value at short times. (C) 2012

Title = {{Cardinal Directions between Complex Regions}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Besides topological relationships and approximate relationships,
   cardinal directions like north and southwest have turned out to be an
   important class of qualitative spatial relationships. They are of
   interdisciplinary interest in fields like cognitive science, robotics,
   artificial intelligence, and qualitative spatial reasoning. In spatial
   databases and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) they are frequently
   used as join and selection criteria in spatial queries. However, the
   available computational models of cardinal directions suffer a number of
   problems like the use of too coarse approximations of the two spatial
   operand objects in terms of single representative points or minimum
   bounding rectangles, the lacking property of converseness of the
   cardinal directions computed, and the limited applicability to simple
   instead of complex regions only. This article proposes and formally
   defines a novel two-phase model, called the Objects Interaction Matrix
   (OIM) model, that solves these problems, and determines cardinal
   directions for even complex regions. The model consists of a tiling
   phase and an interpretation phase. In the tiling phase, a tiling
   strategy first determines the zones belonging to the nine cardinal
   directions of each individual region object and then intersects them.
   The result leads to a bounded grid called objects interaction grid. For
   each grid cell the information about the region objects that intersect
   it is stored in an objects interaction matrix. In the subsequent
   interpretation phase, a well-defined interpretation method is applied to
   such a matrix and determines the cardinal direction. Spatial example
   queries illustrate our new cardinal direction concept that is embedded
   in a spatial extension of SQL and provides user-defined cardinal
   direction predicates.}},

Abstract = {{A brief history of atomic simulation as it was used in chemistry,
   physics, and materials science is presented starting with seminal work
   by Eyring in the 1930s through to current work and future challenges.
   This article provides the background and perspective needed to
   understand the ways in which reactive many-body potentials developed
   over the last three decades and have impacted materials research. It
   also explains the way in which this substantial impact on the field has
   been facilitated by increases in computational resources and traces the
   development of reactive potentials, which have steadily increased in
   complexity and sophistication over time. Together with the other
   contributions in this issue of MRS Bulletin, this article will help
   guide and inspire the next generation of computational materials
   scientists and engineers as they build on current capabilities to expand

Abstract = {{The minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion has been receiving increasing
   attention due to its promising perspectives for applications in signal
   processing and machine learning. In the context of Bayesian estimation,
   the MEE criterion is concerned with the estimation of a certain random
   variable based on another random variable, so that the error's entropy
   is minimized. Several theoretical results on this topic have been
   reported. In this work, we present some further results on the MEE
   estimation. The contributions are twofold: (1) we extend a recent result
   on the minimum entropy of a mixture of unimodal and symmetric
   distributions to a more general case, and prove that if the conditional
   distributions are generalized uniformly dominated (GUD), the dominant
   alignment will be the MEE estimator; (2) we show by examples that the
   MEE estimator (not limited to singular cases) may be non-unique even if
   the error distribution is restricted to zero-mean (unbiased).}},

   data were very similar. The dependence of density on stoichiometry
   resembles the corresponding dependence of the refractive index in the
   transparency range. A free carrier absorption was noted in the visible
   spectral range, leading to a weak absorbing thin transparent conductive
   oxide. On the other hand, the refractive index is smaller than those of
   based oxides (ZnO and In2O3), and counterbalance therefore the weak
   light absorption. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it is difficult to achieve a large
   data collection rate because sensors usually have limited energy and
   communication resources. Such an issue is becoming increasingly more
   challenging with the emerging of information-intensive applications that
   require high data collection rate. To address this issue, in this paper,
   we investigate the throughput capacity of WSNs, where multiple mobile
   relays are deployed to collect data from static sensors and forward them
   to a static sink. To facilitate the discussion, we propose a new
   mobile-relay-assisted data collection (MRADC) model. Based on this
   model, we analyze the achievable throughput capacity of large-scale WSNs
   using a constructive approach, which can achieve a certain throughput by
   choosing appropriate mobility parameters. Our analysis illustrates that,
   if the number of relays is less than a threshold, then the throughput
   capacity can be linearly increased with more relays. On the other hand,
   if the number is greater than the threshold, then the throughput
   capacity becomes a constant, and the capacity gain over a static WSN
   depends on two factors: 1) the transmission range and 2) the impact of
   interference. To verify our analysis, we conduct extensive simulation
   experiments, which validate the selection of mobility parameters and
   demonstrate the same throughput behaviors obtained by analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the longitudinal dynamics of a fast-morphing,
   variable-wing-sweep micro air vehicle are investigated from a flight
   dynamics perspective. The time scales over which the morphing occurs are
   of the same order as the flight dynamics of the micro air vehicle, due
   to which the time-varying aspects of the dynamics must be carefully
   evaluated. The time-varying characteristic equation (which represents a
   generalization of the standard linear time-invariant characteristic
   equation) for this micro air vehicle is presented in analytic form, and
   this enables a characterization of the influence of different morphing
   trajectories on the flight dynamics. The concept of a time-varying pole
   is subsequently adopted and the flight dynamic properties of the
   time-varying modes are determined. A tool to properly evaluate the
   sensitivity of the time-varying modes to different morphing trajectories
   is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{There is increased pressure on the water resources of the southeastern
   United States due to the rapidly growing population of the region. This
   pressure is further exacerbated by the severe seasonal to interannual
   climate variability this region experiences, most of which has been
   attributed to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Understanding the
   regional impacts of ENSO on precipitation and streamflow is a valuable
   tool for water resource managers in the region. This study was
   undertaken to develop a clear picture of the effect of ENSO on observed
   precipitation and streamflow anomalies in Alabama to help managers in
   the state with decision making. The effect of ENSO on precipitation in
   eight climate divisions of Alabama was assessed using 59 years (1950 to
   2008) of monthly historical data. In addition, eight unimpaired streams
   (one in each climate division) were selected to study the relationship
   between ENSO and streamflow. Results indicate a significant relationship
   between ENSO and precipitation as well as between ENSO and streamflow.
   However, different parts of the state respond differently to ENSO. For
   precipitation, it was found that the relationship is significant during
   winter months with dry conditions being associated with La Nina in the
   southern climate divisions. A fairly strong relationship was also found
   during other months. Streamflows show high variability and positive
   correlation during winter months in the southern climate divisions. The
   results obtained can provide a basis for water resource managers in
   Alabama to incorporate climate variability caused by ENSO in their
   decision making related to soil and water conservation.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a new method for optimal placement of sensors for
   detecting damages in composite structures. The problem is formulated as
   a minimax optimization in which the goal is to find the coordinates of a
   given number of sensors so that the worst (maximum) probability of
   nondetection of the sensor network is made as good as possible
   (minimized). It is shown that a minimax approach can more efficiently
   place the sensors on complex geometries, compared to existing placement
   methods that consider average probability of detection. The method
   allows one to account for characteristics of sensors by assuming that
   the effectiveness of a sensor decreases with the distance from damage
   via an experimentally determined sensor probability of detection
   function and sensor noise in sensor network optimization. The
   formulation also enables to account for nonuniform likelihood of damages
   on the structure, which often arises due to irregular loading or
   boundary conditions, using a damage probability density. Numerical
   examples and an experimental validation study involving a Lamb-wave
   sensing system are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{A new device, the Creep Testing Apparatus (CRETA), has been developed
   for use in determining the viscoelastic properties of joint sealant.
   Creep tests were conducted on two types of silicone sealant:
   self-leveling (SL) and non-self-leveling (NS). The results appear to
   indicate that the silicone sealant tested is a linear viscoelastic
   material and that its creep response does not appear to be sensitive to
   temperature variations from 0 degrees C to 60 degrees C. Further creep
   tests were conducted under artificial aging conditions. Hot water aging
   appears to cause both SL and NS sealant to become softer and more
   ductile. Freeze-thaw aging did not appear to have an effect on the
   viscoelastic properties. Oven aging did not appear to affect SL sealant,
   but it did cause NS sealant to become stiffer. These results might be
   useful in a long-term joint performance model.}},

   Methods: Reflection-mode PAT and FMT systems were developed. Target
   embedded in a background phantom with different ICG concentration, size,
   and depth location was examined. Comparisons were made in terms of
   target morphology, spatial resolution, and sensitivity between the two
   modalities.
   Results: Phantom results showed that PAT and FMT gave different image
   morphology. PAT offered higher spatial resolution, while FMT provided
   higher sensitivity. Thus, improved target detection could be achieved by
   correlating the complementary information obtained from the two
   modalities.
   Conclusions: The combination of high resolution PAT and high sensitivity
   FMT will provide a more complete range of pathology spectra for more
   reliable target detection, suggesting a potentially better diagnostic
   tool when this combination coupled with the administration of ICG as
   contrast agent is applied to clinical problems in the future. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors present the design and evaluation of a
   second-generation (G2) hybrid photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and diffuse
   optical tomography (DOT) imaging system for detection of breast cancer.
   The combined PAT/DOT system takes full advantages of two different
   modalities to provide complementary information and most accurate
   recovery of tissue optical properties.
   Methods: This system was designed to produce cross-section images of
   breast tissue with a ring-shaped home-made array of 64 wideband acoustic
   transducers combined with an array of 16/16 source/detector optical
   fiber bundles. A scanning light delivery system was built to illuminate
   a large area of breast tissue for optimized tissue penetration. Finite
   element reconstruction methods for quantitative PAT and DOT were
   utilized to recover absorption and scattering coefficients of
   tissue-mimicking phantoms and ex vivo tumor tissue.
   Results: Performances of the acoustic transducer array and the PAT/DOT
   system were investigated in detail. Frequency response of the
   transducers is from 380 kHz to 1.48 MHz and maximum frequency response
   is up to 2 MHz. Directivity of a single element in the array is +/- 30
   degrees.The PAT/DOT system offers a spatial resolution of similar to 0.5
   mm for PAT and of similar to 4.0 mm for DOT. Quantitatively accurate
   absorption and scattering coefficients were obtained from both the
   phantom and ex vivo experiments.
   Conclusions: The PAT/DOT system provided better PAT images when the
   targets were smaller in size and located near the center of the
   background phantom, while better DOT images were obtained when the
   targets were larger in size and located away from the center of the
   background. The successful results obtained from both the phantom and ex
   vivo experiments will allow us to test the hybrid system in humans with
   breast cancer in the near future. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{Multivariate simulation is necessary for cases where non-Gaussian

   algorithm to generate non-Gaussian wind pressure fields is proposed.
   Gaussian sample fields are generated based on the spectral
   representation method using wavelet transforms method and then mapped
   into non-Gaussian sample fields with the aid of a CDF mapping
   transformation technique. To illustrate the procedure, this approach is
   applied to experimental results obtained from wind tunnel tests on the
   domes. A multivariate Gaussian simulation technique is developed and
   then extended to multivariate non-Gaussian simulation using the CDF
   mapping technique. It is proposed to develop a new wavelet-based CDF
   mapping technique for simulation of multivariate non-Gaussian wind
   pressure process. The efficiency of the proposed methodology for the
   non-Gaussian nature of pressure fluctuations on separated flow regions
   of different rise-span ratios of domes is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTC) in the peripheral blood could provide
   important information for diagnosis of cancer metastasis and monitoring
   treatment progress. However, CTC are extremely rare in the bloodstream,
   making their detection and characterization technically challenging. We
   report here the development of an aptamer-mediated, micropillar-based
   microfluidic device that is able to efficiently isolate tumor cells from
   unprocessed whole blood. High affinity aptamers were used as an
   alternative to antibodies for cancer cell isolation. The
   microscope-slide-sized device consists of >59 000 micropillars, which
   enhanced the probability of the interactions between aptamers and target
   cancer cells. The device geometry and the flow rate were investigated
   and optimized by studying their effects on the isolation of target
   leukemia cells from a cell mixture. The device yielded a capture
   efficiency of similar to 95\% with purity of similar to 81\% at the
   optimum flow rate of 600 nL/s. Further, we exploited the device for
   isolating colorectal tumor cells from unprocessed whole blood; as few as
   10 tumor cells were captured from 1 mL of whole blood. We also addressed
   the question of low throughput of a typical microfluidic device by
   processing 1 mL of blood within 28 mm. In addition, we found that,
   similar to 93\% of the captured cells were viable, making them suitable
   for subsequent molecular and cellular studies.}},

Abstract = {{Throughput maximization is a key challenge for wireless applications in
   cognitive Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (C-VANETs). As a potential solution,
   cooperative communications, which may increase link capacity by
   exploiting spatial diversity, has attracted a lot of attention in recent
   years. However, if link scheduling is considered, this transmission mode
   may perform worse than direct transmission in terms of end-to-end
   throughput. In this paper, we propose a cooperative communication aware
   link scheduling scheme and investigate the throughput maximization
   problem in C-VANETs. Regarding the features of cooperative
   communications and the availability of licensed spectrum, we extend the
   links into cooperative links/general links, define extended link-band
   pairs, and form a 3-dimensional (3-D) cooperative conflict graph to
   characterize the conflict relationship among those pairs. Given all
   cooperative independent sets in this graph, we mathematically formulate
   an end-to-end throughput maximization problem and near-optimally solve
   it by linear programming. Due to the NP-completeness of finding all
   independent sets, we also develop a heuristic pruning algorithm for
   cooperative communication aware link scheduling. Our simulation results
   show that the proposed scheme is effective in increasing end-to-end
   throughput for the session in C-VANETs.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an interlaced multi-shell sampling scheme for
   the reconstruction of the diffusion propagator from diffusion weighted
   magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). In standard multi-shell sampling
   schemes, sample points are uniformly distributed on several spherical
   shells in q-space. The distribution of sample points is the same for all
   shells, and is determined by the vertices of a selected polyhedron. We
   propose a more efficient interlaced scheme where sample points are
   different on alternating shells and are determined by the vertices of a
   pair of dual polyhedra. Since it samples more directions than the
   standard scheme, this method offers increased angular discrimination.
   Another contribution of this work is the application of optimal sampling
   lattices to q-space data acquisition and the proposal of a model-free
   reconstruction algorithm, which uses the lattice dependent sinc
   interpolation function. It is shown that under this reconstruction
   framework, the body centered cubic (BCC) lattice provides increased
   accuracy. The sampling scheme and the reconstruction algorithms were
   evaluated on simulated data as well as rat brain data collected on a 600
   MHz (14.1T) Bruker imaging spectrometer.}},

Abstract = {{The methanol-steam reforming (MSR) performance in micro-scale tubular
   reformers made by various materials is numerically studied. The physical
   domain considered includes an inlet section for methanol-steam mixture
   supply, a reformer section packed with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst particles
   and an outlet section for reformed gas collection. The heat transfer
   effect with three different heat supply mechanisms on the MSR
   performance is addressed. For heat supplies from the applied heat fluxes
   at the reformer outer wall surface and from internal heat generation in
   the reformer wall, it is found that the axial conduction plays an
   important role in both heat transfer characteristics and MSR
   performance. It is suggested that the reformer have a small axial
   conduction parameter for high MSR performance which can be achieved by
   designing the reformer with low wall thermal conductivity, thin wall
   thickness and a small reactants feed rate. It is also found that an
   excess heat supply can be obtained when the axial conduction parameter
   is small. This excess heat supply enhances the MSR performance compared
   with the infinitely-thin walled reformer. For the reformer with a
   constant wall outer surface temperature, the wall material effect on the
   MSR performance is insignificant due to uniformly distributed reformer
   wall temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A combinatorial screening procedure was used for the selection of
   polymer precursors in the preparation of molecularly imprinted polymer
   (MIP), which is useful in the detection of the air pollution marker
   molecule benzo{[}a]pyrene (BAP). Molecular imprinting is a technique for
   the preparation of polymer materials with specific molecular recognition
   receptors. The preparation of imprinted polymers requires polymer
   precursors such as functional monomer, cross-linking monomer, solvent,
   an initiator of polymerization and thermal or UV radiation. A virtual
   library of functional monomers was prepared based on interaction binding
   scores computed using HyperChem Release 8.0 software. Initially, the
   possible minimum energy conformation of the monomers and BAP were
   optimized using the semi-empirical (PM3) quantum method. The binding
   energy between the functional monomer and the template (BAP) was
   computed using the Hartree-Fock (HF) method with 6-31 G basis set, which
   is an ab initio approach based on Moller-Plesset second order
   perturbation theory (MP2). From the computations, methacrylic acid (MAA)
   and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) were selected for preparation
   of BAP imprinted polymer. The larger interaction energy (Delta E)
   represents possibility of more affinity binding sites formation in the
   polymer, which provides high binding capacity. The theoretical
   predictions were complimented through adsorption experiments. There is a
   good agreement between experimental binding results and theoretical
   computations, which provides further evidence of the validity of the
   usefulness of computational screening procedures in the selection of
   appropriate MIP precursors in an experiment-free way.}},

Abstract = {{As renewable energy increasingly penetrates into power grid systems, new
   challenges arise for system operators to keep the systems reliable under
   uncertain circumstances, while ensuring high utilization of renewable
   energy. With the naturally intermittent renewable energy, such as wind
   energy, playing more important roles, system robustness becomes a must.
   In this paper, we propose a robust optimization approach to accommodate
   wind output uncertainty, with the objective of providing a robust unit
   commitment schedule for the thermal generators in the day-ahead market
   that minimizes the total cost under the worst wind power output
   scenario. Robust optimization models the randomness using an uncertainty
   set which includes the worst-case scenario, and protects this scenario
   under the minimal increment of costs. In our approach, the power system
   will be more reliable because the worst-case scenario has been
   considered. In addition, we introduce a variable to control the
   conservatism of our model, by which we can avoid over-protection. By
   considering pumped-storage units, the total cost is reduced
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents statistical model parameter identification using
   Bayesian inference when parameters are correlated and observed data have
   noise and bias. The method is explained using the Paris model that
   describes crack growth in a plate under mode I loading. It is assumed
   that the observed data are obtained through structural health monitoring
   systems, which may have random noise and deterministic bias. It was
   found that a strong correlation exists (a) between two parameters of the
   Paris model, and (b) between initially measured crack size and bias. As
   the level of noise increases, the Bayesian inference was not able to
   identify the correlated parameters. However, the remaining useful life
   was predicted accurately because the identification errors in correlated
   parameters were compensated by each other. It was also found that the
   Bayesian identification process converges slowly when the level of noise

Abstract = {{Column experiments were performed to examine (a) the potential for
   leachate from construction and demolition (C\&D) debris landfills to
   mobilize naturally-occurring iron and arsenic from soils underlying such
   facilities and (b) the ability of crushed limestone to remove these
   aqueous phase pollutants. In duplicate columns, water was added to a
   30-cm layer of synthetic C\&D debris, with the resulting leachate
   serially passed through a 30-cm soil layer containing iron and arsenic
   and a 30-cm crushed limestone layer. This experiment was conducted for
   two different soil types (one high in iron (10,400 mg/kg) and the second
   high in iron (5400 mg/kg) and arsenic (70 mg/kg)); also monitored were
   control columns for both soil types with water infiltration alone.
   Despite low iron concentrations in the simulated C\&D debris leachate,
   elevated iron concentrations were observed when leachate passed through
   the soils; reductive dissolution was concluded to be the cause of iron
   mobilization. In the soil containing elevated arsenic, increased iron
   mobilization from the soil was accompanied by a similar but delayed
   arsenic mobilization. Since arsenic sorbs to oxidized iron soil
   minerals, reductive dissolution of these minerals results in arsenic
   mobilization. Crushed limestone significantly reduced iron (to values
   below the detection limit of 0.01 mg/L in most cases); however, arsenic
   was not removed to any significant extent. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CURRENT EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{372-380}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Chemically defined bioadhesives (CDB) are ``two-component
   reactive adhesives{''} made from antibiotic food additives. They contain
   no animal-derived ingredients and are characterized by a high level of
   self-degradability, low toxicity, and strong bonding properties.
   Amniotic membrane (AM) transplantation is used to repair severe ocular
   surface disease in humans and horses. AM requires meticulous suturing to
   the injured cornea. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
   CDB can facilitate the suture-less placement and adherence of equine AM
   to porcine cadaver cornea.
   Design: Prospective study.
   Materials and Methods: To determine whether there are differences in ex
   vivo adhesion force between equine AM bonded with CDB to porcine cadaver
   cornea and equine AM sutured to porcine cadaver cornea. The following
   groups were tested (n = 5 per group): (1) CDB group: trephined (8 mm in
   diameter) cornea was bonded with CDB to 8-mm-sized discs of AM. (2)
   Suture group: the 8-mm trephined cornea was sutured with 8-0 absorbable
   suture to the AM. (3) Control group 1: two sheets of nitrocellulose
   paper were bonded with CDB. (4) Control group 2: two sheets of
   nitrocellulose paper were attached with suture and tested. Each sample
   was anchored to a tensiometer materials testing machine, and the
   strength of adhesion measured and expressed in units of kilogram-force
   (kgf).
   Results: Mean +/- SD strength of adhesion force found no statistically
   significant difference between CDB group (0.091 +/- 0.054 kgf; 15 min of
   CDB adhesion time) and suture groups (0.095 +/- 0.037 kgf), whereas
   there was significant difference (P < 0.05) between control group 1
   (0.679 +/- 0.048 kgf) and control group 2 (0.585 +/- 0.092 kgf). These
   results revealed that the 15 min of CDB adhesive time had adhesive
   properties as strong as suture group. Conclusions and Clinical
   Relevance: CDB provides a satisfactory level of adherence to ex vivo
   suture-less attachment of equine amniotic membrane transplantation to
   the porcine cornea.}},

Abstract = {{The success of current trust and reputation systems is on the premise
   that the truthful feedbacks are obtained. However, without appropriate
   mechanisms, in most reputation systems, silent and lying strategies
   usually yield higher payoffs for peers than truthful feedback
   strategies. Thus, to ensure trustworthiness, incentive mechanisms are
   highly needed for a reputation system to encourage rational peers to
   provide truthful feedbacks. In this paper, we model the feedback
   reporting process in a reputation system as a reporting game. We propose
   a wage-based incentive mechanism for enforcing truthful report for
   non-verifiable information in self-interested P2P networks. A set of
   incentive compatibility constraint rules including participation
   constraint and self-selection constraints are formulated. We design,
   implement, and analyze incentive mechanisms and players' strategies. The
   extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed incentive
   mechanisms reinforce truthful feedbacks and achieve optimal welfare. (C)

Abstract = {{A numerical study of a dilute turbulent gas-particle flow with inelastic
   collisions and turbulence modulation in an Eulerian framework is
   described. A new interpretation is provided for the interaction/coupling
   terms, based on a fluctuating energy transfer mechanism. This
   interpretation provides for a new robust closure model for the
   interaction terms with the ability to predict the turbulence dampening
   as well as the turbulence enhancement phenomenon. Further, the model
   developed herein is investigated along with a variety of other published
   closure models used for the interaction/coupling terms, particle drag,

Abstract = {{Closed-loop control of skeletal muscle is complicated by the nonlinear
   muscle force to length and velocity relationships and the inherent
   unstructured and time-varying uncertainties in available models. Some
   pure feedback methods have been developed with some success, but the
   most promising and popular control methods for neuromuscular electrical
   stimulation (NMES) are neural network (NN)-based methods. Efforts in
   this paper focus on the use of a NN feedforward controller that is
   augmented with a continuous robust feedback term to yield an asymptotic
   result (in lieu of typical uniformly ultimately bounded stability).
   Specifically, an NN-based controller and Lyapunov-based stability
   analysis are provided to enable semi-global asymptotic tracking of a
   desired limb time-varying trajectory (i.e., non-isometric contractions).
   The developed controller is applied as an amplitude modulated voltage to
   external electrodes attached to the distal-medial and proximal-lateral
   portion of the quadriceps femoris muscle group in non-impaired
   volunteers. The added value of incorporating a NN feedforward term is
   illustrated through experiments that compare the developed controller
   with and without the NN feedforward component.}},

Abstract = {{Water treatment processes can cause secondary changes in water chemistry
   that alter finished water quality including chloride, sulfate, natural
   organic matter (NOM), and metal release. Hence, the goal of this
   research was to provide an improved understanding of the
   chloride-to-sulfate mass ratio (CSMR) with regards to chloride and
   sulfate variations at full-scale water treatment plants and corrosion
   potential under simulated premise plumbing conditions. Laboratory
   corrosion studies were conducted using Pb-Sn solder/Cu tubing galvanic
   cells exposed to model waters with low (approx. 5 mg/L Cl- and 10 mg/L
   SO42-) and high (approx. 50 mg/L Cl- and 100 mg/L SO42-) concentrations
   of chloride and sulfate at a constant CSMR of similar to 0.5. The role
   of NOM during corrosion was also evaluated by changing the type of
   organic material. In addition, full-scale sampling was conducted to
   quantify the raw water variability of chloride, sulfate, and NOM
   concentrations and the changes to these parameters from magnetic ion
   exchange treatment. Test conditions with higher concentrations of
   chloride and sulfate released significantly more lead than the lower
   chloride and sulfate test waters. In addition, the source of NOM was a
   key factor in the amount of lead released with the model organic
   compounds yielding significantly less lead release than aquatic NOM. (C)

Abstract = {{System optimization techniques are widely used to improve energy
   efficiency as well as overall performance. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS)
   is well studied and known to be successful in reducing processor energy
   consumption. Due to the increasing significance of the memory
   subsystem's energy consumption, dynamic cache reconfiguration (DCR)
   techniques are recently proposed at the aim of improving cache
   subsystem's energy efficiency. As the manufacturing technology scales
   into the order of nanometers, leakage current, which leads to static
   power consumption, becomes a significant contributor in the overall
   power dissipation. In this paper, we consider various system components
   and study their impact on system-wide energy consumption under different
   processor voltage levels as well as cache configurations. Based on the
   observation, we efficiently integrate DVS and DCR techniques together to
   make decisions judiciously so that the total energy consumption is
   minimized. Our studies show that considering only DVS or DCR and
   ignoring the impact from other system components may lead to incorrect
   conclusions in overall energy savings. Experimental results demonstrate
   that our approach outperforms existing leakage-aware DVS techniques by
   47.6\% and leakage-oblivious DVS + DCR technique by up to 23.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{The charge injection and transport properties of a high performance

   `'-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazolealt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzo

   dark-injection space-charge-limited current (DI-SCLC) techniques. OPV
   cells employing PCDTBT are known to possess power conversion efficiency
   (PCE) exceeding 6\% {[}1,2]. While TOF probes only the hole mobilities
   of a thick film, DI-SCLC is shown to be useful down to a sample
   thickness of similar to 200 nm, which is comparable to thicknesses used
   in OPV cells. We show that for pristine PCDTBT, the hole mobilities for
   both thick used in TOF and thin films for DI-SCLC are essentially the
   same, and they are in the range of 0.4-3.0 x 10 (4) cm(2)/Vs at room
   temperature. Both poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythioplene) doped with
   poly(strenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and molybdenum (VI) oxide (MoO3) form
   quasi-Ohmic contacts to PCDTBT with better hole injection from MoO3.
   Furthermore, the Gaussian Disorder Model (GDM) was employed to analyze
   the hopping transport of PCDTBT thin films. We show that PCDTBT
   possesses a relatively large energetic disorder (sigma) of similar to
   129 meV, which is significantly higher than the sigma of
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) processed under similar conditions. The
   correlation between sigma and OPV device performance is addressed. (C)

Abstract = {{During the last decade, Reactive Jamming Attack has emerged as a great
   security threat to wireless sensor networks, due to its mass destruction
   to legitimate sensor communications and difficulty to be disclosed and
   defended. Considering the specific characteristics of reactive jammer
   nodes, a new scheme to deactivate them by efficiently identifying all
   trigger nodes, whose transmissions invoke the jammer nodes, has been
   proposed and developed. Such a trigger-identification procedure can work
   as an application-layer service and benefit many existing
   reactive-jamming defending schemes. In this paper, on the one hand, we
   leverage several optimization problems to provide a complete
   trigger-identification service framework for unreliable wireless sensor
   networks. On the other hand, we provide an improved algorithm with
   regard to two sophisticated jamming models, in order to enhance its
   robustness for various network scenarios. Theoretical analysis and
   simulation results are included to validate the performance of this

Abstract = {{Thin and dense bilayer electrolytes consisting of erbium stabilized
   bismuth oxide (ESB) and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) were fabricated on
   tape-cast porous Ni-GDC anode-supports using a scalable and
   cost-effective colloidal deposition process. Nano-sized ESB particles
   were successfully synthesized at temperatures as low as similar to 500
   degrees C using wet chemical co-precipitation. Due to the high
   sinterability of this powder, dense ESB layers were obtained at a
   sintering temperature of 800 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis of a full button cell with
   an ESB/GDC bilayer sintered at 800 degrees C showed no visible
   interfacial diffusion between each layer. A systematic study on the
   sintering behavior of ESB revealed that at higher sintering
   temperatures, bismuth oxide can sublime or penetrate into the GDC
   sublayer. The effect of both the ESB layer and the GDC layer thickness
   on increasing open circuit potential (OCP) was demonstrated. The
   current-voltage measurement of the cell showed high power density
   (similar to 1.5 W cm(-2)) at 650 degrees C due to the increase in OCP
   and a significant reduction in area specific resistance when compared to
   solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a single GDC layer. These results
   demonstrate that ESB/GDC bilayer electrolytes have significant potential
   for high performance SOFCs at low operational temperature. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A compressive sensing framework is described for hyperspectral imaging.
   It is based on the widely used linear mixing model, LMM, which
   represents hyperspectral pixels as convex combinations of small numbers
   of endmember (material) spectra. The coefficients of the endmembers for
   each pixel are called proportions. The endmembers and proportions are
   often the sought-after quantities; the full image is an intermediate
   representation used to calculate them. Here, a method for estimating
   proportions and endmembers directly from compressively sensed
   hyperspectral data based on LMM is shown. Consequently, proportions and
   endmembers can be calculated directly from compressively sensed data
   with no need to reconstruct full hyperspectral images. If spectral
   information is required, endmembers can be reconstructed using
   compressive sensing reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore, given known
   endmembers, the proportions of the associated materials can be measured
   directly using a compressive sensing imaging device. This device would
   produce a multiband image; the bands would directly represent the
   material proportions.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of ions through contact lenses is essential to maintain lens
   movement on the eye. We measure the effective diffusivity and partition
   coefficient of sodium chloride through silicone hydrogels by measuring
   kinetics of salt release and permeation in a diffusion cell. The results
   obtained from both approaches are compared and mechanisms related to
   linearity of transport and dominant transport mechanisms are explored.
   Also, transport parameters are measured from silicone hydrogels of
   several compositions to explore the dependency of ion transport on
   composition. Transport parameters are also correlated with the water
   fraction in the gel in the context of the free volume theory. Results
   show that the transport is linear in concentration and satisfies
   diffusive scaling suggesting that the transport of sodium and chloride
   ions can be lumped into an effective diffusion model. The permeation
   approach which is typically used for determining only the permeability
   can be utilized to yield both effective salt diffusivity and the
   partition coefficients if the short time transient data is fitted to a
   diffusion model. The values of diffusivity and partition coefficient
   obtained from both kinetic and permeation approach are comparable. The
   partition coefficient changes smoothly with variations in composition
   but there are discontinuities observed in diffusivity values likely due
   to changes in microstructure from dispersed to bicontinuous. The
   diffusivity cannot be related to the water content through the classical
   free volume theory because of the variations in the microstructure of
   the gels. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of maximizing the lifetime of a wireless sensor
   network with energy-constrained sensors and a mobile sink. The sink
   travels among discrete locations to gather information from all the
   sensors. Data can be relayed among sensors and then to the sink
   location, as long as the sensors and the sink are within a certain
   threshold distance of each other. However, sending information along a
   data link consumes energy at both the sender and the receiver nodes. A
   vital problem that arises is to prescribe sink stop durations and data
   flow patterns that maximally prolong the life of the network, defined as
   the amount of time until any node exhausts its energy. We describe
   linear programming and column generation approaches for this problem,
   and also for a version in which data can be delayed in its transmission
   to the sink. Our column generation approach exploits special structures
   of the linear programming formulations so that all subproblems are
   shortest path problems with non-negative costs. Computational results
   demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To evaluate the potential of Hg release and co-transport by colloids. it
   is important to understand how Hg, colloids and Hg-loaded colloids
   migrate in soils. Hg sorption by kaolinite and sand were nonlinear and
   fit the Langmuir model, with the maximum Hg sorption capacity being 1.2
   mg/g kaolinite and 0.11 mg/g sand. Co-transport of Hg and kaolinite was
   evaluated using: (1) 1 or 100 mg/L Hg or 100 mg/L kaolinite, (2)1 or 100
   mg/L Hg mixed with 100 mg/L kaolinite, (3) 1 or 100 mg/L Hg presorbed
   onto kaolinite, and (4) 250 mg/L kaolinite in Hg-loaded sand columns.
   The presence of kaolinite (100 mg/L) reduced Hg's mobility through sand
   column by increasing deposition rate of Hg-loaded kaolinite. At 100 mg/L
   Hg, soluble Hg dominated Hg transport: but at 1 mg/L Hg, colloidal Hg
   (Hg sorbed on kaolinite) affected Hg transport. Preloading 100 mg/L Hg
   onto kaolinite (0.43 mg/g) reduced kaolinite's mobility with low
   recovery rate (78\%), with Hg retardation (R=1) in Hg-loaded kaolinite
   being lower than Hg retardation at 100 mg/L Hg (R=1.287). The Hg
   recovery rate (93\%) from Hg-loaded kaolinite at 1 mg/L Hg was higher
   compared to 22\% from 1 mg/L Hg. Kaolinite can serve as a carrier to
   enhance Hg transport in porous media, with 250 mg/L kaolinite mobilizing
   similar to 2.4\% Hg presorbed onto sand media. Correlation analysis
   revealed that desorbed Hg was significantly correlated with kaolinite (r
   = 0.81. P < 0.0001). Hence kaolinite enhanced Hg transport in the sand
   media serving both as a carrier (Hg was loaded before transport) and as
   mobile colloids stripping Hg off the sand media (Hg was loaded during
   transport). Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the fate and transport of functionalized carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) in porous media is crucial to understand their environmental
   impacts. In this study, laboratory column and modeling experiments were
   conducted to mechanistically compare the retention and transport of two
   types of functionalized CNTs (i.e., single-walled nanotubes and
   multi-walled nanotubes) in acid-cleaned, baked, and natural sand under
   unfavorable conditions. The CNTs were highly mobile in the acid-cleaned
   sand columns but showed little transport in the both natural and baked
   sand columns. In addition, the retention of the CNTs in the both baked
   and natural sand was strong and almost irreversible even after reverse,
   high-velocity, or surfactant flow flushing. Both experimental and
   modeling results showed that pH is one of the factors dominatingCNT
   retention and transport in natural and baked sand. Retention of the
   functionalized CNTs in the natural and baked sand columns reduced
   dramatically when the system pH increased. Our results suggest that the
   retention and transport of the functionalized CNTs in natural sand
   porous media were mainly controlled by strong surface deposition through
   the electrostatic and/or hydrogen-bonding attractions between surface
   function groups of the CNTs and metal oxyhydroxide impurities on the
   sand surfaces. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In ferroic materials, the dielectric, piezoelectric, magnetic, and
   elastic coefficients are significantly affected by the motion of domain
   walls. This motion can be described as the propagation of a wall across
   various types and strengths of pinning centers that collectively
   constitute a force profile or energetic landscape. Biased domain
   structures and asymmetric energy landscapes can be created through
   application of high fields (such as during electrical poling), and the
   material behavior in such states is often highly asymmetric. In some
   cases, this behavior can be considered as the electric analogue to the
   Bauschinger effect. The present Letter uses time-resolved, high-energy
   x-ray Bragg scattering to probe this asymmetry and the associated
   deaging effect in the ferroelectric morphotropic phase boundary
   composition 0.36BiScO(3)-0.64PbTiO(3).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multilevel reversible data hiding method based on
   histogram shifting which can recover the original image losslessly after
   the hidden data has been extracted from the stego-image. The method of
   prediction is adopted in our proposed scheme and prediction errors are
   produced to explore the similarity of neighboring pixels. In this
   article, we propose two different predictors to generate the prediction
   errors, where the prediction is carried out using the center prediction
   method and the JPEG-LS median edge predictor (MED) to exploit the
   correlation among the neighboring pixels. Instead of the original image,
   these prediction errors are used to hide the secret information.
   Moreover, we also present an improved method to search for peak and zero
   pairs and also talk about the analogy of the same to improve the
   histogram shifting method for huge embedding capacity and high peak
   signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). In the one-level hiding, our method keeps
   image qualities larger than 53 dB and the ratio of embedding capacity
   has 0.43 bpp (bit per pixel). Besides, the concept with multiple layer
   embedding procedure is applied for obtaining high capacity, and the
   performance is demonstrated in the experimental results. From our
   experimental results and analytical reasoning, it shows that the
   proposed scheme has higher PSNR and high data embedding capacity than
   that of other reversible data hiding methods presented in the
   literature.}},

Title = {{Positive lightning: An overview, new observations, and inferences}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{We examine the various conceptual cloud charge configurations and
   scenarios leading to production of positive lightning with a view toward
   an explanation of its observed properties. Data for 52 positive
   cloud-to-ground flashes containing 63 strokes recorded in Gainesville,
   Florida, in 2007-2008 are presented and discussed. The U. S. National
   Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) located 51 (96\%) of the positive
   strokes at distances of 7.8 to 157 km from the field-measuring station.
   In 42 (81\%) of the 52 flashes, the first (or the only) leader-return
   stroke sequence was not preceded by in-cloud discharge activity. The
   average number of strokes per flash is 1.2. Single-stroke flashes
   constitute 81\%. In three (38\%) of eight two-stroke flashes, the second
   stroke likely followed the channel of the first stroke, and in five
   (62\%) flashes it likely created a new termination on ground. Eight
   (15\%) of the 52 positive flashes had detectable preliminary breakdown
   pulse trains in their electric field records. Electric field waveforms
   of 14 (27\%) first strokes (also of one third stroke) are preceded by
   pronounced pulses, apparently indicative of leader stepping.
   NLDN-reported peak currents for 48 positive strokes in 40 flashes ranged
   from 20 to 234 kA with a geometric mean value of 75 kA. The median
   charge transfers in 1, 2, and 40 ms after the beginning of return stroke
   electric field change for an assumed height of 12 km were estimated to
   be 13, 18, and 34 C, respectively. Two bipolar lightning discharges are
   additionally examined.}},

Title = {{Influence of surface passivation on the friction and wear behavior of
   ultrananocrystalline diamond and tetrahedral amorphous carbon thin films}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Highly sp(3)-bonded, nearly hydrogen-free carbon-based materials can
   exhibit extremely low friction and wear in the absence of any liquid
   lubricant, but this physical behavior is limited by the vapor
   environment. The effect of water vapor on friction and wear is examined
   as a function of applied normal force for two such materials in thin
   film form: one that is fully amorphous in structure (tetrahedral
   amorphous carbon, or ta-C) and one that is polycrystalline with <10 nm
   grains {[}ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD)]. Tribologically induced
   changes in the chemistry and carbon bond hybridization at the surface
   are correlated with the effect of the sliding environment and loading
   conditions through ex situ, spatially resolved near-edge x-ray
   absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. At sufficiently high
   relative humidity (RH) levels and/or sufficiently low loads, both films
   quickly achieve a low steady-state friction coefficient and subsequently
   exhibit low wear. For both films, the number of cycles necessary to
   reach the steady-state is progressively reduced for increasing RH
   levels. Worn regions formed at lower RH and higher loads have a higher
   concentration of chemisorbed oxygen than those formed at higher RH, with
   the oxygen singly bonded as hydroxyl groups (C-OH). While some carbon
   rehybridization from sp(3) to disordered sp(2) bonding is observed, no
   crystalline graphite formation is observed for either film. Rather, the
   primary solid-lubrication mechanism is the passivation of dangling bonds
   by OH and H from the dissociation of vapor-phase H2O. This vapor-phase
   lubrication mechanism is highly effective, producing friction
   coefficients as low as 0.078 for ta-C and 0.008 for UNCD, and wear rates
   requiring thousands of sliding passes to produce a few nanometers of
   wear.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis and morphological characterization are reported for a series
   of 13 precision branched polyethylene structures, the branch being
   placed on every 39th carbon and varying in size from methyl to
   pentadecyl group. A recently established synthetic scheme for
   preparation of the symmetrical alpha,omega-diene monomer was employed to
   increase the number of methylene carbons between the branch points from
   20 to 38, yielding polymers with 5.26 mol \% alpha-olefin incorporation.
   The morphology of these polymers was investigated using differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAX])), and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Methyl branching significantly
   reduces the melting point and single crystal lamellae thickness of
   unbranched polyethylene. On the other hand, all further branches from
   ethyl to pentadecyl produce polymers that have similar melting points
   and single crystal lamellae thicknesses. A dear change in the morphology
   of both solution and melt-grown crystals of these polymers was observed
   from a situation where the methyl branch is incorporated in the
   polymer's unit cell to one where branches of greater mass are mostly
   expelled from the unit cell.}},

Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Loss of physical mobility makes maximal participation in desired
   activities more difficult and in the worst case fully prevents
   participation. This paper surveys recent work in assistive technology to
   improve mobility for persons with a disability, drawing on examples
   observed during a tour of academic and industrial research sites in
   Europe. The underlying theme of this recent work is a more seamless
   integration of the capabilities of the user and the assistive
   technology. This improved integration spans diverse technologies,
   including powered wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, functional electrical
   stimulation, and wearable exoskeletons. Improved integration is being
   accomplished in three ways: 1) improving the assistive technology
   mechanics; 2) improving the user-technology physical interface; and 3)
   sharing of control between the user and the technology. We provide an
   overview of these improvements in user-technology integration and
   discuss whether such improvements have the potential to be
   transformative for people with mobility impairments.}},

Title = {{Effect of dense vegetation on colloid transport and removal in surface

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{434}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Widely distributed in aquatic environment, colloids can pose risks to
   water quality, particularly when loaded in surface runoff, which can
   facilitate fast distribution of contaminants. It is unclear whether
   densely vegetated areas, which are known to be effective to reduce
   solutes and sediment from runoff, can be used to remove colloidal
   contaminants. In this paper, laboratory experiments were conducted to
   investigate effects of dense vegetation on colloid transport and removal
   in surface runoff. First, batch experiments were conducted to obtain the
   sorption isotherms of colloids (fluorescent microspheres) onto different
   vegetation parts (grass leaf, stem, and root). Then, a laboratory
   rainfall/runoff system was used to compare the transport behaviors of a
   tracer (bromide) and colloids in overland and drainage flows during a
   simulated rainfall event (64 mm/h). The system was equipped with Bahia
   grass growing on sandy soil containers with one surface flow and four
   vertical drainage sampling outlets. We found that all grass parts can
   sorb aqueous colloids with the Langmuir maximum sorption capacity
   between 455.3 and 1188.3 mg kg(-1). Runoff experimental results
   demonstrated that both the surface vegetation and the soil (including
   plant root) underneath can effectively remove colloids from surface and
   subsurface flows. Only about 33\% of the applied colloids were recovered
   from the outflows, with about 29\% and 4\% from overland flow and
   drainages, respectively. Our results suggest that well designed and
   maintained areas of dense vegetation, like vegetative filter strips, can
   be used as an effective best management practice to reduce colloidal
   contaminants in surface runoff. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to provide an improved understanding of
   the interactions between alkaline earth metals and DOM under conditions
   that are encountered during drinking water treatment with particular
   focus on cation exchange. Both magnetically enhanced and nonmagnetic
   cation exchange resins were converted to Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba mobile
   counterion forms as a novel approach to investigate the exchange
   behavior between the cations and the interactions between the cations
   and DOM. The results show that cation exchange is a robust process for
   removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ considering competition with cations on the
   resin surface and presence of DOM. DOM was actively involved during the
   cation exchange process through complexation, adsorption, and
   coprecipitation reactions. In addition to advancing the understanding of
   ion exchange processes for water treatment, the results of this work are
   applicable to membrane pretreatment to minimize fouling, treatment of
   membrane concentrate, and precipitative softening.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of chiral-tunneling in Bernal and rhombohedral
   stacked trilayer-graphene (3LG). Based on the chirality of the
   electronic bands, at the K-point, (rhombohedral) Bernal-3LG exhibits
   100\% (50\%) transparency across a heterojunction. Utilizing this
   property, we further investigate the effect of electron collimation in
   3LG. Due to the difference in the Berry's phase, we show that,
   rhombohedral-3LG is a better electron collimator, compared to monolayer
   and Bernal-bilayer graphene. Since, Bernal-3LG can be decomposed into
   two separate channels consisting of a monolayer and a modified
   Bernal-bilayer graphene; the Bernal-3LG is weaker electron collimator,
   compared to rhombohedral-3LG. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{One of the consequences of the fission process in uranium dioxide (UO2)
   fuels in nuclear reactors is the eventual formation of metallic fission
   product inclusions and precipitates. Here, the stability and clustering
   behavior of one particular metallic fission product-ruthenium (Ru)-is
   investigated using density functional theory in combination with
   classical thermodynamics. In particular, the solution energies of
   individual Ru atoms, dimers, and trimers at interstitial, uranium and
   oxygen vacancy, divacancy, and Schottky defect sites are calculated. Ru
   is predicted to be insoluble in most cases, but is soluble in uranium
   vacancy sites under hyperstoichiometric conditions (UO2+x). Density of
   states analysis reveals the metallic nature of even the smallest Ru
   aggregates. Finally, by analyzing the binding characteristics of Ru in
   UO2, metallic dimers in Schottky defects are identified as the probable
   nucleus of metallic precipitates in UO2.}},

Abstract = {{Network robustness issues are crucial in a variety of application areas.
   In many situations, one of the key robustness requirements is the
   connectivity between each pair of nodes through a path that is short
   enough, which makes a network cluster more robust with respect to
   potential network component disruptions. A k-club, which by definition
   is a subgraph of a diameter of at most k, is a structure that addresses
   this requirement (assuming that k is small enough with respect to the
   size of the original network). We develop a new compact linear 0-1
   programming formulation for finding maximum k-clubs that has
   substantially fewer entities compared to the previously known
   formulation (0(kn(2)) instead of O(n(k+1)), which is important in the
   general case of k > 2) and is rather tight despite its compactness.
   Moreover, we introduce a new related concept referred to as an R-robust
   k-club (or, (k,R)-club), which naturally arises from the developed
   k-club formulations and extends the standard definition of a k-club by
   explicitly requiring that there must be at least R distinct paths of
   length at most k between all pairs of nodes. A compact formulation for
   the maximum R-robust k-club problem is also developed, and error and
   attack tolerance properties of the important special case of R-robust
   2-clubs are investigated. Computational results are presented for
   multiple types of random graph instances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

   poly((2,2-bis(2-ethylhexyloxymethyl)-propylene-1,3-dioxy)-3,4-thiophene-
   2,5-diyl) as a vibrantly colored active material (ECP-Magenta) and
   poly(N-octadecyl-(propylene-1,3-dioxy)-3,4-pyrrole-2,5-diyl) as a
   minimally colored, charge balancing material (MCCP). Two electrolyte
   systems were compared to allow development of fully printable and
   laminated devices on flexible substrates. Devices of various sizes, up
   to 7 x 8 cm2, are demonstrated with pixelated devices containing pixel
   sizes of 4 x 4 mm2 or 13 x 13 mm2. The transmission contrast exhibited
   by the devices, when switched between the fully bleached and fully
   colored state, was 58\% at a visible wavelength of 550 nm, and the
   devices exhibited switching times of <10 s. Additionally, we demonstrate
   the utilization of printed organic photovoltaic devices (with or without
   the use of a lithium-polymer battery) to power the devices between the
   colored and bleached state, illustrating a self-powered ECD. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The morphology evolution of miscible blends of a semicrystalline
   polyamide 6 (PA6) and an amorphous polyamide 6Ico6T (PA6IcoT) was
   investigated using an internal Brabender mixer at a temperature range
   220-260 degrees C. Morphology of the blends was characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser particle analysis.
   Temperature rising dissolution was used to separate the different phases
   of the blends and the phase compositions were determined by Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The particle size evolution of
   the dispersed phase (PA6) was calculated and agreed well with
   experimental observation. It was found that the particle size was
   quickly reduced to nanometer scale after several minutes of processing.
   A convection-diffusion model was adopted to study the phase evolution
   during meltmelt mixing stage and compute the dimension of each phase.
   The results strongly support the notion of existence of distinct phases
   during blending, whose development can be well described by the model.
   The dispersed phase is reduced mainly by stretching of flow, while the
   broadening of the blending phase can be primarily attributed to
   molecular diffusion. The study also suggests the possibility to prepare
   novel polymer blends with nanometer sized domain of high uniformity. (C)

Abstract = {{An emerging idea in olfaction is that temporal coding of odor
   specificity can be intrinsic to the primary olfactory receptor neurons

   characterized different patterns of activity in lobster ORNs

   imaging. We demonstrate that lobster ORNs show tonic excitation, tonic
   inhibition, phaso-tonic excitation, and bursting, and that these
   patterns are faithfully reflected in the calcium signal. We then
   demonstrate that the various dynamic patterns of response are inherent
   in the cells, and that this inherent heterogeneity is largely determined
   by heterogeneity in the underlying intrinsic conductances.}},

Title = {{A Preclinical Assessment of Neural Stem Cells as Delivery Vehicles for
   Anti-Amyloid Therapeutics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Transplantation of neural stems cells (NSCs) could be a useful means to
   deliver biologic therapeutics for late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   In this study, we conducted a small preclinical investigation of whether
   NSCs could be modified to express metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), a secreted
   protease reported to degrade aggregated Ab peptides that are the major
   constituents of the senile plaques. Our findings illuminated three
   issues with using NSCs as delivery vehicles for this particular
   application. First, transplanted NSCs generally failed to migrate to
   amyloid plaques, instead tending to colonize white matter tracts.
   Second, the final destination of these cells was highly influenced by
   how they were delivered. We found that our injection methods led to
   cells largely distributing to white matter tracts, which are anisotropic
   conduits for fluids that facilitate rapid distribution within the CNS.
   Third, with regard to MMP9 as a therapeutic to remove senile plaques, we
   observed high concentrations of endogenous metalloproteinases around
   amyloid plaques in the mouse models used for these preclinical tests
   with no evidence that the NSC-delivered enzymes elevated these
   activities or had any impact. Interestingly, MMP9-expressing NSCs formed
   substantially larger grafts. Overall, we observed long-term survival of
   NSCs in the brains of mice with high amyloid burden. Therefore, we
   conclude that such cells may have potential in therapeutic applications
   in AD but improved targeting of these cells to disease-specific lesions
   may be required to enhance efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze current, electric field, and optical signatures of the sudden
   electrical breakdown processes (precursors) that occur at the top of the
   upward extending, grounded, Kevlar-covered copper wires used to
   artificially trigger lightning. For one launch, before the sustained
   upward positive leader initiated, we estimate that up to 10,000
   precursors occurred (one every few hundred microseconds) with peak
   currents from 1 to more than 100 A. Luminosity at the wire tip was
   observed for 339 of 410 precursors examined in detail and, in seven
   cases, discharge channels developed to lengths of 3 to 8 m over times of
   several hundred microseconds. The measured propagation speeds of current
   pulses on the triggering wires were less than the speed of light, and
   decreased from about 2.8 x 10(8) m s (-1) to about 2.3 x 10(8) m s (-1)
   with increasing wire-top heights from about 80 m to about 340 m. The
   triggering wire and its grounding system are modeled as uniform
   transmission lines with model predictions that are consistent with the
   measured wire-base precursor current signatures. The modeling shows that
   (1) the characteristic impedance of the triggering wire, the ratio of
   the propagating precursor voltage pulse to its associated current pulse,
   is between 600 and 800 Omega; (2) the 25 m ground rod grounding
   impedance for the peak precursor current is about 100 Omega, while the
   DC grounding resistance is 20 Omega; and (3) the current reflection
   coefficient at ground for peak precursor current is similar to 0.9.}},

Abstract = {{With its unparalleled ability to safely generate high-contrast images of
   soft tissues, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has remained at the
   forefront of diagnostic clinical medicine. Unfortunately due to
   resolution limitations, clinical scans are most useful for detecting
   macroscopic structural changes associated with a small number of
   pathologies. Moreover, due to a longstanding inability to directly
   observe magnetic resonance (MR) signal behavior at the cellular level,
   such information is poorly characterized and generally must be inferred.
   With the advent of the MR microscope in 1986 came the ability to measure
   MR signal properties of theretofore unobservable tissue structures.
   Recently, further improvements in hardware technology have made possible
   the ability to visualize mammalian cellular structure. In the current
   study, we expand upon previous work by imaging the neuronal cell bodies
   and processes of human and porcine alpha-motor neurons. Complimentary
   imaging studies are conducted in pig tissue in order to demonstrate
   qualitative similarities to human samples. Also, apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC) maps were generated inside porcine alpha-motor neuron
   cell bodies and portions of their largest processes (mean = 1.7 +/- 0.5
   mu m(2)/ms based on 53 pixels) as well as in areas containing a mixture
   of extracellular space, microvasculature, and neuropil (0.59 +/- 0.37 mu
   m(2)/ms based on 33 pixels). Three-dimensional reconstruction of MR
   images containing motor neurons shows the spatial arrangement of
   neuronal projections between adjacent cells. Such advancements in
   imaging portend the ability to construct accurate models of MR signal
   behavior based on direct observation and measurement of the components
   which comprise functional tissues. These tools would not only be useful
   for improving our interpretation of macroscopic MRI performed in the
   clinic, but they could potentially be used to develop new methods of
   differential diagnosis to aid in the early detection of a multitude of
   neuropathologies. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Resting-state fMRI has become a powerful tool for studying network
   mechanisms of normal brain functioning and its impairments by
   neurological and psychiatric disorders. Analytically, independent
   component analysis and seed-based cross correlation are the main methods
   for assessing the connectivity of resting-state fMRI time series. A
   feature common to both methods is that they exploit the covariation
   structures of contemporaneously (zero-lag) measured data but ignore
   temporal relations that extend beyond the zero-lag. To examine whether
   data covariations across different lags can contribute to our
   understanding of functional brain networks, a measure that can uncover
   the overall temporal relationship between two resting-state BOLD signals
   is needed. In this paper we propose such a measure referred as total
   interdependence (TI). Comparing TI with zero-lag cross correlation (CC)
   we report three results. First, when combined with a random permutation
   procedure. TI can reveal the amount of temporal relationship between two
   resting-state BOLD time series that is not captured by CC. Second,
   comparing resting-state data with task-state data recorded in the same
   scanning session, we demonstrate that the resting-state functional
   networks constructed with TI match more precisely the networks activated
   by the task. Third. TI is shown to be more statistically sensitive than
   CC and provides better feature vectors for network clustering analysis.

Abstract = {{In recent years, crop models have increasingly been used to simulate
   agricultural features. The DSSAT (Decision Support System for
   Agrotechnology Transfer) is an important tool in modeling growth;
   however, one of its limitations is related to the unaccounted-for effect
   of diseases. Therefore, the goals of this study were to calibrate and
   validate the CSM CROPGRO-Soybean for the soybean cultivars M-SOY 6101
   and MG/BR 46 (Conquista), analyze the performance and the effect of
   Asian soybean rust on these cultivars under the environmental conditions
   of Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The experimental data for the
   evaluation, testing, and adjustment of the genetic coefficients for the
   cultivars, M-SOY 6101 and MG/BR 46 (Conquista), were obtained during the
   2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2009/2010 growing seasons. GLUE (Generalized
   Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) was used for the estimation of the
   genetic coefficients, and pedotransfer functions have been utilized to
   estimate the physical characteristics of the soil. For all of the sowing
   dates, the early season cultivar, M-SOY 6101, exhibited a lower variance
   in yield, which represents more stability with regard to the interannual
   climate variability, i.e., the farmers who use this cultivar will have
   in 50\% of the crop years analyzed, a higher yield than a late-season
   cultivar. The MG/BR 46 (Conquista) cultivar demonstrated a greater
   probability of obtaining higher yield in years with favorable weather
   conditions. However, in the presence of the Asian soybean rust, yield is
   heavily affected. The early cultivar, M-SOY 6101, showed a lower risk of
   being affected by the rust and consequently exhibited less yield loss
   considering the scenario 090 (condensation on the leaf surface occurs
   when the relative humidity is greater than or equal to 90\%), for a
   sowing date of November 14.}},

Title = {{Mouse stem cells seeded into decellularized rat kidney scaffolds
   endothelialize and remodel basement membranes}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{49-55}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: To address transplant organ shortage, a promising strategy
   is to decellularize kidneys in a manner that the scaffold retains
   signals for seeded pluripotent precursor cells to differentiate and
   recapitulate native structures: matrix-to-cell signaling followed by
   cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, thereby remodeling and replacing
   the original matrix. This would reduce scaffold antigenicity and enable
   xeno-allografts.
   Results: DAPI-labeled cells in arterial vessels and glomeruli were
   positive for both endothelial lineage markers, BsLB4 and VEGFR2. Rat
   scaffold's basement membrane demonstrated immunolabeling with anti-mouse
   laminin beta 1. Labeling intensified over time with 14 day incubations.
   Conclusion: We provide new evidence for matrix-to-cell signaling in
   acellular whole organ scaffolds that induces differentiation of
   pluripotent precursor cells to endothelial lineage. Production of mouse
   basement membrane supports remodeling of host (rat)-derived scaffolds
   and thereby warrants further investigation as a promising approach for
   xenotransplantation.
   Methods: We previously showed that murine embryonic stem cells
   arterially seeded into acellular rat whole kidney scaffolds multiply and
   demonstrate morphologic, immunohistochemical and gene expression
   evidence for differentiation. Vascular cell endothelialization was now
   further tested by endothelial specific BsLB4 lectin and anti-VEGFR2
   (Flk1) antibodies. Remodeling of the matrix basement membranes from rat
   to mouse ({''}murinization{''}) was assessed by a monoclonal antibody
   specific for mouse laminin beta 1 chain.}},

   the same thickness of 50 nm deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. The
   size of the indium zinc oxide stripes was controlled by e-beam

   indium zinc oxide stripes was kept constant at 25 mu m. The electrical
   conductivity decreased as the size of the indium zinc oxide stripes
   decreased below a critical width (80 nm). The activation energy, derived
   from the electric conductivity versus temperature measurement, was
   dependent on the dimensions of indium zinc oxide stripes. These results
   can be understood as stemming from surface charge trapping from the
   absorption of oxygen and/or water vapor, which leads to an increase in
   the energy difference between the conduction energy band and the Fermi
   energy.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the ability of two biochars converted from

   of DAWC (digested dairy waste biochar) and DWSBC (digested whole sugar

   mixture of four heavy metals (Ph2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+) from aqueous
   solutions. Compared to DAWC, DWSBC demonstrated a better ability to
   remove Ni and Cd. Further investigations of lead sorption by the two
   biochars indicated that the removal was mainly through a surface
   precipitation mechanism, which was confirmed by batch sorption
   experiments, mathematical modeling, and examinations of lead-laden
   biochars samples using SEM-EDS, XRD, and FTIR. The lead sorption
   capacity of the two biochars was close to or higher than 200 mmol/kg,
   which is comparable to that of commercial activated carbons. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In the present paper, the experimental results of a cryogenic chilldown
   process are reported. The physical phenomena involve unsteady two-phase
   vapor-liquid flow and intense boiling heat transfer of the cryogenic
   fluid that is coupled with the transient heat conduction inside pipe
   walls. The objective for the present study is to compare the chilldown
   rates and flow patterns between the upward flow and downward flow in a
   vertical pipe. Liquid nitrogen is employed as the working fluid and the
   test section is a vertical straight segment of a Pyrex glass pipe with
   an inner diameter of 8 mm. The effects of mass flow rate on the flow
   patterns, heat transfer characteristics and interface movement were
   determined through experiments performed under several different mass
   flow rates. Through flow visualization, measurement and analysis on the
   flow patterns and temperature variations, a physical explanation of the
   vertical chilldown is given. By observing the process and analyzing the
   results, it is concluded that pipe chilldown in a vertical flow is
   similar to that in microgravity to some extent. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flow back along the outer surface of a needle (backflow) can be a
   significant problem during the direct infusion of drugs into brain
   tissues for procedures such as convection-enhanced delivery (CED). This
   study evaluates the effects of needle insertion speed (0.2 and 1.8 mm/s)
   as well as needle diameter and flow rate on the extent of backflow and
   local damage to surrounding tissues. Infusion experiments were conducted
   on a transparent tissue phantom, 0.6\% (w/v) agarose hydrogel, to
   visualize backflow. Needle insertion experiments were also performed to
   evaluate local damage at the needle tip and to back out the prestress in
   the surrounding media for speed conditions where localized damage was
   not excessive. Prestress values were then used in an analytical model of
   backflow. At the higher insertion speed (1.8 mm/s), local insertion
   damage was found to be reduced and backflow was decreased. The
   compressive prestress at the needle-tissue interface was estimated to be
   approximately constant (0.812 kPa), and backflow distances were similar
   regardless of needle gauge (22, 26, and 32 gauge). The analytical model
   underestimated backflow distances at low infusion flow rates and
   overestimated backflow at higher flow rates. At the lower insertion
   speed (0.2 mm/s), significant backflow was measured. This corresponded
   to an observed accumulation of material at the needle tip which produced
   a gap between the needle and the surrounding media. Local tissue damage
   was also evaluated in excised rat brain tissues, and insertion tests
   show similar rate-dependent accumulation of tissue at the needle tip at

Abstract = {{Imaging spectrometers measure electromagnetic energy scattered in their
   instantaneous field view in hundreds or thousands of spectral channels
   with higher spectral resolution than multispectral cameras. Imaging
   spectrometers are therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras
   (HSCs). Higher spectral resolution enables material identification via
   spectroscopic analysis, which facilitates countless applications that
   require identifying materials in scenarios unsuitable for classical
   spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatial resolution of HSCs,
   microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering, spectra measured
   by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus, accurate
   estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of a few
   materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some
   of: the number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their
   abundances at each pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse
   problem because of model inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental
   conditions, endmember variability, and data set size. Researchers have
   devised and investigated many models searching for robust, stable,
   tractable, and accurate unmixing algorithms. This paper presents an
   overview of unmixing methods from the time of Keshava and Mustard's
   unmixing tutorial {[}1] to the present. Mixing models are first
   discussed. Signal-subspace, geometrical, statistical, sparsity-based,
   and spatial-contextual unmixing algorithms are described. Mathematical
   problems and potential solutions are described. Algorithm
   characteristics are illustrated experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a designed and tested integrated miniature tubular
   quartz-made reactor for hydrogen (H-2) production. This reactor is
   composed of two concentric tubes with an overall length of 60 mm and a
   diameter of 17 mm. The inner tube was designed as the combustor using
   Pt/Al2O3 as the catalyst. The gap between the inner and outer tubes is
   divided into three sections: a liquid methanol-water vaporizer, a
   methanol-steam reformer using RP-60 as the catalyst and a carbon
   monoxide (CO) methanator using Ru/Al2O3 as the catalyst. The
   experimental measurements indicated that this integrated reactor works
   properly as designed. The methanol conversion, hydrogen production rate
   and CO concentration were found to increase with an increasing
   methanol/air flow rate in the combustor and decreases with an increasing
   methanol/water feed rate to the reformer. The methanator experimental
   results indicated that the CO conversion and H-2 consumption can be
   enhanced by increasing the Ru loading. It was also found that the CO
   methanation depends greatly on the reaction temperature. With a higher
   reaction temperature, the CO methanation, carbon dioxide (CO2)
   methanation, and reversed water gas shift reactions took place
   simultaneously. CO conversion was found to decrease while H-2
   consumption was found to increase. At a lower reaction temperature both
   the CO conversion and H-2 consumption were found to increase indicating
   that only CO methanation took place. From the experimental results the
   maximum methanol conversion, hydrogen yield, and CO conversion achieved
   were 97\%, 2.38, and 70\%, respectively. The actual lowest CO
   concentration and maximum power density based on the reactor volume were
   90 ppm and 0.8 kW/L, respectively. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Society relies heavily on its networked physical infrastructure and
   information systems. Accurately assessing the vulnerability of these
   systems against disruptive events is vital for planning and risk
   management. Existing approaches to vulnerability assessments of
   large-scale systems mainly focus on investigating inhomogeneous
   properties of the underlying graph elements. These measures and the
   associated heuristic solutions are limited in evaluating the
   vulnerability of large-scale network topologies. Furthermore, these
   approaches often fail to provide performance guarantees of the proposed
   solutions. In this paper, we propose a vulnerability measure, pairwise
   connectivity, and use it to formulate network vulnerability assessment
   as a graph-theoretical optimization problem, referred to as
   beta-disruptor. The objective is to identify the minimum set of critical
   network elements, namely nodes and edges, whose removal results in a
   specific degradation of the network global pairwise connectivity. We
   prove the NP-completeness and inapproximability of this problem and
   propose an O(log n log log n) pseudo-approximation algorithm to
   computing the set of critical nodes and an O(log(1.5) n)
   pseudo-approximation algorithm for computing the set of critical edges.
   The results of an extensive simulation-based experiment show the
   feasibility of our proposed vulnerability assessment framework and the
   efficiency of the proposed approximation algorithms in comparison to
   other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of liquids to municipal solid waste landfills, a practice
   sometimes performed under pressure to promote moisture distribution, has
   the potential to affect slope stability as a result of increased pore
   water pressure (and reduced shear strength) in the landfilled waste.
   Liquids addition into waste by using buried horizontal trenches was
   modeled to determine pore water pressure distributions, and the
   resulting effect on slope stability was assessed for different
   operational strategies. Model results using typical mechanical
   properties for solid waste found that pressurized liquids addition under
   a sloped landfill surface was possible without inducing a slope failure,
   providing liquids distribution was not obstructed. A reduction in the
   factor of safety occurred when simulating a poorly functioning leachate
   collection and removal system, a low-permeability cover layer within the
   landfill, a seepage control strategy using low-permeability soil, high
   liquids addition pressures, and waste permeability decreasing with
   depth. The sensitivity of the model results to input parameters was
   evaluated and graphically presented. The results demonstrate how
   pressurized liquids addition has the potential to affect slope stability
   and provide important insights for engineers charged with designing and
   permitting such systems. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000609. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents the findings of an investigation using the
   finite-element method to predict the distribution of temperatures within
   a hydrating massive concrete element. The temperature distribution
   produced by the finite-element thermal analysis of the model is used in
   the finite-element structural analysis to quantify the maximum allowable
   internal temperature difference before cracking will initiate in the
   concrete. To verify the results obtained in the finite-element model,
   four different mixes of concrete, typical for use in mass concrete
   applications in Florida, were produced and each mix was used to make two
   large-scale 1: 07 m x 1: 07 m x 1.07 m (3: 5 ft x 3.5 ft x 3.5 ft)
   concrete blocks. The mechanical and thermal properties of early age
   concrete used values obtained experimentally from the concrete used to
   construct the four sets of blocks. The temperature distributions
   produced by the model were shown to be very similar to those measured in
   the experimental blocks. Results suggest that reliance on a limiting
   maximum temperature differential to control cracking in massive concrete
   applications should be supplemented with a requirement for the
   presentation of an analysis showing the calculated stress response to
   the predicted temperature distribution within the concrete to ensure
   that the induced tensile stresses will not exceed the tensile strength
   of the concrete. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000389. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Citrus greening, also called Huanglongbing (HLB), became a devastating
   disease spread through citrus groves in Florida, since it was first
   found in 2005. Multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) airborne images
   of citrus groves in Florida were acquired to detect citrus greening
   infected trees in 2007 and 2010. Ground truthing including field and
   indoor spectral measurement, infection status along with GPS coordinates
   was conducted for both healthy and infected trees. Ground spectral
   measurements showed that healthy canopy had higher reflectance in the
   visible range, and lower reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) range
   than HLB infected canopy. Red edge position (REP) also showed notable
   difference between healthy and HLB canopy. But the difference in the NIR
   range and REP were comparably more sensitive to the environment or the
   background noise. Accuracy for separating HLB and healthy samples
   reached more than 90\% when a simple REP threshold method was
   implemented in the ground reflectance datasets, regardless of field or
   indoor measurement; but it did not work well with the HS images because
   of its low spatial resolution. Support vector machine (SVM) was able to
   provide a fast, easy and adoptable way to build a mask for tree canopy.
   High positioning error of the ground truth in the 2007 HS image led to
   validation accuracy of less than 50\% for most of classification
   methods. In the 2010 image from Southern Gardens (SG) grove, with better
   ground truth records, higher classification accuracies (about 90\% in
   training sets, more than 60\% in validation sets for most of the
   methods) were achieved. Disease density maps were also generated from
   the classification results of each method; most of them were able to
   identify the severely infected areas. Simpler classification methods
   such as minimum distance (MinDist) and Mahalanobis distance (MahaDist)
   showed more stable and balanced detection accuracy between the training
   and validation sets in the 2010 images. Their similar infection trend
   with ground scouted maps showed a promising future to manage HLB disease
   with airborne spectral imaging. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The dynamic tree (DT) graphical model is a popular analytical tool for
   image segmentation and object classification tasks. A DT is a useful
   model in this context because its hierarchical property enables the user
   to examine information in multiple scales and its flexible structure can
   more easily fit complex region boundaries compared to rigid quadtree
   structures such as tree-structured Bayesian networks. This paper
   proposes a novel framework for data fusion called a deformable Bayesian
   network (DFBN) by using a DT model to fuse measurements from multiple
   sensing platforms into a nonredundant representation. The structural
   flexibility of the DFBN will be used to fuse common information across
   different sensor measurements. The appropriate structure update
   strategies for the DFBN and its parameters for the data fusion
   application are discussed. A real-world example application using sonar
   images collected from a survey mission is presented. The fusion results
   using the presented DFBN framework are shown to outperform
   state-of-the-art approaches such as the Gaussian mean shift and spectral
   clustering algorithms. The DFBN's complexity and scalability are
   discussed to address its potential for a larger data set.}},

Title = {{Organ doses for reference pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing
   computed tomography estimated by Monte Carlo simulation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2129-2146}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To establish an organ dose database for pediatric and
   adolescent reference individuals undergoing computed tomography (CT)
   examinations by using Monte Carlo simulation. The data will permit rapid
   estimates of organ and effective doses for patients of different age,
   gender, examination type, and CT scanner model.
   Methods: The Monte Carlo simulation model of a Siemens Sensation 16 CT
   scanner previously published was employed as a base CT scanner model. A
   set of absorbed doses for 33 organs/tissues normalized to the product of
   100 mAs and CTDIvol (mGy/100 mAs mGy) was established by coupling the CT
   scanner model with age-dependent reference pediatric hybrid phantoms. A
   series of single axial scans from the top of head to the feet of the
   phantoms was performed at a slice thickness of 10 mm, and at tube
   potentials of 80, 100, and 120 kVp. Using the established CTDIvol- and
   100 mAs-normalized dose matrix, organ doses for different pediatric
   phantoms undergoing head, chest, abdomen-pelvis, and
   chest-abdomen-pelvis (CAP) scans with the Siemens Sensation 16 scanner
   were estimated and analyzed. The results were then compared with the
   values obtained from three independent published methods: CT-Expo
   software, organ dose for abdominal CT scan derived empirically from
   patient abdominal circumference, and effective dose per dose-length
   product (DLP).
   Results: Organ and effective doses were calculated and normalized to 100
   mAs and CTDIvol for different CT examinations. At the same technical
   setting, dose to the organs, which were entirely included in the CT beam
   coverage, were higher by from 40 to 80\% for newborn phantoms compared
   to those of 15-year phantoms. An increase of tube potential from 80 to
   120 kVp resulted in 2.5-2.9-fold greater brain dose for head scans. The
   results from this study were compared with three different published
   studies and/or techniques. First, organ doses were compared to those
   given by CT-Expo which revealed dose differences up to several-fold when
   organs were partially included in the scan coverage. Second, selected
   organ doses from our calculations agreed to within 20\% of values
   derived from empirical formulae based upon measured patient abdominal
   circumference. Third, the existing DLP-to-effective dose conversion
   coefficients tended to be smaller than values given in the present study
   for all examinations except head scans.
   Conclusions: A comprehensive organ/effective dose database was
   established to readily calculate doses for given patients undergoing
   different CT examinations. The comparisons of our results with the
   existing studies highlight that use of hybrid phantoms with realistic
   anatomy is important to improve the accuracy of CT organ dosimetry. The
   comprehensive pediatric dose data developed here are the first
   organ-specific pediatric CT scan database based on the realistic
   pediatric hybrid phantoms which are compliant with the reference data
   from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The
   organ dose database is being coupled with an adult organ dose database
   recently published as part of the development of a user-friendly
   computer program enabling rapid estimates of organ and effective dose
   doses for patients of any age, gender, examination types, and CT scanner
   model. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{Alternating AB copolymers were synthesized by exploiting the selectivity
   of the metathesis reaction between alpha,omega-dienes and

   (ADMET) polymerizations, the copolymerization of dienes and diacrylates
   does not require high vacuum conditions. This work utilizes this unique
   characteristic to explore the effect of various solvents on ADMET
   polymerization. We found significant variation in the efficacy of the
   solvents we screened, with CH2Cl2 yielding the highest molecular weight
   polymer. Additionally, the performance of Grubbs second generation
   catalyst was compared with Hoveyda-Grubbs second generation catalyst in
   different solvents, revealing a stark difference in the molecular weight
   of the resulting polymers in CH2Cl2 but a relatively minor difference in
   the final molecular weight from polymerizations in acetic acid.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{469-476}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The design of nanocomposite capacitors poses certain challenges due to
   the reduced dielectric strength resulting from the integration of
   typically high dielectric fillers into the polymer. In prior efforts it
   was demonstrated that increasing of the filler could lead to
   energy-storage densities up to 19.3\% above the neat polymer. To further
   enhance the energy density, a novel strategy is developed to align
   nanowires in a thermoplastic matrix by uniaxial stretching assembly. It
   is demonstrated that the energy-storage capability of the nanocomposite
   can be enhanced through the alignment of lead zirconate titanate (PZT)
   nanowires (NWs) in the direction of the applied electric field compared
   to randomly oriented samples. The maximum energy density of the
   nanocomposites is as high as 1.28 J cm-3 at a volume fraction of 40\%
   PZT NWs (aspect ratio around 14) with axis of alignment in the direction
   of the electric field. The findings of this research could lead to
   broader interest due to development of the piezoceramic nanocomposites
   with enhanced dielectric properties for use in next-generation
   energy-storage and conversion devices.}},

Abstract = {{Microscale 2D separation systems have been implemented in capillaries

   advancement, focusing on three types of platforms, including 2D
   capillary electrophoresis (CE), CE coupling with capillary LC, and
   microfluidic devices. A variety of CE and LC modes have been employed to
   construct 2D separation systems via sophistically designed interfaces.
   Coupling of different separation modes has also been realized in a
   number of microfluidic devices. These separation systems have been
   applied for the proteomic analysis of various biological samples,
   ranging from a single cell to tumor tissues.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss in this paper the propagation of lightning current pulses
   along conical tall structures. Although the dominant mode of an
   infinitely long conical transmission line is transverse electric and
   magnetic (TEM), such a structure can also support higher order TE and TM
   modes which display a gradual cutoff frequency variation with height.
   Recently, Baba and Rakov's finite-difference time domain numerical
   analysis revealed that for a perfectly conducting conical structure,
   while the current pulses suffer no attenuation as they travel from the
   cone's apex to its base, the attenuation is significant when pulses
   propagate from the base to the apex. Adopting an analysis method using
   1) the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation environment based on the finite
   element method and 2) the partial equivalent element circuit method, we
   study the same reduced-scale structure analyzed by Baba and Rakov. The
   obtained results confirm the conclusions drawn by Baba and Rakov. We
   also perform simulations for the case of a 100-m tall tower considering
   different tower-base radii. It is shown that the upward current pulses
   are affected by a strong attenuation resulting from the field scattering
   near the discontinuity at the tower base, followed by a weaker
   attenuation resulting from the propagation along the cone from its base
   to the apex. A simple way to modify the engineering lightning return
   stroke models to account for the attenuation of the upward current
   pulses is suggested. Finally, we report on experiments to study the
   current pulse propagation along a 1/582 reduced scale model of the
   Toronto, CN, tower. The obtained experimental data support the numerical
   simulations.}},

Title = {{Impact of manure and slurry applications on soil nitrate in a
   maize-triticale rotation: Field study and long term simulation analysis}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{43-53}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of nitrate leaching from agricultural systems is critical to
   environment impact studies. Simulation models can help to assess and
   understand the dynamics of nitrates in the soil and in relation to
   fertilizer types and agronomical management. The main hypothesis of this
   study was that the long term annual application of mineral and organic N
   fertilizers, in irrigated sandy soil areas increases dramatically the
   quantity of NO3- in the soil for potential nitrate leaching. The main
   objectives of this research were then to quantify inorganic N
   concentration in soil layers affected by mineral and organic N (manure
   and slurry) fertilizers: and to test the SAWS crop simulation model to
   identify the best N management strategy able to minimize NO3- leaching
   without compromising crop growth and yields. A first set of rotational
   simulations were carried out for the 2007 and 2008 experiments, with the
   goal of comparing measured and simulated results. A second set of
   rotational simulations were carried out for a long term assessment (50
   years) of the two treatments in comparisons. Additional long term
   rotational simulation runs were carried out considering two different
   fertilization strategies based on the maize crop uptake in 2007 (276 kg
   N ha(-1)) and on the PUA ({''}Best Nitrogen Management with manures{''})
   which defines the fertilization practices adopted in the nitrate
   vulnerable zones (no more than 170 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Measured data
   showed that in the manure treatment, the highest nitrate-N concentration
   was 627.3 mg kg(-1) at 0.10 m depth on August 2008, while the lowest was
   2.50 mg kg(-1) at 1.40 m depth on July 2007. In the slurry treatment,
   the maximum nitrate N concentration was 344.6 mg kg(-1) at 0.10 m depth
   on August 2008 and the minimum was 8.9 mg kg(-1) at 0.60 cm depth on
   September 2007. The model was able to closely reproduce the measured
   results. The simulation results of the inorganic soil N were 1228 kg
   ha(-1) and 1370 kg ha(-1) for the manure and slurry treatment
   respectively versus the measured soil inorganic N content at the
   beginning of the experiment of 1267 kg ha(-1) for the manure treatment
   and 1323 kg ha(-1) for the slurry treatment. The simulated cumulative
   amount of nitrate leaching was 9251 kg ha(-1) for the manure treatment
   and 11,101 kg ha(-1) for the slurry treatment for the 50 years
   simulations.
   The simulations results also showed that when the inorganic N was used
   alone, the amount of leaching and soil N were significantly reduced. (C)

Title = {{Optimal N fertiliser management based on a seasonal forecast}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{66-73}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Achievable grain yields can vary widely between seasons in rain-fed
   agriculture. Adjusting N fertiliser inputs according to achievable grain
   yields could reduce over-fertilisation in low-yielding seasons and allow
   increasing gross margins in potential high-yielding seasons. Seasonal
   rainfall forecasts from the coupled ocean-atmosphere global circulation
   model POAMA were skill tested and employed for N fertiliser decision
   making in the Western Australian wheat-belt. The POAMA seasonal rainfall
   forecast showed significant skill in forecasting rainfall season types
   in southern regions of the Western Australian wheat-belt. This skill
   resulted in about A\$50 ha(-1) of additional benefits when used in N
   management decisions in wheat cropping. However, such a forecast should
   not be used without considering other systems knowledge available to
   farmers. Combining a forecast with systems information such as initial
   soil water conditions can be crucial in obtaining value from a forecast.
   Another important factor to consider is the risk behaviour of farmers,
   where the gross margin from additional fertiliser is expected to exceed
   the cost by a factor of two or more. Finally, variations in fertiliser
   cost and wheat prices are critical in determining the benefits from
   using a forecast system for management decisions in agriculture. Using a
   forecast for only the wet season-type can further increase a forecast
   value because the additional gains in wet seasons are often higher than
   the savings from reduced fertiliser in dry seasons. It is expected that
   skilful seasonal forecasting systems will become increasingly valuable
   in regions where rainfall is decreasing because they help to capture
   benefits in the declining number of potentially high-yielding seasons
   and minimise the losses in the increasing number of low-yielding
   seasons. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to understand phase transition in
   noncooperative dynamic games with a large number of agents. Applications
   are found in neuroscience, biology, and economics, as well as
   traditional engineering applications. The focus of analysis is a
   variation of the large population linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) model
   of Huang et al. 2007, comprised here of a controlled N-dimensional
   stochastic differential equation model, coupled only through a cost
   function. The states are interpreted as phase angles for a collection of
   heterogeneous oscillators, and in this way the model may be regarded as
   an extension of the classical coupled oscillator model of Kuramoto. A
   deterministic PDE model is proposed, which is shown to approximate the
   stochastic system as the population size approaches infinity. Key to the
   analysis of the PDE model is the existence of a particular Nash
   equilibrium in which the agents `opt out' of the game, setting their
   controls to zero, resulting in the `incoherence' equilibrium. Methods
   from dynamical systems theory are used in a bifurcation analysis, based
   on a linearization of the partial differential equation (PDE) model
   about the incoherence equilibrium. A critical value of the control cost
   parameter is identified: above this value, the oscillators are
   incoherent; and below this value (when control is sufficiently cheap)
   the oscillators synchronize. These conclusions are illustrated with
   results from numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an improved technique for estimating the end-to-end
   distortion, which includes both a quantization error after encoding and
   a random transmission error, after transmission in video communication
   systems. The proposed technique mainly differs from most existing
   techniques in that it takes into account filtering operations, e.g.,
   interpolation in subpixel motion compensation, as introduced in advanced
   video codecs. The distortion estimation for pixels or subpixels under
   filtering operations requires the computation of the second moment of a
   weighted sum of random variables. In this paper, we prove a proposition
   for calculating the second moment of a weighted sum of correlated random
   variables without requiring knowledge of their probability distribution.
   Then, we apply the proposition to extend our previous error-resilient
   algorithm for prediction mode decision without significantly increasing
   complexity. Experimental results using an H.264/AVC codec show that our
   new algorithm provides an improvement in both rate-distortion
   performance and subjective quality over existing algorithms. Our
   algorithm can also be applied in the upcoming high-efficiency video
   coding standard, where additional filtering techniques are under
   consideration.}},

   design is presented here, and measured performance was in line with
   sponsor specifications, including a sensitivity of -39 mu V/Pa, a
   minimum detectable pressure of 40.4 dB, a confirmed bandwidth up to 20
   kHz, a 129.5-kHz resonant frequency, and a 3\% distortion limit
   approaching 172 dB. With this performance-in addition to its small

Abstract = {{This paper presents technology development toward the goal of a

   of underwater high-speed supercavitating vehicles. Low-resistance
   polysilicon-based throughsilicon vias (TSVs) have been integrated with
   the device to enable backside contacts for drive and sense circuitry.
   The sensor and vias were fabricated in a
   complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible process using deep
   reactive ion etching, producing a 1-mm-diameter composite diaphragm and
   20-mu m-diameter high-aspect-ratio TSVs on a silicon-on-insulator wafer.
   The diaphragm incorporates a central resistive heater for thermoelastic
   actuation and diffused piezoresistors for sensing acoustic pressure
   perturbations. Electrical, mechanical, and acoustic characterizations of
   the device indicate a transmitter source level of 50 dB (ref 20 mu Pa)

   in optically dense flows. In order to avoid damaging the optical access
   windows, the high-speed gas jet was seeded with small ice crystals. LDV
   bursts from the bed particles and gas tracer ice crystals were
   simultaneously recorded. The Doppler signals from the tracer crystals
   and bed particles were differentiated based on their burst intensity and
   coincidence to yield the particulate and gas phase velocities at a given
   location within the jet plume. Example gas and particulate phase

Abstract = {{With the development of computers and the Internet, digital multimedia
   can be distributed and pirated easily. Watermarking is a useful
   technique for multimedia copyright protection. In this paper, we develop
   a robust video watermarking system. It consists of two components, that
   is, watermarking embedder and watermarking detector. In the embedder, we
   insert a watermark pattern into video frames according to a watermark
   payload. The watermark pattern is generated from a pseudo-random noise
   sequence generator using the spread spectrum technique. User and
   copyright information are mapped to a binary sequence and then encrypted
   with advanced encryption standard and encoded/protected by convolutional
   error correction code to produce a watermark payload. The watermark
   pattern is weighted and embedded to each frame to meet perceptual
   requirements. In addition, the video is slightly geometrically
   manipulated in order to defend possible collusion attacks. The detector
   extracts the watermark from the candidate video. KanadeLucasTomasi
   feature tracker is used to register the candidate video with respect to
   the original video to enhance the correlation with the reference. The
   cross-correlation sequence is binarized, error correction code decoded,
   and decrypted. The experimental results show that the proposed video
   watermark system is very robust to not only geometric attack but also
   collusion attacks, and that it is perceptually invisible to human vision
   system. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a dynamic Lagrangian dual optimization
   procedure for solving mixed-integer 0-1 linear programming problems.
   Similarly to delayed relax-and-cut approaches, the procedure dynamically
   appends valid inequalities to the linear programming relaxation as
   induced by the Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT). A Lagrangian
   dual algorithm that is augmented with a primal solution recovery scheme
   is applied implicitly to a full or partial first-level RLT relaxation,
   where RLT constraints that are currently being violated by the primal
   estimate are dynamically generated within the Lagrangian dual problem,
   thus controlling the size of the dual space while effectively capturing
   the strength of the RLT-enhanced relaxation. We present a preliminary
   computational study to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{A technique is presented to estimate static tip resistance of a pile
   during driving from embedded strain and accelerometer data located one
   diameter (D) from the bottom of the pile. The approach uses a nonlinear
   single degree of freedom system to satisfy force and energy equilibrium
   with a global genetic inversion approach. By balancing force and energy
   from inertia, damping, and stiffness against the measured tip data, the
   unknown parameters (mass, damping, and nonlinear stiffness) are
   estimated. Requiring a few seconds for analysis for each blow, the
   algorithm ensures a real-time assessment of static tip resistance as a
   function of displacement, which is important when setting pile lengths.
   The proposed approach was applied to four test piles at two bridge sites
   (Florida and Louisiana). Mobilized static tip resistances ranging from
   400 to 1500 kN as a function of displacement were predicted. The
   predicted static resistance versus displacements compared favorably with
   measured values from static load tests. Interestingly, the maximum
   recorded increase in tip resistance in silty to clayey sands was less
   than 20\% when piles were re-struck at times ranging from 2 to 30 days
   after initial drive.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{332-340}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method for reducing the order of dynamic models of
   temperature and humidity in multizone buildings. Low-order models of
   building thermal dynamics are useful for model-based HVAC control
   techniques, especially to computationally intensive ones such as Model
   Predictive Control (MPC). Even a lumped parameter model for a multi-zone
   building, which is a set of non-linear coupled ordinary differential
   equations, can have large state-space dimension. Model reduction
   techniques are useful to simplify such models. Although there are a
   number of well-developed techniques for model reduction of linear
   systems, techniques available for non-linear systems are limited. The
   method we propose exploits the linear portion of the model to compute a
   transformation (by using balanced realization) and a specific sparsity
   pattern of the non-linear portion that building thermal models possess
   to obtain the reduced order model. Simulations show that the prediction
   of the zone temperatures and humidity ratios by the reduced model is
   quite close to that from the full-scale model, even when substantial
   reduction of model order is specified that reduces computation time by a
   factor of six or more. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To quantify the hazard of hurricane storm surge and coastal inundation
   in the U.S., storm surge atlas and base flood elevation (BFE) maps are
   developed. The traditional method for determining the BFE map is the
   joint probability method (JPM), which requires the simulation of over
   thousands of hypothetical hurricanes to accurately represent the storm
   climatology to determine the surge response and return frequency-a huge
   cost using the sophisticated surge and inundation models today. This
   study presents an efficient and accurate JPM-OS (optimal sampling) for
   determining inundation return frequencies using piecewise multivariate
   regression splines coupled with dimension adaptive sparse grids, based
   on inundation response calculated by a storm surge modeling system. This
   method involves the interpolation in five-dimensional space of the
   simulated surge response and the storm characteristics of an optimal set
   of storms to any set of storm parameters. The interpolated results can
   be combined with a probabilistic description to obtain the return
   frequencies. The method is used to calculate the inundation frequencies
   of SW Florida and compared with the JPM. The results show excellent
   agreement between simulated and interpolated response with two orders of
   magnitude reduction in computational cost. This technique can be readily
   applied to other coasts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The first part of this two-part review focused on the fundamental and
   diagnostics aspects of laser-induced plasmas, only touching briefly upon
   concepts such as sensitivity and detection limits and largely omitting
   any discussion of the vast panorama of the practical applications of the
   technique. Clearly a true LIBS community has emerged, which promises to
   quicken the pace of LIBS developments, applications, and
   implementations. With this second part, a more applied flavor is taken,
   and its intended goal is summarizing the current state-of-the-art of
   analytical LIBS, providing a contemporary snapshot of LIBS applications,
   and highlighting new directions in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy,
   such as novel approaches, instrumental developments, and advanced use of
   chemometric tools. More specifically, we discuss instrumental and
   analytical approaches (e.g., double- and multi-pulse LIBS to improve the
   sensitivity), calibration-free approaches, hyphenated approaches in
   which techniques such as Raman and fluorescence are coupled with LIBS to
   increase sensitivity and information power, resonantly enhanced LIBS
   approaches, signal processing and optimization (e.g., signal-to-noise
   analysis), and finally applications. An attempt is made to provide an
   updated view of the role played by LIBS in the various fields, with
   emphasis on applications considered to be unique. We finally try to
   assess where LIBS is going as an analytical field, where in our opinion
   it should go, and what should still he done for consolidating the
   technique as a mature method of chemical analysis.}},

Title = {{Estimation of nonlinear static skin friction on multiple pile segments

   pile}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{79-89}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A technique is presented to estimate the nonlinear skin friction of a
   driven pile using monitored strains and accelerations at the top and
   bottom of a pile during a hammer blow. The scheme is based on a
   numerical solution of the 1-D wave equation with nonlinear static skin
   friction and viscous stiffness proportional damping. The soil-pile
   system is divided into pile segments based on pile length and the
   frequency content of the measured signal. Each segment is characterized
   with independent multilinear (bilinear loading with independent
   unloading) soil skin friction. The measured strains at the top and
   bottom of the pile are used to solve for the unknowns, including
   proportional damping and the loading and unloading stiffness of each
   pile segment from a least square error comparison of measured and
   computed particle velocities at the top and bottom of the pile. The
   technique was applied to four full-scale piles driven into layered sand
   and clay deposits with measured ultimate static skin frictions varying
   from 700 to 2700 kN. The analysis was carried out on five separate
   beginning of restrike blows within 1 week of the static load tests. The
   approach was shown to give consistent (within 20\%) predicted skin
   frictions vs. displacements of the measured static load test results.

Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{77-82}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the event of a pandemic, the general public would use filters as
   protective devices. However, most commercial filters only remove
   airborne viruses physically without inactivating them, allowing
   reproduction on the surface and yielding the mask as a fomite. The
   objective of this study was to investigate the inactivation performance
   of dialdehyde starch (DAS) treated filters against airborne viruses.
   The viable removal efficiency by and relative survivability on the
   biocidal filters prepared with dialdehyde starch compared to untreated
   filters were investigated using MS2 bacteriophage at high relative
   humidity (80-90\%) and room temperature. Experimental results showed no
   significant difference in viable removal efficiency and pressure drop
   between the treated and untreated filters for polypropylene filtering
   facepiece respirators. The pressure drop of DAS treated cellulose
   filters significantly decreased although there was no significant change
   in viable removal efficiency; the combination of these two factors
   resulted in an increase of filter quality. All biocidal filters showed a
   significantly lower relative survivability than untreated filters, and
   the relative survivability decreased as the concentration of DAS
   increased. The biocidal filter treated with 4\% DAS presented an average
   of 30\% survivability compared to the baseline of untreated filters. The
   results demonstrate that dialdehyde starch can be incorporated onto
   filters to provide an effective means for inactivating MS2 viruses
   through surface contact. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of emotional conditioning on early visual processing: Temporal

Abstract = {{Studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have shown that
   affectively arousing stimuli enhance attention and perception. In
   addition, simple neutral stimuli, when paired with emotionally engaging
   unconditioned stimuli (i.e., the CS+) in classical conditioning
   paradigms, were found to evoke increased sensory responses as learning
   progresses, compared to responses elicited by the same stimuli not
   paired with a noxious stimulus (CS-). To date the detailed
   trial-to-trial temporal dynamics of this sensory facilitation process is
   not known. Signal averaging required for the ERP analysis eliminates
   trial-to-trial information of temporal cortical dynamics. In the current
   study, a novel single-trial analysis method called Analysis of
   Single-trial ERP and Ongoing activity (ASEO) was adopted to study the
   detailed electrocortical dynamics of sensory processing during classical
   aversive conditioning. Focusing on the P1 component of the ERP evoked by
   simple grating patterns serving as CS+ and CS-, we found that over a
   session of conditioning trials, there were three phases of P1 amplitude
   changes for both CS+ and CS-: (1) an initial decrease phase, (2) a
   subsequent increase phase, and (3) a final habituating phase. Tests on
   the rates of P1 amplitude changes in each of the three phases between
   CS+ and CS- conditions revealed differential effects of CS+ and CS- for
   all three phases. No such effects were found for a session of control
   trials where the same grating patterns were paired with checkerboards.
   We interpret these results as providing evidence supporting the view
   that emotional experience can modulate early visual processing and
   dynamics of perceptual learning. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{We report that the ferromagnetism of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite
   (HOPG) samples as measured by hysteretic magnetization loops can be
   diminished and eventually extinguished with sufficiently long high
   vacuum anneals at temperatures on the order of 2300 degrees C.
   Concomitant with the extinction of ferromagnetism, we observe an
   anneal-induced increase in grain size (accompanied by possible edge
   reconstruction) confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements and improved
   transport properties, including lower in-plane and out-of-plane
   resistivity, higher electron and hole mobility and improved charge
   compensation. The implied reduction of defects and vacancies by
   annealing suggests that the ferromagnetism of pristine HOPG is
   correlated with localized states located at zigzag edges, vacancies and
   related defects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are distributed systems that have
   proliferated across diverse application domains (e. g.,
   security/defense, health care, etc.). One commonality across all WSN
   domains is the need to meet application requirements (i.e., lifetime,
   responsiveness, etc.) through domain specific sensor node design.
   Techniques such as sensor node parameter tuning enable WSN designers to
   specialize tunable parameters (i.e., processor voltage and frequency,
   sensing frequency, etc.) to meet these application requirements.
   However, given WSN domain diversity, varying environmental situations
   (stimuli), and sensor node complexity, sensor node parameter tuning is a
   very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an automated Markov
   Decision Process (MDP)-based methodology to prescribe optimal sensor
   node operation (selection of values for tunable parameters such as
   processor voltage, processor frequency, and sensing frequency) to meet
   application requirements and adapt to changing environmental stimuli.
   Numerical results confirm the optimality of our proposed methodology and
   reveal that our methodology more closely meets application requirements
   compared to other feasible policies.}},

Abstract = {{With Moore's law supplying billions of transistors on-chip, embedded
   systems are undergoing a transition from single-core to multicore to
   exploit this high-transistor density for high performance. Embedded
   systems differ from traditional high-performance supercomputers in that
   power is a first-order constraint for embedded systems; whereas,
   performance is the major benchmark for supercomputers. The increase in
   on-chip transistor density exacerbates power/thermal issues in embedded
   systems, which necessitates novel hardware/software power/thermal
   management techniques to meet the ever-increasing high-performance
   embedded computing demands in an energy-efficient manner. This paper
   outlines typical requirements of embedded applications and discusses
   state-of-the-art hardware/software high-performance energy-efficient
   embedded computing (HPEEC) techniques that help meeting these
   requirements. We also discuss modern multicore processors that leverage
   these HPEEC techniques to deliver high performance per watt. Finally, we
   present design challenges and future research directions for HPEEC
   system development.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in wireless networks is the ability to maximize the
   throughput. High throughput in a wireless network requires a relatively
   low complex scheduling policy with a provable efficiency ratio, which is
   a measure of the performance of the policy in terms of throughput and
   stability. For most scheduling policies that achieve provable ratios, at
   the onset of every frame, a selection is made of a subset of links to
   transmit data in the immediately following frame. In this paper, we
   propose a policy that allows links to transmit data in any future frame
   by means of frame reservations. The new, reservation-based distributed
   scheduling approach will improve the capacity of the system and provide
   greater throughput. First, we create a framework to analyze the
   stability of reservation-based scheduling systems. Then, to demonstrate
   its efficacy, we propose a reservation-based distributed scheduling
   policy for IEEE 802.16 mesh networks and use the new framework to find
   sufficient conditions for the stability of the network under this
   policy, i.e., we find a lower bound for its efficiency ratio. Finally,
   by means of simulation, we validate the mathematical analysis and
   compare the performance of our policy with nonreservation-based
   policies.}},

Abstract = {{Impairment of the human neuromusculoskeletal system can lead to
   significant mobility limitations and decreased quality of life.
   Computational models that accurately represent the musculoskeletal
   systems of individual patients could be used to explore different
   treatment options and optimize clinical outcome. The most significant
   barrier to model-based treatment design is validation of model-based
   estimates of in vivo contact and muscle forces. This paper introduces an
   annual Grand Challenge Competition to Predict In Vivo Knee Loads based
   on a series of comprehensive publicly available in vivo data sets for
   evaluating musculoskeletal model predictions of contact and muscle
   forces in the knee. The data sets come from patients implanted with
   force-measuring tibial prostheses. Following a historical review of
   musculoskeletal modeling methods used for estimating knee muscle and
   contact forces, we describe the first two data sets used for the first
   two competitions and summarize four subsequent data sets to be used for
   future competitions. These data sets include tibial contact force, video
   motion, ground reaction, muscle EMG, muscle strength, static and dynamic
   imaging, and implant geometry data. Competition participants create
   musculoskeletal models to predict tibial contact forces without having
   access to the corresponding in vivo measurements. These blinded
   predictions provide an unbiased evaluation of the capabilities and
   limitations of musculoskeletal modeling methods. The paper concludes
   with a discussion of how these unique data sets can be used by the
   musculoskeletal modeling research community to improve the estimation of
   in vivo muscle and contact forces and ultimately to help make
   musculoskeletal models clinically useful. (C) 2011 Orthopaedic Research

   mobility impairments: a perspective from European research sites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Mobility impairments due to injury or disease have a significant impact
   on quality of life. Consequently, development of effective treatments to
   restore or replace lost function is an important societal challenge. In
   current clinical practice, a treatment plan is often selected from a
   standard menu of options rather than customized to the unique
   characteristics of the patient. Furthermore, the treatment selection
   process is normally based on subjective clinical experience rather than
   objective prediction of post-treatment function. The net result is
   treatment methods that are less effective than desired at restoring lost
   function. This paper discusses the possible use of personalized
   neuromusculoskeletal computer models to improve customization,
   objectivity, and ultimately effectiveness of treatments for mobility
   impairments. The discussion is based on information gathered from
   academic and industrial research sites throughout Europe, and both
   clinical and technical aspects of personalized neuromusculoskeletal
   modeling are explored. On the clinical front, we discuss the purpose and
   process of personalized neuromusculoskeletal modeling, the application
   of personalized models to clinical problems, and gaps in clinical
   application. On the technical front, we discuss current capabilities of
   personalized neuromusculoskeletal models along with technical gaps that
   limit future clinical application. We conclude by summarizing
   recommendations for future research efforts that would allow
   personalized neuromusculoskeletal models to make the greatest impact
   possible on treatment design for mobility impairments.}},

Title = {{Adsorption of sulfamethoxazole on biochar and its impact on reclaimed

Abstract = {{Reclaimed water irrigation can satisfy increasing water demand, but it
   may also introduce pharmaceutical contaminants into the soil and
   groundwater environment. In this work, a range of laboratory experiments
   were conducted to test whether biochar can be amended in soils to
   enhance removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from reclaimed water. Eight
   types of biochar were tested in laboratory sorption experiments yielding
   solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d) of 2-104 L/kg. Two types of
   biochar with relatively high Kd were used in column leaching experiments
   to assess their effect on reclaimed water SMX transport through soils.
   Only about 2-14\% of the SMX was transported through biochar-amended
   soils, while 60\% was found in the leachate of the unamended soils.
   Toxicity characteristic leaching experiments confirmed that the mobility
   and bioavailability of SMX in biochar-amended soils were lower than that
   of unamended soils. However, biochar with high accumulations of SMX was
   still found to inhibit the growth of the bacteria compared to biochar
   with less SMX which showed no effects. Thus, biochar with very high
   pharmaceutical sorption abilities may find use as a low-cost alternative
   sorbent for treating wastewater plant effluent, but should be used with
   caution as an amendment to soils irrigated with reclaimed water or waste
   water. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polystyrene-based polymers that feature pendant Ru(II) polypyridine
   chromophores have been prepared by using reversible addition
   fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization combined with the
   azide-alkyne click reaction. RAFT polymerization was effected using
   4-chloromethylstyrene to afford functional polymers with M-n values of
   3300 and 8600 g/mol with low polydispersity. Reaction of the resulting
   poly(4-chloromethylstyrene)s with azide ion afforded the corresponding
   poly(4-azidomethylstyrene)s, which were further reacted in an
   azide-alkyne click reaction with
   (5-ethynyl-1,10-phenanthroline)-bis(2,2-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) to
   afford the chromophore loaded polymers. The reactions were followed by
   using nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy, and the
   results suggest that the click reactions lead to nearly quantitative
   functionalization of the azidomethyl functional polymers. The
   photophysical and electrochemical properties of the Ru functional
   polymers were characterized in solution. Emission quantum yield and
   lifetime studies reveal that the metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited
   state is quenched in the polymers relative to a model Ru complex
   chromophore. This finding indicates that the thiol end-group on the
   polymers that arises from the thiocarbonylthio RAFT chain transfer agent
   is able to quench the MLCT state, presumably by a charge transfer
   mechanism. Stern-Volmer quenching studies show that the polymers are
   quenched with very high efficiency by negatively charged ions compared
   to model systems, revealing amplified quenching takes place.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel droplet-based tablet platform for temporal polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) in microliter droplets. The simple design of the
   device does not require extensive processing or external equipment,
   which allows for greater ease of use and integration as a point-of-care
   diagnostic. We demonstrate its functionality to perform both PCR and
   reverse-transcription PCR for lambda phage DNA and H3 influenza RNA with
   ramp rates and cycle times consistent with traditional PCR thermal
   cyclers. We additionally investigate the effect of performing PCR in
   small volumes on the reaction performance by specifically examining
   adsorption of reagents at the oil/water interface. We determined that
   adsorption of Taq polymerase at the biphasic interface reduces yield and
   impairs reaction performance at standard concentrations. Thus,
   microdroplet PCR reactions require additional polymerase to achieve
   sufficient amplification and we project for applications utilizing
   nanodroplets or picodroplets like digital applications, even greater
   concentrations of polymerase are required to achieve desired results.
   Following the adsorption investigation, we evaluated the sensitivity of
   lambda phage PCR on our platform to be less than 2.0 copies/mu L with an
   efficiency of 104.4\% and similar sensitivity for reverse-transcription
   PCR for influenza H3 RNA.}},

   bandstructure, we have shown that the (100)/< 100 > and (110)/< 110 >
   average conductivity effective mass values are similar. This is
   explained by the much heavier non-parabolic confinement mass for
   Delta(2) valley of (110) FinFETs, which leads to lower Delta(2) energy
   than Delta(4). Thus, for both (100) and (110), the majority of electrons
   occupy the Delta(2) valley with 0.19m(0) conductivity effective mass,
   resulting in comparable electron mobility. (C) 2012 American Institute

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{The main objectives of the present study are to obtain improved models
   of hydrodynamic forces and torque on a particle sitting on a bed and to
   use these models for the investigation of incipient motion and
   resuspension of particles. The improved models for force and torque are
   obtained from numerical simulations of a particle sitting on a bed with
   a turbulent flow of logarithmic mean velocity profile approaching the
   particle. Since the mean turbulent velocity profile can depart from the
   logarithmic profile in case of macroscale rough beds or flow down steep
   slopes, we have also considered forces and torque on a particle due to
   both linear and uniform mean flow profiles. The computed drag and lift
   coefficients and the predicted critical shear stress for incipient
   particle motion and resuspension are compared against available
   experimental results. The improved force and torque models are also used
   to evaluate the effect of turbulent velocity fluctuations on the
   critical shear stress for incipient motion and resuspension. The present
   results are of direct relevance to cases where the particle is mostly
   exposed to the ambient flow. In cases where the particle protrusion is
   small and is submerged mostly within a pocket of other particles, the
   above formulation can be used with a redefined area of exposure and flow
   velocity seen by the particle. However, the drag, lift, and torque
   coefficients and the resisting forces will be influenced by the partial
   exposure and the details of pocket geometry, which require further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Limitations of cylindrical carbon nanotubes based on the
   buckminsterfullerene structure as delivery vehicles for therapeutic
   agents include their chemical inertness, sharp edges and toxicological
   concerns. As an alternative, we have developed lignin-based nanotubes
   synthesized in a sacrificial template of commercially available alumina
   membranes. Lignin is a complex phenolic plant cell wall polymer that is
   generated as a waste product from paper mills and biorefineries that
   process lignocellulosic biomass into fuels and chemicals. We covalently
   linked isolated lignin to the inner walls of activated alumina membranes
   and then added layers of dehydrogenation polymer onto this base layer
   via a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction. By using phenolic monomers
   displaying different reactivities, we were able to change the thickness
   of the polymer layer deposited within the pores, resulting in the
   synthesis of nanotubes with a wall thickness of approximately 15 nm or
   nanowires with a nominal diameter of 200 nm. These novel nanotubes are
   flexible and can be bio-functionalized easily and specifically, as shown
   by in vitro assays with biotin and Concanavalin A. Together with their
   intrinsic optical properties, which can also be varied as a function of
   their chemical composition, these lignin-based nanotubes are expected to
   enable a variety of new applications including as delivery systems that
   can be easily localized and imaged after uptake by living cells.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The reduced performance of B4C armor plate for impact against tungsten
   carbide penetrators beyond a critical velocity has been attributed in
   the literature to localized amorphization. However, it is unclear if
   this reduction in strength is a consequence of high pressure or high
   velocity. Despite numerous fundamental studies of B4C under indentation
   and impact, the roles of strain rate and pressure on amorphization have
   not been fully established. Toward this end, rate dependent uniaxial
   compressive strength and rate dependent indentation hardness, along with
   Raman spectroscopy, have been employed to show that high strain rate
   deformation alone (without concurrent high pressure) cannot trigger
   localized amorphization in B4C. Based on our analysis, it is also
   suggested that rate dependent indentation hardness can be used to reveal
   if a given B4C ceramic exhibits amorphization under high pressure and
   high strain rate loading. It is argued that when amorphization does
   occur in B4C, its dynamic inelastic properties degrade more severely
   than its static properties. Finally, it is suggested that dynamic
   hardness, in conjunction with static hardness, can be used as a
   measurable mechanical property to reveal the incidence of amorphization
   in B4C without the need for postmortem TEM or Raman spectroscopy
   analyses. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Here we report the sensitive and reversible detection of vapors by using
   self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals. The condensation of various
   vapors in the interstitials of silica colloidal photonic crystals leads
   to red-shift and amplitude reduction of optical stop bands. A linear
   relationship between wavelength shift and vapor partial pressure has
   been observed for a variety of vapors including ethanol, water, and
   toluene. Importantly, the sensitivity of colloidal photonic
   crystal-based vapor detectors can be improved by nearly two orders of
   magnitude by using a new full-peak analysis technique that takes
   advantage of the manifest amplitude reduction of optical stop bands
   during vapor condensation. Optical simulation based on a scalar-wave
   approximation model shows that the predicted optical responses during
   vapor condensation in colloidal photonic crystals agree well with
   experimental results. The condensation of vapors between
   submicrometer-scale microspheres, a topic that has received little
   examination, has also been investigated by both experiments and
   theoretical calculations. Predictions based on a modified Kelvin

Abstract = {{Estimates of radiation absorbed dose to organs of the nuclear medicine
   patient are a requirement for administered activity optimization and for
   stochastic risk assessment. Pediatric patients, and in particular the
   newborn child, represent that portion of the patient population where
   such optimization studies are most crucial owing to the enhanced tissue
   radiosensitivities and longer life expectancies of this patient
   subpopulation. In cases where whole-body CT imaging is not available,
   phantom-based calculations of radionuclide S values-absorbed dose to a
   target tissue per nuclear transformation in a source tissue-are required
   for dose and risk evaluation. In this study, a comprehensive model of
   electron and photon dosimetry of the reference newborn child is
   presented based on a high-resolution hybrid-voxel phantom from the
   University of Florida (UF) patient model series. Values of photon
   specific absorbed fraction (SAF) were assembled for both the reference
   male and female newborn using the radiation transport code MCNPX v2.6.
   Values of electron SAF were assembled in a unique and time-efficient
   manner whereby the collisional and radiative components of organ
   dose-for both self-and cross-dose terms-were computed separately. Dose
   to the newborn skeletal tissues were assessed via fluence-to-dose
   response functions reported for the first time in this study. Values of
   photon and electron SAFs were used to assemble a complete set of S
   values for some 16 radionuclides commonly associated with molecular
   imaging of the newborn. These values were then compared to those
   available in the OLINDA/EXM software. S value ratios for organ self-dose
   ranged from 0.46 to 1.42, while similar ratios for organ cross-dose
   varied from a low of 0.04 to a high of 3.49. These large discrepancies
   are due in large part to the simplistic organ modeling in the stylized
   newborn model used in the OLINDA/EXM software. A comprehensive model of
   internal dosimetry is presented in this study for the newborn nuclear
   medicine patient based upon the UF hybrid computational phantom. Photon
   dose response functions, photon and electron SAFs, and tables of
   radionuclide S values for the newborn child-both male and female-are
   given in a series of four electronic annexes available at
   stacks.iop.org/pmb/57/1433/mmedia. These values can be applied to
   optimization studies of image quality and stochastic risk for this most
   vulnerable class of pediatric patients.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nHAP) have been widely used to remediate
   soil and wastewater contaminated with metals and radionuclides. However,
   our understanding of nHAP transport and fate is limited in natural
   environments that exhibit significant variability in solid and solution
   chemistry. The transport and retention kinetics of Alizarin red S
   (ARS)-labeled nHAP were investigated in water-saturated packed columns
   that encompassed a range of humic acid concentrations (HA, 0-10 mg L-1),
   fractional surface coverage of iron oxyhydroxide coatings on sand grains
   (lambda, 0-0.75), and pH (6.0-10.5). HA was found to have a marked
   effect on the electrokinetic properties of ARS-nHAP, and on the
   transport and retention of ARS-nHAP in granular media. The transport of
   ARS-nHAP was found to increase with increasing HA concentration because
   of enhanced colloidal stability and the reduced aggregate size. When HA
   = 10 mg L-1, greater ARS-nHAP attachment occurred with increasing 16
   lambda A because of increased electrostatic attraction between
   negatively charged nanoparticles and positively charged iron
   oxyhydroxides, although alkaline conditions (pH 8.0 and 10.5) reversed
   the surface charge of the iron oxyhydroxides and therefore decreased
   deposition. The retention profiles of ARS-nHAP exhibited a
   hyperexponential shape for all test conditions, suggesting some
   unfavorable attachment conditions. Retarded breakthrough curves occurred
   in sands with iron oxyhydroxide coatings because of time-dependent
   occupation of favorable deposition sites. Consideration of the above
   effects is necessary to improve remediation efficiency of nHAP for
   metals and actinides in soils and subsurface environments.}},

Abstract = {{The practical application of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells requires
   high throughput printing techniques in order to attain cells with an
   area large enough to provide useful amounts of power. However, in the
   laboratory screening of new materials for OPVs, spin-coating is used
   almost exclusively as a thin-film deposition technique due its
   convenience. We report on the significant differences between the
   spin-coating of laboratory solar cells and slot-die coating of a
   blue-green colored, low bandgap polymer (PGREEN). This is one of the
   first demonstrations of slot-die-coated polymer solar cells OPVs not
   utilizing poly(3-hexylthiophene):(6,6)-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl
   ester (PCBM) blends as a light absorbing layer. Through synthetic
   optimization, we show that strict protocols are necessary to yield
   polymers which achieve consistent photovoltaic behavior. We fabricated
   spin-coated laboratory scale OPV devices with PGREEN: PCBM blends as
   active light absorbing layers, and compare performance to slot
   die-coated individual solar cells, and slot-die-coated solar modules
   consisting of many cells connected in series. We find that the optimum
   ratio of polymer to PCBM varies significantly when changing from
   spin-coating of thinner active layer films to slot-die coating, which
   requires somewhat thicker films. We also demonstrate the detrimental
   impacts on power conversion efficiency of high series resistance
   imparted by large electrodes, illustrating the need for higher
   conductivity contacts, transparent electrodes, and high mobility active
   layer materials for large-area solar cell modules.}},

Abstract = {{Near-ground aerosol fogs were applied in the Chihuahua Desert of New
   Mexico, which has widely spaced, low shrub vegetation. Near-ground fog
   dispersion was measured remotely with a light detection and ranging
   (lidar) system. Local atmospheric turbulence and stability were
   continuously measured with 3-axis sonic anemometers during aerosol
   treatments. Lidar-measured plume area coverage and spread were related
   to the simultaneous local-scale weather, including both convective
   boundary layers (CBL) and stable boundary layers (SBL). A modified bulk
   stability ratio (SRm) was used to characterize the stability conditions
   near the ground. Time averages appropriate to the SBL were determined
   using the multidimensional decomposition technique and matched to the
   short spray time periods in the CBL. The widest, most effective,
   near-ground coverage was obtained from insect fogger applications
   conducted during relatively high wind speeds: U > 1 m s(-1) stable
   conditions, and U > 3 m s(-1) in unstable conditions. In general,
   spraying during SBLs was more efficient than during CBLs, with less
   material wasted and better consistency of coverage in the target zone
   nearest the ground. There was no significant difference in spray
   coverage or plume dispersion between the handheld thermal fogger and the
   ultra-low volume (cold fogger) applicator used.}},

Abstract = {{This article is an introduction to the ``Advances in Irrigation{''}
   Special Collection in this issue of Transactions ASABE and the next
   issue of Applied Engineering in Agriculture, consisting of 14 articles
   selected from 88 papers and presentations at the ASABE 5th Decennial
   National Irrigation Symposium, which was held in December 2010 in
   Phoenix, Arizona. This symposium followed the objectives of the previous
   four decennial events to provide a forum to assess the progress of
   research endeavors to advance the effectiveness of irrigation practices
   during the past ten years, leading to further research priorities in
   light of future challenges. The articles in this Special Collection
   address a wide range of topics grouped into broad categories: micro
   irrigation, center-pivot irrigation, crop water use for improved
   irrigation management, and smart irrigation controllers for landscape
   irrigation. While these articles are not inclusive of all irrigation
   work since the last decennial symposium, they provide an example of work
   considered important by researchers, funding agencies, and other
   stakeholders. Many aspects of irrigation have changed since the first
   symposium in 1970. Although microirrigation is a small proportion of
   irrigated acreage, it will continue to increase in highly technical
   commercial food and fiber production as well as in subsistence farming.
   Center-pivot irrigation systems have been an important tool to deliver
   water more efficiently in diverse settings. Advanced telemetry and
   control systems, developed during the past ten years, are now common
   options for center pivots, but challenges remain in integrating these
   hardware developments into crop management practices. Possibilities are
   emerging for adding monitoring devices to center pivots to match crop
   water needs with water delivery. Energy balance models continue to be
   refined as tools to estimate crop water use from both ground-based and
   satellite-based data. Evapotranspiration estimates are evolving from
   single-location weather stations to whole-field or regional scopes.
   Finally, smart irrigation controllers have coupled evapotranspiration
   estimation or soil water sensing with automated irrigation system water
   delivery. These controllers can increase the precision of irrigation to
   match crop or landscape water needs. Irrigation will continue to be an
   important practice for producing the world's food. The irrigation
   research and education professions will need to respond to food
   production challenges with even more refined irrigation systems and
   water management in the next ten years. However, research investment in
   irrigation continues to decline while important issues exist, such as
   maintaining agricultural profitability with declining water supplies,
   integrating sensor-based information for real-time autonomous or
   semi-autonomous management, competition for limited water supplies
   between agriculture and other sectors, increasing energy cost,
   environmental impacts of irrigation, and use of alternative (i.e., lower
   quality) water sources for irrigation.}},

Abstract = {{In the past ten years, smart irrigation controllers have been developed
   by a number of manufacturers and have been promoted by water purveyors
   in an attempt to reduce excessive irrigation. Legislation has been
   introduced in California and Texas and passed in Florida mandating or
   incentivizing the use of these controllers. As a result of the interest
   in smart controllers, their use is increasing in new installations and
   retrofits of residential and light commercial irrigation systems. A
   number of controlled research studies using formal experimental design
   and statistical analyses indicate substantial water savings of anywhere
   from 40\% to more than 70\% when using these devices; however,
   real-world savings in larger pilot-scale projects indicate savings of
   typically less than 10\%. Reasons for the divergence between the
   apparent potential savings and the realized savings in pilot projects
   are related to the lack of targeting of high irrigation users (on either
   a relative or absolute scale), education for contractors and end users,
   and timely follow-up to assess water savings. In addition, much of the
   scientific research on smart controllers has been conducted in humid
   regions where higher potential savings are likely due to irrigation
   needed only to supplement rainfall. Future pilot projects should include
   comprehensive educational components aimed at irrigation sites with
   potential irrigation savings based on estimated landscape irrigation
   demand from climatic variables (i.e., high irrigation users).}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this article is to present summary findings of multiple
   research studies concerning evapotranspiration (ET) controllers. Each
   study provided unique information concerning the performance and
   implementation techniques necessary to ensure successful integration
   with irrigation systems to optimize scheduling for water conservation.
   Based on these studies, ET controllers have the potential for irrigation
   savings of as much as 63\%, without sacrificing landscape quality, when
   implemented in moderate to high water use scenarios and programmed
   correctly Only homes that irrigated more than 450 mm per year had
   irrigation savings with an ET controller in southwest Florida. The ET
   controllers that underwent Irrigation Association Smart Water
   Application Technologies (SWAT) testing experienced oscillations in
   irrigation adequacy and scheduling efficiency dependent on rainfall.
   Assuming acceptable levels for irrigation adequacy and scheduling
   efficiency of 80\% and 95\%, respectively, there were only a few periods
   during the Florida SWAT test when both scores were above these
   thresholds. A maximum of 10\% of scores were passing in any of the three
   evaluation periods with frequent rainfall, indicating that properly
   accounting for rainfall is a challenge for many of these controllers.
   The SWAT scores are indicators of water savings only if there is a
   potential for savings due to excess irrigation prior to implementation
   of the ET controller.}},

Abstract = {{This is a review article with the objective of summarizing and relating
   the main findings of different research projects carried out in Florida
   that evaluated commercially available soil moisture sensor systems
   (SMSs) for residential irrigation control. The initial goal of the
   experiments cited was to find out if SMSs could reduce irrigation water
   application as compared to typical residential irrigation systems
   without sensor feedback. The effect of different threshold settings and
   irrigation frequencies on water application and turf quality was also
   evaluated Other research goals included evaluating the consistency of
   different SMS units and their precision in measuring soil water content
   (theta). Results on turfgrass plots showed that a 7 days per week (d
   week(-1)) irrigation frequency significantly reduced the water applied
   compared to 1 and 2 d week(-1) scheduled frequencies. During rainy
   periods, the SMSs tested reduced irrigation by 42\% to 72\% on average,
   depending on specific testing conditions, while maintaining good turf
   quality. During dry periods, the average savings decreased to -1\% to
   64\%, and the resultant turf quality was sometimes below the minimum
   acceptable level. Therefore, under sustained thy weather conditions or
   in dry climates, the run times, irrigation frequency, and/or low
   threshold settings should be carefully considered. Results showed that
   SMSs from Acclima and Rain Bird were more consistent and precise in
   measuring soil water content and saved more water than Water Watcher and
   Irrometer units. Under residential conditions, SMSs decreased the water
   application by 65\% compared to homes with automated irrigation systems
   without sensor feedback. Overall research results clearly demonstrate
   that the use of SMSs in Florida, when properly installed, set, and
   maintained, could lead to significant irrigation water savings while
   maintaining turf quality at or above the minimum acceptable rating.}},

Abstract = {{Citrus greening, also known as Huanglongbing or HLB, is a major threat
   to the U.S. citrus industry. Currently, scouting and visual inspection
   are used for screening infected trees. However, this is a time-consuming
   and expensive method for HLB disease detection. Moreover, as it is
   subjective, the current method exhibits high detection error rates. The
   objective of this study was to investigate the potential of visible and
   near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy for identifying HLB-infected citrus
   trees. The spectral data from infected and healthy orange trees of the
   Valencia variety were collected from four different orchards in Florida.
   Two different spectroradiometers with a spectral range of 350 to 2500 nm
   were used to collect the canopy reflectance spectral data. Three
   classification techniques were used to classify the data: k-nearest
   neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines
   (SVM). Analysis showed that using only one canopy reflectance
   observation per tree was inadequate. None of the classification methods
   was successful in discriminating healthy trees from HLB-infected trees
   because of the large variability in the canopy reflectance spectral
   data. When five spectra from the same tree were used for classification,
   the SVM and weighted KNN methods classified spectra with 3.0\% and 6.5\%
   error rates, respectively The results from this study indicate that
   canopy VIS-NIR spectral reflectance data can be used to detect
   HLB-infected citrus trees; however, high classification accuracy (>90\%)
   requires multiple measurements from a single tree.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of operating municipal solid waste landfills as bioreactor
   landfills has become more common over the past decade. Because
   simulating moisture balance and flow is more critical in such landfills
   than in dry landfills, researchers have developed methods to address
   this problem using the hydrologic evaluation of landfill performance
   (HELP) model. This paper discusses three methods of applying the HELP
   model to simulate the percolation of liquids added to landfill waste:
   the leachate recirculation feature (LRF), the subsurface inflow (SSI)
   feature, and additional rainfall to mimic liquids addition. The LRF is
   simple to use but may not be able to bring the landfill to bioreactor
   conditions. The SSI feature provides a convenient user interface for
   modeling liquids addition to each layer. The additional rainfall feature
   provides flexibility to the model, allowing users to estimate the
   leachate generation rate and the leachate head on bottom liner
   associated with daily variation in the liquids addition rate.
   Additionally, this paper discusses several issues that may affect the
   HELP model, such as the time of model simulation, layers of liquids
   addition, and the limitations of the HELP model itself. Based on the
   simulation results, it is suggested that the HELP model should be run
   over an extended period of time after the cessation of liquids addition
   in order to capture the peak leachate generation rate and the head on
   the liner (HOL). From the perspectives of leachate generation and the
   HOL, there are few differences between single-layer injection and
   multiple-layer injection. This paper also discusses the limitations of
   using the HELP model for designing and permitting bioreactor landfills.}},

Abstract = {{Site characterization for the design of geotechnical structures such as
   deep foundations is crucial, as unanticipated site conditions still
   represent the most common and most significant cause of problems and
   disputes that occur during construction. Surface-based refraction
   methods have been widely used recently to assess spatial variation, but
   one of the biggest limitations of these methods is that they cannot well
   characterize reverse profiles (decreasing in velocity with depth),
   buried low-velocity zones, or deep bedrock. An addition of borehole data
   to surface data is expected to improve inversion results. In this study,
   the coupling of so-called downhole and refraction tomography techniques
   using only one borehole is presented. To both qualitatively and
   quantitatively appraise the capability of the data, a global inversion
   scheme based on simulated annealing was investigated. Many synthetic and
   real test data sets with or without boreholes were inverted using the
   developed technique to obtain both inverted profiles and associated
   quantitative uncertainties. A comparison of tomograms utilizing the
   combined borehole and surface data against tomograms developed using
   just the surface data suggests that significant additional resolution of
   inverted profiles at depth are obtained with the addition of a borehole.
   The uncertainty estimates provide a quantitative assessment of the
   reliability of the interpreted profiles. It is also found that the
   quantitative uncertainties associated with the inverted profiles are
   significantly reduced when adding a borehole. In addition, the inversion
   results of the combined data provide credible information for the design
   of deep foundations, particularly useful in implementing the new load
   and resistance factor design methodology that can explicitly account for
   spatial variability in design parameters. DOI:

Abstract = {{Coupling between initial and damage-induced anisotropies in 3D elastic
   damaged materials has been so far addressed by homogenization techniques
   only for particular microcracks configurations. The main difficulty in
   developing a general 3D micromechanical model lies in the lack of
   closed-form solutions of the Eshelby tensor corresponding to cracks
   arbitrarily oriented in an elastic anisotropic medium. In this study, we
   begin to present analytical expressions of the Eshelby tensor S
   (equivalently the Hill tensor P) that we derived for a cylindrical crack
   embedded in an orthotropic material. The obtained expressions reduce to
   existing results in the 2D case or in particular 3D cracks
   configurations. The effective compliance of the orthotropic medium
   containing arbitrarily oriented cracks is then derived by using the
   newly derived expressions of the Eshelby tensor. Finally, a damage model
   is formulated by combining the above results with classical
   thermodynamics approach. The ability of the model to capture coupling
   between initial orthotropy and damage induced anisotropy is demonstrated
   through a comparison with experimental data available for a ceramic
   matrix composite (unidirectional SiC-SiC). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes the experimental estimation of the rotary-damping
   coefficients of micro air vehicle (MAV) wings using a novel system for
   dynamic wind-tunnel testing. Two geometrically identical Zimmerman wings
   are used, one rigid and one flexible. The flexible wing consists of a
   perimeter-reinforced latex membrane with three levels of prestrain. A
   two-degrees-of-freedom motion rig permits the control of the two
   individual components of the rotary-damping moment. A modern design of
   experiments methodology was used to elucidate the correlation between
   the wings' elastic membrane prestrain state and the aerodynamic
   characteristics. For the flexible wing, elastic deformations are
   measured using visual image correlation and evaluated using a
   dimensionless parameter. The resulting aerodynamic model compares well
   with static reference data. The presence of dynamic changes in the angle
   of attack or pitch angle has a significant effect on the response of the
   rigid and flexible MA V wings, particularly on the pitching moment
   coefficient. At the current levels of the dimensionless membrane wing
   elastic prestrain, the pretension strain did not exhibit any correlation
   with the rotary-damping moment coefficients, whereas the pretension
   strain level does appear as a factor in the rotary-damping drag

   placed inside the vacuum chamber for modal characterization using a
   scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The experimental modal analysis
   is conducted by imposing a structural excitation to the ring for
   investigating the membrane vibration characteristics at both atmospheric
   and reduced pressures in a vacuum chamber. FE models are developed for
   the natural frequencies of the membrane at different uniform and
   non-uniform pre-tension levels with the effect of the added mass of air.
   The Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic material model is selected for the
   membrane. The natural frequencies of the membrane computed by
   experimental and FE models are correlated well, although discrepancy is
   expected among experimental and FE results within reasonable limits due
   to the variation of the thickness of the membrane. The natural
   frequencies increase with the mode and pre-tension level of the membrane
   but decrease due to an increase in ambient pressure. The damping ratios
   have very minimal effect on the frequencies due to low values but help
   to reduce the amplitude of vibration. Natural frequencies of the
   membrane do not change with the uniform and non-uniform nature of the
   pre-tension, although they increase with the pre-tension level. It is
   also found that the effect of added mass on the natural frequencies
   increases with an increase of the size of the membrane specimen. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{In a direct collocation pseudospectral method, a continuous-time optimal
   control problem is transcribed to a finite-dimensional nonlinear
   programming problem. Solving this nonlinear programming problem as
   efficiently as possible requires that sparsity at both the first- and
   second-derivative levels be exploited. In this paper, a computationally
   efficient method is developed for computing the first and second
   derivatives of the nonlinear programming problem functions arising from
   a pseudospectral discretization of a continuous-time optimal control
   problem. Specifically, in this paper, expressions are derived for the
   objective function gradient, constraint Jacobian, and Lagrangian Hessian
   arising from the previously developed Radau pseudospectral method. It is
   shown that the computation of these derivative functions can be reduced
   to computing the first and second derivatives of the functions in the
   continuous-time optimal control problem. As a result, the method derived
   in this paper reduces significantly the amount of computation required
   to obtain the first and second derivatives required by a nonlinear
   programming problem solver. The approach derived in this paper is
   demonstrated on an example where it is found that significant
   computational benefits are obtained when compared against direct
   differentiation of the nonlinear programming problem functions. The
   approach developed in this paper improves the computational efficiency
   of solving nonlinear programming problems arising from pseudospectral
   discretizations of continuous-time optimal control problems.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed ultraviolet light (PUV), a novel technology most commonly used
   for microbial inactivation, has recently been employed to effectively
   mitigate food allergens in peanuts, soybean, shrimp, and almond.
   Putative mechanisms for the efficacy of PUV in reducing allergen
   reactivity include photothermal, photochemical, and photophysical
   effects. To date, there are no published data highlighting the effects
   of in vitro simulated gastric and intestinal digestion on the stability
   of PUV reduced allergen reactivity of food. In this study, PUV-treated
   shrimp extracts were subjected to simulated gastric fluid containing
   pepsin and simulated intestinal fluid containing trypsin and
   chymotrypsin, and then tested for changes in allergen potency. SDS-PAGE
   showed no major band deviation between undigested and digested
   PUV-treated shrimp extracts. IgE binding to tropomyosin remained
   markedly decreased as seen in Western blot analysis. Total shrimp
   allergen reactivity remained unchanged following in vitro peptic
   digestion and was markedly reduced following in vitro intestinal
   digestion as illustrated in indirect ELISA. The PUV reduced shrimp
   allergens remained at a low level under the in vitro simulated digestive
   conditions. The results inferred that PUV could be a potential method to
   create less allergenic shrimp products that would remain at a low
   allergen level under human gastric and intestinal digestive conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A target detection algorithm is developed based on a supervised learning
   technique that maximises the margin between two classes, that is, the
   target class and the non-target class. Specifically, the proposed target
   detection algorithm consists of (i) image differencing, (ii)
   maximum-margin classifier, and (iii) diversity combining. The image
   differencing is to enhance and highlight the targets so that the targets
   are more distinguishable from the background. The maximum-margin
   classifier is based on a recently developed feature weighting technique
   called Iterative RELIEF; the objective of the maximum-margin classifier
   is to achieve robustness against uncertainties and clutter. The
   diversity combining utilises multiple images to further improve the
   performance of detection, and hence it is a type of multi-pass change
   detection. The authors evaluate the performance of the proposed
   detection algorithm, using the CARABAS-II synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   image data and the experimental results demonstrate superior performance
   of the proposed algorithm, compared to the benchmark algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A CFD study on the effect of spanwise width on a rectangular jet with

Abstract = {{Gravity currents from instantaneous sources down a slope were modeled
   with classic thermal theory, which has formed the basis for many
   subsequent studies. Considering entrainment of ambient fluid and
   conservation of total buoyancy, thermal theory predicted the height,
   length, and velocity of the gravity current head. In this study, the
   problem with direct numerical simulations was re-investigated, and the
   results compared with thermal theory. The predictions based on thermal
   theory are shown to be appropriate only for the acceleration phase, not
   for the entire gravity current motion. In particular, for the current
   head forms on a 10 slope produced from an instantaneous buoyancy source,
   the contained buoyancy in the head is approximately 58\% of the total
   buoyancy at most and is not conserved during the motion as assumed in
   thermal theory. In the deceleration phase, the height and aspect ratio
   of the head and the buoyancy contained within it may all decrease with
   downslope distance. Thermal theory relies on the increase in the mass of
   the current head through entrainment as the major mechanism for
   deceleration and, therefore, tends to underpredict the front velocity in
   the deceleration phase. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000500. (C)

Abstract = {{Uniform matrix deposition on tissue samples for matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization (MALDI) is key for reproducible analyte ion
   signals. Current methods often result in nonhomogenous matrix
   deposition, and take time and effort to produce acceptable ion signals.
   Here we describe a fully-automated method for matrix deposition using an
   enclosed spray chamber and spray nozzle for matrix solution delivery. A
   commercial air-atomizing spray nozzle was modified and combined with
   solenoid controlled valves and a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to
   control and deliver the matrix solution. A spray chamber was employed to
   contain the nozzle, sample, and atomized matrix solution stream, and to
   prevent any interference from outside conditions as well as allow
   complete control of the sample environment. A gravity cup was filled
   with MALDI matrix solutions, including DHB in chloroform/methanol (50:
   50) at concentrations up to 60 mg/mL. Various samples (including rat
   brain tissue sections) were prepared using two deposition methods (spray
   chamber, inkjet). A linear ion trap equipped with an
   intermediate-pressure MALDI source was used for analyses. Optical
   microscopic examination showed a uniform coating of matrix crystals
   across the sample. Overall, the mass spectral images gathered from
   tissues coated using the spray chamber system were of better quality and
   more reproducible than from tissue specimens prepared by the inkjet
   deposition method.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium (Mg) has garnered significant interest for its potential use
   as a biodegradable implant material. Of specific interest in this study
   is the effect of zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr) additions on both the
   mechanical and degradation behaviors in Mg due to their established
   beneficial effect on strength and microstructural grain refinement while
   being biocompatible. Three binary Mg-x wt\% Sr (x = 0.5. 1.0. 1.5)
   alloys and three ternary Mg-x wt\%Zo-0.5wt\% Sr (x = 2.0. 4.0. 6.0) were
   studied to evaluate their mechanical and degradation behavior.
   Mechanical testing was performed at room temperature on solution-treated
   and peak aged alloys using microhardness and tensile tests. Degradation
   was studied using immersion tests in Hanks' solution. Results indicate a
   decrease in grain size and an increase in strength with increasing Sr
   and Zn content. When considering degradation behavior Mg-0.5wt\%Sr
   demonstrated the lowest degradation rate among binary alloys. At
   constant Sr content at 0.5wt\%, the addition of Zn increased the
   corrosion rate, with the highest rate for the Mg-6.0wt\%Zn-0.Swt\%Sr.
   The alloys which best optimized both mechanical and degradation
   behaviors were Mg-2.0wt\%Zn-0.5wt\%Sr and Mg-4.0wt\%Zn-0.5wt\%Sr.
   Finally, microstructure and property relationships were evaluated and
   discussed in reference to each alloy's potential use as a biodegradable
   implant material. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The authors fabricate vertical geometry single-walled carbon nanotube
   (CNT) film/p-type silicon Schottky barrier photodetectors, where the CNT
   film acts as the transparent metal and silicon as the active
   semiconductor. The authors experimentally characterize the
   current-voltage, spectral responsivity, and noise properties of these
   devices under reverse bias. The authors find that the CNT film-Si
   Schottky barrier photodetectors exhibit a large photocurrent-to-dark
   current ratio with responsivity as high as 0.10 A/W due to the high
   transmittance of the CNT film. The measured current noise spectral
   density shows a 1/f limited behavior and scales as the square of the
   reverse bias current. The noise equivalent power of the devices is found
   to be 1.4 x 10(-10) W. A comparison between CNT film devices and devices
   based on conventional metal electrodes is also carried out. These
   results provide important insights into the properties and performance
   of CNT film-Si Schottky barrier photodetectors. (C) 2012 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{Electrical properties and deep electron and hole trap spectra were
   measured for undoped n-GaN cut from a thick boule grown by hydride vapor
   phase epitaxy (HVPE). The material is characterized by a very low
   concentration of residual donors (10(13)-10(14) cm(-3)) in the first 30
   mu m near the growth surface. The bulk electrical properties were
   similar to those of standard high quality undoped bulk HVPE n-GaN, with
   a net donor concentration of similar to 10(16) cm(-3) and mobility
   similar to 1000 cm(2)/V s. The strong decrease of electron concentration
   in the surface region of the high resistivity GaN was caused by the
   compensation of shallow residual donors by a high density (similar to 6
   x 10(15) cm(-3)) of hole traps with activation energy of 0.2 eV,
   confined to the compensated region. In addition, other hole traps H5
   with activation energy 1.2 eV and concentration 5 x 10(15) cm(-3) were
   present. These latter traps had similar concentrations in both the high
   resistivity and standard conducting HVPE GaN. Radiation detectors
   prepared on the high resistivity material showed charge collection
   efficiency (CCE) close to 100\% for spectrometry of alpha-particles with
   energy up to 5.1 MeV. The CCE dependence on voltage indicated a strong
   trapping of holes in the active region of detectors by the H5 hole
   traps. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{Grain boundaries (GBs) are ubiquitous in polycrystalline graphene
   materials obtained by various growth methods. It has been shown
   previously that considerable electrical transport gap can be opened by
   grain boundaries. On the other hand, polycrystalline graphene with GBs
   is an atomically thin membrane that can sustain extraordinary amount of
   strain. Here, by using atomistic quantum transport numerical
   simulations, we examine modulation of electrical transport properties of
   graphene GBs. The results indicate the modulation of transport gap and
   electrical conductance strongly depends on the topological structure of
   the GB. The transport gap of certain GBs can be significantly widened by
   strain, which is useful for improving the on off ratio in potential
   transistor applications and for applications as monolayer strain
   sensors.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{253-262}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Array processing algorithms are used in many applications for source
   localization and signal waveform estimation. When the number of
   snapshots is small and/or the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, it
   becomes a challenge to discriminate closely-spaced sources. In this
   paper, two new array processing algorithms exploiting sparsity are
   proposed to overcome this problem. The first proposed method combines a
   well-known sparsity preserving algorithm, namely the least absolute
   shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), with the Bayesian information
   criterion (BIC) to eliminate user parameters. The second proposed
   algorithm extends the sphere decoding algorithm, which is widely used in
   communication applications for the recovery of signals belonging to a
   finite integer dictionary, to promote the sparsity of the solution. The
   proposed algorithms are compared with several existing sparse signal
   estimation techniques. Simulations involving uncorrelated and coherent
   sources demonstrate that the proposed algorithms, especially the
   algorithm based on sphere decoding, show better performance than the
   existing methods. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are shown to be more
   practical than the existing methods due to the easiness in selecting
   their user parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microstimulation (MiSt) is used experimentally and clinically to
   activate localized populations of neural elements. However, it is
   difficult to predict-and subsequently control-neural responses to
   simultaneous current injection through multiple electrodes in an array.
   This is due to the unknown locations of neuronal elements in the
   extracellular medium that are excited by the superposition of multiple
   parallel current sources. We, therefore, propose a model that maps the
   computed electric field in the 3-D space surrounding the stimulating
   electrodes in one brain region to the local field potential (LFP)
   fluctuations evoked in a downstream region. Our model is trained with
   the recorded LFP waveforms in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1)
   resulting from MiSt applied in multiple electrode configurations in the
   ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the quiet awake rat. We then
   predict the cortical responses to MiSt in ``novel{''} electrode
   configurations, a result that suggests that this technique could aid in
   the design of spatially optimized MiSt patterns through a multielectrode
   array.}},

Abstract = {{A 95?mm x 40?mm x 15?mm compact reactor for hydrogen production from
   methanol-steam reforming (MSR) is constructed by integrating a
   vaporizer, reformer, and combustor into a single unit. CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 is
   used as the catalyst for the MSR while the required heat is provided
   using Platinum (Pt) -catalytic methanol combustion. The reactor
   performance is measured using three reformer designs: patterned
   micro-channel; inserted catalyst layer placed in a single plain channel;
   and catalyst coated directly on the bottom wall of single plain channel.
   Because of longer reactant residence time and more effective heat
   transfer, slightly higher methanol conversion can be obtained from the
   reformer with patterned microchannels. The experimental results show
   that there is no significant reactor performance difference in methanol
   conversion, hydrogen (H2) production rate, and carbon monoxide (CO)
   composition among these three reformer designs. These results indicated
   that the flow and heat transfer may not play important roles in compact
   size reactors. The reformer design with inserted catalyst layer provides
   convenience in replacing the aged catalyst, which may be attractive in
   practical applications compared with the conventional packed bed and
   wall-coated reformers. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A method employing photochemical hole burning, previously developed to
   measure the distribution of Raman enhancement factors on a
   nanostructured substrate for surface-enhanced Raman scattering, is used
   to compare the enhancement distributions of benzenethiol adsorbed on
   substrates optimized for 532?nm laser excitation consisting of
   close-packed (CP) or nonclose-packed (NCP) nanospheres. The
   ensemble-averaged Raman enhancement factor was 2.8 times smaller for the
   NCP substrate. The measured distributions revealed additional
   information. For instance, 92\% of the molecules on the CP substrate and
   93.6\% of the molecules on the NCP substrate had Raman enhancements
   below average. The minimum enhancements on both substrates were similar
   to 10(4), but on the NCP substrate the maximum enhancement was 1.2 x
   10(8), whereas on the CP substrate the maximum was 2 x 10(10). The
   Ag-coated nanospheres form hemisphere-on-cylinder mushroom-like
   structures on both lattices, but on the NCP lattice, one third of the
   molecules are on the flat regions between the mushrooms. The flats on
   the NCP lattice have enhancements of similar to 104, showing they are
   part of a resonant plasmonic structure. The highest NCP enhancements of
   similar to 108 are tentatively associated with regions at the bases of
   the mushrooms, whereas the highest CP enhancements of 2 x 10(10) are
   tentatively associated with gaps between nanospheres where 0.0025\% of
   the molecules reside. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Compressible inviscid instability of rapidly expanding spherical
   material interfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme is employed to
   investigate the stability of a rapidly expanding material interface
   produced by a spherical shock tube. The flow structure is characterized
   by a forward moving primary shock, a backward moving secondary shock,
   and a spherical contact interface in-between. We consider herein the
   linear inviscid regime and focus on the development of the
   three-dimensional perturbations around the contact interface by solving
   a one-dimensional system of partial differential equations. Numerical
   simulations are performed to illustrate the effects of the contact
   interface's density discontinuity on the growth of the disturbances for
   various spherical wave numbers. In a spherical shock tube the
   instability is influenced by various mechanisms which include classical
   Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) effects, Bell-Plesset or geometry/curvature
   effects, the effects of impulsively accelerating the interface, and
   compressibility effects. Henceforth, the present instability will be
   referred to as non-classical RT instability to distinguish it from
   classical RT instability. For an extended intermediate time period, it
   can be shown that the small disturbances grow exponentially as in the
   classical RT instability. During this stage, the exponential growth rate
   increases with the spherical wave number, until it saturates for very
   large wave numbers due to the finite thickness limitation of the
   numerical representation of the contact interface. The results compare
   favorably with previous theoretical models; but indicate that in
   addition to compressibility, the space-time evolution of the contact
   interface's thickness plays a significant role. A parametric study is
   performed that varies the pressure and density ratios of the initial
   spherical container. The characteristics of the contact interface and
   the applicability of various instability theories is investigated for
   these regimes. Furthermore, varying the pressure and density ratios aids
   in understanding significance of compressibility effects on the
   instability at different operating conditions. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Several drought indices are available to compute the degree of drought
   to which crops are exposed. They vary in complexity, generality, and the
   adequacy with which they represent processes in the soil, plant, and
   atmosphere. Agricultural Reference Index for Drought (ARID) was
   developed as a reference index to approximate the water stress factor
   that is used to affect growth and other physiological processes in crop
   simulation models. Using RMSE, Willmott d index, and modeling efficiency
   (ME) as performance measures, ARID was evaluated using soil water
   contents in the root zone measured daily in two grass fields in Florida.
   The ability of ARID was assessed through comparison with the water
   deficit index (WSPD) of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology
   Transfer (DSSAT) CERES-Maize model. Seven other drought indices were
   compared with WSPD to identify the most appropriate agricultural drought
   index. Values of each index were computed for full canopy cover periods
   of maize (Zea mays L.) crops for 16 locations in the U.S. Southeast.
   Using periodic values, the performance of each index was assessed in
   terms of its correlation (r) with and departure from WSPD. The ARID
   reasonably predicted soil water contents (RMSE = 0.01-0.019, d index =
   0.92-0.94, ME = 0.66-0.73) and adequately approximated WSPD (r = 0.90,
   RMSE = 0.15). Among the indices compared, ARID mimicked WSPD the most
   closely (RMSE smaller by 1-83\%, r larger by 1-630\%) and captured
   weather fluctuation effects the most accurately. Results indicated that
   ARID may be used as a simple index for quantifying drought and its
   effects on crop yields.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the performance limits of field-effect transistors (FETs)
   with chemically modified graphene as the channel materials. Graphene
   nanoroad (XNR) and graphene nanomesh (XNM) can be created through
   selective chemical modification by an X adsorbate (either H or F) on
   graphene, which generates a bandgap while conserving the continuous
   two-dimensional (2D) atomistic layer. We adopt a ballistic transistor
   model, where the band structures were calculated using ab initio
   simulations to assess the performance of graphene nanoroad and nanomesh
   transistors. It is shown that arrays of graphene nanoroads, defined by
   hydrogenation or fluorination of atomically narrow dimer lines in a 2D
   graphene, are most ideal for transistor channel materials in terms of
   delivering a large ON-current, and significantly outperform Si
   metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs).
   Alternatively, comparable performance to silicon can be achieved by
   careful design of a graphene nanomesh through patterned hydrogenation or
   fluorination. Both hydrogenation and fluorination lead to similar
   transistor performance, with fluorination more preferred in terms of
   chemical energetics.}},

Abstract = {{Miscible displacement in a bounded fluid layer introduces instabilities

   The viscosity difference across the surface modifies the dip, slightly
   at large surface tensions, completely at low surface tensions. The
   effect of the surface deflection is present whether or not the surface
   is stable and can be omitted only if the viscosity of the driving fluid
   is very high or the surface tension is very low.

Abstract = {{Grain boundaries (GBs) can act as either sinks or sources of the point
   defects that are produced in large numbers under irradiation damage. In
   polycrystalline materials, as the grain size decreases, more of the
   point defects resulting from irradiation damage annihilate at GBs. It is
   unknown, however, whether the GB sink efficiency will saturate after
   prolonged defect annihilation, particularly when the grain Size is of
   nanoscale dimensions. Using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulation and rate theory, the authors show that high-energy GBs in
   body-centered-cubic (BCC) Mo do not saturate as sinks of point defects.

Abstract = {{As human beings pursue the deeper space exploration, advanced propulsion
   systems that deliver super performance and possess increased durability
   for the next generation spacecraft will be needed, despite current
   limitations on materials. A promising technology is to fill the current
   open cooling channels with open-cell metal foams to drastically enhance
   the cooling of the thrust chamber. After applying the methods developed
   for the feasibility evaluation, it is found that under equal pressure
   drop and coolant mass flow rate, the actual amount of increase in the
   heat transfer coefficient for the foamed channel over the open channel
   is approximately the same for any given pressure drop, while the percent
   heat transfer coefficient increase actually decreases with increasing
   pressure drop from 99\% at 841 kPa/m to 48\% at 3090 kPa/m. It is also
   shown that under equal pressure drop and coolant mass flow rate in an
   actual rocket condition, the heat transfer coefficient of the foamed
   channel is 49581 W/m(2) K, which is more than 110\% enhancement,
   compared with 23464 W/m(2) K for the open channel. That means that,
   under the same pressure drop and mass flow rate, the foamed channel has
   the capability to significantly enhance the cooling for the rocket
   engine thrust chamber.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral recovery in animal models of human CNS syndromes suggests
   that transplanted stem cell derivatives can augment damaged neural
   networks but the mechanisms behind potentiated recovery remain elusive.
   Here we use microelectrode array (MEA) technology to document neural
   activity and network integration as rat primary neurons and rat
   hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiate and mature. The
   natural transition from neuroblast to functional excitatory neuron
   consists of intermediate phases of differentiation characterized by
   coupled activity. High-frequency network-wide bursting or
   ``superbursting{''} is a hallmark of early plasticity that is ultimately
   refined into mature stable neural network activity. Microelectrode array
   (MEA)-plated neurons transition through this stage of coupled
   superbursting before establishing mature neuronal phenotypes in vitro.
   When plated alone, adult rat hippocampal NPC-derived neurons fail to
   establish the synchronized bursting activity that neurons in primary and
   embryonic stem cell-derived cultures readily form. However, adult rat
   hippocampal NPCs evoke re-emergent superbursting in
   electrophysiologically mature rat primary neural cultures. Developmental
   superbursting is thought to accompany transient states of heightened
   plasticity both in culture preparations and across brain regions. Future
   work exploring whether NPCs can re-stimulate developmental states in
   injury models would be an interesting test of their regenerative
   potential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless video communication system can be designed based on the
   rate-distortion (R-D) criterion, i.e., minimizing the end-to-end
   distortion (which includes quantization distortion and transmission
   distortion) subject to the transmission bit-rate constraint. The
   minimization can be achieved by adjusting the source encoding parameters
   and channel encoding parameters. This rate-distortion optimization (RDO)
   is usually done for each video frame individually in a real-time video
   communication system, e. g., video calls or videoconferencing. To
   achieve this, an accurate bit-rate model and distortion model for each
   frame can be used to reduce the RDO complexity. In this paper, we derive
   a source bit-rate model and quantization distortion model; we also
   improve the performance bound for channel coding under a convolutional
   code and a Viterbi decoder, and derive its performance bound under a
   Rayleigh block fading channel. Given the instantaneous channel
   condition, e. g., signal-to-noise ratio and transmission bit-rate
   constraint, we design an R-D optimized cross-layer rate control (CLRC)
   algorithm by jointly choosing quantization step size in source coding
   and code rate in channel coding. Experimental results show that our
   proposed R-D models are more accurate than the existing R-D models.
   Experimental results also showed that the rate control under our models
   has more stable R-D performance than the existing rate control
   algorithms; using the channel estimation, CLRC can further achieve
   remarkable R-D performance gain over that without channel estimation.
   Another important result is that the subjective quality of our CLRC
   algorithm is much better than the existing algorithms due to its
   intelligent reference frame selection.}},

   GaN high electron mobility transistors on silicon substrate are
   presented. The degradation of the device characteristics for RF
   overdrive conditions from 3-dB to 8-dB gain saturation is discussed.
   Output RF power degrades significantly in a short period of time. Both
   transient and permanent degradation of electronic properties of the
   device are identified. After high RF gain compression levels, DC
   characteristics like the threshold voltage (V-T) and gate leakage
   current change permanently. Detailed microscopic changes in the
   electronic structure of the device were studied by performing
   simultaneous low-frequency noise measurements of gate and drain currents
   before and after stress. The channel was found to be immune to the whole
   stress regime with no increase of the Hooge parameter. On the other
   hand, activation of unstable defects and then an increase of the defect
   density near the gate metal semiconductor interface were observed from
   gate noise measurements. A point defect located at around 4.5 nm from
   the gate metal semiconductor interface with activation energy of 0.9 eV
   below the AlGaN conduction band edge was determined from random
   telegraph noise measurements. The role of forward gate biasing as a

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess potential toxic effects of

   malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver of C auratus were analyzed after a
   7-, 14- and 21-day exposure to simulated urban runoff containing
   galaxolide (HHCB) and cadmium (Cd). The results showed that the activity
   of antioxidant enzymes and the content of MDA increased significantly
   exposed to the simulated urban runoff containing HHCB alone or mixture
   of HHCB and Cd. The activity of the investigated enzymes and the content
   of MDA then returned to the blank level over a longer period of
   exposure. The oxidative stress could be obviously caused in the liver of
   C. auratus under the experimental conditions. This could provide useful
   information for toxic risk assessment of urban runoff. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although vein bypass grafting is one of the primary options for the
   treatment of arterial occlusive disease and provides satisfactory
   results at an early stage of the treatment, the patency is limited to a
   few months in many patients. When the vein is implanted in the arterial
   system, it adapts to the high flow rate and high pressure of the
   arterial environment by changing the sizes of its layers, and this
   remodeling is believed to be a precursor of future graft failure.
   Hemodynamic forces, such as wall shear stress (WSS) and wall tension,
   have been recognized as major factors impacting vein graft remodeling.
   Although a wide range of experimental evidence relating hemodynamic
   forces to vein graft remodeling has been reported, a comprehensive
   mathematical model describing the relationship among WSS, wall tension,
   and the structural adaptation of each individual layer of the vein graft
   wall is lacking. The current manuscript presents a comprehensive and
   robust framework for treating the complex interaction between the WSS,
   wall tension, and the structural adaptation of each individual layer of
   the vein graft wall. We modeled the intimal and medial area and the
   radius of external elastic lamina, which in combination dictate luminal
   narrowing and the propensity for graft occlusion. Central to our model
   is a logistic relationship between independent and dependent variables
   to describe the initial increase and later decrease in the growth rate.
   The detailed understanding of the temporal changes in vein graft
   morphology that can be extracted from the current model is critical in
   identifying the dominant contributions to vein graft failure and the
   further development of strategies to improve their longevity.}},

Abstract = {{Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) emitted from welding poses serious health
   risks to workers exposed to welding fumes. In this study,
   tetramethylsilane (TMS) was added to shielding gas to control hazardous
   air pollutants produced during stainless steel welding. The silica
   precursor acted as an oxidation inhibitor when it decomposed in the
   high-temperature welding arc, limiting Cr6+ formation. Additionally, a
   film of amorphous SiO2 was deposited on fume particles to insulate them
   from oxidation. Experiments were conducted following the American
   Welding Society (AWS) method for fume generation and sampling in an AWS
   fume hood. The results showed that total shielding gas flow rate
   impacted the effectiveness of the TMS process. Increasing shielding gas
   flow rate led to increased reductions in Cr6+ concentration when TMS was
   used. When 4.2\% of a 30-lpm shielding gas flow was used as TMS carrier
   gas, Cr6+ concentration in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) fumes was
   reduced to below the 2006 Occupational Safety and Health Administration
   standard (5 mu g m(-3)) and the efficiency was > 90\%. The process also
   increased fume particle size from a mode size of 20 nm under baseline
   conditions to 180-300 nm when TMS was added in all shielding gas flow
   rates tested. SiO2 particles formed in the process scavenged nanosized
   fume particles through intercoagulation. Transmission electron
   microscopy imagery provided visual evidence of an amorphous film of SiO2
   on some fume particles along with the presence of amorphous SiO2
   agglomerates. These results demonstrate the ability of vapor phase
   silica precursors to increase welding fume particle size and minimize
   chromium oxidation, thereby preventing the formation of hexavalent
   chromium.}},

Abstract = {{Ophthalmic drug delivery through eye drops is inefficient because of low
   corneal bioavailability and short residence time in tears. Contact
   lenses are ideally suited for extended and targeted drug delivery to
   cornea, but commercial contact lenses release ophthalmic drugs for only
   1-2 h. This study focuses on dispersing timolol encapsulating highly
   crosslinked nanoparticles in contact lenses to increase the duration of
   drug release from 1 to 2 h to about 2-4 weeks. The highly crosslinked
   particles were prepared from monomers with multivinyl functionalities
   such as EGDMA (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and PGT (propoxylated
   glyceryl triacylate). The nanoparticles were about 3.5 nm in size and
   encapsulated 48-66\% of the drug depending on the composition. Drug
   release studies in a diffusion cell showed that the particles released
   the drug for a period of about 4 weeks. The drug loaded particles were
   dispersed in hydroxy methyl methacrylate (HEMA) gels, which are common
   contact lens materials. The particle loaded gels release timolol in
   phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2-4 weeks at therapeutic dose, which
   is promising for extended drug release applications. The proposed
   mechanism of drug transport is hydrolysis of ester bonds that link
   timolol to the particle matrix which form during the particle formation
   process. The drug release profiles can be described by a first order
   reaction model with a temperature dependent rate constant. The rate
   constant of ester hydrolysis was significantly smaller than that in
   previous studies on timolol esters possibly due to steric effects and
   the low water content of the highly crosslinked hydrophobic particles.
   The results of this study provide evidences that contact lenses loaded
   with nanoparticles could be very useful for extended delivery of
   ophthalmic drugs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured carbon materials continue to attract much interest for
   use in devices and as fillers in composites. Here, classical molecular
   dynamics simulations are carried out using many-body empirical
   potentials to contrast the mechanical properties of straight and coiled
   carbon nanotubes. The specific properties of a coiled carbon nanotube
   (CCNT) are investigated under compression, tension, re-compression,
   re-tension and pullout from a polyethylene (PE) matrix. The
   stress-strain curves, spring constants, and yielding strains under
   compression and tension are given for each system, and the corresponding
   reasons for the differences in their behavior are discussed. They
   indicate that the interaction between a CCNT and a PE matrix is stronger
   than the corresponding interactions between CNTs and PE. Thus, the
   results indicate that CCNTs are good potential candidates for
   lightweight, tough composites. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon nano-onions have been shown to provide exceptional friction and
   wear reduction through a rolling and sliding mechanism of the
   nano-onions at the interface, but the influence of this behavior on the
   their tribological properties is not well documented. Understanding the
   lubrication mechanisms of such nanostructured materials aids in
   determining their frictional properties and promotes the use of these
   materials in tribological applications. Here, we characterize the
   mechanisms of rolling and sliding through which carbon nano-onions
   provide low coefficients of friction by performing atomistic molecular
   dynamics simulations of carbon nano-onions sliding between diamond-like
   carbon substrates. The results indicate that the ability of the
   nano-onions to roll is inhibited both by increased contact pressure and
   the presence of a diamond core within the nanoparticles that enhances
   the formation of interfacial bonds during friction. The transition from
   rolling to sliding behavior is accompanied by a significant increase in
   the coefficient of friction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High pressure-high temperature (HP/HT) methods are utilized to introduce
   structural modifications in the layered lithium transition metal oxides
   LiCoO2 and Li{[}NixLi1/3-2x/3Mn2/3-x/3]O-2 where x = 0.25 and 0.5. The
   electrochemical property to structure relationship is investigated
   combining computational and experimental methods. Both methods agree
   that the substitution of transition metal ions with Li ions in the
   layered structure affects the compressibility of the materials. We have
   identified that following high pressure and high temperature treatment
   up to 8.0 GPa, LiCoO2 did not show drastic structural changes, and
   accordingly the electrochemical properties of the high pressure treated
   LiCoO2 remain almost identical to the pristine sample. The high pressure
   treatment of LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (x = 0.5) caused structural modifications
   that decreased the layered characteristics of the material inhibiting
   its electrochemical lithium intercalation. For Li{[}Li1/6Ni1/4Mn7/12]O-2
   more drastic structural modifications are observed following high
   pressure treatment, including the formation of a second layered phase
   with increased Li/Ni mixing and a contracted c/a lattice parameter
   ratio. The post-treated Li{[}Li1/6Ni1/4Mn7/12]O-2 samples display a good
   electrochemical response, with clear differences compared to the
   pristine material in the 4.5 voltage region. Pristine and post-treated
   Li{[}Li1/6Ni1/4Mn7/12]O-2 deliver capacities upon cycling near 200 mA h
   g(-1), even though additional structural modifications are observed in
   the post-treated material following electrochemical cycling. The results
   presented underline the flexibility of the structure of
   Li{[}Li1/6Ni1/4Mn7/12]O-2; a material able to undergo large structural
   variations without significant negative impacts on the electrochemical
   performance as seen in LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2. In that sense, the Li excess
   materials are superior to LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, whose electrochemical
   characteristics are very sensitive to structural modifications.}},

Abstract = {{Transmitting video over wireless is a challenging problem since video
   may be seriously distorted due to packet errors caused by wireless
   channels. The capability of predicting transmission distortion (i.e.,
   video distortion caused by packet errors) can assist in designing video
   encoding and transmission schemes that achieve maximum video quality or
   minimum end-to-end video distortion. This paper is aimed at deriving
   formulas for predicting transmission distortion. The contribution of
   this paper is twofold. First, we identify the governing law that
   describes how the transmission distortion process evolves over time and
   analytically derive the transmission distortion formula as a closed-form
   function of video frame statistics, channel error statistics, and system
   parameters. Second, we identify, for the first time, two important
   properties of transmission distortion. The first property is that the
   clipping noise, which is produced by nonlinear clipping, causes decay of
   propagated error. The second property is that the correlation between
   motion-vector concealment error and propagated error is negative and has
   dominant impact on transmission distortion, compared with other
   correlations. Due to these two properties and elegant error/distortion
   decomposition, our formula provides not only more accurate prediction
   but also lower complexity than the existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The efficacy of ophthalmic drug delivery through contact lenses
   in animal model was explored to evaluate its potential for serving as an
   alternative to eye drops, which are inefficient vehicles for delivering
   ophthalmic drugs.
   Methods: The efficacy of timolol delivered via contact lenses was
   compared to eye drops in beagle dogs that suffer from spontaneous
   glaucoma. Experiments were conducted with NIGHT \& DAY (TM) silicone
   hydrogel contact lenses and NIGHT \& DAY (TM) loaded with vitamin E,
   which was included in the lens to extend the release duration of the
   drug. Timolol was loaded into contact lenses by soaking in
   drug/phosphate buffered saline solution, and the drug-loaded lenses were
   subsequently inserted in one of the eyes, with the other eye serving as
   control. The lenses were replaced every 24 hours, and the
   pharmacodynamics of intraocular pressure (IOP) and pupil size were
   monitored in both eyes.
   Results: The IOP reduction from baseline by NIGHT \& DAY (TM) (5.02 +/-
   0.83 mmHg) was comparable with that by eye drops with similar drug
   dosing (4.64 +/- 0.41 mmHg). In addition, lenses with one-third of the
   drug loading as eye drops resulted in the similar IOP reduction,
   suggesting higher bioavailability for contact lenses compared to eye
   drops. Inclusion of vitamin E into the lenses did not improve the IOP
   reduction. The IOP in the untreated eye also decreased from baseline for
   eye drops (3.17 +/- 0.42 mmHg) but it remained relatively unchanged with
   treatments based on lenses, suggesting reduction in systemic absorption
   for delivery of drugs by contact lenses.
   Conclusions: Ophthalmic drug delivery through contact lenses increases
   bioavailability and reduces systemic drug uptake.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Currently, two classes of computational phantoms have been developed for
   dosimetry calculation: (1) stylized (or mathematical) and (2) voxel (or
   tomographic) phantoms describing human anatomy through mathematical
   surface equations and 3D voxel matrices, respectively. Mathematical
   surface equations in stylized phantoms are flexible, but the resulting
   anatomy is not as realistic. Voxel phantoms display far better
   anatomical realism, but they are limited in terms of their ability to
   alter organ shape, position, and depth, as well as body posture. A new
   class of computational phantoms called hybrid phantoms takes advantage
   of the best features of stylized and voxel phantoms-flexibility and
   anatomical realism, respectively. In the current study, hybrid
   computational phantoms representing the adult male and female reference
   anatomy and anthropometry are presented. These phantoms serve as the
   starting framework for creating patient or worker sculpted whole-body
   phantoms for retrospective dose reconstruction. Contours of major organs
   and tissues were converted or segmented from computed tomography images
   of a 36-y-old Korean volunteer and a 25-y-old U.S. female patient,
   respectively, with supplemental high-resolution CT images of the
   cranium. Polygon mesh models for the major organs and tissues were
   reconstructed and imported into Rhinoceros (TM) for non-uniform rational
   B-spline (NURBS) surface modeling. The resulting NURBS/polygon mesh
   models representing body contour and internal anatomy were matched to
   anthropometric data and reference organ mass data provided by Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention and International Commission on
   Radiation Protection, respectively. Finally, two hybrid adult male and
   female phantoms were completed where a total of eight anthropometric
   data categories were matched to standard values within 4\% and organ
   volumes matched to ICRP data within 1\% with the exception of total
   skin. The hybrid phantoms were voxelized from the NURBS phantoms at
   resolutions of 0.158 x 0.158 x 0.158 cm(3) and 0.126 x 0.126 x 0.126
   cm(3) for the male and female, respectively. To highlight the
   flexibility of the hybrid phantoms, graphical displays are given of (1)
   underweight and overweight adult male phantoms, (2) a sitting position
   for the adult female phantom, and (3) extraction and higher-resolution
   voxelization of the small intestine for localized dosimetry of mucosal
   and stem cell layers. These phantoms are used to model radioactively
   contaminated individuals and to then assess time-dependent detector
   count rate thresholds corresponding to 50, 250, and 500 mSv effective
   dose, as might be needed during infield radiological triage by first
   responders or first receivers. Health Phys. 102(3): 292-304; 2012}},

Abstract = {{In June 2006, the Radiation Studies Branch of the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention held a workshop to explore rapid methods of
   facilitating radiological triage of large numbers of potentially
   contaminated individuals following detonation of a radiological
   dispersal device. Two options were discussed. The first was the use of
   traditional gamma cameras in nuclear medicine departments operated as
   makeshift whole-body counters. Guidance on this approach is currently
   available from the CDC. This approach would be feasible if a manageable
   number of individuals were involved, transportation to the relevant
   hospitals was quickly provided, and the medical staff at each facility
   had been previously trained in this non-traditional use of their
   radiopharmaceutical imaging devices. If, however, substantially larger
   numbers of individuals (100's to 1,000's) needed radiological screening,
   other options must be given to first responders, first receivers, and
   health physicists providing medical management. In this study, the
   second option of the workshop was investigated-the use of commercially
   available portable survey meters (either NaI or GM based) for assessing
   potential ranges of effective dose (<50, 50-250, 250-500, and >500 mSv).
   Two hybrid computational phantoms were used to model an adult male and
   an adult female subject internally contaminated with Am-241, Cs-60,
   Cs-137, I-131, or Ir-192 following an acute inhalation or ingestion
   intake. As a function of time following the exposure, the net count
   rates corresponding to committed effective doses of 50, 250, and 500 mSv
   were estimated via Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation for each
   of four different detector types, positions, and screening distances.
   Measured net count rates can be compared to these values, and an
   assignment of one of four possible effective dose ranges could be made.
   The method implicitly assumes that all external contamination has been
   removed prior to screening and that the measurements be conducted in a
   low background, and possibly mobile, facility positioned at the triage
   location. Net count rate data are provided in both tabular and graphical
   format within a series of eight handbooks available at the CDC website
   (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/clinicians/evaluation). Health Phys.

Abstract = {{Recently, the information potential (IP) of order, defined as the
   argument of the log in the alpha-order Renyi entropy, has been
   successfully used as an information theoretic criterion for supervised
   adaptive system training. In this paper, we use the survival function
   (or equivalently the distribution function) of an absolute value
   transformed random variable to define a new information potential, named
   the survival information potential (SIP). Compared with the IP, the SIP
   has some advantages, such as validity in a wide range of distributions,
   robustness, and the simplicity in computation. The properties of SIP and
   a simple formula for computing the empirical SIP are given in the paper.
   Finally, the SIP criterion is applied in adaptive system training, and
   simulation examples on FIR adaptive filtering, kernel adaptive
   filtering, and time delay neural networks (TDNNs) training are presented
   to demonstrate the performance.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stones develop by calcium
   oxalate crystal deposition on Randall plaque. The mechanisms involved in
   Randall plaque formation are still unclear. We hypothesized that Randall
   plaque formation is similar to that of vascular calcification, involving
   components of extracellular matrix, including membrane bound vesicles
   and collagen fibers. To verify our hypothesis we critically examined
   renal papillary tissue from patients with stones.
   Materials and Methods: We performed 4 mm cold cup biopsy of renal
   papillae on 15 patients with idiopathic stones undergoing percutaneous
   nephrolithotomy. Tissue was immediately fixed and processed for analysis
   by various light and electron microscopic techniques.
   Results: Spherulitic calcium phosphate crystals, the hallmark of Randall
   plaque, were seen in all samples examined, including in interstitium and
   laminated basement membrane of tubular epithelium. Large crystalline
   deposits were composed of dark elongated strands mixed with spherulites.
   Strands showed banded patterns similar to collagen. Crystal deposits
   were surrounded by collagen fibers and membrane bound vesicles. Energy
   dispersive x-ray microanalysis and electron diffraction identified the
   crystals as hydroxyapatite. Few kidneys were examined and urinary data
   were not available on all patients.
   Conclusions: Results showed that crystals in Randall plaque are
   associated with collagen and membrane bound vesicles. Collagen fibers
   appeared calcified and vesicles contained crystals. Crystal deposition
   in renal papillae may have started with membrane vesicle induced
   nucleation and grown by the further addition of crystals at the
   periphery in a collagen framework.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory simulation studies, through mechanical removal of leaf tissue,
   provide valuable insight about plant compensation and tolerance to
   defoliation. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to examine the effects
   of defoliation on growth and biomass accumulation of Hygrophila
   polysperma and thereby determine the critical level of herbivory
   necessary to achieve significant reduction in growth of this invasive
   plant. The data collected during the experiment were used to develop an
   empirical plant growth model to examine the usefulness of a model-based
   approach for a priori understanding of plant response to defoliation.
   The results of the mesocosm experiment showed that defoliation
   significantly influenced growth and biomass accumulation of hygrophila.
   The empirical plant growth model accurately simulated plant growth
   response to herbivory across treatments. Based on the results of the
   mesocosm experiment, an insect defoliator that causes complete
   defoliation of hygrophila at least at monthly intervals may be able to
   reduce biomass and growth of hygrophila. The ability of the mathematical
   model to predict the effects of defoliation on hygrophila suggest that
   it could be a useful tool for the selection of effective biological
   control agents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Throughput capacity in mobile ad hoc networks has been studied
   extensively under many different mobility models. However, most previous
   research assumes global mobility, and the results show that a constant
   per-node throughput can be achieved at the cost of very high delay.
   Thus, we are having a very big gap here, i. e., either low throughput
   and low delay in static networks or high throughput and high delay in
   mobile networks. In this paper, employing a practical restricted random
   mobility model, we try to fill this gap. Specifically, we assume that a
   network of unit area with n nodes is evenly divided into cells with an
   area of n(-2 alpha), each of which is further evenly divided into
   squares with an area of n(-2 beta)(0 <= alpha <= beta <= 1/2). All nodes
   can only move inside the cell which they are initially distributed in,
   and at the beginning of each time slot, every node moves from its
   current square to a uniformly chosen point in a uniformly chosen
   adjacent square. By proposing a new multihop relay scheme, we present
   smooth trade-offs between throughput and delay by controlling nodes'
   mobility. We also consider a network of area n(gamma)(0 <= gamma <= 1)
   and find that network size does not affect the results obtained before.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless sensor network can get separated into multiple connected
   components due to the failure of some of its nodes, which is called a
   ``cut.{''} In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting cuts by
   the remaining nodes of a wireless sensor network. We propose an
   algorithm that allows 1) every node to detect when the connectivity to a
   specially designated node has been lost, and 2) one or more nodes (that
   are connected to the special node after the cut) to detect the
   occurrence of the cut. The algorithm is distributed and asynchronous:
   every node needs to communicate with only those nodes that are within
   its communication range. The algorithm is based on the iterative
   computation of a fictitious ``electrical potential{''} of the nodes. The
   convergence rate of the underlying iterative scheme is independent of
   the size and structure of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed algorithm through simulations and a real hardware
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the biological response of Pseudokirchneriella
   subcapitata to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) suspended in gum
   Arabic (GA), using typical 96-hour algal bioassays and long-term growth
   studies. Changes in algal biomass and cell morphology associated with
   specific SWNT-treatments were monitored and the mechanisms of observed
   biological responses investigated through a combination of biochemical
   and spectroscopic methods. Results from short-term bioassays showed a
   growth inhibition in culture media containing >0.5 mg SWNT/L and a final
   GA concentration of 0.023\% (v/v). Interestingly, the observed toxicity
   disappears when GA concentrations are brought to levels >= 0.046\%.
   Long-term experiments based on toxic combination of SWNTs and GA showed
   that P. subcapitata would easily recover from an initial growth
   inhibition effect. Overall, these findings point to the possibility of
   GA to mitigate the toxicity of SWNTs, making it an ideal surfactant if
   SWNT suspension in GA does not alter the performance sought from these
   nanotubes.}},

Abstract = {{The surface chemical compositions of three types of silicone hydrogel
   contact lenses, PureVision(A (R)) (balafilcon A), ACUVUE(A (R)) OASYS(A

   using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy prior to and following treatment
   in a test solution of diblock copolymer of poly(ethylene oxide) and
   poly(butylene oxide) (EO-BO). Prior to treatment, differences in surface
   elemental compositions of the lenses were found to reflect known bulk
   compositions and/or respective surface treatments. Following solution
   treatment, surface chemical modifications were apparent in balafilcon A
   and lotrafilcon B, especially in the distribution of chemical
   functionalities present at the surface. Only modest changes in surface
   composition were observed for the senofilcon A material. Atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) was employed to evaluate the surface topography and
   frictional properties of the lenses prior to and following similar
   solution treatments. AFM measurements in saline revealed large
   disparities between the coefficients of friction of the three lenses,
   with balafilcon A and lotrafilcon B exhibiting coefficients of friction
   approximately five times greater than that of senofilcon A. Lens surface
   treatment with the diblock copolymer test solution produced a
   significant reduction in the coefficients of friction of the two lenses
   exhibiting higher friction, yet only a small reduction in friction was
   observed for senofilcon A lens. Together, these results depict a strong
   correlation between the surface chemistry and frictional response of the
   lens systems as they relate to solution treatment with this specific
   diblock copolymer.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis
   (PARAFAC) has been widely used to characterize dissolved organic matter
   (DOM). Characterization is based on the intensity and location of
   independent fluorescent components identified in models constructed from
   excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). Similar fluorescent components have
   been identified in PARAFAC studies across a wide range of systems;
   however, there is a lack of discussion regarding the consistency with
   which these similar components behave. The overall goal of this critical
   review is to compare results for PARAFAC studies published since the
   year 2000 which include one or more of three reoccurring humic-like
   components. Components are compared and characterized based on EEM
   location, characteristic ecosystems, and behavior in natural and
   engineered systems. This synthesis allows PARAFAC users to more
   confidently infer DOM characteristics based on identified components.
   Additionally, behavioral inconsistencies between similar components help
   elucidate DOM properties for which fluorescence spectroscopy with
   PARAFAC may be a weak predictive tool.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{396}},

Abstract = {{In this study we explored a possibility for enhancing aqueous sorption
   of humic substances (HS) onto hydroxylated surfaces (e.g., silica gel)
   by increasing modification rate of their most abundant functional groups
   - carboxyls with mineral-adhesive alkoxysilyl moieties. The synthesis
   included treatment of dried humic material with 3-aminopropyl trimethoxy
   silane (APTS) capable of forming amide bonds with carboxyl groups of HS
   under anhydrous conditions. The reaction was run at six different HS to
   APTS ratio for achieving different modification degrees of the carboxyl
   groups in the humic backbone. The obtained derivatives were
   characterized using elemental analysis, 13C NMR Spectroscopy, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography that
   confirmed quantitative incorporation of alkoxysilyl-moieties into HS
   structure. Aqueous adsorption was investigated in 0.028 M phosphate
   buffer using silica gel as a surrogate for mineral surface. Both
   distribution coefficients as well adsorption capacities paralleled the
   amount of alkoxysilyl-moieties incorporated into backbone of the
   parental HS. The adsorption capacity reached its maximum value of 210 mg
   of HS per g of SiO2 for the APTS derivative synthesized at the equimolar
   reagent ratio. This value was comparable to the amount of the same HS
   immobilized onto the APTS-treated silica gel (265 mg of HS per g of
   SiO2). Adsorption of alkoxysilyl-derivatives was found to be
   irreversible under conditions studied. Conclusively, we believe that the
   directed modification of HS by incorporating alkoxysilyl-moieties is
   well suited for producing humic derivatives with controllable affinity
   for aqueous sorption onto hydroxylated surfaces. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Somatostatin (SST) has been suggested to play an important role in
   maintaining hippocampal homeostasis by modulating excitatory
   neurotransmission. The putative anticonvulsant role for SST was tested
   in an electrical amygdala kindling model. SST was cloned into serotype 5
   of the adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector and delivered bilaterally
   into the hippocampus of adult male Sprague Dawley rats that were
   subsequently electrically kindled. Behavioral severity and duration of
   kindled seizures was compared to uninjected and GFP-injected control
   rats. Results demonstrated that 70\% of SST treated animals did not
   experience class IV or V seizures without affecting the threshold for
   individual stimulation-evoked seizures. This result was significantly
   different from control groups where 100\% of animals reached class V
   seizures. No difference in the number of stimulations required to reach
   the first class I-III seizures was observed in the experimental cohort
   relative to age-matched controls. These preclinical results suggest a
   putative role for SST as an anticonvulsant therapeutic modality for

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional atom probe tomography was used to characterize the
   segregation of B dopant atoms to grain boundaries in polycrystalline Si
   after flash-assisted rapid thermal annealing. Tomographic
   reconstructions allowed direct measurement of segregation coefficients,
   which were found to be greater at lower flash temperatures with thermal
   budgets that limit grain growth. Hall measurements confirmed the
   deactivation of B at the grain boundaries, while secondary ion mass
   spectrometry was used to measure B diffusion in the film. Experimental
   parameters were then simulated in a diffusion model which accurately
   predicts the diffusion of B in polycrystalline Si at flash temperatures
   of 1150 degrees C, 1250 degrees C, and 1350 degrees C, as well as with
   conventional rapid thermal annealing. (C) 2012 American Institute of

   formation in ZnO}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{Photoluminescence (PL) and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)
   techniques are utilized to examine the effects of P implantation and
   post-implantation annealing on defect formation in ZnO single crystals.
   From ODMR, the main defects created by ion implantation include oxygen
   and zinc vacancies as a well as a deep donor labeled as PD. The
   formation of the PD defect is likely promoted by the presence of P as it
   could only be detected in the P-containing ZnO. The V-O and PD centers
   are found to exhibit low thermal stability and can be annealed out at
   800 degrees C. On the other hand, a new set of defects, such as Z, T,
   and D{*} centers, is detected after annealing. Based on measured
   spectral dependences of the ODMR signals, the V-O, V-Zn, and PD centers
   are shown to participate in spin-dependent recombination processes
   related to red emissions, whereas the Z, T, and D{*} centers are
   involved in radiative recombination over a wide spectral range of
   1.55-2.5 eV. From the PL measurements, combined effects of implantation
   and annealing also lead to appearance of a new PL band peaking at
   similar to 3.156 eV, likely due to donor-acceptor-pair recombination.
   The formation of the involved deep acceptor is concluded to be
   facilitated by the presence of P. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{We report significant improvement in both the power conversion
   efficiency and the environmental stability of solution-processed hybrid
   organic-inorganic solar cells by including a solution-processed ZnO
   nanocrystal layer between the photoactive layer and the cathode. For
   devices based on blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and
   mostly-spherical CdSe nanocrystals, incorporation of the ZnO layer leads
   to an up to 70\% increase in the power conversion efficiency. Compared
   to only a few hours of shelf lifetime for unencapsulated devices with
   the metal cathode directly deposited on the hybrid active layer, devices
   with the ZnO layer can retain approximately 70\% of the original
   efficiency when they are exposed to the laboratory ambient without
   encapsulation for more than two months. We attribute the function of
   this ZnO nanocrystal layer to a combination of optical, electronic,
   morphological, and chemical effects, including blocking leakage of
   photogenerated holes to the cathode, optimizing the optical intensity
   profile in the hybrid active layer, minimizing recombination or
   quenching of photogenerated excitons and charge carriers, significantly
   reducing the transport rate of oxygen and water molecules to the active
   layer and reducing degradation/oxidation of any low work function layer

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to gain understanding of the quasi-static,
   large strain deformation behavior at room-temperature of high-purity
   alpha-Ti with an initial split-basal texture. Simple shear tests were
   conducted along different directions in order to quantify the material's
   anisotropy and hardening evolution for different strain paths such as
   monotonic, Bauschinger, and cyclic loadings. The stress-strain curves
   indicate that the material displays strong anisotropy in the flow
   behavior. In order to capture the link between microstructure evolution
   (occurrence of twinning, grain size evolution, etc.) and the macroscopic
   response, a thoroughly detailed multi-scale characterization using
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations and electron
   backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis was also conducted.
   Specifically, EBSD analyses indicate that the twin activity and grain
   fragmentation are responsible for the observed difference between the
   macroscopic hardening rates corresponding to different directions and
   loading paths. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first published observations of ``chaotic{''} dart
   leaders in triggered-lightning discharges. We examine four leaders that
   exhibited ``chaotic{''} electric field derivative (dE/dt) signatures in
   their final 10 to 12 mu s. The dE/dt signatures were characterized by
   bursts exhibiting widths of the order of hundreds of nanoseconds on
   which were superimposed irregular pulses with widths of the order of
   tens of nanoseconds. These unique signatures were dissimilar from the
   dE/dt waveforms observed from dart or dart-stepped leaders in triggered
   lightning. Three-dimensional locations for dE/dt pulses that radiated
   from the bottom 200 m of the leader channels were determined, as were
   emission times. Vertical leader speeds for the four ``chaotic{''} dart
   leaders were estimated to range from 2.0 to 4.3 x 10(7) m/s. A
   relatively continuous flux of energetic radiation (X-rays and gamma
   rays) was observed during the final 10-13 mu s of each ``chaotic{''}
   dart leader. Some individual photons had energies more than 1 MeV.
   High-speed video images of three ``chaotic{''} dart leaders were
   obtained at a frame rate of 300 kilo-frames per second (exposure time of
   3.33 mu s). One image, in the frame immediately prior to the return
   stroke, shows an upward positive leader 11.5 m in length propagating
   from the launch facility and a downward negative leader above with a
   streamer zone length of about 25 m. Channel base currents preceding the
   four ``chaotic{''} dart leaders were of unusually long duration and
   large charge transfer, and return strokes following them had larger than
   usual peak currents.}},

Abstract = {{The passive flux meter (PFM) measures local cumulative water and
   contaminant fluxes at an observation well. Conditional stochastic
   simulation accounting for both spatial correlation and data skewness is
   introduced to interpret passive flux meter observations in terms of
   probability distributions of discharges across control planes
   (transects) of wells. An estimator of the effective number of
   independent data is defined and applied in the development of two
   significantly simpler approximate methods for estimating discharge
   distributions. One method uses a transformation of the t statistic to
   account for data skewness and the other method is closely related to the
   classic bootstrap. The approaches are demonstrated with passive flux
   meter data from two field sites (a trichloroethylene {[}TCE] plume at
   Ft. Lewis, WA, and a uranium plume at Rifle, CO). All methods require
   that the flux heterogeneity is sufficiently represented by the data and
   maximum differences in discharge quantile estimates between methods are
   similar to 7\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel supercapacitor electrode design based on
   poly(3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole) (PProDOP) electropolymerized onto thin
   films of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) on glass substrates.
   This permits the electropolymerization of thicker PProDOP films than can
   be deposited onto flat gold-coated Kapton electrodes and a
   correspondingly greater capacitance per unit area. A pyrene
   functionalized polyfluorene, designated Sticky-PF, was designed and used
   as an effective monolayer interfacial adhesion modifier between the SWNT
   films and PProDOP via noncovalent self-assembly onto the SWNT film
   surfaces before polymer electrodeposition. The thickness of the
   electrodeposited PProDOP was found to be self-limiting at thicknesses
   characteristic of each substrate electrode. Optimized areal capacitance
   values for PProDOP on flat gold and Sticky-PP coated SWNT films were
   measured to be 8.1 mF/cm(2) and 16.4 mF/cm(2), respectively, with the
   twofold enhancement due to the thicker films possible on the SWNT
   electrode. The specific capacitance of PProDOP on gold and
   Sticky-PFISWNT film substrates were found to be similar at 141 F/g and
   122 F/g, respectively, indicating the capacitance to be due to the
   electroactive polymer. The areal capacitance values of the corresponding
   supercapacitor devices constructed with Au/Kapton substrates was 3.2
   mF/cm(2), whereas a significantly greater value of 8.8 mF/cm(2) was
   measured for the Sticky-PFISWNT film substrates. The supercapacitors
   prepared using the Au/Kapton substrates were highly stable, retaining
   80\% of their electroactivity after 32 700 nonstop charge/discharge
   cycles (100\% depth of discharge). Supercapacitors made using the
   Sticky-PFISWNT substrates showed a steady loss of capacitance to about
   57\% of the original value (to 5.0 mF/cm(2)) after 32 700
   charge/discharge cycles, which was still 38\% larger than the initial
   capacitance of the gold electrode devices.}},

Title = {{Drawing graphene nanoribbons on SiC by ion implantation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{We describe a straightforward technique for selective graphene growth
   and nanoribbon production onto 4H- and 6H-SiC. The technique presented
   is as easy as ion implanting regions where graphene layers are desired
   followed by annealing to 100 degrees C below the graphitization
   temperature (T-G) of SiC. We find that ion implantation of SiC lowers
   the T-G, allowing selective graphene growth at temperatures below the
   T-G of pristine SiC and above T-G of implanted SiC. This results in an
   approach for patterning device structures ranging from a couple tens of
   nanometers to microns in size without using conventional lithography and
   chemical processing. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Discrete element method modeling of bi-convex pharmaceutical tablets:
   Contact detection algorithms and validation}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{69}},

Pages = {{587-601}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Various algorithms have been presented in the literature for contact
   detection between three-dimensional hi-convex objects, such as
   pharmaceutical tablets. Most are approximations to true hi-convex
   shapes, e.g., glued spheres, sphere-intersections, sphero-cylinders, and
   super-ellipsoids, and others, such as the discrete function
   representation, are computationally expensive. In this paper, algorithms
   are presented for determining if two, true hi-convex tablets, or a
   hi-convex tablet and an infinite plane, are in contact. A hi-convex
   tablet has two spherical caps and a cylindrical band. In all, ten
   contact scenarios are examined involving all components of the tablets,
   i.e., caps, band, and edges. In addition to checking for contact,
   relations for determining the contact location, overlap, and unit normal
   vector for the contact are presented for use in discrete element method
   computer simulations. These algorithms have been validated for single
   and multiple tablet scenarios: (a) comparing translational and angular
   velocities of a single hi-convex tablet impacting a flat plane, (b)
   comparing the fill fractions of hi-convex tablets in a container, and
   (c) comparing the dynamic angle of repose of hi-convex tablets in a
   rotating drum. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{It Takes More Than an Imine: The Role of the Central Atom on the

Abstract = {{We report on the comparison of the electronic and photophysical
   properties of a series of related donor-acceptor-donor oligomers
   incorporating the previously known 2H-benzo{[}d]{[}1,2,3]triazole (BTz)
   moiety as the acceptor and the recently reported BTzTD acceptor, a
   hybrid of BTz and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD). Although often implied
   in the polymer literature that BTz has good acceptor character, we show
   that this moiety is best described as a weak acceptor. We present
   electrochemical, computational, and photophysical evidence supporting
   our assertion that BTzTD is a strong electron acceptor while maintaining
   the alkylation ability of the BTz moiety. Our results show that the
   identity of the central atom (N or S) in the benzo-fused heterocyclic
   ring plays an important role in both the electron-accepting and the
   electron-donating ability of acceptor moieties with sulfur imparting a
   greater electron-accepting ability and nitrogen affording greater
   electron-donating character. We report on the X-ray crystal structure of
   a BTzTD trimer, which exhibits greater local aromatic character in the
   region of the triazole ring and contains an electron-deficient sulfur
   that imparts strong electron-accepting ability. Additionally, we examine
   the transient absorption spectra of BTzTD and BTz oligomers and report
   that the BTz core promotes efficient intersystem crossing to the triplet
   state, while the presence of the thiadiazole moiety in BTzTD leads to a
   negligible triplet yield. Additionally, while BTz does not function as a
   good acceptor, oligomers containing this moiety do function as excellent
   sensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen.}},
