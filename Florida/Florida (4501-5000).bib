Abstract = {{The Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM 2010) contains a significantly
   revised automobile analysis and level-of-service (LOS) methodology for
   arterials. This study compared the arterial LOS results of the HCM 2000
   and HCM 2010 methodologies for an experimental set of arterial segments
   and analyzed the effects of the revised methodology. In addition,
   existing Florida field data sets were also analyzed with arterial
   segments obtained from Gainesville, Tallahassee, and Tampa, all in
   Florida, as well as data received from the Florida Department of
   Transportation Districts 2 and 3. The HCM 2010 results showed that for
   shorter, lower-speed arterial segments {[}such as in central business
   districts (CBDs)] it was not possible to obtain LOS Ratings A or B.
   Therefore, many CBD arterials that had good LOS values under the HCM
   2000 methodology would now have moderate to poor LOS values.
   Consequently, the research-team tested-several revisions of the HCM 2010
   methodology to find an approach that would not be as punitive to
   arterials with shorter segment lengths and that would provide a good
   balance of LOS values across a range of segment lengths, posted speeds,
   and traffic demands. Suggested revisions to the HCM 2010 methodology
   that allowed this objective to be achieved consisted of the following:
   the use of two classes instead of one (on the basis of the posted
   speed); the use of the average travel speed as the service measure
   instead of the ratio of the average travel speed to the base free-flow
   speed; and the setting of the free-flow speed to equal the posted speed
   plus 5 mph, instead of using the free-flow speed computations in the HCM
   2010 methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of ocean flow on the motion of autonomous underwater vehicles
   (ACV) is often crucial in the development of underwater localization
   algorithms and should not be treated as small disturbances. The
   domination of strong ocean currents and the requirement of low power
   consumption prohibit AUN's to move against a background flow to obtain
   localization correction in a timely manner. Our recent studies, among
   others, enable an unmanned vehicle to follow a near optimal trajectory
   found by Lagrangian coherent structures based fluid control algorithm
   with minimal fuel usage, which improves the vehicles' runtime and the
   path following accuracy in the presence of strong background flow. Here,
   we propose a three-dimensional fully distributed localization hierarchy
   to improve the localization of low-cost mobile marine data collection
   underwater sensor networks using intra-vehicle communication and
   measurements. The proposed algorithm is realized by using the extended
   Kalman filter. Correlation terms in covariance matrices are considered
   independently to meet the distributed feature. Resulting simulated
   localization errors are bounded at satisfactory levels and the
   relationship between the number of AUN's and the performance of the
   algorithm is investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have shown that the lateral line found in most fish and some
   other aquatic organisms is capable of providing hydrodynamic information
   of the surrounding fluid, which may facilitate many behavioral
   decisions. Previous work by the group introduced a lateral line inspired
   feedforward design for underwater vehicle control. The system utilizes
   pressure sensor arrays to estimate the hydrodynamic force acting on the
   vehicle such that the additional information will simplify the modeling
   process and improve the maneuvering accuracy for the control tasks in
   underwater exploration and environmental monitoring. In this paper, the
   feedforward control design is presented and tested in simulation for
   trajectory tracking and path following after expressing the force
   estimation algorithm in the three-dimensional domain. Pressure
   measurements at multiple locations on the vehicle surface form a least
   squares approximation of the pressure distribution. Hydrodynamic forces
   acting on the vehicle are then estimated and passed to the controller
   for improved performance. Preliminary experimental tests are conducted
   to vindicate the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we concentrate on the transport and noise properties of
   field-effect transistors based on individual carbon nanotubes. We show
   that there are two different regimes in transistor operation: one regime
   where the Schottky barriers determine the transport properties, and one
   regime where their influence is negligible and the nanotube channel
   plays a major role. The regimes are clearly separated at certain gate
   voltages by different dependences of the drain current and the spectral
   density of the flicker noise component on the gate voltage. The noise
   related to the transport determined by Schottky barriers was found to be
   at least one order of magnitude higher than noise related to the
   transport properties of the carbon nanotube channel. In addition to the
   flicker component, generation-recombination noise components were
   registered and investigated at different temperatures. This allowed us
   to estimate the activation energies of traps and their influence on the
   transport properties.}},

Abstract = {{In order to judiciously compare neural responses between repeated trials
   or stimuli, a well-suited distance metric is necessary. With
   multi-electrode recordings, a neural response is a spatiotemporal
   pattern, but not all of the dimensions of space and time should be
   treated equally. In order to understand which dimensions of the input
   are more discriminative and to improve the classification performance,
   we propose a metric-learning approach that can be used across scales.
   This extends previous work that used a linear projection into lower
   dimensional space; here, multiscale metrics or kernels are learned as
   the weighted combinations of different metrics or kernels on each of the
   neural response's dimensions. Preliminary results are explored on a
   cortical recording of a rat during a tactile stimulation experiment.
   Metrics on both local field potential and spiking data are explored. The
   learned weights reveal important dimensions of the response, and the
   learned metrics improve nearest-neighbor classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for computing a path of
   diffeomorphisms between a pair of input diffeomorphisms. Direct
   computation of a geodesic path on the space of diffeomorphisms
   Diff(Omega) is difficult, and it can be attributed mainly to the
   infinite dimensionality of Diff(Omega). Our proposed framework, to some
   degree, bypasses this difficulty using the quotient map of Diff(Omega)
   to the quotient space Diff(M)/Diff(M)(mu) obtained by quotienting out
   the subgroup of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms Diff(M)(mu). This
   quotient space was recently identified as the unit sphere in a Hilbert
   space in mathematics literature, a space with well-known geometric
   properties. Our framework leverages this recent result by computing the
   diffeomorphic path in two stages. First, we project the given
   diffeomorphism pair onto this sphere and then compute the geodesic path
   between these projected points. Second, we lift the geodesic on the
   sphere back to the space of diffeomerphisms, by solving a quadratic
   programming problem with bilinear constraints using the augmented
   Lagrangian technique with penalty terms. In this way, we can estimate
   the path of diffeomorphisms, first, staying in the space of
   diffeomorphisms, and second, preserving shapes/volumes in the deformed
   images along the path as much as possible. We have applied our framework
   to interpolate intermediate frames of frame-sub-sampled video sequences.
   In the reported experiments, our approach compares favorably with the
   popular Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping framework
   (LDDMM).}},

Abstract = {{Active learning approaches are becoming of increasing importance within
   engineering education, and it has been established that an active
   learning environment leads to improved student outcomes. What is less
   known is the ways in which these classes support student learning. Our
   study takes place in the context of a Process Oriented Guided Inquiry
   Learning (POGIL) classroom. We use grounded theory to answer the
   research question: How do students construct knowledge in a POGIL
   classroom? Constructivist grounded theory was used to code student
   interview data and develop a theory of how student learning occurs. The
   resulting theory shows that the use of POGIL results in a
   concept-focused class, as opposed to focusing on discrete aspects of
   knowledge (facts). This concept-focused class provides for both
   conceptual understanding and improved retention of information. The
   findings illustrate one way to design a class for deep conceptual
   understanding and suggest broader implications for curriculum design.}},

Abstract = {{Arginine is one of the essential amino acid involved in numerous
   biosynthetic pathways that significantly influence tumor growth. It has
   been demonstrated that arginine is effective to inhibit proliferation of
   cancer cells when an appropriate dose is applied. Generally, induction
   of cell death requires high concentration of arginine while low
   concentration of arginine facilitates cell proliferation. In addition to
   the apoptosis induced by metabolism of arginine, it has also been
   reported that in an ideal solution environment, arginine may assemble
   into arginine clusters to kill cancer cells. Therefore, to make the
   arginine an effective anticancer agent, arginine/albumin microspheres
   were designed and synthesized to provide a localized high concentration
   of arginine on tumor sites. In addition, the arginine/albumin
   mesospheres (AAMS) are also expected to provide an arginine-rich surface
   on microspheres, which is similar to the arginine cluster, to
   effectively inhibit tumor growth. In this study, the AAMS were
   synthesized through a water/organic solvent emulsion system and the
   surface properties were characterized. The in vitro effects of AAMS on
   A549, CRL-2081, MAK9 lung cancer cells (LCC) proliferation, migration,
   and tumor growth were determined. The expression of oncogenic protein
   EphA2 and transcription factor slug was also determined. AAMS
   significantly inhibited the cell proliferation, cell migration and tumor
   growth in all the three LCC, while same concentration of free arginine
   promoted the LCC tumor growth and migration. Our studies indicate that
   the synthesized AAMS has a more effective inhibiting effect on
   proliferation, migration and tumor growth of LCC than freely released
   arginine. The expression of EphA2 receptor mRNA was significantly
   decreased when compared to control cells. In addition the mRNA
   expression of transcription factor slug was also inhibited by AAMS
   suggesting that AAMS affects the expression of EphA2 and slug and may
   regulate LCC proliferation and migration. These data suggests that the
   AAMS can be an ideal delivery vehicle for therapeutic interventions
   against LCCs.}},

Abstract = {{Various tensor decompositions use different arrangements of factors to
   explain multi-way data. Components from different decompositions can
   vary in the number of parameters. Allowing a model to contain components
   from different decompositions results in a combinatoric number of
   possible models. Model selection balances approximation error and the
   number of parameters, but due to the number of possible models, post-hoc
   model selection is infeasible. Instead, we incrementally build a model.
   This approach is analogous to sparse coding with a union of
   dictionaries. The proposed greedy approach can estimate a model
   consisting of a combination of tensor decompositions.}},

Abstract = {{With the introduction of volatile renewable energy sources into the

   method to provide ancillary service by using the flexibility of demand
   in commercial building HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning)
   systems. In particular, we show how a regulation command transmitted by
   a balancing authority can be tracked by varying the cooling demand in
   commercial buildings in real-time. A key idea here is the bandwidth
   limitation of the regulation signal, which allows the building's HVAC
   system to provide this service with little effect on the indoor climate.
   The proposed control scheme can be applied on any building with a VAV
   (Variable Air Volume) system and on-site chiller(s). Simple calculations
   show that the commercial buildings in the U.S. can provide 47 GW of
   regulation reserves in the frequency band f is an element of {[}1/(60

Abstract = {{Advances in biocompatible materials and electrocatalytic nanomaterials
   have extended and enhanced the field of biosensors. Immobilization of
   biorecognition elements on nanomaterial platforms is an efficient
   technique for developing high fidelity biosensors. Single layer (i.e.,
   Langmuir-Blodgett) protein films are efficient, but disadvantages of
   this approach include high cost, mass transfer limitations, and Vromer
   competition for surface binding sites. There is a need for simple, user
   friendly protein-nanomaterial sensing membranes that can be developed in
   laboratories or classrooms (i.e., outside of the clean room). In this
   research, we develop high fidelity nanomaterial platforms for developing
   electrochemical biosensors using sustainable biomaterials and
   user-friendly deposition techniques. Catalytic nanomaterial platforms
   are developed using a combination of self assembled monolayer chemistry
   and electrodeposition. High performance biomaterials (e. g., nanolignin)
   are recovered from paper pulp waste and combined with proteins and
   nanomaterials to form active sensor membranes. These methods are being
   used to develop electrochemical biosensors for studying physiological
   transport in biomedical, agricultural, and environmental applications.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate and rapid measurement of physiological O-2 transport is
   vital for understanding spatially and temporally dynamic metabolism and
   stress signalling in plant cells and tissues. Single channel luminescent
   O-2-quenched optrodes have been available for use in laboratory and
   field experiments since the early 2000's. However, to collect the large
   datasets needed to understand O-2 transport in complex systems, many
   experiments require a multiple channel O-2 sensor system. This research
   reports the development of a multiplexing fiber optic O-2 microsensor
   system designed to conduct high temporal resolution experiments for
   field studies of plant physiology. The 10 channel system was
   demonstrated for measuring O-2 concentration in developing soybean seeds
   (Glycine max L. Merr.) within a climate controlled greenhouse.}},

Abstract = {{Non-invasive tools that allow real-time quantification of molecules
   relevant to metabolism, homeostasis, and cell signaling in cells and
   tissue are of great importance for studying physiology. Several
   microsensor technologies have been developed to monitor concentration of
   molecules such as ions, oxygen, electroactive molecules (e. g., nitric
   oxide, hydrogen peroxide), and biomolecules (e. g., sugars, hormones).
   The major challenges for microsensors are overcoming relatively low
   sensitivity and low signal-to-noise ratio. Modern approaches for
   enhancing microsensor performance focus on the incorporation of
   catalytic nanomaterials to increase sensitivity, reduce response time,
   and increase operating range. To improve signal-to-noise ratio, a
   non-invasive microsensor modality called self-referencing (SR) is being
   applied. The SR technique allows measurement of temporal and spatial
   transport dynamics at the cell, tissue, organ, and organismal level.}},

   Rectangular Steel-Reinforced Elastomeric Bridge Bearing Pads}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2331}},
Pages = {{3-13}},
Abstract = {{Accurate estimates of bearing stiffnesses are often necessary for bridge
   design and construction calculations. In the case of steel-reinforced
   elastomeric bearing pads, the compression stiffness or roll stiffness is
   sometimes difficult to estimate because of complex deformations of the
   elastomer. A method of numerical analysis for estimating the axial and
   roll stiffnesses of bearing pads is presented. To validate the axial
   calculation method, experimental compression tests were performed on pad
   specimens constructed in accordance with Florida design standards. A
   method for calculating roll stiffness is also presented in which the pad
   is modeled as a grillage of compression-only axial springs. The grillage
   method was partially derived from roll stiffness data measured in a
   separate experimental study. The grillage method was demonstrated to
   accurately capture both the nonlinear moment rotation behavior caused by
   liftoff of the girder from the pad and the observed sensitivity of roll
   stiffness to initial compressive loading caused by self-weight of the
   girder. Reductions in roll stiffness that are caused by girder slope
   relative to the pad were also examined.}},

Title = {{Analysis and Design of Tradable Credit Schemes Under Uncertainty}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2333}},
Pages = {{27-36}},
Abstract = {{Market-based instruments for congestion mitigation can be generally
   classified into two groups: price-based and quantity-based. The former,
   widely known as congestion pricing, charges tolls to influence
   travelers' decisions; the latter directly regulates congestion. More
   specifically, credits or permits are first distributed by a government
   agency, and travelers are then required to pay a certain number of
   credits to access transportation facilities. The credits can be traded
   between travelers, and the price is determined by the market through
   free trading. In this study the identity between congestion pricing and
   tradable credit schemes in managing network mobility is formally
   established. A numerical example demonstrates how the identity falls
   apart when uncertainty is associated with transportation supply or
   demand. A sensitivity analysis of the coupled network and market
   equilibrium is then conducted to predict how credit price varies with
   respect to the perturbation associated with the supply or demand. A
   safety-valve policy is investigated to balance regulation success and
   price volatility under uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{The 2007 edition of AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications contains

   reinforcement as an alternative to AASHTO's prescriptive requirements.
   The model considers a range of I-girder conditions and variations, yet
   is intended to be practical enough for use by bridge design engineers.
   Variables in the design model include flange and bearing geometry,
   strand size and placement, effective prestress force, concrete and steel
   material properties, and the effects of steel bearing plates. The model
   is based on strut-and-tie and shear-friction concepts and considers the

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide (GO) based poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene)
   P(VDF-TrFE) (56/44) nanocomposite films were prepared using solution
   casting. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed increase in
   the crystallinity at lower GO content up to 0.3 wt \%, where the 0.3 wt
   \% GO-copolymer showed similar to 13 \% higher crystallinity than the
   pure copolymer under similar annealing conditions. However, at higher GO
   content, the high aspect ratio GO sheets suppress the crystallization of
   the polymer, resulting in 3 \% lower crystallinity than the pure
   copolymer. The dielectric permittivity of the GO-copolymer showed
   improvement, likely due to the interfacial interaction between GO and
   polymer dipoles and also due to the higher crystallinity. At 20 Hz, the
   dielectric permittivity increased from similar to 14.5 for pure
   copolymer to similar to 18 for 0.3 wt \% GO copolymer. Similarly,
   electrical conductivity of the GO-copolymer increased with GO content;
   however, even at the 0.6 wt \% content GO, the copolymer nanocomposites
   did not attain the percolation threshold and displayed an insulative
   behavior like the pure copolymer. The presence of GO improved the
   ferroelectric properties of the copolymer films by increasing the
   remnant polarization from 47 (mC/m(2)) for pure copolymer to 57
   (mC/m(2)) for the 0.3 wt \% GO-copolymer.}},

Abstract = {{Eight wireless accelerometer sensor nodes (Imote2) equipped with energy
   harvesting solar panels were deployed continuously on an operational
   pedestrian footbridge in Singapore for two weeks. Each node periodically
   processed vibration data using a novel embedded data processing
   algorithm, referred to as the Filtered Hilbert-Huang transform, which
   resulted in a data reduction of 96\%. From the processed results which
   the nodes transmitted to the base station, it was possible to conclude
   that resonant response from pedestrian walking excitation led to
   increased vibration levels during peak usage times. The maximum recorded
   peak and RMS acceleration were 52mg and 35mg respectively, which are
   within the limits allowed by several major design guidelines. This
   wireless sensor network deployment demonstrated the potential of
   decentralised, embedded data processing for wireless medium- and
   long-term structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure.}},

Title = {{Reliability based design of driven pile groups using combination of pile
   driving equations and high strain dynamic pile monitoring}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Abstract = {{Reliability based design (e.g., load and resistance factor design -
   LRFD) aims at meeting a maximum permissible probability of failure
   (target reliability) for engineered systems or major elements thereof.
   For deep foundations, such as driven pile groups, statistical parameters
   of the random load and target reliabilities are naturally defined for
   entire pile groups, while pile driving criteria for stopping pile
   advance are required for individual piles. We present an approach using
   dynamic equations (e.g., Gates) and dynamic monitoring (e.g.,
   PDA/CAPWAP) for estimating axial pile resistances. Dynamic equations are
   site-specifically calibrated to dynamic monitoring results from test
   pile programs, for example, and resistance estimates of production piles
   from equations (available at all piles) and monitoring (only available
   at monitored piles) are combined by best linear unbiased estimation
   (BLUE). Resulting resistance estimates and uncertainties of all piles in
   a group are further combined to obtain LRFD resistance factors Phi for
   pile groups as well as explicit pile driving criteria for individual
   piles. An iteration procedure is presented to account for the possible
   presence of previously driven piles in a group. A practical example and
   charts of Phi as a function of the degree of monitoring (percentage of
   piles monitored in a group) are used to demonstrate and discuss results.

   interconnect in chip-package system, the test ICs were ball-bonded on to
   a custom FR-4 board designed for measuring high speed transients.
   Comparison measurements between on-chip and off-chip signals were

Abstract = {{A single turn inductor is fabricated on Tier 2 of a three dimensional IC

   specifications is important because in cases where accuracy is critical,
   for example oscillators, where parasitic elements might hamper the
   sustenance of oscillation which proves hazardous for the design success.
   The goal behind the experiment is to validate the de-embedded inductor

Abstract = {{Mathematical Optimization is an interdisciplinary branch of applied
   mathematics, related to the fields of Operations Research, Computational
   Complexity, and Algorithm Theory. It can be informally defined as the
   science of finding the ``best{''} solution from a set of available
   alternatives, where the notion of ``best{''} is intrinsically related to
   the specific problem addressed. Nowadays, optimization problems arise in
   all sorts of areas and are countless in everyday life, such as in
   engineering, microelectronics, telecommunications, biomedicine,
   genetics, proteomics, economics, finance, and physics. However, in spite
   of the proliferation of optimization algorithms, there is no universal
   method suitable for all optimization problems, and the choice of the
   ``most appropriate method{''} to solve the specific problem is demanded
   to the user. With this in mind, in this chapter we address some general
   questions about optimization problems and their solutions, in order to
   provide a background knowledge of the issues analyzed later.}},

Title = {{Development and comparative evaluation of a stochastic analog method to
   downscale daily GCM precipitation}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4481-4502}},
Abstract = {{There are a number of statistical techniques that downscale coarse
   climate information from general circulation models (GCMs). However,
   many of them do not reproduce the small-scale spatial variability of
   precipitation exhibited by the observed meteorological data, which is an
   important factor for predicting hydrologic response to climatic forcing.
   In this study a new downscaling technique (Bias-Correction and
   Stochastic Analog method; BCSA) was developed to produce stochastic
   realizations of bias-corrected daily GCM precipitation fields that
   preserve both the spatial autocorrelation structure of observed daily
   precipitation sequences and the observed temporal frequency distribution
   of daily rainfall over space.
   We used the BCSA method to downscale 4 different daily GCM precipitation
   predictions from 1961 to 1999 over the state of Florida, and compared
   the skill of the method to results obtained with the commonly used
   bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) approach, a modified
   version of BCSD which reverses the order of spatial disaggregation and
   bias-correction (SDBC), and the bias-correction and constructed analog
   (BCCA) method. Spatial and temporal statistics, transition
   probabilities, wet/dry spell lengths, spatial correlation indices, and
   variograms for wet (June through September) and dry (October through
   May) seasons were calculated for each method.
   Results showed that (1) BCCA underestimated mean daily precipitation for
   both wet and dry seasons while the BCSD, SDBC and BCSA methods
   accurately reproduced these characteristics, (2) the BCSD and BCCA
   methods underestimated temporal variability of daily precipitation and
   thus did not reproduce daily precipitation standard deviations,
   transition probabilities or wet/dry spell lengths as well as the SDBC
   and BCSA methods, and (3) the BCSD, BCCA and SDBC methods underestimated
   spatial variability in daily precipitation resulting in underprediction
   of spatial variance and overprediction of spatial correlation, whereas
   the new stochastic technique (BCSA) replicated observed spatial
   statistics for both the wet and dry seasons. This study underscores the
   need to carefully select a downscaling method that reproduces all
   precipitation characteristics important for the hydrologic system under
   consideration if local hydrologic impacts of climate variability and
   change are going to be reasonably predicted. For low-relief,
   rainfall-dominated watersheds, where reproducing small-scale
   spatiotemporal precipitation variability is important, the BCSA method
   is recommended for use over the BCSD, BCCA, or SDBC methods.}},

Abstract = {{Reconfigurable computing (RC) devices such as field-programmable gate
   arrays (FPGAs) offer significant advantages over fixed-logic, many-core
   CPU and GPU architectures, including increased performance for many
   computationally challenging applications, superior power efficiency, and
   reconfigurability. Difficulties of using FPGAs, however, has limited
   their acceptance in high-performance computing (HPC) and
   high-performance embedded computing (HPEC) applications. These
   difficulties stem from a lack of standards between FPGA platforms and
   the complexities of hardware design, and lead to higher costs and time
   to market over competing technologies. Differences in FPGA platform
   resources such as the type and number of FPGAs, memories and
   interconnects, as well as vendor-specific procedural APIs and hardware
   interfaces, inhibits application portability and code reusability.
   Despite efforts to reduce FPGA application design complexity through
   technologies such as high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, platform support
   and portability remains limited, and is typically left as a challenge
   for application developers. In this paper, we present a novel RC
   Middleware (RCMW), an extensible framework which enables FPGA
   application portability and enhances developer productivity by providing
   an application-centric development environment. Developers focus
   specifically on the optimal resources and interfaces required by their
   application, and RCMW handles the mapping and translation of those
   resources onto a target platform. We demonstrate that RCMW enables
   application portability over three heterogeneous platforms from two
   vendors, using both Xilinx and Altera FPGAs, with less than 10\%
   performance and area overhead for several application kernels, and
   microbenchmarks for the common case. We present the productivity
   benefits of RCMW, showing that RCMW reduces required number of hardware
   and software driver lines of code and total development time with
   respect to native platform deployment methods for several application
   kernels.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded signal-processing applications often require feature tracking
   to identify and track the motion of different objects (features) across
   a sequence of images. Common measures of similarity for real-time usage
   are either based on correlation, mean-squared error, or sum of absolute
   differences, which are not robust enough for safety-critical
   applications. A recent feature-tracking algorithm called C-Flow uses
   correntropy to significantly improve signal-to-noise ratio. In this
   paper, we present an FPGA accelerator for C-Flow that is typically 2-7x
   faster than a GPU and show that the FPGA is the only device capable of
   real-time usage for large features. Furthermore, we show the FPGA
   accelerator is generally more appropriate for embedded usage, with
   energy consumption that is often 1.2-7.9x less than the GPU.}},

Abstract = {{The mean-shift algorithm provides a unique non-parametric and
   unsupervised clustering solution to image segmentation and has a proven
   record of very good performance for a wide variety of input images. It
   is essential to image processing because it provides the initial and
   vital steps to numerous object recognition and tracking applications.
   However, image segmentation using mean-shift clustering is widely
   recognized as one of the most compute-intensive tasks in image
   processing, and suffers from poor scalability with respect to the image
   size (N pixels) and number of iterations (k): O(kN(2)). Our novel
   approach focuses on creating a scalable hardware architecture fine-tuned
   to the computational requirements of the mean-shift clustering
   algorithm. By efficiently parallelizing and mapping the algorithm to
   reconfigurable hardware, we can effectively cluster hundreds of pixels
   independently. Each pixel can benefit from its own dedicated pipeline
   and can move independently of all other pixels towards its respective
   cluster. By using our mean-shift FPGA architecture, we achieve a speedup
   of three orders of magnitude with respect to our software baseline.}},

Abstract = {{In a wireless sensor network, if the sensors are deployed uniformly
   across the network, they experience different traffic intensities,
   thereby, different energy depletion rates depending on their locations.
   Usually, the sensors near the sink tend to deplete their energy sooner;
   when enough of them exhaust their energy, they leave holes in the
   network, causing the remaining nodes to be disconnected from the sink.
   One of the solutions to this energy-hole problem is to deploy the
   sensors non-uniformly. This paper describes a method for deciding the
   sensor deployment densities so as to equalize the energy consumption
   rates of all nodes. The method is general and can be applied to other
   objectives and constraints.}},

   from a transmitter coil to a compact electromechanical receiver over a
   range of distances using low-amplitude, low-frequency magnetic fields. A
   previously reported prototype has demonstrated the feasibility of this

   investigate the efficiency of electrodynamic wireless power transfer
   using a lumped circuit model of the system. From this analysis, we show
   that the efficiency is constrained by the electrodynamic coupling
   strength. Furthermore, increasing the mechanical quality factor of the
   receiver can improve the overall power transfer efficiency of the system
   to a level where this technology becomes a viable option for power

   sum of the stationary queue sizes under the approximate maximum weight
   scheduling (MWS) policy and under the longest-queue-first (LQF) policy
   in one-hop wireless networks. For MWS, our results improves the
   previously provided bounds; for LQF, the results are new. In the
   derivation of the new bounds, a connection with certain graph theory
   quantities has been established. We also derive bounds for the sum of
   the second moments of the stationary queue sizes, which are also bounds
   for the sum of the queue-size variances. The method is general and it
   can be used to derive bounds for the sum of even higher moments of the
   stationary queue sizes. However, for the approximate MWS policy, the
   bounds for the second or higher moments are only valid when the average
   arrival rate vector is confined to a subset of the capacity region that
   depends on the order of the moment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Implantable-grade polyetheretherketone (PEEK-OPTIMA (R)) is a
   high-performance thermoplastic that has been used in implant devices
   such as spinal-fusion cages since its introduction in 1999. Here, a new
   porous PEEK version was investigated.
   Methods: Porous PEEK was fabricated using industrial scale relevant
   methods of compounding with porogen filler, extrusion, and subsequent
   extraction with water at supercritical temperatures and pressures.
   Mechanical properties were assessed according to ISO standards. Marrow
   stromal cells were cultured on porous PEEK samples and in vitro
   cytocompatibility was assessed by total DNA, alkaline phosphatase
   activity, osteopontin, calcium, and cell morphology to indicate stages
   of proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. Compressive
   strength was assessed statically on 21 day cell cultures and
   media-soaked samples and dynamically within a medical device application
   specific context for interbody fusion cages (ASTM F2077).
   Results: Manufacturing resulted in a biomaterial with similar to 50\%
   porosity and a mean pore size of 100 microns. The porous PEEK was found
   to have: tensile strength (14.5MPa), strain at break (3.5\%), impact
   strength (3.6 kJ/m(2)), flexural strength (21.6MPa), and flexural
   modulus (0.8GPa). Production of extracellular mineralized matrix
   occurred very early in the culture period, indicating a preferred
   surface for differentiation. SEM images revealed polygonal cell
   morphology supporting a differentiated osteoblastic-like phenotype. EDS
   analysis detected levels of carbon, phosphorus, and calcium coinciding
   with assay results for the proliferation and differentiation stages.
   Conclusion: Previous observations of cytocompatibility and calcification
   on the PEEK biomaterial could be carried through to this new porous form
   of the PEEK biomaterial. This helps porous PEEK to potentially offer
   more design options for implant devices requiring reduced modulus and/or
   increased tissue ingrowth aspects at the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Impervious surfaces alter hydrology while affecting the chemical balance
   of water resources. Even though historical flooding remains an issue,
   chemistry, loads, and aesthetics are companion concerns. Recently, total
   maximum daily loads have spread across the United States. Additionally,
   Florida has promulgated no net load increases for runoff and
   constituents and now has numeric criteria for nutrients. As trends move
   toward low-impact development and green infrastructure, urban retrofit
   design practice entails hydrologic restoration, reuse, and source
   control. Site redesign can provide a means to manage hydrologic and
   constituent load, with no net increase for long-term loadings. The
   proposed design retrofitted an existing surface parking facility with a
   series of design elements. A biofiltration area reactor was lined with
   clay for management of the water table and denitrification. A linear
   infiltration reactor of cementitious permeable pavement provided
   infiltration and evaporation, filtration, and adsorption. Street
   sweeping provided source control. In addition, load credits have been
   established in Florida for nutrients recovered from street sweeping.
   Continuous simulations with climate and site data indicated that
   redesign could result in no load increase. Estimates demonstrated that
   the cost of redesign was comparable to conventional construction costs
   while incorporating a Florida-friendly landscape. Also, design options
   cost less per nutrient load treated than did conventional Florida best
   management practices.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the propulsive efficiency of underwater vehicles
   which are driven by unsteady propulsors. The analysis is focused on
   vehicles utilizing a novel thruster which expels finite propulsive jets
   periodically. This analysis also applies to swimming squid and jellyfish
   (from which the thruster was inspired), and can be extended to any
   periodic unsteady propulsion. The vehicle trajectory is solved
   analytically to calculate the exact work output/input and it is observed
   that with unbounded forcing there is an optimal thruster duty cycle,
   lambda = 0.31, which maximizes propulsive efficiency. This optimal duty
   cycle is very close to the actual jetting duty cycle observed in
   steadily swimming squid.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a class of nonlinear networked control systems (NCS)
   operating over a shared-channel are considered. For sensor networks and
   networks requiring information collaboration among various devices, the
   objective to reduce contention and use the bandwidth limited network
   resources more efficiently can be achieved by developing ``smart{''}
   sensors. Model-based control and event-based triggering can be fused
   such that smart sensors determine the ``value of information{''} for
   stable operation of control systems. A context-aware feedback policy can
   be developed for a class of nonlinear NCS based on the informational
   value of sensor measurements that minimizes network usage or traffic.
   The developed aperiodic feedback policy guarantees global asymptotic
   tracking of output states of an uncertain system along the desired
   time-varying trajectory. A direct adaptive parameter update law is
   formulated to estimate the uncertain system dynamics that can further
   reduce feedback requirements. A piecewise continuous tracking controller
   is developed and validated using extensive simulation results for
   nonlinear scalar and coupled MIMO systems.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions influence our thoughts, opinions and actions. In
   this paper, social interactions are studied within a group of
   individuals composed of influential social leaders and follower
   groupies. Each person is assumed to maintain a social state, which can
   be an emotional state or an opinion on a social event. Followers update
   their own states based on the states of local neighbors, which are
   considered as reasonable, while the social leaders maintain a desired
   constant state. Social interactions are modeled as a directed graph
   where each directed edge represents an influence from one person to
   another. Motivated by the non-local property of fractional-order
   systems, the social response of individuals in the network are modeled
   by fractional-order dynamics whose states depend on influences from
   local neighbors and past experiences. A decentralized influence method
   is then developed to maintain existing social influence between
   individuals (i.e., without isolating peers in the group), and to
   influence the social group to a common desired state (i.e., within a
   convex hull spanned by social leaders). Mittag-Leffler stability methods
   are used to prove asymptotic stability of the networked fractional-order
   system.}},

Abstract = {{To perform clock synchronization in mobile adhoc networks, nodes need to
   estimate current time of a global clock based on the readings of their
   local clocks along with time-stamped messages from their neighbors. We
   formulate the problem as nodes simultaneously estimating skews and
   offsets of their own clocks with respect to a global clock from noisy
   difference measurements of logarithm of skews and that of offsets. These
   measurements can be obtained by exchanging time stamped messages. A
   leader-following consensus-based algorithm is proposed to estimate these
   parameters in a distributed manner. Ideas from stochastic approximation
   are used to ensure mean square convergence of estimation error under
   certain conditions. A sequence of scheduled update times is used to meet
   the requirement of specific decreasing time-varying gains that need to
   be synchronized across nodes with unsynchronized clocks. Simulations
   indicate that high accuracy of global time estimation can be maintained
   for long time duration with the proposed algorithm. Performance of the
   proposed algorithm is compared through simulations with the virtual
   clock synchronization algorithm ATS {[}1]. It is seen that the proposed
   algorithm is more robust than ATS to measurement noise resulting from
   random delays in message exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral Mixture Analysis is a widely used image analysis tool with many
   applications. Yet, one of the major issues with this technique remains
   the lack of ability to properly account for the spectral variability of
   endmembers or ground cover components that occur throughout an image
   scene. Endmember variability is most often addressed using iterative
   mixture cycles (e.g. MESMA) in which different endmember combination
   models are compared for each pixel. The model with the best fit is
   assigned to the pixel. The drawback of MESMA is the computational burden
   which often hampers the operational use. In an attempt to address this
   issue we proposed a new geometric based methodology to more efficiently
   evaluate different endmember combinations in MESMA. This geometric
   unmixing methodology has a two-fold benefit. First of all, geometric
   unmixing allows a fast and fully constrained unmixing, which was
   previously unfeasible in MESMA due to the long processing times of the
   available fully constrained unmixing methods. Secondly, whereas the
   traditional MESMA explores all different endmember combinations
   separately, and selects the most appropriate combination as a final
   step, our approach selects the best endmember combination prior to
   unmixing, as such increasing the computational efficiency of MESMA. To
   do so, we built upon the equivalence between the reconstruction error in
   least-squares unmixing and spectral angle minimization in geometric
   unmixing. With the inclusion of the proposed endmember combination
   selection technique, the computation time decreased by a factor between
   5 and 8.5, depending on the size and organization of the libraries. The
   spectral angle can as such be used as a proxy for model fit, enabling
   the selection of the proper endmember combination from large spectral
   libraries prior to unmixing.}},

Abstract = {{Though the concepts of magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) were originally
   proposed over 50 years ago, the technique has yet to be successfully
   translated into routine clinical application. Significant challenges
   must be addressed if the field is to progress and realise its potential
   as an option for treatment of diseases such as cancer. These challenges
   include determining the optimum fields and frequencies that maximise the
   effectiveness of MFH without significant detrimental off-target effects
   on healthy tissue, achieving sufficient concentrations of magnetic
   nanoparticles (MNPs) within the target tumour, and developing a better
   mechanistic understanding of MNP-mediated energy deposition and its
   effects on cells and tissue. On the other hand, emerging experimental
   evidence indicates that local thermal effects indeed occur in the
   vicinity of energy-dissipating MNPs. These findings point to the
   opportunity of engineering MNPs for the selective destruction of cells
   and/or intracellular structures without the need for a macroscopic
   tissue temperature rise, in what we here call magnetically mediated
   energy delivery (MagMED).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the scheduling policy for collaborative
   execution in mobile cloud computing. A mobile application is represented
   by a sequence of fine-grained tasks formulating a linear topology, and
   each of them is executed either on the mobile device or offloaded onto
   the cloud side for execution. The design objective is to minimize the
   energy consumed by the mobile device, while meeting a time deadline. We
   formulate this minimum-energy task scheduling problem as a constrained
   shortest path problem on a directed acyclic graph, and adapt the
   canonical ``LARAC{''} algorithm to solving this problem approximately.
   Numerical simulation suggests that a one-climb offloading policy is
   energy efficient for the Markovian stochastic channel, in which at most
   one migration from mobile device to the cloud is taken place for the
   collaborative task execution. Moreover, compared to standalone mobile
   execution and cloud execution, the optimal collaborative execution
   strategy can significantly save the energy consumed on the mobile
   device.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient estimation of tag population in RFID systems has many
   important applications. In this paper, we present a new problem called
   differential cardinality estimation, which tracks the population changes
   in a dynamic RFID system where tags are frequently moved in and out. In
   particular, we want to provide quick estimation on (1) the number of new
   tags that are moved in and (2) the number of old tags that are moved
   out, between any two consecutive scans of the system. We show that the
   traditional cardinality estimators cannot be applied here, and the tag
   identification protocols are too expensive if the estimation needs to be
   performed frequently in order to support real-time monitoring. This
   paper presents the first efficient solution for the problem of
   differential cardinality estimation. The solution is based on a novel
   differential estimation framework, and is named zero differential
   estimator. We show that this estimator can be configured to meet any
   pre-set accuracy requirement, with a probabilistic error bound that can
   be made arbitrarily small.}},

Abstract = {{RFID technology has many applications such as object tracking, automatic
   inventory control, and supply chain management. They can be used to
   identify individual objects or count the population of each type of
   objects in a deployment area, no matter whether the objects are
   passports, retail products, books or even humans. Most existing work
   adopts a ``flat{''} RFID system model and performs functions of
   collecting tag IDs, estimating the number of tags, or detecting the
   missing tags. However, in practice, tags are often attached to objects
   of different groups, which may represent a different product type in a
   warehouse, a different book category in a library, etc. An interesting
   problem, called multigroup threshold-based classification, is to
   determine whether the number of objects in each group is above or below
   a prescribed threshold value. Solving this problem is important for
   inventory tracking applications. If the number of groups is very large,
   it will be inefficient to measure the groups one at a time. The best
   existing solution for multigroup threshold-based classification is based
   on generic group testing, whose design is however geared towards
   detecting a small number of populous groups. Its performance degrades
   quickly when the number of groups above the threshold become large. In
   this paper, we propose a new classification protocol based on logical
   bitmaps. It achieves high efficiency by measuring all groups in a mixed
   fashion. In the meantime, we show that the new method is able to perform
   threshold-based classification with an accuracy that can be pre-set to
   any desirable level, allowing tradeoff between time efficiency and
   accuracy.}},

   design a new technique called filtering vector, which can significantly
   reduce transmission overhead during search process, thereby shortening
   search time. Based on this technique, we propose an iterative tag search

Abstract = {{In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), it is important to understand the
   throughput-delay trade-off (TD trade-off) problem in large-scale
   scenarios. In the literature, the TD trade-off problem has been studied
   extensively and many of them are based on the independent and
   identically distributed (i.i.d.) mobility model, in which each node can
   randomly move to any place in the network, after every time slot.
   Although the i.i.d. model has been widely used, it cannot fully
   represent MANETs in which nodes change positions less frequently. To
   characterize such MANETs, in this paper, we propose a generalized i.i.d.
   (g.i.i.d.) mobility model, in which each node moves once after every 1/f
   (0 < f <= 1) time slots, and remains static between two moves. To
   investigate the TD trade-off under the g.i.i.d. model, we develop a
   novel multi-relay multi-hop (MRMH) scheme that exploits the
   opportunities of multi-hop transmissions when the network is static.
   Furthermore, to enable the multi-hop transmissions, we construct a new
   percolation highway system, which has not been used in the TD trade-off
   analysis for MANETs. Using the proposed MRMH scheme, we develop and
   prove constructive bounds for throughput and delay in MANETs with
   different scales of f. Our constructive bound is asymptotically optimal
   for f = 1 (i.e., the i.i.d. model).}},

Abstract = {{Mobile content dissemination is very useful for many mobile applications
   in delay tolerant networks (DTNs), like instant messaging, file sharing,
   and advertisement dissemination, etc. Recently, social-based approaches,
   which attempt to exploit social behaviors of DTN users to forward
   time-insensitive data, such as family photos and friends' sightseeing
   video clips, have attracted intensive attentions in designing routing
   schemes in DTNs. Most social-based schemes leverage users' contact
   history and social information (e. g., community and friendship) as
   metrics to improve the dissemination performance. In these schemes,
   users need to obtain others' social information to determine their
   dissemination strategy, which apparently compromises others users'
   privacy. Moreover, the owner of mobile contents may only want to
   disclose his/her data to a particular group of users rather than
   revealing it to the public. In this paper, we propose a
   privacy-preserving social-assisted mobile content dissemination scheme
   in DTNs. We apply users' verifiable attributes to establish their
   potential social relationships in terms of identical attributes in a
   privacy-preserving way. Besides, to provide the confidentiality of
   mobile contents, our approach enables users to encrypt contents before
   the dissemination process, and only allows users who have particular
   attributes to decrypt them. By trace-driven simulations and experiments,
   we show the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNA sequences that negatively
   regulate the expression of target genes by posttranscriptional
   repression. miRs are dysregulated in various diseases, including cancer.
   let-7a miR, an antioncogenic miR, is downregulated in lung cancers. Our
   earlier studies demonstrated that let-7a miR inhibits tumor growth in
   malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and could be a potential
   therapeutic against lung cancer. EphA2 (ephrin type-A receptor 2)
   tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in most cancer cells, including MPM and
   non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Ephrin-A1, a specific ligand
   of the EphA2 receptor, inhibits cell proliferation and migration. In
   this study, to enhance the delivery of miR, the miRs were encapsulated
   in the DOTAP (N-{[}1-(2.3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl
   ammonium)/Cholesterol/DSPE
   (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-{[}cyanur(polyethylen
   e glycol)-2000])-PEG (polyethylene glycol)-cyanur liposomal
   nanoparticles (LNP) and ephrin-A1 was conjugated on the surface of LNP
   to target receptor EphA2 on lung cancer cells. The LNP with an average
   diameter of 100 nm showed high stability, low cytotoxicity, and high
   loading efficiency of precursor let-7a miR and ephrin-A1. The ephrin-A1
   conjugated LNP (ephrin-A1-LNP) and let-7a miR encapsulated LNP (miR-LNP)
   showed improved transfection efficiency against MPM and NSCLC. The
   effectiveness of targeted delivery of let-7a miR encapsulated ephrin-A1
   conjugated LNP (miR-ephrin-A1-LNP) was determined on MPM and NSCLC tumor
   growth in vitro. miR-ephrin-A1-LNP significantly increased the delivery
   of let-7a miR in lung cancer cells when compared with free let-7a miR.
   In addition, the expression of target gene Ras was significantly
   repressed following miR-ephrin-A1-LNP treatment. Furthermore, the
   miR-ephrin-A1-LNP complex significantly inhibited MPM and NSCLC
   proliferation, migration, and tumor growth. Our results demonstrate that
   the engineered miR-ephrin-A1-LNP complex is an effective carrier for the
   targeted delivery of small RNA molecules to lung cancer cells. This
   could be a potential therapeutic approach against tumors overexpressing
   the EphA2 receptor.}},

Abstract = {{Broadband powerline communication systems are continuing to gain
   significant market adoption worldwide for applications ranging from high
   speed multimedia to Smart Grid applications. HomePlug AV is the most
   successful high speed PLC protocol and in fact was adopted as a major
   component of the IEEE 1901 standard. This paper provides an overview of
   the unique design choices made in the development of the MAC and PHY
   subsystems of HomePlug AV and describes how these capabilities were
   adapted and augmented for incorporation into the IEEE 1901 Standard. The
   paper also discusses an example of IEEE 1901 used as a Smart Grid
   enabler. The paper then proceeds to explain how HomePlug AV was adapted
   to form the recently released HomePlug Green PHY specification that uses
   robust HomePlug AV communication modes at 10 Mbps for Smart Energy
   applications. Finally the paper shows how HomePlug AV was augmented and
   enhanced to produce HomePlug AV 2.0 using MIMO and other capabilities to
   achieve speeds of up to 1.5 Gbps}},

Abstract = {{Partial reconfiguration (PR) of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)
   enables hardware tasks to time multiplex PR regions (PRRs) by isolating
   reconfiguration to only the reconfigured PRR, which avoids halting the
   entire FPGA's execution. Time multiplexing PRRs requires support for
   unloading/loading tasks and for resuming a task's execution state. In
   order to resume a task's execution state, the execution state (context)
   must be saved when the task is unloaded so that the execution state can
   be restored when the task resumes-context save (CS) and context restore
   (CR), respectively. In this paper, we present a software-based, on-chip
   context save and restore (CSR) for PR-capable FPGAs. As compared to
   prior work, our CSR is autonomous (i.e., does not require any external
   host support), does not require custom on-chip hardware, is portable
   across any system design, and does not require tool flow modifications
   or special tools. Experimental results extensively evaluate the CSR
   execution time based on PRR size, enabling designers to trade off PRR
   granularity for CSR execution time based on application requirements.}},

   technology. In addition, the author modeled a test vehicle on to Android
   Rogers 4350B PCB which is 50 Omega matched in HFSS. The vehicle has two
   patterns; one is a differential microstrip lines pattern which has two
   different lengths of differential pair traces, the other is differential
   microstrip lines with multiple vias. Using the test IC and the vehicle,
   the paper is presented both transient and electromagnetic simulation

Abstract = {{A facile synthesis of 3-6 nm, water dispersible, near-infrared (NIR)
   emitting, quantum dots (QDs) magnetically doped with Fe is presented.
   Doping of alloyed CdTeS nanocrystals with Fe was achieved in situ using
   a simple hydrothermal method. The magnetic quantum dots (MQDs) were
   capped with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) ligands, containing thiol and
   carboxylic acid functional groups to provide stable aqueous dispersion.
   The optical and magnetic properties of the Fe doped MQDs were
   characterized using several techniques. The synthesized MQDs are tuned
   to emit in the vis-NIR (530-738 nm) wavelength regime and have high
   quantum yields (67.5-10\%). NIR emitting (738 nm) MQDs having 5.6
   atomic\% Fe content exhibited saturation magnetization of 85 emu per g
   {[} Fe] at room temperature. Proton transverse relaxivity of the Fe
   doped MQDs (738 nm) at 4.7 T was determined to be 3.6 mM(-1) s(-1). The
   functional evaluation of NIR MQDs has been demonstrated using phantom
   and in vitro studies. These water dispersible, NIR emitting and MR
   contrast producing Fe doped CdTeS MQDs, in an unagglomerated form, have
   the potential to act as multimodal contrast agents for tracking live
   cells.}},

Title = {{Predicting the distribution of potential natural vegetation based on

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{261-271}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Potential natural vegetation (PNV) can provide a
   basic reference in guiding the restoration activities for damaged
   landscapes. Our aim was to find a practicable approach of reconstructing
   PNV based on functional groups (FGs) in species rich and fragmented
   forest region.
   Methods - A total of 149 sample plots (20 x 20 m) were laid and
   investigated systematically by 1 x 1 km or 1 x 2 km grids across the 482
   km(2) forest region in Bawangling nature reserve, Hainan Island, China.
   The 579 woody plant species found were aggregated into eight functional
   groups (FGs) according to successional status and potential maximum
   height. The ecological niche model (MaxEnt) was adopted in predicting
   the potential distribution of the FGs. The relationship between
   occurrence probability of FGs and environmental factors was determined
   as a function of the predicted response curves. The PNV was produced by
   the overlay of maps for the potential distribution of the FGs, while
   referring the FGs interactions.
   Key results - The predicted pioneer FGs scattered widely in the whole
   landscape, while climax FGs mainly distributed in the central and south
   part of the study region. Pioneer FGs could better withstand
   environmental change and occurred in warmer and drier sites, while
   climax FGs are distributed in cooler and wetter conditions. The PNV
   could be reconstructed by considering interactions among the FGs.
   Sixteen main functional patch types were reconstructed in the tropical
   forest landscape, among which twelve were dominated by climax FGs,
   accounting for 72.7\% of the area, and only four were dominated by
   pioneer FGs, and accounting for 18.8\% of the area.
   Conclusion - We produced successful prediction of the observed PNV by
   applying a niche-based model (MaxEnt) based on FGs in fragmented and
   species rich forest region. This is helpful for predicting how PNV will
   change to natural and anthropic stressors.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrochlore ruthenate oxides are promising electrocatalytic materials for
   lower temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC) cathodes due to their
   high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which is
   the major rate-limiting step at reduced temperatures (below 750 degrees
   C). Here we report for the first time highly pure pyrochlore bismuth
   ruthenate (Bi2Ru2O7, BRO7) synthesized via a practical and
   cost-effective glycine-nitrate (GNC) combustion method. The synthesis
   parameters including glycine to nitrate ratio and calcination conditions
   were systematically optimized, resulting in nanoparticles with
   crystallite size of similar to 30 nm and significant reduction in
   synthesis steps. Incorporating the synthesized BRO7 nanoparticles with
   highly conductive bismuth oxide as an SOFC cathode results in
   significant enhancement of ORR, showing 9 times lower SOFC cathode area
   specific resistance, compared to that of BRO7 via conventional
   solid-state reaction. Thus, this result demonstrates the feasibility of
   BRO7 nanoparticles via GNC to enhance the ORR for lower temperature SOFC

Abstract = {{Mechanically enhanced aerogels of graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes

   The CNTs may act as a scaffold in the aerogels to resist compressive

   used in the synthesis. In addition, the aerogels also have excellent
   mechanical properties with elastic modulus between 0.011 and 0.29 MPa.
   Because of their porous structures, the graphene-CNTs aerogels showed

Abstract = {{Due to the popularity and importance of Parallel File Systems (PFSs) in
   modern High Performance Computing (HPC) centers, PFS designs and I/O
   optimizations are active research topics. However, the research process
   is often time-consuming and faces cost and complexity challenges in
   deploying experiments in real HPC systems. This paper describes PFSsim,
   a trace-driven simulator of distributed storage systems that allows the
   evaluation of PFS designs, I/O schedulers, network structures, and
   workloads. PFSsim differentiates itself from related work in that it
   provides a powerful platform featuring a modular design with high
   flexibility in the modeling of subsystems including the network,
   clients, data servers and I/O schedulers. It does so by designing the
   simulator to capture abstractions found in common PFSs. PFSsim also
   exposes script-based interfaces for detailed configurations. Experiments
   and validation against real systems considering sub-modules and the
   entire simulator show that PFSsim is capable of simulating a
   representative PFS (PVFS2) and of modeling different I/O scheduler
   algorithms with good fidelity. In addition, the simulation speed is also
   shown to be acceptable.}},

Title = {{Importance of Insulation at the Bottom of Mass Concrete Placed on Soil
   with High Groundwater}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2342}},
Pages = {{113-120}},
Abstract = {{Frequently, when mass concrete is placed directly on top of a soil
   layer, an insulation layer is not used at the bottom of the concrete.
   The rationale for this practice is that the soil on which the concrete
   is placed is already an insulating material. This study investigated the
   question of whether the absence of an insulating layer between the mass
   concrete and the soil may cause a problem with cracking of the concrete
   at an early age. A three-dimensional finite element model was used for
   this investigation. The typical soil condition in Florida, where the
   groundwater level is high, was considered. The soil layer beneath the
   concrete was modeled to simulate realistic heat transfer between the
   concrete and the soil. To validate the developed model, temperature
   development in a bridge pier footing constructed in the field in Florida
   was compared with the computed temperature distribution from the finite
   element model. The results showed that the temperatures predicted by the
   model closely agreed with those measured in the field. A parametric
   analysis was also conducted to determine the effects of insulation on
   the temperature distribution, induced tensile stresses, and cracking
   risk in the concrete. From the thermal cracking analysis for the
   monitored footing, it is concluded that full insulation with adequate
   thickness (a 63-mm-thick blanket at the top, 63-mm plywood panels at the
   sides, and a 63-mm polystyrene foam board at the bottom) should be used
   to reduce the temperature differentials and prevent early-age cracking
   in concrete.}},

   Aggregate Base Materials in Florida}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2349}},
Pages = {{25-31}},
Abstract = {{The mechanistic empirical pavement design guidelines recommend the use
   of the material modulus in lieu of the structural number for the design
   of pavement base layer thickness. The modulus is nonlinear with respect
   to effective confinement stress, loading strain, and moisture (suction).
   Modulus nonlinearity should be considered for an efficient base layer
   design and analysis. Fixed-free resonant column tests were conducted on
   two base materials used in Florida to characterize shear modulus (G)
   nonlinearity in the strain range of 10(-5)\% to 10(-1)\%, including
   small level strains, under different loading confinements and moisture
   contents. The suction effect on the nonlinear modulus due to drying was
   evaluated, and it was found that the unsaturated modulus was linear at
   strains lower than 10(-5)\% and nonlinear thereafter. In a comparison
   with dry materials, the presence of moisture in unsaturated material
   made it more nonlinear with respect to strain. The suction effect
   increased G in the strain range of 10(-5)\% to 10(-1)\%, with
   significant increases at strain levels below 10(-3)\%. Empirical
   equations were developed to calculate the very small strain modulus
   (G(max)) of dry material. A procedure to calculate an approximate
   G-value at known moisture content, confinement, and strain magnitude was
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the heat transfer to a hydrodynamically developed
   digitzed flow in a microchannel is studied with a specific emphasis on
   the dynamics occuring near the start of a heated region. The
   nondimensional parameters governing the phenomena are identified and the
   relations among them are presented. It is shown that the relevant
   nondimensional parameters are Nu; x/D, L-d/D, Re, and Pr while ignoring
   the air gap between droplets. Currently, Digitized Heat Transfer (DHT)
   is most commonly presented as Nu with respect to x/DReDHPr. This
   approach is reexamined and it is shown that x/DReDHPr is a parameter
   uniquely suited to heat transfer in a continuous flow and not
   appropriate for DHT. Based on two dimensional Cartesian and axisymmetric
   numerical simulations, a new model is proposed where heat transfer rate
   in DHT is presented as Nu root AR/Pe vs x/2L(d) + D where AR = L-d/D is
   the droplet aspect ratio. Using this scaling, the Nu within the first
   circulation length of a translating droplet converges for all AR and Pe
   values greater than 1. Experimental trials are conducted to verify
   trends observed in numerical simulations. It is confirmed that increases
   in P e cause an overall increase in Nu and that the proposed scaling is
   applicable to digitized flows with liquid fractions less than one.
   Furthermore, it is found that the relative size of the gas bubbles
   compared to the liquid droplets can have an effect on local heat
   transfer rate where larger gas bubbles result in a lower Nu.}},

Abstract = {{A yield monitoring system was used to collect yield data from a
   commercial citrus canopy shaker during the 2008 harvesting season. A
   computer algorithm was developed to preprocess the yield data before
   estimating field efficiency (E-f) and field machine index (FMI) measures
   of the mechanical harvesting equipment. Total time of the harvesting
   operation was calculated and divided into primary and support functions,
   which corresponded to the effective harvesting time and machine time
   losses, respectively. Time losses related to row-end turning were
   determined using an algorithm based on linear regression and geometrical
   methods. Each component of the harvesting operation was then expressed
   as a percentage of total field time. It was observed that FMI varied
   from 80\% to 98\% with 4\% standard deviation. Turning time varied from
   3\% to 8\% of the total operational time. Further data analysis showed
   an exponential relationship between FMI and row-end turning time with
   R-2=0.97. It was also observed that the actual travel distance and the
   effective time of operation have linear relationships with the
   theoretical distance of operation with R-2=0.96 and 0.93, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear photomechanics and thermodynamics of azobenzene liquid
   crystal polymer networks is studied to quantify interactions between
   wavelength dependent molecular conformation changes that occur within a
   polymer network. The transfer of energy from light to liquid crystals to
   a polymer network strongly depends on the wavelength and polarization of
   light where trans or rod shaped azobenzene chromophores convert to a cis
   or kinked conformation and simultaneously may relax back to the trans
   state but in a different orientation. This behavior requires an
   understanding of the dynamic interactions between light and azobenzene
   molecules and thermodynamics of light-matter interactions. We
   investigate this behavior by quantifying transmission and absorption of
   electro-magnetic energy with stored energy within the solid material.
   This is conducted by introducing a set of optical order parameters
   coupled to photochemistry that evolve as a function of electromagnetic
   radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites containing high dielectric permittivity ceramics embedded
   in high breakdown strength polymers are currently of considerable
   interest as a solution for the development of high energy density
   capacitors. However, the improvement of dielectric permittivity comes at
   expense of the breakdown strength leading to limit the final energy
   density. Here, an ultra-high energy density nanocomposite was fabricated
   based on high aspect ratio barium strontium titanate nanowires. The
   pyroelectric phase Ba0.2Sr0.8TiO3 was chosen for the nanowires combined
   with quenched PVDF to fabricate high energy density nanocomposite. The
   energy density with 7.5\% Ba0.2Sr0.8TiO3 nanowires reached 14.86 J/cc at
   450 MV/m, which represented a 42.9\% increase in comparison to the PVDF
   with an energy density of 10.4 J/cc at the same electric field. The
   capacitors have 1138\% greater than higher energy density than
   commercial biaxial oriented polypropylene capacitors (1.2 J/cc at 640).
   These results demonstrate that the high aspect ratio nanowires can be
   used to produce nanocomposite capacitors with greater performance than
   the neat polymers thus providing a novel process for the development of
   future pulsed-power capacitors.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle suspension systems are needed in modern tractors to improve ride
   comfort by insulating driver's cabin from road disturbances. Active
   suspension (AS) systems have the potential to improve both ride quality
   and handling vibration performance upon use of feedback to control its
   hydraulic actuator. This gives a capability to the vehicle to
   continuously adjust itself and response to the varying road conditions.
   The main objective of this study was to use a full-state feedback
   approach to design and analysis of AS control system for Kubota M110X
   tractor to eliminate the transmitted vibrations to the driver's cabin
   caused by field roughness. The inputs of the system were determined as
   the control force generated from the hydraulic actuator of the AS and
   the road disturbances caused by holes and uneven surface. A simulation
   model was developed to analyze the behavior of the system to
   disturbances with 0.25 m amplitude. Results are included to show the
   dynamic performance and robustness of the proposed controller in
   dissipating the corresponding disturbance vibrations for a comfort ride

Abstract = {{Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) and concrete containing Reclaimed Asphalt
   Pavement (RAP) as aggregate were evaluated by the Superpave Indirect
   Tensile (IDT) strength test in conjunction of X-ray Computed Tomography
   (CT). Each concrete specimen for Superpave IDT strength test was subject
   to several procedures of preparation: concrete slicing, air drying,
   surface cleaning, gage points mounting, and LVDTs aligning. The concrete
   specimen was administrated a specified load level for ten seconds and
   then unloaded. A pre-sitting load of ten to fifteen pounds was
   constantly applied in order to hold still the concrete specimen. The
   load level was repeated with approximately 10\% increment of peak stress
   (eg., 10\%, 20\%, 30\%...etc.), until when the fracture of concrete
   occurred. The X-ray CT scans were performed: before the load was
   initially applied and after the load was released. It was to identify
   subtle changes in concrete before and after the repeated load levels
   were administrated. An image-processing technique was developed to
   assess the air voids distribution for each load level. The maximum
   variation of air voids measured near the central area of the specimen
   was within +/- 0.3\%. The volume of air voids in the concrete was
   observed to increase significantly when the concrete specimen was loaded
   to fracture. The significance of this study is a better understanding of
   microstructural property in terms of air voids by using X-ray CT to
   assess the microdamage in concrete before fracture.}},

Abstract = {{The necessity for capping carbon emission has significantly restricted
   the potential of modern data centers. For this matter, both industry and
   academia are proactively seeking opportunities on cross-layer power
   management schemes that could open a door for sustainable
   high-performance computing platform. In this paper we investigate an
   emerging trend in the IT industry: using promising onsite distributed
   generation (DG) techniques to provide premium clean energy to the
   computing load.
   We develop data center power demand shaping (PDS), a novel technique
   that allows data centers to utilize onsite green energy efficiently. In
   contrast to prior design, PDS takes advantage of a so-far unexplored
   power supply feature, i.e., the load following capabilities of DG
   systems to avoid the high performance penalty issue incurred during
   supply tracking. In addition, PDS features two adaptive power management
   schemes: DGR Boost and UPS Boost. These two workload-aware optimization
   methods leverage mature computer tuning knobs to achieve attractive data
   center performance improvement. Using real-world data center traces and
   industry data of distributed generation systems, we show that our
   technique can come within 1.2\% performance of an ideal oracle, which is
   roughly a 37\% improvement over existing supply tracking based design.
   Our design could save over 100 metric tons of carbon emissions annually
   for a 10MW data center.}},

Abstract = {{Phase change memory is emerging as a promising candidate for building up
   future energy efficient memory systems. To achieve high-performance and
   energy proportional design, phase change memory devices need to be
   reorganized so that (1) the relatively long latency of phase change
   memory devices should be hidden; (2) unnecessary power waste of phase
   change memory need to be preserved. Previous studies show that
   conventional memory ranks could be broken down into multiple smaller
   ranks for increased concurrency and lower power consumption.
   Nevertheless, the conventional electrical bus is incapable of supporting
   a large number of memory chips due to its insufficient load capacity and
   signal traversing speed. In this paper, we propose a phase change memory
   system design that leverages the state-of-art photonic links to overcome
   this issue. Moreover, thanks to the flexibility of photonic links, it is
   possible to amortize the small-rank penalty (e. g. the rank-to-rank
   switch overhead) by partitioning the channels either statically or
   dynamically. Our experimental results show that photonically
   interconnected phase change memory can increase the system performance
   (IPC) by up to 19\% while saving 35\% memory system power.}},

Abstract = {{Massively parallel computing on throughput computers such as GPUs
   requires myriad memory accesses to register files, on-chip scratchpad,
   caches, and off-chip DRAM. Unlike CPUs, these processors have a large
   register file and on-chip scratchpad memory, which consume a significant
   portion of compute core power (35\%-45\%). In this paper, we introduce
   novel throughput architecture by integrating resistive memory (Spin
   Transfer Torque RAM) inside the compute core, which reduces leakage
   significantly, but introduces write power overhead and longer write
   latencies in GPU shared memory and register file accesses. We enhance
   the compute core by introducing register file organization with
   differential memory update mechanism to remove update redundancy during
   write operations. Furthermore, using merged register-writemechanism and
   write-back buffer, we coalesce multithreaded GPU register write accesses
   to save write energy. In addition, we introduce hybrid shared memory
   design using SRAM and STT-MRAM that provides significant leakage/dynamic
   power savings without affecting performance. On average, across 23
   GPGPU/graphics workloads, our schemes save 46\% dynamic power due to
   register access (83\% leakage power saving) with negligible performance
   degradation. On average, hybrid shared memory provides 10\% reduction in
   dynamic power with maximum 1.6x performance improvement for the current
   workloads at no additional area overhead.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an ac/dc voltage doubler, where the output dc
   voltage is twice the input ac voltage amplitude. Two configurable power
   supply schemes are explored for the voltage doubler in vibrational
   energy harvesting applications. An `input-powered' power supply scheme
   eliminates standby power consumption of the circuit when the harvester
   is not active. Alternatively, a `cross-connected' power supply scheme
   reduces the minimum input voltage without additional circuit cost.
   Implemented in On Semi 3M-2P 0.5 mu m CMOS technology, the circuit is
   first benchtop characterized with a signal generator and then also
   demonstrated with a vibrational energy harvester. A maximum power
   efficiency of 87\% is achieved using the input-powered scheme for a 1.5
   V ac input amplitude and 960 mu W of output power. In the
   cross-connected scheme, the circuit is able to rectify input voltage
   amplitudes as low as 400 mV, below the transistor threshold voltage of

   approaches suffer from low throughput, incompatibility with standard
   microfabrication, and limited crystal structures which greatly hamper
   the mass-production and on-chip integration of practical nanooptical
   devices. In this feature article, we review the recent advances of a
   versatile spin-coating technological platform that enables rapid
   production of wafer-scale colloidal photonic crystals with unusual
   non-close-packed structures and a large variety of periodic metal
   nanostructures with tunable plasmonic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Designed for long propagation delay and frequent channel disruptions,
   delay tolerant networking (DTN) protocols are supporting the latest
   proposed optical space internetworking communication missions. While
   previous DTN-based testbeds experimented with bandwidth capacity in
   megabits, this paper presents a channel emulation testbed that supports
   multiple gigabit-bandwidth Ethernet clients and servers simultaneously.
   In addition to capacity, this testbed modeled optical link properties
   with channel emulation, and provided high flexibility by utilizing
   virtual LANs and link aggregation connected through a gigabit switch.
   The testbed emulated propagation delay, asynchronous channel rates, and
   bit errors, including free-space optical bit errors that varied as a
   function of time. We emulated an optical flight terminal relaying data
   between ground stations, and measured the maximum goodput of various DTN
   configurations while increasing the relay's round trip times. Results
   showed that for a 200 ms to one second round trip time, BP/TCPCL/TCP
   transmitted higher goodput than BP/LTP/UDP, and TCP/IP. For round trip
   times longer than one second, BP/LTP/UDP transmitted higher goodput than
   BP/TCPCL/TCP, and TCP/IP.}},

Abstract = {{Skid-steered robots are commonly used in outdoor applications due to
   their mechanical simplicity, high maneuverability, and robustness. The
   maneuverability of these robots allows them, under ideal conditions
   (e.g., fiat terrain and powerful actuators), to perform turning
   maneuvers ranging from point turns to straight line motion. However
   sloped terrain, terrain with high friction, or actuator torque and power
   limitations can limit the achievable turning radii. This work presents
   the analysis and experimental verification of a dynamic model for
   skid-steered autonomous ground vehicles equipped with non ideal (i.e.,
   torque and power limited) actuators and moving on sloped terrains. The
   experimental results show that the model is able to predict motor
   torques for the full range of turning radii on fiat ground, i.e., from
   point turns to straight line motion. In addition, it is shown that the
   proposed model is able to predict motor torques (including motor
   saturation) and minimum turn radius as a function of terrain slope,
   vehicle heading, terrain parameters and actuator characteristics. This
   makes the model usable for curvilinear motion planning tasks on sloped
   surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the control design and analysis of a nonlinear model
   of a MacPherson suspension system equipped with a magnetorheological
   (MR) damper. The model suspension considered incorporates the kinematics
   of the suspension linkages. A state feedback controller is developed
   using an L-2-gain analysis based on the concept of energy dissipation.
   The controller is effectively a saturated PID. The performance of the
   closed-loop system is compared with a purely passive MacPherson
   suspension system and a semi-active damper, whose damping coefficient is
   tunned by a Skyhook-Acceleration Driven Damping (SH-ADD) method.
   Simulation results show that the developed controller outperforms the
   passive case at the rattle space, tire hop frequencies and the SH-ADD at
   tire hop frequency while showing a close performance to the SH-ADD at
   the rattle space frequency. Time domain simulation results confirm that
   the control strategy satisfies the dissipative constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Store-induced limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) are a common issue on
   current fighter aircraft and are expected to be present on next
   generation fighter aircraft. Current efforts in control systems designed
   to suppress LCO behavior have been either linear and restricted to
   specific flight regimes or nonlinear but require uncertainties in the
   system dynamics to be linear-in-the-parameters and only present in the
   torsional stiffness. Furthermore, the aerodynamic model used in prior
   research efforts neglects any nonlinear effects. This paper presents the
   development of a controller consisting of a continuous RISE feedback
   term with a neural network feedforward term to achieve semi-global
   asymptotic tracking of the wing angle of attack in the presence of
   structural and aerodynamic uncertainties that do not satisfy the
   linear-in-the-parameter assumption.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric materials due to their high electromechanical coupling
   properties are good candidates for energy harvesting applications by
   transforming mechanical energy to electrical power. The piezoelectric
   coupling coefficient of each material is dependent on its operating mode
   and higher coupling coefficient means higher efficiency in energy
   harvesting. In most of the piezoelectric materials, the d(15)
   piezoelectric strain coefficient is the highest coefficient compared to
   the d(33) and d(31) coefficients. However complicated fabrication and
   evaluation of energy harvesting devices operating in the shear mode has
   slow down the research in this area. The shear piezoelectric effect can
   be induced during the steady state response of a thick cantilever
   composite beam due to the effect of shear force through the thickness.
   Here, a model based on the Timoshenko beam theory is developed to
   estimate the electric power output in a cantilever beam with a
   piezoelectric core subjected to the base excitation. The governing
   electromechanical equations as well as the output voltage and power
   frequency responses are derived for the piezoelectric sandwich beam.
   This model is applicable to different geometries and piezoelectric
   compositions in order to design an optimal shear energy harvester. At
   the end, the performance of this type of shear energy harvesters is
   compared to the typical cantilever bimorph energy harvesting beams with
   the same piezoelectric volume.}},

Abstract = {{A synthetic aperture radar system operating in congested frequency bands
   suffers from radio frequency interference (RFI) from narrowband sources.
   When RFI interference is suppressed by frequency notching, gaps are
   introduced into the fast time phase history. This results in a missing
   data spectral estimation problem, where the missing data increases
   sidelobe energy and degrades image quality.
   The adaptive spectral estimation method Iterative Adaptive Approach
   (IAA) has been shown to provide higher resolution and lower sidelobes
   than comparable methods, but at the cost of higher computationally
   complexity. Current fast IAA algorithms reduce the computational
   complexity using Toeplitz/Vandermonde structures, but are not applicable
   for missing data cases because these structures are lost. When the
   number of missing data samples is small, which often is the case in SAR
   with RFI, we use a low rank completion to restore the
   Toeplitz/Vandermonde structures. We show that the computational
   complexity of the proposed algorithm is considerably lower than the
   state-of-the-art and demonstrate the utility on a simulated frequency
   notched SAR imaging problem.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to the decreasing cost of whole-body sensing technology and its
   increasing reliability, there is an increasing interest in, and
   understanding of, the role played by body expressions as a powerful
   affective communication channel. The aim of this survey is to review the
   literature on affective body expression perception and recognition. One
   issue is whether there are universal aspects to affect expression
   perception and recognition models or if they are affected by human
   factors such as culture. Next, we discuss the difference between form
   and movement information as studies have shown that they are governed by
   separate pathways in the brain. We also review psychological studies
   that have investigated bodily configurations to evaluate if specific
   features can be identified that contribute to the recognition of
   specific affective states. The survey then turns to automatic affect
   recognition systems using body expressions as at least one input
   modality. The survey ends by raising open questions on data collecting,
   labeling, modeling, and setting benchmarks for comparing automatic
   recognition systems.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems have been shown to
   have significant performance improvements over their single-input
   multiple-output (SIMO) counterparts. For transmit and receive elements
   that are collocated, the waveform diversity afforded by this radar is
   exploited for performance improvements. These improvements include but
   are not limited to improved target detection, improved parameter
   identifiability and better resolvability. In this paper, we present the
   Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction Radar (SIRE) Ultra-wideband (UWB)
   radar designed by the Army Research Lab (ARL) for landmine and
   improvised explosive device (IED) detection as a 2 by 16 MIMO radar
   (with collocated antennas). Its improvement over its SIMO counterpart in
   terms of beampattern/cross range resolution are discussed and
   demonstrated using simulated data herein. The limitations of this radar
   for Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) suppression are also discussed in
   this paper. A relaxation method (RELAX) combined with averaging of
   multiple realizations of the measured data is presented for RFI
   suppression; results show no noticeable target signature distortion
   after suppression. In this paper, the back-projection (delay and sum)
   data independent method is used for generating SAR images. A side-lobe
   minimization technique called recursive side-lobe minimization (RSM) is
   also discussed for reducing side-lobes in this data independent
   approach. We introduce a data-dependent sparsity based spectral
   estimation technique called Sparse Learning via Iterative Minimization
   (SLIM) as well as a data-dependent CLEAN approach for generating SAR
   images for the SIRE radar. These data-adaptive techniques show
   improvement in side-lobe reduction and resolution for simulated data for
   the SIRE radar.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have recently proposed a widely separated multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) radar using monopulse angle estimation techniques
   for target tracking. The widely separated antennas provide improved
   tracking performance by mitigating complex target radar cross-section
   fades and angle scintillation. An adaptive array is necessary in this
   paradigm because the direct path from any transmitter could act as a
   jammer at a receiver. When the target-free covariance matrix is not
   available, it is critical to include robustness into the adaptive
   beamformer weights. This work explores methods of robust adaptive
   monopulse beamforming techniques for MIMO tracking radar.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in thermoresponsive polymers has steadily grown over many
   decades, and a great deal of work has been dedicated to developing
   temperature sensitive macromolecules that can be crafted into new smart
   materials. However, the overwhelming majority of previously reported
   temperature-responsive polymers are based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
   (PNIPAM), despite the fact that a wide range of other thermoresponsive
   polymers have demonstrated similar promise for the preparation of
   adaptive materials. Herein, we aim to highlight recent results that
   involve thermoresponsive systems that have not yet been as fully
   considered. Many of these (co)polymers represent clear opportunities for
   advancements in emerging biomedical and materials fields due to their
   increased biocompatibility and tuneable response. By highlighting recent
   examples of newly developed thermoresponsive polymer systems, we hope to
   promote the development of new generations of smart materials.}},

Title = {{Estimating the Impacts of Police Enforcement Stops on Freeway Operations
   and Capacity}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2327}},
Pages = {{45-52}},
Abstract = {{Over the years, some police agencies have sought to be good stewards of
   urban traffic flow by reducing their emergency lights while on roadside
   enforcement stops, particularly during peak hours. Over the past decade,
   however, move-over laws that require motorists to slow down or vacate
   the lane adjacent to the stopped emergency vehicle have been implemented
   in every state. As a consequence, the traffic impacts of police
   enforcement stops have shifted from a distraction that might slow
   traffic to a mandate for drivers to change lanes or slow down. From a
   highway capacity standpoint, the enforcement stop can be modeled as a
   theoretical lane-blocking event adjusted for motorists' compliance with
   move-over laws. This research examined 13,416 enforcement stops
   conducted near roadway traffic detectors on Florida freeways and shows
   that police enforcement stops reduced the available capacity by between
   54\% and 58\% on two-lane freeways, 35\% and 41\% on three-lane
   facilities, 23\% and 30\% on four-lane facilities, and 14\% and 22\%
   when five lanes were present. Regression analysis examined factors to
   explain the speed of vehicles passing stops and showed that the number
   of lanes, posted speed limits, and ambient lighting conditions were
   statistically significant factors. Police agencies should therefore
   consider implementing policies in which they use their emergency
   lighting equipment throughout the duration of enforcement stops since
   they improve compliance with move-over laws and, ostensibly, safety.
   Breakdowns were not explicitly modeled and are likely not a
   deterministic measure, so police activity during periods of high traffic
   flow and congestion should be reserved for compelling traffic safety
   needs.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we prepared a porous Si nanoparticle with a pore
   morphology that facilitates the proximal loading and alignment of
   magnetite nanoparticles. We characterized the composite materials using
   superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, dynamic light
   scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and MRI. The in vitro
   cytotoxicity of the composite materials was tested using cell viability
   assays on human liver cancer cells and rat hepatocytes. An in vivo
   analysis using a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Sprague Dawley rat model
   was used to determine the biodistribution properties of the material,
   while naive Sprague Dawley rats were used to determine the
   pharmocokinetic properties of the nanomaterials. The composite material
   reported here demonstrates an injectable nanomaterial that exploits the
   dipolar coupling of superparamagnetic nanoparticles trapped within a
   secondary inorganic matrix to yield significantly enhanced MRI contrast.
   This preparation successfully avoids agglomeration issues that plague
   larger ferromagnetic systems. A Fe3O4:pSi composite formulation
   consisting of 25\% by mass Fe3O4 yields an maximal T2{*} value of 556 mM
   Fe-1 s(-1). No cellular (HepG2 or rat hepatocyte cells) or in vivo (rat)
   toxicity was observed with the formulation, which degrades and is
   eliminated after 4-8 h in vivo. The ability to tailor the magnetic
   properties of such materials may be useful for in vivo imaging, magnetic
   hyperthermia, or drug-delivery applications.}},

Title = {{Intratumoral chemotherapy for lung cancer: re-challenge current targeted
   therapies}},
Journal = {{DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{571-583}},
Abstract = {{Strategies to enhance the already established doublet chemotherapy
   regimen for lung cancer have been investigated for more than 20 years.
   Initially, the concept was to administer chemotherapy drugs locally to
   the tumor site for efficient diffusion through passive transport within
   the tumor. Recent advances have enhanced the diffusion of
   pharmaceuticals through active transport by using pharmaceuticals
   designed to target the genome of tumors. In the present study, five
   patients with non-small cell lung cancer epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR) negative stage IIIa-IV International Union Against
   Cancer 7 (UICC-7), and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2
   scores were administered platinum-based doublet chemotherapy using
   combined intratumoral-regional and intravenous route of administration.
   Cisplatin analogues were injected at 0.5\%-1\% concentration within the
   tumor lesion and proven malignant lymph nodes according to pretreatment
   histological/cytological results and the concentration of systemic
   infusion was decreased to 70\% of a standard protocol. This combined
   intravenous plus intratumoral-regional chemotherapy is used as a first
   line therapy on this short series of patients. To the best of our
   knowledge this is the first report of direct treatment of involved lymph
   nodes with cisplatin by endobronchial ultrasound drug delivery with a
   needle without any adverse effects. The initial overall survival and
   local response are suggestive of a better efficacy compared to
   established doublet cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy in (higher)
   standard concentrations alone according to the UICC 7 database expected
   survival. An extensive search of the literature was performed to gather
   information of previously published literature of intratumoral
   chemo-drug administration and formulation for this treatment modality.
   Our study shows a favorable local response, more than a 50\% reduction,
   for a massive tumor mass after administration of five sessions of
   intratumoral chemotherapy plus two cycles of low-dose intravenous
   chemotherapy according to our protocol. These encouraging results (even
   in very sick ECOG 2 patients with central obstructive non-small cell
   lung cancer having a worse prognosis and quality of life than a
   non-small cell lung cancer in ECOG 0 of the same tumor node metastasis
   {[}TNM]-stage without central obstruction) for a chemotherapy-only
   protocol that differs from conventional cisplatin-based doublet
   chemotherapy by the route, target site, and dose paves the way for
   broader applications of this technique. Finally, future perspectives of
   this treatment and pharmaceutical design for intratumoral administration
   are presented.}},

Abstract = {{With the exception of the CubeSat specification, CubeSat design and
   development approaches have been mostly ad hoc, which has questioned
   their reliability. A systems engineering approach, based on the
   guidelines of NASA's Systems Engineering Handbook has been developed for
   CubeSats to facilitate systematic design, development and address their
   reliability, traceability, and reusability. The CubeSat systems
   engineering approach, developed as a repeatable process, uses a top-down
   design methodology to translate mission definitions into basic building
   blocks, components, interfaces and tasks, that then facilitate a
   bottom-up development and fabrication process. Some of the design tools
   (e.g., N2 diagram) described in NASAs Systems Engineering Handbook are
   utilized early in the design phase to identify potential conflicts in
   the mechanical and electrical interfaces. A novel subsystem level
   flowdown, which transcribes the system level requirements into
   identifiable CubeSat subsystems, (i.e., building blocks) is described.
   Utilizing this approach yields full traceability from mission concept to
   subsystem component to flight software. Additionally, the approach
   facilitates the estimation of the mission overhead in terms of power,
   telemetry, and computation associated with each component, interface,
   and task.}},

Abstract = {{Repositioning patients regularly to prevent pressure ulcers and reduce
   interface pressures is the standard of care, yet prior work has found
   that standard repositioning does not relieve all areas of at-risk tissue
   in nondisabled subjects. To determine whether this holds true for
   high-risk patients, we assessed the effectiveness of routine
   repositioning in relieving at-risk tissue of the perisacral area using
   interface pressure mapping. Bedridden patients at risk for pressure
   ulcer formation (n = 23, Braden score <18) had their perisacral skin-bed
   interface pressures recorded every 30 s while they received routine
   repositioning care for 4-6 h. All participants had specific skin areas
   (206 +/- 182 cm(2)) that exceeded elevated pressure thresholds for >95\%
   of the observation period. Thirteen participants were observed in three
   distinct positions (supine, turned left, turned right), and all had
   specific skin areas (166 +/- 184 cm(2)) that exceeded pressure
   thresholds for >95\% of the observation period. At-risk patients have
   skin areas that are likely always at risk throughout their hospital stay
   despite repositioning. Healthcare providers are unaware of the actual
   tissue-relieving effectiveness (or lack thereof) of their repositioning
   interventions, which may partially explain why pressure ulcer mitigation
   strategies are not always successful. Relieving at-risk tissue is a
   necessary part of pressure ulcer prevention, but the repositioning
   practice itself needs improvement.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{12075-12087}},
Abstract = {{We used temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and
   molecular beam reflectivity measurements to investigate the initial
   dissociation of n-butane isotopologues on PdO(101) and determine kinetic
   parameters governing the selectivity of initial C-H(D) bond cleavage. We
   observe differences in the reactivity of the n-butane isotopologues on
   PdO(101) due to kinetic isotope effects, and find that the initial
   dissociation probability decreases with increasing surface temperature
   for each isotopologue. We performed an analysis of the dissociation
   kinetics using a model that is based on a precursor-mediated mechanism
   for n-butane dissociation and enables quantification of kinetic
   parameters for selective C-H bond cleavage by considering differences in
   the reactivity among the n-butane isotopologues. From the analysis, we
   estimate that 49\% of the n-butane molecules which react during TPRS do
   so through 1 degrees C-H bond cleavage when the initial coverage of
   n-butane lies between similar to 40\% and 100\% of the saturation
   coverage of the molecular precursor state. For dissociation in the limit
   of zero coverage, we estimate that the conditional probability for 1
   degrees C-H bond cleavage is equal to similar to 87\% and varies only
   weakly with surface temperature from 300 K to 400 K. Analysis of the
   temperature dependent rate data further predicts that the barrier for 1
   degrees C-H bond cleavage is 3.5 kJ mol(-1) lower than that for 2
   degrees C-H bond cleavage for n-butane dissociation on PdO(101) in the
   limit of zero coverage. Our results provide evidence that the
   selectivity for 11 C-H bond cleavage on PdO(101) increases as the
   n-butane coverage decreases below similar to 40\% of the saturation
   value. We speculate that intermolecular interactions among the n-butane
   species are responsible for the apparent coverage dependence of the C-H
   bond selectivity for n-butane dissociation on PdO(101).}},

   nanoring-like nanodimples, and binary-void nanodimples, can be
   reproducibly templated over wafer-sized areas by simply controlling the
   conditions during an oxygen plasma etching process. Normal-incidence
   specular reflection measurements show that the resulting gold nanodimple
   arrays exhibit tunable surface plasmon properties. The efficient
   electromagnetic coupling between neighboring nanodimples and inner-outer
   walls of nanoring-like nanodimples leads to high SERS enhancement
   factors (>10(8)). Numerical simulations based on a finite-difference
   time-domain model complement the experimental measurements, showing the
   spatial distribution of electromagnetic ``hot spots{''} surrounding the
   periodic gold nanodimple arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible particles are widely encountered in nature, e.g., stalks of
   plants, fiberglass particles, and ceramic nanofibers. Early studies
   indicated that the deformability of particles has a significant impact
   on the properties of granular materials and fiber suspensions. In this
   study, shear flows of flexible particles are simulated using the
   Discrete Element Method (DEM) to explore the effect of particle
   flexibility on the flow behavior and constitutive laws. A flexible
   particle is formed by connecting a number of constituent spheres in a
   straight line using elastic bonds. The forces/moments due to the normal,
   tangential, bending, and torsional deformation of a bond resist the
   relative movement between two bonded constituent spheres. The bond
   stiffness determines how difficult it is to make a particle deform, and
   the bond damping accounts for the energy dissipation in the particle
   vibration process. The simulation results show that elastically bonded
   particles have smaller coefficients of restitution compared to rigidly
   connected particles, due to the fact that kinetic energy is partially
   converted to potential energy in a contact between flexible particles.
   The coefficient of restitution decreases as the bond stiffness decreases
   and the bond damping coefficient increases. As a result, smaller
   stresses are obtained for granular flows of the flexible particles with
   smaller bond stiffness and larger bond damping coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation is a critical part of integrated circuit design
   methodology. The primary objective is to detect and eliminate the bugs
   that has escaped pre-silicon validation phase. One of the key challenges
   in post-silicon validation is the limited observability of internal
   signals in manufactured chips. Leveraging on-chip buffers addresses this
   issue by storing some of the internal signal states during runtime. A
   promising direction to improve observability is to combine trace and
   scan signals - a small set of trace signals are stored every cycle,
   whereas a large set of scan signals are dumped across multiple cycles.
   Existing techniques are not very effective since they explore a
   coarse-grained combination of trace and scan signals. In this paper, we
   propose a fine-grained architecture that addresses this issue by using
   various scan chains with different dumping periods. We also propose an
   efficient algorithm to select beneficial signals based on this
   architecture. Our experimental results demonstrate that our signal
   selection algorithm can improve restoration ratio up to 91\% (32.3\% on
   average) compared to existing trace only techniques. Our approach also
   shows up to 116\% improvement (54.7\% on average) compared to techniques
   that allows combination of trace and scan signals.}},

Abstract = {{Dual, large (52 m(3)), outdoor chambers were used to investigate the
   effect of aerosol aqueous phase chemistry on the secondary organic
   aerosol (SOA) yields of the photooxidation products of aromatic
   hydrocarbons in the coastal environment. Toluene and
   1,3,5-trimethylbenzene were photochemically oxidised in the presence and
   absence of inorganic seeds (sea salt aerosol (SSA) or NaCl) at low NOx
   conditions. Overall, the presence of SSA, which was shown to contain
   water even at low relative humidities (RHs), led to higher SOA yields
   than the presence of NaCl seeds and the seedless condition. The results
   suggest that SOA yields in the coastal environment will be higher than
   those produced in terrestrial environment. To study the effect of SOA
   formation on the chemical composition of SSA, inorganic species were
   measured using a particle-into-liquid-sampler coupled to an ion
   chromatograph. The hygroscopic properties of the SSA internally mixed
   with SOA were analysed using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer.
   The fresh SSA shows a weak phase transition whereas no clear phase
   transition appeared in the aged SSA. The depletion of Cl- due to the
   accommodation of nitric acid and carboxylic acids on the surface of SSA
   coincides with changes in aerosol hygroscopic properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on mobile multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   underwater acoustic communications (UAC) over double-selective channels
   subject to both intersymbol interference and Doppler scaling effects.
   Temporal resampling is implemented to effectively convert the Doppler
   scaling effects to Doppler frequency shifts. Under the assumption that
   the channels between all the transmitter and receiver pairs experience
   the same Doppler frequency, a variation of the recently proposed
   generalization of the sparse learning via iterative minimization
   (GoSLIM) algorithm, referred to as GoSLIM-V, is employed to estimate the
   frequency modulated acoustic channels. GoSLIM-V is user parameter free
   and is easy to use in practical applications. This paper also considers
   turbo equalization for retrieving the transmitted signal. In particular,
   this paper reviews the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) based
   soft-input soft-output equalizer involved in the turbo equalization
   scheme and adopts a fast implementation of the equalizer that achieves
   negligible detection performance degradation compared to its direct
   implementation counterpart. The effectiveness of the considered MIMO UAC
   scheme is demonstrated using both simulated data and measurements
   recently acquired during the MACE10 in-water experiment.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed surface investigation of the lithium-excess nickel manganese
   layered oxide Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 structure was carried out using X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), total electron yield and transmission
   X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and electron energy loss
   spectroscopy (EELS) during the first two electrochemical cycles. All
   spectroscopy techniques consistently showed the presence of Mn4+ in the
   pristine material and a surprising reduction of Mn at the voltage
   plateau during the first charge. The Mn reduction is accompanied by the
   oxygen loss revealed using EELS. Upon the first discharge, the Mn at the
   surface never fully recovers back to Mn4+. The electrode/electrolyte
   interface of this compound consists of the reduced Mn at the crystalline
   defect-spinel inner layer and an oxidized Mn species simultaneously with
   the presence of a superoxide species in the amorphous outer layer. This
   proposed model signifies that oxygen vacancy formation and lithium
   removal result in electrolyte decomposition and superoxide formation,
   leading to Mn activation/dissolution and surface layer-spinel phase
   transformation. The results also indicate that the role of oxygen is
   complex and significant in contributing to the extra capacity of this
   class of high energy density cathode materials.}},

Title = {{A COARSE-GRAINED ATOMISTIC METHOD FOR 3D DYNAMIC FRACTURE SIMULATION}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR MULTISCALE COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{227-237}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a new coarse-grained (CG) method is presented. The new
   method combines an atomistic formulation of balance equations and a
   modified finite element method. Through three numerical examples, we
   demonstrate that the new method is able to predict the dynamic fracture
   behavior of crystalline materials. First, the stress wave propagation is
   simulated through the CG method and the stress response is found to be
   identical with that of the corresponding atomic-level molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulation. Then, three-dimensional dynamic crack propagation in a
   notched thin film under tension is simulated through both CG and MD
   simulations. Simulation results show that not only the crack propagation
   paths but also the local and average stresses calculated from CG
   simulations agree well with that from the corresponding MD simulations.
   Most importantly, although a large number of degrees of freedoms have
   been eliminated, the CG models capture the atomic-scale phenomenon such
   as the dislocation emission and migration accompanied with the crack
   propagation. In addition, through CG simulations of a plate under impact
   lading, the CG method is demonstrated to be able to simulate both stable
   crack propagation problems and the fragmentations of materials under
   high-strain-rate dynamic loading.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling the two-dimensional (2D) solid phase epitaxial growth (SPEG) of
   amorphized Ge has become important due to the renewed interest in Ge as
   an alternative material to Si in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
   (CMOS) devices. In this work, a 2D SPEG model that uses level set
   techniques as implemented in the Florida object oriented process
   simulator (FLOOPS) to propagate regrowth fronts with variable
   crystallographic orientation patterned material is presented. Apart from
   the inherent orientation dependence of the SPEG velocity, it is
   established that nitride-induced stress can affect mask edge defect
   formation for patterned samples. Data acquired from transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) experiments matches well with simulations,
   thus providing a stable model for simulating 2D regrowth and mask edge
   defect formation in Ge. In comparison to Si, mask edge defect formation
   is less apparent in Ge due to a more isotropic orientation dependence
   for Ge SPEG. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between molecules are probabilistic events. An interaction
   may or may not happen with some probability, depending on a variety of
   factors such as the size, abundance, or proximity of the interacting
   molecules. In this paper, we consider the problem of aligning two
   biological networks. Unlike existing methods, we allow one of the two
   networks to contain probabilistic interactions. Allowing interaction
   probabilities makes the alignment more biologically relevant at the
   expense of explosive growth in the number of alternative topologies that
   may arise from different subsets of interactions that take place. We
   develop a novel method that efficiently and precisely characterizes this
   massive search space. We represent the topological similarity between
   pairs of aligned molecules (i.e., proteins) with the help of random
   variables and compute their expected values. We validate our method
   showing that, without sacrificing the running time performance, it can
   produce novel alignments. Our results also demonstrate that our method
   identifies biologically meaningful mappings under a comprehensive set of
   criteria used in the literature as well as the statistical coherence
   measure that we developed to analyze the statistical significance of the
   similarity of the functions of the aligned protein pairs.}},

Title = {{Numerical Simulations of MREIT Conductivity Imaging for Brain Tumor
   Detection}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is a new
   modality capable of imaging the electrical properties of human body
   using MRI phase information in conjunction with external current
   injection. Recent in vivo animal and human MREIT studies have revealed
   unique conductivity contrasts related to different physiological and
   pathological conditions of tissues or organs. When performing in vivo
   brain imaging, small imaging currents must be injected so as not to
   stimulate peripheral nerves in the skin, while delivery of imaging
   currents to the brain is relatively small due to the skull's low
   conductivity. As a result, injected imaging currents may induce small
   phase signals and the overall low phase SNR in brain tissues. In this
   study, we present numerical simulation results of the use of head MREIT
   for brain tumor detection. We used a realistic three-dimensional head
   model to compute signal levels produced as a consequence of a predicted
   doubling of conductivity occurring within simulated tumorous brain
   tissues. We determined the feasibility of measuring these changes in a
   time acceptable to human subjects by adding realistic noise levels
   measured from a candidate 3 T system. We also reconstructed conductivity
   contrast images, showing that such conductivity differences can be both
   detected and imaged.}},

   respect to their energy dissipation rate in applied alternating magnetic
   fields. The nanoparticles had a hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 70
   +/- 10 nm and were superparamagnetic, with energy dissipation rates in
   the range of 58-175 W g(-1) for an applied field frequency of 233 kHz
   and an applied field amplitude in the range of 20-48 kA m(-1). The
   nanoparticles were stable in a range of pH, at temperatures between 23
   degrees C and 53 degrees C, and in short term storage in water, PBS, and
   culture media. The particles were non-cytotoxic to the immortalized
   human cancer cell lines Hey A8 FDR, A2780, MDA 468, MCF-7 and Caco-2.
   The nanoparticles were readily taken up by Caco-2 cells in a time and
   concentration dependent fashion, and were found to have a
   pharmacokinetic time constant of 47 +/- 3 min. The small size,
   non-cytotoxicity, and efficient energy dissipation of the particles
   could make them useful for biomedical applications such as magnetic

Title = {{Effective Admittivity of Biological Tissues as a Coefficient of Elliptic
   PDE}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The electrical properties of biological tissues can be described by a
   complex tensor comprising a simple expression of the effective
   admittivity. The effective admittivities of biological tissues depend on
   scale, applied frequency, proportions of extra-and intracellular fluids,
   and membrane structures. The effective admittivity spectra of biological
   tissue can be used as a means of characterizing tissue structural
   information relating to the biological cell suspensions, and therefore
   measuring the frequency-dependent effective conductivity is important
   for understanding tissue's physiological conditions and structure.
   Although the concept of effective admittivity has been used widely, it
   seems that its precise definition has been overlooked. We consider how
   we can determine the effective admittivity for a cube-shaped object with
   several different biologically relevant compositions. These precise
   definitions of effective admittivity may suggest the ways of measuring
   it from boundary current and voltage data. As in the homogenization
   theory, the effective admittivity can be computed from pointwise
   admittivity by solving Maxwell equations. We compute the effective
   admittivity of simple models as a function of frequency to obtain
   Maxwell-Wagner interface effects and Debye relaxation starting from
   mathematical formulations. Finally, layer potentials are used to obtain
   the Maxwell-Wagner-Fricke expression for a dilute suspension of ellipses
   and membrane-covered spheres.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of silicon carbide (SIC) inert matrix fuel
   (IMF) pellets fabricated by a low temperature (1050 degrees C) polymer
   precursor route were evaluated at room temperature. The Vickers hardness
   was mainly related to the chemical bonding strength between the
   amorphous SiC phase and the beta-SiC particles. The biaxial fracture
   strength with pre-notch and fracture toughness were found to be mostly
   controlled by the pellet density. The maximum Vickers hardness, biaxial
   fracture strength with pre-notch and fracture toughness achieved were
   5.6 GPa, 201 MPa and 2.9 MPa m(1/2) respectively. These values appear to
   be superior to the reference MOX or UO2 fuels. Excellent thermal shock
   resistance for the fabricated SIC IMF was proven and the values were
   compared to conventional UO2 pellets. XRD studies showed that ceria

Title = {{Multiscale periodicities in aerosol optical depth over India}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aerosols exhibit periodic or cyclic variations depending on natural and
   anthropogenic sources over a region, which can become modulated by
   synoptic meteorological parameters such as winds, rainfall and relative
   humidity, and long-range transport. Information on periodicity and phase
   in aerosol properties assumes significance in prediction as well as
   examining the radiative and climate effects of aerosols including their
   association with changes in cloud properties and rainfall. Periodicity
   in aerosol optical depth, which is a columnar measure of aerosol
   distribution, is determined using continuous wavelet transform over 35
   locations (capitals of states and union territories) in India.
   Continuous wavelet transform is used in the study because continuous
   wavelet transform is better suited to the extraction of the periodic and
   local modulations present in various frequency ranges when compared to
   Fourier transform. Monthly mean aerosol optical depths (AODs) from the
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra
   satellite at 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution from January 2001 to
   December 2012 are used. Annual and quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) in
   AOD are evident in addition to the weak semi-annual (5-6 months) and
   quasi-triennial oscillations (similar to 40 months). The semi-annual and
   annual oscillations are consistent with the seasonal and yearly cycle of
   variations in AODs. The QBO type periodicity in AOD is found to be
   non-stationary while the annual period is stationary. The 40 month
   periodicity indicates the presence of long term correlations in AOD. The
   observed periodicities in MODIS Terra AODs are also evident in the
   ground-based AOD measurements made over Kanpur in the Indo-Gangetic
   Plain. The phase of the periodicity in AOD is stable in the
   mid-frequency range, while local disturbances in the high-frequency
   range and long term changes in the atmospheric composition give rise to
   unstable phases in the low-frequency range. The presence of phase
   relations among different locations reveals that modulations in AOD over
   a location/region can influence aerosol characteristics over other
   locations/regions.}},

Abstract = {{We report efficient ultraviolet (UV)-violet organic light-emitting

   molecules, which can generate tunable emission from 350 nm to 450 nm in
   solution by using different electron donor and acceptor arrangements on
   the heterocycles as reported previously. Here, external quantum
   efficiencies (EQEs) up to eta(EQE) = 1.6\% are achieved for the
   multilayer OLEDs based on purine 2, with UV emission peaked at 393 nm,
   as compared to previously reported purine 1 based OLEDs with eta(EQE) =
   3.1\% and peak emission at 433 nm. The efficiencies of the OLEDs based
   on the two purine molecules are among the highest reported to date with
   emission peak wavelengths below 450 nm. By using a range of charge
   transport and host materials, we show that appropriate energy level
   alignment in multilayer OLED devices is imperative to achieve UV
   emission and prevent undesired emission from other layers or interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Double-diffusive convection (DDC) has been detected in the Martinez and
   Baker channels of central Patagonia (Chile) by employing a Self
   Contained Autonomous Micro-Profiler (SCAMP). This profiler measures
   temperature and salinity in the water column with a vertical resolution
   on the millimetre scale. The expedition took place in December 2011 and
   included 19 vertical high-resolution profiles from surface to similar to
   55 m depth. The formation of thermohaline staircase patterns, resulting
   from the DDC process, could be documented by the micro-profiler's
   measurements. DDC events, below the shallow but strongly stratified
   surface layer (7-10 m), were confirmed to occur in intermediate depths
   between 15 and 45 m by means of the Turner angle. Most of these events
   were usually weak but several strong ones could also be detected between
   15 and 40 m. DDC is initiated at the interface between sub-surface
   waters of estuarine origin (cold and less salty) and intermediate waters
   of oceanic origin (warmer and saltier), with upward heat and salt
   fluxes. DDC together with mixing caused by winds, tides, and internal
   waves, constitute an important mechanism for mixing the water column
   with implications for small organisms therein.}},

Abstract = {{The longevity of total hip arthroplasty (THA) continues to improve with
   advancements in design and bearing materials. However, the incidence of
   dislocation and impingement-related failures continue to rise, with the
   inability of the surgeon to achieve optimal component orientation cited
   as a cause. Computer-assistance has been shown to increase the accuracy
   of component orientation and robotic-assistance has been developed to
   translate this advantage into precise surgical execution. We sought to
   validate a haptically-guided robotic arm system in performing THA with
   the aim of comparing the accuracy of robotic-assisted acetabular cup
   placement to manual placement. We implanted 12 acetabular components in
   6 cadaveric pelvises comparing robotic-assistance on one side with
   manual implantation on the other. We measured planned and actual center
   of rotation (COR), cup position, leg-length equalization and offset for
   each THA using computed tomography and the robotic platform. The
   root-mean-square (RMS) error for the robotic-assisted system was within
   3 degrees for cup placement and within 1mm for leg-length equalization
   and offset when compared to computed tomography. The robotic-assisted
   system was significantly more accurate than manual implantation in
   reproducing the COR and cup orientation, as determined by a preoperative
   plan. The RMS error for manual implantation compared to
   robotic-assistance was 5 times higher for cup inclination and 3.4 times
   higher for cup anteversion (p < 0.01). Robotic-assistance is more
   accurate than manual implantation in achieving optimal cup orientation.
   It has the ability to eliminate human error from THA and should be
   considered in light of THA failures due to component malposition.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of this progress in predicting ductile failure, the development
   of macroscopic yield criteria for describing damage evolution in HCP
   (hexagonal close-packed) materials remains a challenge. HCP materials
   display strength differential effects (i.e., different behavior in
   tension versus compression) in the plastic response due to twinning.
   Cazacu and Stewart {[}1] developed an analytic yield criterion for a
   porous material containing randomly distributed spherical voids in an
   isotropic, incompressible matrix that displays tension-compression
   asymmetry. The matrix material was taken to obey the isotropic form of
   the Cazacu et al. {[}2] yield criterion, which captures the
   tension-compression asymmetry of the matrix material. In this paper,
   finite element calculations of a round tensile bar are conducted with
   the material behavior described by the Cazacu and Stewart {[}1] yield
   criterion. The goal of these calculations is to investigate the effect
   of the tension-compression asymmetry on the necking induced by void
   evolution and propagation.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To demonstrate diffuse optical tomography (DOT) corrected
   fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) for quantitatively imaging
   tumor-targeted contrast agents in a 4T1 mouse mammary tumor model.
   PROCEDURES: In the first set of experiments, we validated our DOT
   corrected FMT method using subcutaneously injected 4T1 cells pre-labeled
   with a near-infrared (NIR) Cy 5.5 dye labeled recombinant amino-terminal
   fragment (ATF) of the receptor binding domain of urokinase plasminogen
   activator (uPA), which binds to uPA receptor (uPAR) that is highly
   expressed in breast cancer tissues. Next, we apply the DOT corrected FMT
   method to quantitatively evaluate the ability of sensitive tumor imaging
   after systemic delivery of new uPAR-targeted optical imaging probes in
   the mice bearing 4T1 mammary tumors. These uPAR-targeted optical imaging
   probes are ATF peptides labeled with a newly developed NIR-830 dye being
   conjugated to magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs).
   RESULTS: Our results have shown that DOT corrected FMT can accurately
   quantify and localize the injected imaging probe labeled 4T1 cells.
   Following systemic delivery of the targeted imaging nanoprobes into the
   mice bearing orthotopic mammary tumors, specific accumulation of the
   imaging probes in the orthotopic mammary tumors was detected in the mice
   that received uPAR targeted NIR-830-ATF-IONP probes but not in the mice
   injected with non-targeted NIR-830-mouse serum albumin (MSA)-IONPs.
   Additionally, DOT corrected FMT also enables the detection of both
   locally recurrent tumor and lung metastasis in the mammary tumor model
   72 hrs after systemic administration of the uPAR-targeted
   NIR-830-labeled ATF peptide imaging probes.
   CONCLUSIONS: DOT corrected FMT and uPAR-targeted optical imaging probes
   have great potential for detection of breast cancer, recurrent tumor and
   metastasis in small animals.}},

Abstract = {{There are many challenges that need to be met before efficient and
   reliable computation at the petascale is possible. Many scientific and
   engineering codes running at the petascale are likely to be memory
   intensive, which makes thrashing a serious problem for many petascale
   applications. One way to overcome this challenge is to use a dynamic
   number of processes, so that the total amount of memory available for
   the computation can be increased on demand. This paper describes
   modifications made to the massively parallel global optimization code
   pVTdirect in order to allow for a dynamic number of processes. In
   particular, the modified version of the code monitors memory use and
   spawns new processes if the amount of available memory is determined to
   be insufficient. The primary design challenges are discussed, and
   performance results are presented and analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Constant-phase-element behavior caused by inhomogeneous water uptake in
   anti-corrosion coatings}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{693-700}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The impedance of a substrate/coating/electrolyte system was calculated
   with the assumptions: (i) the coating uptakes electrolyte to an extent
   that progressively decreases from the coating/electrolyte interface to
   the substrate/coating interface where it becomes negligible; (ii) the
   volume fraction of the electrolyte varies along the coating thickness
   according to a power-law; (iii) the resistivity and permittivity
   profiles of the electrolyte-penetrated coating can be calculated through
   an effective medium theory (EMT) formula corresponding to a parallel
   combination of the two media (electrolyte and coating material); and
   (iv) some pores extend from the coating/electrolyte interface to the
   substrate/coating interface, providing a low resistance path. The
   impedance plots thus calculated exhibited a constant phase element (CPE)
   behavior in a large frequency range. Some experimental results obtained
   with 2024 aluminum alloy/hybrid sol gel coating samples immersed in a
   NaCl solution were analyzed with reference to the above described model.
   The extension of the recently developed power-law CPE model to
   anti-corrosion coatings is shown to yield insight into the distribution
   of resistivity and associated water uptake. Evaluation of mixing rules
   for conductivities and permittivities of the two media (coating and
   electrolyte) showed that the linear combination provided results that
   were consistent with the observed impedance response; whereas,
   distributions resulting from a series combination of the two media, an
   EMT formula proposed in the literature, and the Maxwell approximation
   were incompatible with the observed CPE impedance response. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Cooperative (co-op) advertising is a promotion mechanism widely used by
   manufacturers. In cooperative advertising, a retailer implements local
   advertising and a manufacturer pays a part of the costs. In the
   literature of cooperative (co-op) advertising, the manufacturers often
   act as leaders and are followed by retailers (the manufacturers have the
   greater power than the retailers). According to the recent studies in
   marketing, retailers have increased their power equal or even greater
   than the manufacturers in many industries over the last two decades.
   When both parties in the supply chain have negotiation power, they may
   finally agree to cooperate rather than not to cooperate with each other.
   Therefore, we consider coordination of cooperative advertising between
   one manufacturer and two retailers when their relationships are
   symmetric and they cooperate to increase their profits. We use the
   concepts of group equilibria and cooperative games to find fair
   allocation schemes for dividing the total profit of grand coalition
   among the three members.}},

Pages = {{257-271}},
Abstract = {{Wind pressure fluctuations acting on structures are important for the
   prediction of peak pressure values and for design against fatigue.
   Collection of time histories of pressure fluctuations by traditional
   wind tunnel measurements is time consuming and expensive. To overcome
   this problem, a study on developing a new wind pressure simulation
   technique for domed structures is carried out. A simulation algorithm to
   generate non-Gaussian wind pressure fields using wavelet bases is
   proposed. It presents an efficient, flexible, and easily applied
   stochastic non-Gaussian simulation using a cumulative distribution
   function mapping technique that converges to a desired target power
   spectral density. This method first generates Gaussian sample fields
   using wavelet bases and then maps them into non-Gaussian sample fields
   with the aid of an iterative procedure. Results from this technique are
   presented and compared for domes of different rise-span ratios to
   demonstrate its efficacy. The advantages and limitations of this method
   are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Agricultural Reference Index for Drought (ARID) is a newly designed
   decision support tool to quantify plant water deficit and predict the
   effect of deficit on crop yields. This study explored uncertainties in
   ARID associated with its parameters and the sensitivity of ARID to its
   parameters. Daily values of ARID were computed for five selected
   locations in the southeastern United States using historical weather
   data for a 30-yr period (1971-2000). Uncertainty and sensitivity
   analyses were performed using the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test.
   According to the results, available water capacity was the most
   influential parameter, explaining about 60\% of the total variance in
   ARID, followed by root zone depth, which contributed about 30\% to the
   total variance. Of the five parameters, runoff curve number and drainage
   coefficient had insignificant influence. The effect of the water uptake
   coefficient was negligible in most cases, and this parameter never
   contributed more than 15\% of the total variance. Except for soils with
   large moisture content, ARID had small uncertainties associated with its
   parameters. Even under wet conditions, ARID mostly concentrated around
   its default values, indicating small uncertainties, which were mainly
   due to available water capacity. The type of distribution selected for
   the parameters was found to have significant influence on sensitivity
   and uncertainty. With a shift from uniform to normal distribution,
   uncertainty in ARID decreased by 15 to 50\%. Results indicated that
   although ARID uses a fixed set of parameter values, it is applicable to
   a wide range of crops, soils, topographies, and management and has
   fairly small uncertainties.}},

Title = {{Radiation effects in GaN materials and devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{877-887}},
Abstract = {{This article reviews the effects of radiation damage on GaN materials
   and devices such as light-emitting diodes and high electron mobility
   transistors. Protons, electrons and gamma rays typically produce point
   defects in GaN, in contrast to neutron damage which is dominated by more
   extended disordered regions. Regardless of the type of radiation, the
   electrical conductivity of the GaN is reduced through the introduction
   of trap states with thermal ionization energies deep in the forbidden
   bandgap. An important practical parameter is the carrier removal rate
   for each type of radiation since this determines the dose at which
   device degradation will occur. Many studies have shown that GaN is
   several orders of magnitude more resistant to radiation damage than
   GaAs, i.e. it can withstand radiation doses of at least two orders of
   magnitude higher than those degrading GaAs with a similar doping level.
   Many issues still have to be addressed. Among them are the strong
   asymmetry in carrier removal rates in n- and p-type GaN and interaction
   of radiation defects with Mg acceptors and the poor understanding of
   interaction of radiation defects in doped nitrides with the dislocations
   always present.}},

   are primarily based on applying chemicals in solid, liquid or suspension
   forms. Nanotechnology approaches in food industry can impart properties
   such as resistance to gas penetration, increased tensile strength and
   enhanced absorption of nutrients leading to novel food packaging and
   processing materials. Despite these features, the usage of
   nanotechnology is still limited, owing to the lack of proper toxicity
   evaluation data. Understanding the risks and taking appropriate measures
   to mitigate them will significantly enable nanotechnology advances
   targeting to agriculture and food industries. In this paper, we have
   reviewed some of the recent research and development efforts that have
   been carried out in nanotechnology for its potential applications in
   agrifood sector. More specifically, nanotechnology approaches mediated
   by particle technology advances are reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{The sequential and stochastic assignment problem (SSAP) has wide
   applications in logistics, finance, and health care management, and has
   been well studied in the literature. It assumes that jobs with unknown
   values arrive according to a stochastic process. Upon arrival, a job's
   value is made known and the decision-maker must immediately decide
   whether to accept or reject the job and, if accepted, to assign it to a
   resource for a reward. The objective is to maximize the expected reward
   from the available resources. The optimal assignment policy has a
   threshold structure and can be computed in polynomial time. In reality,
   there exist situations in which the decision-maker may postpone the
   accept/reject decision. In this research, we study the value of
   postponing decisions by allowing a decision-maker to hold a number of
   jobs which may be accepted or rejected later. While maintaining this
   queue of arrivals significantly complicates the analysis, optimal
   threshold policies exist under mild assumptions when the resources are
   homogeneous. We illustrate the benefits of delaying decisions through
   higher profits and lower risk in both cases of homogeneous and
   heterogeneous resources.}},

Abstract = {{Recent architectural trends have focused on increased parallelism via
   multicore processors and increased heterogeneity via accelerator devices
   (e.g., graphics-processing units, field-programmable gate arrays).
   Although these architectures have significant performance and energy
   potential, application designers face many device-specific challenges
   when choosing an appropriate accelerator or when customizing an
   algorithm for an accelerator. To help address this problem, in this
   article we thoroughly evaluate convolution, one of the most common
   operations in digital-signal processing, on multicores,
   graphics-processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays. Whereas
   many previous application studies evaluate a specific usage of an
   application, this article assists designers with design space
   exploration for numerous use cases by analyzing effects of different
   input sizes, different algorithms, and different devices, while also
   determining Pareto-optimal trade-offs between performance and energy.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated infrared thermography (IRT) as a
   nondestructive testing method for FRP systems applied to concrete.
   Twenty-seven small-scale specimens (15 cm x 30 cm) were constructed
   using carbon and glass FRP composites with thicknesses ranging from 1 mm
   to 4 mm. Different wet lay-up procedures were used to saturate dry
   fibers and the level of matrix saturation was also varied (weight
   fractions for fibers ranged from 0.4 to 0.67). Infrared thermography
   inspections were performed by heating samples for 60 s with halogen
   lamps and an existing normalization technique was applied to the
   resulting temperature vs. time history for each pixel in the resulting
   series of thermal images. This method was shown to be effective for
   minimizing the effects of non-uniform heating as well as establishing
   the relative depth of fabricated defects with respect to the
   FRP/concrete interface. The normalized temperature response for
   defect-free regions in each specimen was also shown to be dependent on
   matrix saturation levels, the presence/absence of a thickened epoxy
   tack-coat, and the uniformity of matrix saturation. (C) 2009 Elsevier

   describing the evaluation of full-scale impact damage with respect to
   the structures undamaged state. The replacement of a functionally
   obsolete bridge created a unique opportunity to conduct full-scale barge
   impact tests on the structure before demolition. Repeated impact testing
   was performed on two of the bridge piers. Ultrasonic pulse velocity
   tomography was used to assess the integrity of the structure before and
   after impact. The induced damage, the response of the bridge structure,
   and the viability of using ultrasonic pulse velocity testing for the
   investigation of impact damage in concrete structures were assessed. (C)

Abstract = {{An online adaptive reinforcement learning-based solution is developed
   for the infinite-horizon optimal control problem for continuous-time
   uncertain nonlinear systems. A novel actor-critic-identifier (ACI) is
   proposed to approximate the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation using three
   neural network (NN) structures actor and critic NNs approximate the
   optimal control and the optimal value function, respectively, and a
   robust dynamic neural network identifier asymptotically approximates the
   uncertain system dynamics. An advantage of using the ACI architecture is
   that learning by the actor, critic, and identifier is continuous and
   simultaneous, without requiring knowledge of system drift dynamics.
   Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed using Lyapunov-based adaptive
   control methods. A persistence of excitation condition is required to
   guarantee exponential convergence to a bounded region in the
   neighborhood of the optimal control and uniformly ultimately bounded
   (UUB) stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results
   demonstrate the performance of the actor-critic-identifier method for
   approximate optimal control. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tunable broadband monolithic microwave integrated
   circuit (MMIC) active directional coupler that demonstrates tuned
   coupling gains (from 3 dB to -6 dB) and tuned center frequencies. The
   active directional coupler consists of two broadband near 90 degrees
   phase shifters, two amplifiers between these phase shifters, and
   varactors at the connection nodes of the phase shifters and the
   amplifiers. It was designed and fabricated in a 130-nm process. For a
   3-dB coupling gain, the 10-dB directivity bandwidth is 2.3 GHz (from 5.5
   to 7.8 GHz). The amplitude imbalance is 3 dB +/- 0.5 dB, the phase
   imbalance is 180 degrees +/- 5 degrees, and the noise figure is less
   than 8 dB in the range of 4 to 9 GHz. The return losses are better than
   19 dB and the insertion loss is less than 1.2 dB in the range of 4 to 9
   GHz. The measured IP1 dBs for 3-dB and 0-dB coupling gains at 6.7 GHz
   are 0.3 dBm and 1.8 dBm, respectively. The supply voltage is 1.2 V. The
   measured power consumptions at 3-dB, 0-dB, -3-dB, and -6-dB coupling
   gains are 22 mW, 6 mW, 3 mW, and 1 mW, respectively. The core chip area,
   including two on-chip DC bias inductors, is 470 mu m 250 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a formulation for the fixed charge network flow (FCNF)
   problem subject to multiple uncertain arc failures, which aims to
   provide a robust optimal flow assignment in the sense of restricting
   potential losses using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We show that a
   heuristic algorithm referred to as Adaptive Dynamic Cost Updating
   Procedure (ADCUP) previously developed for the deterministic FCNF
   problem can be extended to the considered problem under uncertainty and
   produce high-quality heuristic solutions for large problem instances.
   The reported computational experiments demonstrate that the described
   procedure can successfully tackle both the uncertainty considerations
   and the large size of the networks. High-quality heuristic solutions for
   problem instances with up to approximately 200,000 arcs have been
   identified in a reasonable time.}},

Abstract = {{InGaN/GaN vertical light emitting diodes (LEDs) with argon (Ar) and

   1360 x 1360 mu m(2) was improved, whose value was comparable or lower to
   that of nonalloyed Cr/Au-based devices. The Al/Ti electrodes resulted in
   improvement in optical output power of LEDs due to their high
   reflectivity (typically 10\%-15\% higher based on our data) compared to
   LEDs with conventional Cr/Au-based electrodes. The x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy showed the increase in Ga-O peak intensity during O-2
   plasma treatment. These results demonstrate that O-2 plasma-treated
   Al/Ti electrodes reduced the contact resistance by forming a thin
   conductive GaOxN1-x layer at n-GaN surface. (C) 2013 American Vacuum

   transistor reliability}},

Abstract = {{AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) with three
   different types of buffer layers, including a GaN/AlGaN composite layer,
   or 1 or 2 mu m GaN thick layers, were fabricated and their reliability
   compared. The HEMTs with the thick GaN buffer layer showed the lowest
   critical voltage (V-cri) during off-state drain step-stress, but this
   was increased by around 50\% and 100\% for devices with the composite
   AlGaN/GaN buffer layers or thinner GaN buffers, respectively. The
   Voff-state for HEMTs with thin GaN and composite buffers were similar to
   100 V, however, this degraded to 50-60V for devices with thick GaN
   buffers due to the difference in peak electric field near the gate edge.
   A similar trend was observed in the isolation breakdown voltage
   measurements, with the highest V-iso achieved based on thin GaN or
   composite buffer designs (600-700 V), while a much smaller V-iso of
   similar to 200V was measured on HEMTs with the thick GaN buffer layers.
   These results demonstrate the strong influence of buffer structure and
   defect density on AlGaN/GaN HEMT performance and reliability. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents a concurrent atomistic-continuum methodology (CAC)
   to simulate the dynamic processes of dislocation nucleation and
   migration as well as crack initiation and propagation in complex
   crystals. The accuracy and efficiency of the method is tested with
   respect to the molecular dynamics (MD) method through simulations of the
   dynamic fracture processes in strontium titanate under a combination of
   tension and shear loading and the dislocation behavior under
   nanoindentation. CAC simulation results demonstrated a smooth passage of
   cracks and dislocations through the atomistic-continuum interface
   without the need for additional constitutive rules or special numerical
   treatment. Although some accuracy is lost in CAC simulations as a
   consequence of a 98.4\% reduction in the degrees of freedom, all the CAC
   results are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable with MD results.
   The stacking fault width and nanoindentation hardness measured in the
   CAC simulations agrees well with existing experimental data. Criteria
   for cleavage and slip in ionic materials are verified. The need to
   include the internal degrees of freedom of atoms in concurrent
   atomistic-continuum methods for polyatomic crystalline materials is
   confirmed. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Postmortem studies of advanced PD have revealed
   disease-related pathology in the thalamus with an apparent predilection
   for specific thalamic nuclei. In the present study, we used DTI to
   investigate in vivo the microstructural integrity of 6 thalamic regions
   in de novo patients with PD relative to healthy controls.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty subjects (20 with early stage untreated PD
   and 20 age- and sex-matched controls) were studied with a
   high-resolution DTI protocol at 3T to investigate the integrity of
   thalamic nuclei projection fibers. Two blinded, independent raters drew
   ROls in the following 6 thalamic regions: AN, VA, VL, DM, VPL/VPM, and
   PU. FA values were then calculated from the projection fibers in each
   region.
   RESULTS: FA values were reduced significantly in the fibers projecting
   from the AN, VA, and DM, but not the VPL/VPM and PU, in the PD group
   compared with the control group. In addition, there was a reduction in
   FA values that approached significance in the VL of patients with PD.
   These findings were consistent across both raters.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides preliminary in vivo evidence of
   thalamic projection fiber degeneration in de novo PD and sheds light on
   the extent of disrupted thalamic circuitry as a result of the disease
   itself.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability-based design, such as LRFD, aims at meeting desired
   probability of failure levels for engineered structures. The present
   work attempts to contribute to this field by analyzing the influence of
   spatially variable soil/rock strength on the axial resistance
   uncertainty of single and multiple shafts in group layouts. This
   includes spatial variability over the individual shaft surfaces, effects
   of limited data, random measurement errors, and workmanship. A possible
   correlation between boring data inside or near the footprint of a
   foundation and the foundation itself is considered. In a geostatistical
   approach, spatial averaging (upscaling) and a degenerate case of
   ordinary kriging are applied to develop variance reduction charts and
   design equations for a series of foundation group layouts (single,
   double, triple, and quadruple). For the potential situation of an
   unknown horizontal correlation range at a site, the worst case scenarios
   are identified and demonstrated in an example problem. Resulting
   probabilities of failure are applied to the whole foundation (i.e.,
   group) rather than single objects. It is found that a boring at the
   center of a group footprint can significantly reduce resistance
   prediction uncertainty, especially under the worst case scenario for
   unknown horizontal correlation range. In contrast, independent of the
   presence of a center boring or not, the uncertainty reduction through
   additional borings becomes small, once four or five borings are
   available. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000728. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Granular media are increasingly utilized for control of phosphorus (P),
   frequently indexed as total P (TP), which represents the sum of
   particulate (PP) and dissolved P (DP) fractions. The fate of PP
   notwithstanding, when such media are deployed for control of DP, the
   mass transfer kinetics from an aqueous matrix to the media is important
   for design and modeling tools. In this paper, the mass transfer of DP
   for a suite of common media are monitored and modeled with a focus on
   comparing the behavior of Al-oxide coated media (AOCM) subjected to
   synthetic and actual runoff (wet weather) as well as wastewater (dry
   weather) matrices. The media employed were AOCM(c) (clay based), AOCM(p)
   (pumice based), and AOCM(pcc) (Portland cement concrete based), and
   their corresponding media (UCM) substrates. A 2nd-order potential
   driving model is utilized for the overall total phosphorus (TP) transfer
   rate from aqueous solution to AOCM, whereas an intramedia diffusion
   model illustrates diffusion rates. In comparison with AOCM forms that
   demonstrate similar and rapid kinetics (lower for AOCM(p)), other media
   exhibited large variability, decreasing in order from Fe-coated perlite,
   activated alumina, expanded shale, and bio-retention media. In contrast,
   Zeolite-perlite-GAC (granular activated carbon) and tire-crumb (Black
   and Gold, B\&G) displayed net adsorption not significantly different
   from 0 (p = 0.05). Comparing synthetic and actual runoff matrices
   demonstrated that actual runoff produced slower kinetics for AOCM(c) and
   AOCM(p), primarily attributable to the presence of competitive ions
   (SO42-), whereas elevated Ca2+ at the alkaline surface of AOCM(pcc)
   offset the effect of SO42- through surface precipitation. DOI:

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{A hydrodynamic separator (HS) is commonly used as a preliminary unit
   operation for separation of coarser particulate matter (PM) and
   PM-associated constituents transported by urban rainfall-runoff.
   Although the small spatial footprint of an HS is advantageous for
   integration into sewer (storm or combined) or drainage systems, the
   small footprint also concentrates flow energy. In many HS units, where
   PM sludge is not isolated or in units that are not maintained (cleaned),
   washout of previously separated PM sludge can result in a net export of
   PM. This study analyzes PM washout from a baffled HS as a function of
   steady-flow rates and particle-size distributions (PSDs) guided by a
   physical modeling framework utilized for scour certification. The HS
   hydraulic signature is determined through velocity measurements and a
   residence time distribution (RTD) analysis. As a function of surface
   overflow rate (SOR), the predeposited PM washout rate ranges from 0.4 to
   13.3 g/min for fine PM (sandy silt, SM <75 mu m), from 0.3 to 4.9 g/min
   for moderately coarser PM (SM II,<100 mu m), and 0.2 to 3.1 g/min for
   coarser PM (SM III,<1000 mu m) as SOR ranges from 47 L/min-m(2) (0.91
   L/s) to 581 L/min-m(2) (11.31 L/s). The washout rate decreases with time
   for each heterodisperse PM gradation, and the evolution of HS washout is
   modeled as a first-order exponential analogous to urban washoff models.
   Washout from the HS is modeled as a function of the densimetric Froude
   number and SOR. Results indicate that washout based on a Shields
   approach cannot be applied to HS units. DOI:

   STC formula, was named Silica-Titania-Coated Packing (STCP). The STCP
   was capable of 90\% oxidation and removal of mercury from a simulated
   flue gas under conditions where other technologies would fail.
   Additionally, a preliminary cost estimate determined that the STCP would
   have much lower average annual costs than two commercial technologies
   that are widely accepted as the best available for this application.

Abstract = {{Numerical experiments were performed to investigate saltwater intrusion
   and recirculation of seawater at a coastal boundary. A field-scale
   two-dimensional cross section was simulated in which freshwater inflow
   occurred at an upgradient boundary, and saltwater inflow, freshwater
   outflow, and recirculated seawater outflow occurred at a downgradient
   boundary. The upgradient boundary is a specified-flux boundary with a
   zero (i.e., freshwater) concentration, and the downgradient boundary is
   a specified-head boundary with a specified (i.e., saltwater)
   concentration. This problem was solved numerically using SEAWAT for two
   conditions; i.e., first for the uncoupled condition in which the fluid
   density is constant, and thus, the flow and transport equations are
   uncoupled in a constant-density flowfield, and then for the coupled
   condition in which the fluid density is a function of the concentration
   of total dissolved solids, and thus, the flow and transport equations
   are coupled in a variable-density flowfield. Equivalent freshwater heads
   are specified at the downstream boundary for both conditions to account
   for density differences between freshwater and saltwater at the
   downstream boundary. For both conditions, it was determined that
   saltwater intrusion and seawater recirculation are decreased
   significantly as the dimensionless ratio of the freshwater inflow
   relative to the density-driven buoyancy flux (a(z)) is increased.
   However, the extent of saltwater intrusion is less and the degree of
   seawater recirculation is greater for the uncoupled condition than for
   the coupled condition at smaller values of a(z), indicating that
   significant differences can occur between uncoupled and coupled
   simulations. For the experiments conducted in this investigation, at
   smaller values of a(z) similar to 0.1, where the density-driven buoyancy
   flux dominates the freshwater advective flux, the extent of saltwater
   intrusion is less and the degree of saltwater recirculation and percent
   of recirculated seawater are greater for the uncoupled condition than
   the coupled condition. At larger values of a(z) similar to 10.0, where
   the freshwater advective flux dominates the buoyancy flux, the extent of
   saltwater intrusion for the uncoupled condition becomes equal to the
   extent of saltwater intrusion for the coupled condition, and the degree
   of saltwater recirculation and percent of recirculated seawater for the
   uncoupled condition asymptotically approach the corresponding values for
   the coupled condition. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000594. (C) 2013

   that this dependence is resulted from different deformation mechanisms,
   i.e., phase transformation, amorphous phase formation, dislocation, and

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{195-202}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are proposed for protection of receiving
   water bodies and aquatic organisms from pesticides in runoff, but there
   is debate regarding the efficiency and filter size requirements. This
   debate is largely due to the belief that no quantitative methodology
   exists for predicting runoff buffer efficiency when conducting acute
   and/or chronic environmental exposure assessments. Previous research has
   proposed a modeling approach that links the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's (EPA's) PRZM/EXAMS with a well-tested process-based
   model for VFS (VFSMOD). In this research, we apply the modeling
   framework to determine (1) the most important input factors for
   quantifying mass reductions of pesticides by VFS in aquatic exposure
   assessments relative to three distinct U.S. EPA scenarios encompassing a
   wide range of conditions; (2) the expected range in percent reductions
   in acute and chronic estimated environmental concentrations (EECs); and
   (3) the differential influence of VFS when conducting acute versus
   chronic exposure assessments. This research utilized three, 30-yr U.S.
   EPA scenarios: Illinois corn, California tomato, and Oregon wheat. A
   global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method identified the most important
   input factors based on discrete uniform probability distributions for
   five input factors: VFS length (VL), organic-carbon sorption coefficient
   (K-oc), half-lives in both water and soil phases, and application
   timing. For percent reductions in acute and chronic EECs, VL and
   application timing were consistently the most important input factors
   independent of EPA scenario. The potential ranges in acute and chronic
   EECs varied as a function of EPA scenario and application timing.
   Reductions in acute EECs were typically less than percent reductions in
   chronic EECs because acute exposure was driven primarily by large
   individual rainfall and runon events. Importantly, generic specification
   of VFS design characteristics equal across scenarios should be avoided.
   The revised pesticide assessment modeling framework offers the ability
   to elucidate the complex and non-linear relationships that can inform
   targeted VFS design specifications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{358-368}},

Abstract = {{Biochar derived from waste biomass is now gaining much attention for its
   function as a biosorbent for environmental remediation. The objective of
   this study was to determine the effectiveness of biochar as a sorbent in
   removing Cd, Cu, and Zn from aqueous solutions.
   Biochar was produced from dairy manure (DM) at two temperatures: 200A
   degrees C and 350A degrees C, referred to as DM200 and DM350,
   respectively. The obtained biochars were then equilibrated with 0-5 mM
   Cu, Zn or Cd in 0.01 M NaNO3 solution for 10 h. The changes in solution
   metal concentrations after sorption were evaluated for sorption capacity
   using isotherm modeling and chemical speciation Visual MINTEQ modeling,
   while the solid was collected for species characterization using
   infrared spectroscopy and X-ray elemental dot mapping techniques.
   The isotherms of Cu, Zn, and Cd sorption by DM200 were better fitted to
   Langmuir model, whereas Freundlich model well described the sorption of
   the three metals by DM350. The DM350 were more effective in sorbing all
   three metals than DM200 with both biochars had the highest affinity for
   Cu, followed by Zn and Cd. The maximum sorption capacities of Cu, Zn,
   and Cd by DM200 were 48.4, 31.6, and 31.9 mg g(-1), respectively, and
   those of Cu, Zn, and Cd by DM350 were 54.4, 32.8, and 51.4 mg g(-1),
   respectively. Sorption of the metals by the biochar was mainly
   attributed to their precipitation with PO (4) (3-) or CO (3) (2-)
   originating in biochar, with less to the surface complexation through
   -OH groups or delocalized pi electrons. At the initial metal
   concentration of 5 mM, 80-100 \% of Cu, Zn, and Cd retention by DM200
   resulted from the precipitation, with less than 20 \% from surface
   adsorption through phenonic -OH complexation. Among the precipitation,
   20-30 \% of the precipitation occurred as metal phosphate and 70-80 \%
   as metal carbonate. For DM350, 75-100 \% of Cu, Zn, and Cd retention
   were due to the precipitation, with less than 25 \% to surface
   adsorption through complexation of heavy metal by phenonic -OH site or
   delocalized pi electrons. Among the precipitation, only less than 10 \%
   of the precipitation was present as metal phosphate and more than 90 \%
   as metal carbonate.
   Results indicated that dairy manure waste can be converted into
   value-added biochar as a sorbent for sorption of heavy metals, and the
   mineral components originated in the biochar play an important role in
   the biochar's high sorption capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to compare the quality of parameter
   estimation from experiments with protein hydrolysis of fish muscle
   carried out following a traditional versus D-optimal design of
   experiments. Traditional design was done from hydrolysis experiments
   using the rapid titration method, from which a large number of data
   points was obtained and made available for parameter estimation.
   D-optimal design is recommended under conditions when it would not be
   possible to use rapid titration with analytical tools. Such conditions
   would make it necessary to reduce the number of samples that would need
   to be taken as well as the error and variance in the estimated
   parameters needed for the kinetic model. Results have shown that
   D-optimal and traditional designs of experiments obtained accurate and
   reliable estimates of kinetic model parameters, with a great difference
   in the number of data points between both types of design: 18 points in
   traditional and 3 points in D-optimal design. Nevertheless, a few number
   of observations in D-optimal design impacted negatively the confidence
   interval because of a low degree of freedom. Confidence intervals
   ranging from 7.8\% to 87\% of the parameters values were obtained with
   D-optimal design method in contrast with traditional design where
   confidence intervals ranged from 6.2\% to 15\% of the parameters values.
   It is estimated that combining the advantages of both types of design
   will result in an optimal experimental design in terms of reliability,
   accuracy, and costs saving of analysis. This would be done by
   determining the number of observations required to achieve an
   appropriate confidence interval (about six or more experimental points)
   and, then, a selection of the best experimental points of a curve of
   hydrolysis by D-optimal design.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that state-dependent, multi-step Lyapunov bounds lead to
   greatly simplified verification theorems for stability for large classes
   of Markov chain models. This is one component of the ``fluid model{''}
   approach to stability of stochastic networks. In this paper we extend
   the general theory to randomized multi-step Lyapunov theory to obtain
   criteria for stability and steady-state performance bounds, such as
   finite moments. These results are applied to a remote stabilization
   problem, in which a controller receives measurements from an erasure
   channel with limited capacity. Based on the general results in the paper
   it is shown that stability of the closed loop system is assured provided
   that the channel capacity is greater than the logarithm of the unstable
   eigenvalue, plus an additional correction term. The existence of a
   finite second moment in steady-state is established under additional
   conditions.}},

   exams: Validation studies of organ doses with physical phantoms}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To validate the accuracy of a Monte Carlo source model of the
   Siemens SOMATOM Sensation 16 CT scanner using organ doses measured in
   physical anthropomorphic phantoms.
   Methods: The x-ray output of the Siemens SOMATOM Sensation 16
   multidetector CT scanner was simulated within the Monte Carlo radiation
   transport code, MCNPX version 2.6. The resulting source model was able
   to perform various simulated axial and helical computed tomographic (
   CT) scans of varying scan parameters, including beam energy, filtration,
   pitch, and beam collimation. Two custom-built anthropomorphic phantoms
   were used to take dose measurements on the CT scanner: an adult male and
   a 9-month-old. The adult male is a physical replica of the University of
   Florida reference adult male hybrid computational phantom, while the
   9-month-old is a replica of the University of Florida Series B
   9-month-old voxel computational phantom. Each phantom underwent a series
   of axial and helical CT scans, during which organ doses were measured
   using fiber-optic coupled plastic scintillator dosimeters developed at
   the University of Florida. The physical setup was reproduced and
   simulated in MCNPX using the CT source model and the computational
   phantoms upon which the anthropomorphic phantoms were constructed.
   Average organ doses were then calculated based upon these MCNPX results.
   Results: For all CT scans, good agreement was seen between measured and
   simulated organ doses. For the adult male, the percent differences were
   within 16\% for axial scans, and within 18\% for helical scans. For the
   9-month-old, the percent differences were all within 15\% for both the
   axial and helical scans. These results are comparable to previously
   published validation studies using GE scanners and commercially
   available anthropomorphic phantoms.
   Conclusions: Overall results of this study show that the Monte Carlo
   source model can be used to accurately and reliably calculate organ
   doses for patients undergoing a variety of axial or helical CT
   examinations on the Siemens SOMATOM Sensation 16 scanner. (C) 2013

Title = {{Survival of tumor and normal cells upon targeting with electronemitting
   radionuclides}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Previous studies have shown that the mean absorbed dose to a
   tissue element may not be a suitable quantity for correlating with the
   biological response of cells in that tissue element. Cell survival can
   depend strongly on the distribution of radioactivity at the cellular and
   multicellular levels. Furthermore, when cellular absorbed doses are
   examined, the cross-dose from neighbor cells can be less radiotoxic than
   the self-dose component. To better understand how the nonuniformity of
   activity among cells can affect the dose response, a computer model of a
   3D tissue culture was previously constructed and showed that activity
   distribution among cells is significantly more relevant than the mean
   absorbed dose for low-energy-electron emitters. The present work greatly
   expands upon those findings.
   Methods: In the present study, we used this same computer model but
   restricted the number of labeled cells to a fraction of the whole cell
   population (50\%, 10\%, and 1\%, respectively). The labeled cells were
   randomly distributed among the whole cell population.
   Results: While the activity distribution is an important factor in
   determining the tissue response for low-energy-electron emitters, the
   fraction of labeled cells has an even more pronounced effect on survival
   response. For all electron energies studied, reducing the percentage of
   cells labeled significantly increases the surviving fraction of the
   whole population.
   Conclusions: This study provides abundant information on killing tumor
   and normal cells under some conditions relevant to targeted radionuclide
   therapy of isolated tumor cells and micrometastases. The percentage of
   cells labeled, activity distribution among the labeled cells, and
   electron energy play key roles in determining their response. Most
   importantly, and not previously demonstrated, lognormal activity
   distributions can have a profound impact on the response of the tumor
   cells even when the radionuclide emits high-energy electrons. (C) 2013

Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{E876-E884}},
Abstract = {{Background: Simulation in medical education provides students with
   opportunities to practice interviews, examinations, and diagnosis
   formulation related to complex conditions without risks to patients.
   Aim: To examine differences between individual and team participation on
   learning outcomes and student perspectives through use of virtual
   patients (VPs) for teaching cranial nerve (CN) evaluation.
   Methods: Fifty-seven medical students were randomly assigned to complete
   simulation exercises either as individuals or as members of three-person
   teams. Students interviewed, examined, and diagnosed VPs with possible
   CN damage in the Neurological Exam Rehearsal Virtual Environment
   (NERVE). Knowledge of CN abnormalities was assessed pre- and
   post-simulation. Student perspectives of system usability were evaluated
   post-simulation.
   Results: An aptitude-treatment interaction (ATI) effect was detected; at
   pre-test scores <= 50\%, students in teams scored higher (83\%) at
   post-test than did students as individuals (62\%, p = 0.02).
   Post-simulation, students in teams reported greater confidence in their
   ability to diagnose CN abnormalities than did students as individuals (p
   = 0.02; mean rating = 4.0/5.0 and 3.4/5.0, respectively).
   Conclusion: The ATI effect allows us to begin defining best practices
   for the integration of VP simulators into the medical curriculum. We are
   persuaded to implement future NERVE exercises with small teams of
   medical students.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of transfer films is a common wear and lubrication
   mechanism of solid lubricants, such as polymers and lamellar solids.
   Material can transfer from a solid lubricant to a counter surface as
   early as the first cycle of sliding, initiating the formation of a
   transfer film, which can persist for the duration of sliding. Surface
   plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to monitor incipient molecular wear of
   a solid lubricant as performed here using a gold coated (50 nm) quartz
   prism in situ during sliding experiments. Surface-enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (SERS) is a complementary technique enabling the analysis
   of ultra-thin transfer films. SPR and SERS experiments confirm that
   polytetrafluoroethylene and graphite transfer readily, with observed
   changes in SPR signal after one cycle of sliding, while
   ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene shows little transfer to the
   gold during sliding in the in situ SPR experiment. This shows the
   feasibility of SPR and SERS as important diagnostic tools for
   tribological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Ocular tear film mucins and lipids promote lubricity of the corneal

   difficult to model and to measure due to the delicate nature of the film
   itself and the conditions under which it exists. This study describes a
   kinetic friction coefficient measured between a glass probe and a living
   mouse eye. A portable custom micro-tribometer was used to prescribe
   sliding motions and record normal and frictional forces. Friction
   coefficient measured over both sliding directions resulted in A mu A =
   0.068 under a pressure of approximately 12 kPa. In vivo measurements may
   enhance the understanding of corneal friction response, as well as
   provide an empirical friction coefficient for more complex mechanical

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A landfill reclamation project was considered to recover landfill
   airspace and soil, reduce future groundwater impacts by removing the
   waste buried in the unlined area, and optimize airspace use at the site.
   A phased approach was utilized to evaluate the technical and economic
   feasibility of the reclamation project; based on the results of these
   evaluations, approximately 6.8 ha of the unlined cells were reclaimed.
   Approximately 371,000 in-place cubic meters of waste was mined from 6.8
   ha in this project. Approximately 230,600 cubic meters of net airspace
   was recovered due to beneficial use of the recovered final cover soil
   and reclaimed soil as intermediate and daily cover soil, respectively,
   for the current landfill operations. This paper presents the
   researchers' landfill reclamation project experience, including a
   summary of activities pertaining to reclamation operations, an
   estimation of reclamation rates achieved during the project, project
   costs and benefits, and estimated composition of the reclaimed

   Nutraceutical Approaches: A Mini-Review}},
Journal = {{GERONTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-31}},
Abstract = {{A variety of consumable plant-derived phytochemicals exhibit
   nutraceutical properties because they produce physiological benefits and
   combat disease processes. Emerging evidence suggests that widely
   accessible and safe organic polyphenolic phytochemicals, in particular,
   treat depression at much lower concentrations than clinical doses of
   classical drugs. Structurally similar polyphenolics such as curcumin,
   resveratrol, and proanthocyanidins exhibit antioxidant and
   immunomodulatory properties and recent research suggests that they also
   modulate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity,
   serotonergic transmission and hippocampal neurogenesis (perhaps via
   their effects on serotonin and HPA activity). These data tempt
   speculation that polyphenolic compounds could also combat age-related
   cognitive decline, which is often accompanied by depression and
   potentially by reduced levels of hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we
   review the relationships between dysregulation of these systems and
   age-related cognitive decline. We then suggest that this group of
   structurally similar polyphenolic compounds may be particularly
   promising therapeutic leads for age-related cognitive decline and
   depression because they modulate these processes. Copyright (c) 2012 S.

Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely accepted method to
   extract brain networks underlying cognitive processes from functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, the application of ICA
   to multi-task fMRI data is limited due to the potential non-independency
   between task-related components. The ICA with projection (ICAp) method
   proposed by our group (Hum Brain Mapp 2009;30:417-31) is demonstrated to
   be able to solve the interactions among task-related components for
   single subject fMRI data. However, it still must be determined if ICAp
   is capable of processing multi-task fMRI data over a group of subjects.
   Moreover, it is unclear whether ICAp can be reliably applied to
   event-related (ER) fMRI data. In this study, we combined the projection
   method with the temporal concatenation method reported by Calhoun (Hum
   Brain Mapp 2008;29:828-38), referred to as group ICAp, to perform the
   group analysis of multi-task fMRI data. Both a human fMRI rest
   data-based simulation and real fMRI experiments, of block design and ER
   design, verified the feasibility and reliability of group ICAp, as well
   as demonstrated that ICAp had the strength to separate 4D multi-task
   fMRI data into multiple brain networks engaged in each cognitive task
   and to adequately find the commonalities and differences among multiple
   tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{89-93}},
Abstract = {{Monolithic reactor concepts are currently intensively discussed in the
   literature. For the oxidative coupling of methane relying on a balance
   of surface and gas phase reactions, such concepts have previously been
   claimed to have beneficial effects with respect to obtainable C-2
   yields. In order to verify the superior performance in the case of a
   foam catalyst, ceria and samaria foams were fabricated by a direct
   foaming process. In both cases, mechanically stable, homogeneous
   open-cell foams were obtained as revealed by 3D magnetic resonance
   imaging, Hg-porosimetry, and scanning electron microscopy. As a
   characteristic feature of the introduced foaming methodology the process
   resulted in bimodal pore size distributions, ensuring low pressure drops
   on the one hand and sufficiently large surface areas on the other hand.
   Oxidative coupling of methane was carried out over the samaria foams. It
   was possible to obtain C-2 yields that were indeed higher than those
   obtained with the samaria powder, in contrast to honeycomb monoliths
   previously studied in the literature.}},

Title = {{On the effect of the matrix tension-compression asymmetry on damage
   evolution in porous plastic solids}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{35-44}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Strength differential effects (different behavior in tension versus
   compression) are observed at the polycrystal level, if either twinning
   or non-Schmid type slip are contributors to plastic deformation at the
   single crystal level. Despite recent progress in modeling the effects of
   this asymmetry on the plastic flow of the fully dense polycrystal,
   modeling the response of such polycrystals in the presence of voids
   remains a challenge. The aim of this paper is to numerically assess the
   influence of the tension-compression asymmetry of the plastic flow in
   the matrix (solid material) on void evolution and the location of the
   zone corresponding to maximum damage in round tensile specimens subject
   to uniaxial tension. It is shown that if the matrix tensile strength is
   higher than its compressive strength, void growth and damage
   distribution are similar to that in classical materials obeying Gurson's
   criterion. On the other hand, for certain porous polycrystals in which
   the matrix tensile strength is lower than its compressive strength, the
   rate of void growth rate is much slower. Damage distribution is
   significantly different, the location of the zone of maximum porosity
   shifts from the center of the specimen outwards. Furthermore, void
   growth is significantly affected by the rate of change of the tension
   compression asymmetry of the matrix with accumulated plastic strain. (C)

Abstract = {{The use of ex vivo-derived scaffolds as vascular conduits has shown to
   be a clinically valid approach to repair or bypass occluded vessels.
   Implantation of allogeneic tissue grafts requires careful processing to
   lower immunogenicity and prevent bacterial infection. However, the
   mechanical/chemical treatments used to prepare biological scaffolds can
   result in significant alterations to the native structure and surface
   chemistry, which can affect in vivo performance. Of particular
   importance for vascular grafts are binding interactions between the
   implanted biomaterial and host cells from the circulation and adjacent
   vasculature. Here we present a comparison of four strategies used to
   decellularize allogeneic human umbilical vein (HUV) scaffolds:
   ethanol/acetone, sodium chloride, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), or
   Triton X-100. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that all four
   techniques achieved removal of native cells from both the lumenal and
   ablumenal surfaces of HUV grafts. Platelets and promyelocytic HL-60
   cells showed preferential binding on the more loosely structured
   ablumenal surface, although low surface coverage was observed overall by
   peripheral blood cells. Vascular endothelial cell adhesion was highest
   on HUV decellularized using ethanol/acetone, and significantly higher
   than on SDS-processed grafts (p = 0.016). Primary cells showed high
   viability on the lumenal surface regardless of decellularization
   technique (over 95\% in all cases). These results demonstrate the
   critical effects of various chemical processing strategies on the
   adhesive properties of ex vivo-derived vascular grafts. Careful
   application-specific consideration is warranted when selecting a
   processing strategy that minimizes innate responses (e.g. thrombosis,
   inflammation) that are often deleterious to graft survival. (C) 2012

   of all possible locations in which a contamination can start and examine
   problems in which we strategically preposition agents. In one problem,
   we minimize the number of agents and prescribe their initial locations,
   so that the graph can be cleaned within a time limit for any potential
   initial contamination. We also determine the best initial locations for
   some predetermined number of agents to minimize expected cleaning time,
   given probability estimates of potential initial contamination
   locations. We analyze the complexity of each variant and formulate the
   problems as mixed-integer programs. As an alternative method, we also
   provide a construction heuristic for the cleaning problem and
   cutting-plane algorithms for the agent location problems. Computational
   results using these approaches demonstrate the efficacy of our
   procedures. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, 2013}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to introduce a novel robust real time system capable of
   rapidly detecting and tracking vehicles in a video stream using a
   monocular vision system. The framework used for this purpose is an
   actively relearned implementation of the Haar-Iike feature based
   Viola-Jones classifier capable of classifying image frame regions as a
   vehicle or non-vehicle. A passively trained supervised system (based on
   Adaboost) is initially built by cascading a set of weak classifiers
   working with Rectangular Haar-like features. An actively learned model
   is then generated from the initial passive classifier by querying
   misclassified instances when the model is evaluated on an independent
   dataset. This classifier is integrated with a Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow
   Tracker and an empirical distance estimation algorithm to evolve the
   system into a complete real-time detection and tracking system. The
   built model is then evaluated extensively on static as well as real
   world data and results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{OpenCL has emerged as the open standard for parallel programming for
   heterogeneous platforms enabling a uniform framework to discover,
   program, and distribute parallel workloads to the diverse set of compute
   units in the hardware. For that reason, there have been efforts
   exploring the advantages of parallelism from the OpenCL framework by
   offloading GPGPU workloads within an HPC cluster environment. In this
   paper, we present an OpenCL-based remote offloading framework designed
   for mobile platforms by shifting the motivation and advantages of using
   the OpenCL framework for the HPC cluster environment into mobile cloud
   computing where OpenCL workloads can be exported from a mobile node to
   the cloud. Furthermore, our offloading framework handles service
   discovery, access control, and data privacy by building the framework on
   top of a social peer-to-peer virtual private network, SocialVPN. We
   developed a prototype implementation and deployed it into local-and
   wide-area environments to evaluate the performance improvement and
   energy implications of the proposed offloading framework. Our results
   show that, depending on the complexity of the workload and the amount of
   data transfer, the proposed architecture can achieve more energy
   efficient performance by offloading than executing locally.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer-level digital cameras typically post-process raw captured image
   data to produce enhanced visually appealing output RGB images.
   Post-processing operations include color gamut compression, tone mapping
   and other non-linear color corrections. However, raw image data is
   needed for many computer vision applications such as photometric stereo,
   shape from shading, and color constancy. Recovering raw image data from
   RGB images is complicated by the high non-linearity of the
   post-processing operations. In this paper, we propose a coupled
   dictionary scheme to model the relationship between the raw and RGB
   color image spaces of consumer cameras. Dictionary learning is
   regularized by sparsity constraints on feature representation. As well,
   we explore a more elaborate variant of coupled dictionary schemes that
   models the feature coupling more accurately. We test the proposed
   dictionary learning schemes on many commercial camera datasets. Our
   experimental results show accurate recovery of raw image data that looks
   visually indistinguishable from the ground truth.}},

   detecting and analyzing fission neutrons produced in a fuel sample by an

   detectors are investigated in this paper for use in a novel fission rate

   a fast response time, and give significant information on incident
   neutron energy allowing for energy cuts to be applied to the detected
   signal. These features are shown in this work to allow for the detection
   of prompt fission neutrons in-situ during active neutron interrogation
   of a U-238 sample. The energy spectrum from three different neutrons
   sources (Cf-252, AmBe, AmLi) is measured using the He-4 detection system

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to present a low-cost methodology for the
   selection of proper pedestrian crossing facility by anticipating
   pedestrian delays at interrupted and uninterrupted flow and to correlate
   the pedestrian delays with level of service based on 6 levels which are
   ranked using the human's perceptions of comfort, safety and
   psychological limitation as well as acceptable delay. This paper focuses
   on the application of statistical distributions to model traffic and
   pedestrian flows. A Monte Carlo technique used to simulate traffic and
   pedestrians, and discusses how to create a tool in order to
   quantitatively rank which pedestrian facility is appropriate for
   particular situation. Initially pedestrian delay can anticipate at an
   unsignalized intersection. If the pedestrian delay is found to be more
   in uninterrupted flow, then signalized facility will be simulated.
   Later, the effect on vehicle delay at signalized intersection will be
   simulated. Finally delay simulation outputs will be used for the
   selection of pedestrian facility either unsignalized crosswalk,
   signalized cross walk or grade separated pedestrian facility. Thus, the
   simulation results gained in this study should be useful for enhancing
   the current assessment of facility. It is also hoped that the developed
   model could be used as a reference source for other Asian cities with
   similar pedestrian and traffic flow characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals
   with the design, construction and maintenance of the physical and
   naturally built environment, including works such as bridges, roads,
   canals, dams and buildings.
   An Introduction to Engineering (EGN 1002) is a one credit course offered
   to all engineering freshmen by the college of engineering at the
   University of Florida. This course introduces students to the eleven
   departments that offer undergraduate degrees. The class breaks students
   into groups of 20 and rotates the groups weekly through each department.
   During the department visit, the students participate in two-or three
   hour hands-on experimental laboratory classes. The truss bridge
   laboratory is a part of this one credit hour course offered to the
   freshmen engineering students by the Civil and Coastal Engineering
   department. The purpose of the laboratory is to familiarize students
   with the concept, theory and practical side of the civil engineering and
   is focused on aiding students in the process of making an informed
   decision for their futures. This paper is focused on procedure of the
   laboratory as well as how the resulted data can be utilized in real-life
   projects. After each team of 4-5 students build their truss, the truss
   is loaded until it fails. Record of the failure load, score, and final
   score were kept and the winner team got a prize of Gator pens. The type
   and the shape of the trusses, location of the failures are kept in a
   data base for analysis. The results showed that Warren truss types are
   stronger and most cost effective. Students enjoyed interacting with
   their team members in building their bridges and learned about civil
   engineering.
   Many international engineering curriculums do not have such a course to
   provide students at freshmen level gaining early knowledge for deciding
   what branches of engineering to take for their future career. The EGN
   1002 provides engineering freshmen with knowledge of various engineering
   disciplines in advanced to help them decide their future study. This
   course also provide multidisciplinary knowledge at early stage of
   engineering education that should have an international engineering
   educational values.}},

   load tuning for sporadic tasks on solar energy powered multicore
   systems. The objective is to frilly utilize the available solar energy
   while meeting the deadlines of tasks.
   To solve the problem, we first perform analysis and formulate the
   scheduling problem in each duration as an integer linear programming
   (ILP) model to obtain an optimal schedule. Then we present a heuristic
   algorithm to dynamically refine the task scheduling based on the
   predictions of the availability of solar energy. We conduct experiments
   using real-world meteorological data across different geographic sites.
   The experimental results show that SolarTune can significantly improve
   the solar energy utilization ratio and reduce the number of deadline
   misses compared to the conventional task scheduler.}},

Abstract = {{A key problem in post-silicon validation is to identify a small set of
   traceable signals that are effective for debug during silicon execution.
   Structural analysis used by traditional signal selection techniques
   leads to poor restoration quality. In contrast, simulation-based
   selection techniques provide superior restorability but incur
   significant computation overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient
   signal selection technique using machine learning to take advantage of
   simulation-based signal selection while significantly reducing the
   simulation overhead. Our approach uses (1) bounded mock simulations to
   generate training vectors set for the machine learning technique, and
   (2) an elimination approach to identify the most profitable signals set.
   Experimental results indicate that our approach can improve
   restorability by up to 63.3\% (17.2\% on average) with a faster or
   comparable runtime.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is defined as the use of an
   electrical stimulus to elicit muscle contractions and is commonly used
   in rehabilitative settings. NMES is also used for assistive purposes to
   create functional movements where it is termed functional electrical
   stimulation (FES). One limitation of NMES/FES is early onset of fatigue
   due to the nonselective, spatially fixed, synchronous activation of
   motor units. Asynchronous stimulation can reduce NMES-induced fatigue;
   however, one limitation of asynchronous stimulation is that switching
   between stimulation channels may introduce discontinuities due to a
   differing response to stimulation by each group of recruited motor
   units. Thus, there is a need to design a controller which considers the
   switching dynamics and muscle response to stimulation during
   asynchronous stimulation. A closed-loop feedback controller is developed
   in this paper to yield semi-global asymptotic tracking of a desired
   trajectory for a person's knee-shank complex during asynchronous
   stimulation. The result is promising for the implementation of
   asynchronous stimulation in assistive devices as a method to reduce
   fatigue while tracking a desired trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{A robust, nonlinear tracking control strategy is presented for an
   aircraft equipped with synthetic jet actuators (SJA). The control law is
   designed to be easily implementable, requiring no observers, function
   approximators, or adaptive laws. By exploiting minimal knowledge of the

   technique is exploited to compensate for the input-multiplicative
   parametric uncertainty inherent in the SJA dynamics. The control law is
   shown to yield global asymptotic trajectory tracking in the presence of
   parametric uncertainty, actuator nonlinearity, and unknown, nonlinear
   external disturbances. A rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis is
   utilized to prove the theoretical result, and numerical simulation
   results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed

Abstract = {{Localization for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is difficult
   because of the lack of adequate light, distinguishable landmarks and
   global positioning system (GPS) radio frequency (RF) signals in undersea
   areas. Due to maneuverability limitations, small AUVs are usually
   susceptible to strong ocean currents. The impacts of ocean flow on
   vehicle motion are usually too large to be considered as disturbances.
   Simulations of large-scale ocean currents are available to track changes
   of the background flow. Fluid-based multi-vehicle path planning
   algorithms have been developed to achieve the feasibility in the
   presence of the background flow and optimized energy consumption. With
   certain information from both simulations and measurements of the
   background flow, the performance of multi-AUV cooperative localization
   can be improved. In this work, a multi-AUV cooperation hierarchy is
   proposed. More capable AUVs with bounded localization errors are used as
   localization references to improve the localization performance of other
   low-cost AUVs. The proposed algorithm is fully distributed and it is
   verified by using a modified extended Kalman filter (MEKF). This paper
   focuses on the outline of the algorithm and its associated matching
   techniques. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on
   simulations in the flow field generated by the N - vortex system.
   Localization errors of low-cost AUVs are all bounded at satisfactory
   levels. The diverging behavior of the pure cooperative localization is
   effectively avoided.}},

Abstract = {{New sources of uncertainty and variability are being introduced into
   modern power grids creating new control challenges. Examples include
   renewable generation from solar and wind generators, electric vehicles,
   etc. In addition, there is compelling value in reducing the peak
   electric power demand as that has a direct beneficial impact of reducing
   the need for new capital investments in overall power sector.
   Introduction of new sensing, communications and computational elements
   offers opportunities for novel control solutions. One promising approach
   to addressing these problems is to exploit the inherent flexibility in
   many types of electric power loads and use that to accommodate the
   inherent variability in renewable generation and/or to reduce the peak
   demand. In this paper, we focus on electric vehicles(EVs) as flexible
   loads in the context of renewable generation. We take an intra-day time
   horizon where we assume we have a good prediction of renewable
   generation. Based on the supply schedule of thermal generators and
   predicted supply of renewable generation, the charging of the electric
   vehicles is controlled to minimize the imbalance between generation and
   consumption using centralized and distributed control algorithms. We
   develop a pricing scheme based on the proportional allocation mechanism
   for the distributed case. Assuming individual loads are price takers, we
   show that there is a time varying price which can be set by the control
   authority such that it's objective aligns with the individual's
   objective. If the users are price anticipators, the corresponding
   situation can be formulated in a game-theoretic setting. Distributed
   algorithms are developed to compute solution in both the cases. We also
   analyze the ``price of anarchy{''} and show that the worst case loss of
   efficiency is 0.25.}},

Abstract = {{A large fraction of energy consumed by the HVAC (heating ventilation and
   air-conditioning) system in a commercial building is consumed at the
   AHUs (air handling units) that condition a mixture of outside and return
   air to specific temperature and humidity levels. Traditionally, the
   return air ratio and temperature of the air leaving the cooling coils in
   the AHU (conditioned air temperature) are maintained at pre-determined
   set points instead of being based on real-time measurements of
   occupancy, zone humidity, and outside weather. In this paper, we
   investigate the potential of energy savings as a function of the
   complexity of control algorithm. The inputs that can be commanded by the
   controllers are: air flow rate, return air ratio, conditioned air
   temperature, and the temperature of air leaving the heating coils in the
   AHU. Simulation results show that the controllers that use the
   measurements of occupancy, zone humidity, and outside weather result in
   significant savings over conventional controllers that do not use such
   measurements, without sacrificing thermal comfort or indoor air quality
   (IAQ). Surprisingly, a simple feedback control scheme is found to
   perform almost as well as a much more complex MPC (model predictive
   control) controller.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable evidence suggests that the lateral line system found in
   most fish and some other aquatic organisms serves an important role in
   many behaviors by providing hydrodynamic information about the
   surrounding fluid. A lateral line inspired pressure feedforward control
   design was proposed by the group; the goal of the research is to improve
   maneuvering accuracy for autonomous underwater vehicles by estimating
   the pressure distribution around the vehicle bodies. In this paper,
   instead of segregating the hydrodynamic forces into added mass and
   damping terms and finding the corresponding coefficients, the forces are
   directly approximated with pressure sensor measurements and passed to
   the controller for improved performance. Simulation tests are presented
   to compare the trajectory tracking performance between the proposed
   feedforward control system and the one developed with traditional
   hydrodynamic modeling process. Experimental tests are conducted to
   verify the force estimation algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In deterministic systems, reinforcement learning-based online
   approximate optimal control methods typically require a restrictive
   persistence of excitation (PE) condition for convergence. This paper
   presents a concurrent learning-based solution to the online approximate
   optimal regulation problem that eliminates the need for PE. The
   development is based on the observation that given a model of the
   system, the Bellman error, which quantifies the deviation of the system
   Hamiltonian from the optimal Hamiltonian, can be evaluated at any point
   in the state space. Further, a concurrent learning-based parameter
   identifier is developed to compensate for parametric uncertainty in the
   plant dynamics. Uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence of the
   system states to the origin, and UUB convergence of the developed policy
   to an approximate optimal policy are established using a Lyapunov-based
   analysis, and simulations are performed to demonstrate the performance
   of the developed controller.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on queue-length-based randomized link scheduling
   algorithms have shown their throughput-optimality. But simulation
   results indicate that the packet delay in such algorithms can be quite
   large, even when the traffic intensity is low compared with the network
   capacity. The reason can be traced to the fact that these algorithms
   need the queues to be sufficiently large before the links have a good
   chance to be activated for transmission. In this paper, we propose a new
   randomized scheduling algorithm based on the Ising model in physics. The
   algorithm does not require queue build-up for link activation and can
   thus give better delay performance. It is easily implementable in a
   distributed fashion and it retains throughput-optimality.}},

Abstract = {{Location-based Services (LBSs) enable mobile users to request and obtain
   certain services based on their current locations, such as finding
   nearby gas station, looking for coffee shops, and using online GPS
   navigation, etc. As a major branch of LBSs, geosocial networking
   services, such as Foursquare, become popular due to the explosive growth
   of smartphone users. Geosocial networking services allow people to use
   their location information to find potential friends who have similar
   interests within close proximity and initiate communications with each
   other. However, most existing geosocial networking services ask for
   mobile users' current location information and store it on an untrusted
   server with less privacy concerns. To some extent, mobile users need to
   reveal their interests and physical location information to a service
   provider in order to realize the functionality of geosocial networking,
   which apparently deteriorates users' privacy on the aspects of their
   profiles and locations. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving
   friend search scheme in geosocial networks without relying on a trusted
   centralized server. Our scheme lets localization infrastructures, such
   as base stations, create encrypted searchable tables on an untrusted
   server and allow mobile users to search for their possible friends using
   their profiles without exposing their location information. Extensive
   trace-driven simulation results and analysis show both the efficiency
   and privacy preservation of our proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to obtain the channel conditions (if exist)
   under which substitution attacks performed by relay node(s) in a relay
   network can be detected. The network model considered consists of a
   source node and a destination node. There are two independent
   transmission paths from the source to the destination, each via a
   potentially malicious relay which may perform substitution attacks by
   forwarding altered symbols to the destination. The destination attempts
   to detect any such malicious act of the relays by comparing the joint
   empirical distribution of the symbols received from the relays with
   known channel statistics along the two paths. Note that every symbol
   received by the destination may be altered, and hence no clean reference
   observation is available to the node. It is demonstrated that
   maliciousness of the relays can be asymptotically detected with
   sufficient channel observations if and only if the two relays do not
   collude and the network satisfies a non-manipulability condition.}},

Abstract = {{We study the influence maximization problem (IMP) in multiple online
   social networks (OSNs). In contrast to most of the previous works on
   influence maximization which only focused on a single network, our work
   is the first one to evaluate the propagation of influence across
   multiple networks simultaneously.
   In this paper, we first propose a general representation for multiple
   networks using universal ids for the users. We next introduce a powerful
   coupling scheme which reduces the multiple networks into a single
   network without changing influencing properties, thereby allowing us to
   solve the problem in the reduced network. Moreover, the coupling scheme
   is also an efficient tool to investigate various aspects of the
   influence propagation on multiple OSNs. The extensive experiments on
   real-world and synthesized datasets not only confirm the quality of the
   solution but also reveal interesting insights into the behavior of
   influence propagation in and across the networks.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) use ``store-carry-forward{''}
   paradigm to pass the message between the nodes that meet occasionally
   which results in intermittent connectivity. Once the message meets the
   destination, the network initiates the so called ``infection recovery
   process{''} in order to remove the delivered messages from the rest of
   the nodes. This process starts as soon as the message reaches the first
   destination which, in the case of multicast sessions, may reduce the
   chances that the other destination nodes receive the message. In this
   paper, we present an analytical framework to study the performance of
   different infection recovery schemes for multicast DTN. New adaptive
   recovery schemes are developed where the recovery probability is
   adjusted to the multicast traffic. The performance of these new
   algorithms is compared to a number of unicast recovery schemes modified
   for multicast DTN, which also represents a contribution of this paper.
   Our analytical framework can be easily extended to model the recovery
   process for different multicast routing schemes. Numerical results show
   that by adaptive immune, immune\_TX and vaccine schemes the delivery
   delay can be reduced up to 75\% compared to the conventional schemes. By
   timeout recovery scheme, when applied to multicast session, the
   reduction in the delivery delay can reach up to 90\% at the expense of
   larger recovery delay.}},

Abstract = {{Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are characterized by sparse node density,
   uncertain node mobility and lack of global information, which make
   routing one of the most challenging problems. In this paper, we propose
   a new routing protocol for DTNs. We observe that the forwarding
   performance of a node is not only determined by its contact schedules
   with the destination but also affected by its contacts with the neighbor
   where the packet is received from, which has not been considered in most
   of existing routing schemes in DTNs. Based on this observation, we
   design a novel routing metric, called Instant Delivery Probability
   (IDP), which provides an accurate estimation on node forwarding
   performance in terms of packet delivery ratio and can be efficiently
   calculated with local information. The single-copy and multi-copy
   forwarding algorithms are also presented, where each message is
   opportunistically forwarded to the nodes with largest IDP to maximize
   the delivery probability. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that
   our routing protocol with IDP significantly improves the routing
   performance compared to the state-of-the-art forwarding strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile users have become increasingly addicted to multimedia
   applications which are extremely downlink-intensive. We observed that
   conventional objectives, like rate adaptive and margin adaptive, adopted
   for radio resource allocation may lead to unnecessary energy consumption
   of mobile devices, which is adverse to the development of mobile
   multimedia applications. This paper presents an alternative objective,
   called energy adaptive, and formulates the energy-efficient downlink
   resource allocation problem. The objective is to minimize the total
   energy consumption of mobile devices for data reception while satisfying
   users' data rate requirements and base station's available transmit
   power. We prove that the target problem is NP-hard and propose an
   efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. The results of
   simulations conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm
   agree with our observation on the conventional objectives, as well as
   providing some useful insights into the design of energy-efficient

   In the possible presence of misbehaving nodes, who make harmful

   the mechanism for expansion is an introduction-based reputation protocol
   {[}1]: a prospective connection between two nodes is offered only by way
   of introduction via a third party already connected to both nodes, and
   each node's accept/decline decision is driven by a privately-managed
   pool of reputations. Our probabilistic analysis exposes a delicate
   interplay between the policies for managing established and prospective

   decentralization. Our results are illustrated by examples.}},

Abstract = {{Robust optimization recently becomes a state-of-the-art approach to
   solve decision-making under uncertainty problems in the power system
   operations. To better quantify and highlight the significance of the
   robust optimization for reliable unit commitment runs, PJM and Alstom
   Grid have collaborated to develop a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO)
   prototype since 2012. In this paper, we present a computational
   tractable TSRO framework for the PJM Look-Ahead Unit Commitment (LAUC)
   with the consideration of load uncertainty. Instead of only covering
   limited number of scenarios in the uncertainty set, TSRO provides a
   robust solution that immunizes all possible scenario realizations.
   Linear decision rule (LDR) and two-stage decomposition approaches are
   considered respectively to solve TSRO in this research. We test the
   scalability and sensitivity of the proposed models and algorithms with
   the PJM market data. Finally, the computational results indicate that
   the proposed TSRO framework provides sufficient ramping capability and
   improves the security of the large-scale power grid system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel approach for sparse coding that further
   improves upon the sparse representation-based classification (SRC)
   framework. The proposed framework, Affine-Constrained Group Sparse
   Coding (ACGSC), extends the current SRC framework to classification
   problems with multiple input samples. Geometrically, the
   affine-constrained group sparse coding essentially searches for the
   vector in the convex hull spanned by the input vectors that can best be
   sparse coded using the given dictionary. The resulting objective
   function is still convex and can be efficiently optimized using
   iterative block-coordinate descent scheme that is guaranteed to
   converge. Furthermore, we provide a form of sparse recovery result that
   guarantees, at least theoretically, that the classification performance
   of the constrained group sparse coding should be at least as good as the
   group sparse coding. We have evaluated the proposed approach using three
   different recognition experiments that involve illumination variation of
   faces and textures, and face recognition under occlusions. Preliminary
   experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach, and in particular, the results from the recognition/occlusion
   experiment are surprisingly accurate and robust.}},

   dynamic moisture conditions. Active observations exhibit less
   sensitivity to SM changes and higher sensitivity to surface roughness
   than passive observations. Based upon these findings, the observed
   brightness temperatures (T(B)s) were used to estimate a SM profile using
   an emission model. The backscatter (sigma degrees) observations were
   used to estimate root mean square height (s) and correlation length (cl)
   using a backscatter model. The estimated SM profile, s, and cl resulted
   in RMSDs of 4.55K and 0.81dB between the observed and modeled T-B and
   sigma degrees values, respectively, for the rough surface. This study
   demonstrates the integrated use of AP to improve SM estimates.}},

Abstract = {{In a standard target detection approach, data is collected, points of
   interest called alarms are identified, and detection algorithms
   determine the confidence that a target is present at each point.
   Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves can be used to evaluate
   the performance of each detector and choose operating thresholds. The
   use of multiple sensors can improve the probability of detection of a
   diverse set of targets. It is difficult to properly assess the
   performance of a system of detectors and choose the best joint set of
   operating thresholds if confidence values from different detectors do
   not compare meaningfully. Fusion methods can be used to improve the
   joint performance of a set of detectors. However, in the case where
   different detectors do not operate on the same points of interest,
   typical fusion methods cannot be used to improve the binary decisions on
   individual alarms. In this paper, we propose a new fusion method that
   maps the confidence outputs from different detectors to a shared range
   where they compare meaningfully, and optimizes the joint performance of
   multiple detectors even when their alarm sets are disjoint. Our method
   uses dynamic programming to monotonically map the confidence output from
   each detector onto a shared range in such a way that we maximize the
   area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the ROC curve corresponding to the joint
   set of alarms. This joint ROC curve can be used to determine the
   operational thresholds for each individual detector to maximize their
   joint performance.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-Input Multiple-Output arrays with closely spaced antennas
   typically utilize orthogonal waveforms to create a larger virtual
   aperture. Orthogonality between waveforms can be achieved using time,
   Doppler, coding, or frequency division. In this work we examine the
   method of generating frequency diverse waveforms. In general, the
   frequency division approach generates waveforms that have reduced
   bandwidth which results in reduced range resolution. To overcome this
   loss of range resolution more spectrum must be utilized which might not
   be compatible with narrowband arrays. Herein, we present an approach for
   generating a notched waveform set that preserves range resolution, is
   effectively orthogonal, and could be utilized by narrowband arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Many message delivery services are based on publish-subscribe systems
   designed to distribute updates through centralized infrastructures
   requiring active Internet connections. For mobile devices, individual
   nodes should have the ability to propagate messages to interested users
   over ad-hoc wireless connections thereby removing the dependence on
   Internet and centralized servers. These nodes are sometimes stationary,
   but are often mobile, creating intermittent networks of nodes that tend
   to be socially related. In this paper, we propose LESC, a delaytolerant
   message delivery protocol, which facilitates efficient message
   dissemination in a decentralized, ad-hoc fashion and can be implemented
   using a commodity mobile communication technology such as Bluetooth LE.
   By leveraging the frequent collocation of socially related peers, nodes
   strategically become information carriers with the ability to propagate
   messages to out of range nodes in the future. We design a discrete event
   simulator that utilizes actual traveling paths derived from Google Maps.
   The simulator emulates LESC and the epidemic routing protocol to
   determine if we can achieve reasonable performance. Related works have
   approached the problem of publish-subscribe systems on mobile devices,
   but to the best of our knowledge, have not shown the feasibility of a
   protocol that can directly be implemented over current commodity
   wireless technologies. We simulate the protocol in Matlab and allow
   nodes to have multiple publications and subscriptions simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{In slow frequency-hop spread spectrum with non-orthogonal spreading
   sequences, multiple-access interference (MAI) occurs whenever two users
   transmit in the same frequency band. Schemes to mitigate such MAI have
   been previously developed for such systems when binary frequency-shift
   keying is used for modulation. It is desirable to instead use
   continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) to improve spectral
   efficiency; however, CPFSK is not a memoryless modulation and this
   complicates the problem of MAI mitigation. Previous work on CPFSK has
   been limited to ignoring the effects of MAI. In this paper, we develop
   an interference mitigation scheme for a slow FHSS system employing CPFSK
   and present performance results that show that our scheme significantly
   improves performance, especially in the presence of a strong
   interferers.}},

Abstract = {{this paper proposes a Deadline Based Resource Balancing (DBRB) task
   allocation algorithm for heterogeneous LEO small satellite networks, in
   which each satellite is equipped with one or more resources and limited
   power. So in the task allocation process, the dispatcher needs to
   consider the deadlines of the tasks as well as the balance of different
   resources. As the Map-Reduce program model is broadly adopted, a task in
   this network can consists of multiple subtasks. This paper schedules the
   subtasks based on both task deadline and resource balance. The DBRB
   algorithm is deployed on the head node of a cluster. It gathers the
   status from each cluster member and calculates their Node Importance
   Factors (NIFs) from the carried resources, residue power and compute
   capacity. The algorithm calculates the number of concurrent subtasks
   based on the deadlines, and allocates the subtasks to the lower NIFs
   first to balance the resources. The simulation results show that when
   cluster members carry multiple resources, resource are more balanced and
   rare resources serve longer in DBRB than in an Early Deadline First
   algorithm. We also analyze the resource balancing and average task
   finish time with different task deadline settings. And we show that the
   algorithm performs well in service isolation by serving multiple tasks
   with different deadlines. Moreover, the average task response time with
   various cluster size settings is well controlled within deadlines as
   well.}},

Abstract = {{A significant amount of research has been involved with the development
   of advanced driver-assistance systems. Such systems typically include
   radars, laser or video sensors that detect the vehicle trajectory and
   warn for an imminent lane departure, or sense the front vehicle's speed
   and apply the brakes of the following vehicle to maintain safe distance
   headways (i.e., collision avoidance system). However, most of these
   systems rely on the subject vehicle and surrounding vehicles' position
   and do not explicitly consider the driver's actions during the driving
   task. In addition safety research has focused on eye tracking as a means
   of capturing driver's attention, fatigue, or drowsiness; however, the
   body posture has not been investigated in depth. This paper presents a
   novel approach for studying the actual movements of drivers inside the
   vehicle, when performing specific maneuver types such as lane changing
   and merging. This information can be useful for identifying specific
   body movements that may hide potentially unsafe situations. A pilot
   study was conducted along a freeway and arterial segment, where the 3D
   shapes of selected participants were constructed with the use of a
   low-cost infrared depth sensor (Microsoft Kinect) while merging and
   changing lanes. The analysis of the 3D shapes shows that there are
   important differences between participants when performing similar
   driving maneuvers. The preliminary results of this pilot research set
   the basis for implementing the proposed methodological framework for
   conducting full-scale experiments with a variety of participants, and
   exploring differences due to driver behavior attributes, such as age,
   gender and driving experience.}},

Abstract = {{The current generation of genome sequencers produces orders of magnitude
   more sequencing data at a fraction of their former cost, a development
   that has repositioned the sequencing bottleneck from data acquisition to
   alignment and analysis. Optimal alignment algorithms, such as
   Smith-Waterman (SW), provide the most desirable output in terms of
   sensitivity and accuracy, but are perceived as too computationally
   demanding for practical use. Practical alignment tools, such as NCBI
   BLAST, have compensated by using increasingly specialized heuristics to
   provide faster results at the expense of reduced sensitivity and
   accuracy. This paper presents an FPGA-based alignment tool that
   considerably accelerates the SW algorithm with a highly configurable and
   novel hardware computation engine, while providing a robust software
   interface that seamlessly integrates into existing BLAST pipelines. This
   new alignment tool, BLAST-wrapped Smith-Waterman (BSW), improves upon
   previously published SW-acceleration research by providing a refined
   tool with a familiar and standard BLAST interface and essential local
   alignment statistics found in production tools. Experimental evaluation
   of BSW's performance for several configurations using large, real-world
   genome datasets shows speedups up to 59 and 7 vs. BLAST (word sizes 7
   and 11) and 63 vs. FASTA's SSEARCH on a single Altera Stratix IV E530
   FPGA. Scaled speedups exceeding 3300 vs. SSEARCH were observed when
   executed on up to 64 FPGAs of Novo-G, the reconfigurable supercomputer
   in the NSF CHREC Center at Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse coding, an unsupervised feature learning technique, is often used
   as a basic building block to construct deep networks. Convolutional
   sparse coding is proposed in the literature to overcome the scalability
   issues of sparse coding techniques to large images. In this paper we
   propose an efficient algorithm, based on the fast iterative shrinkage
   thresholding algorithm (FISTA), for learning sparse convolutional
   features. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed
   convolutional extension of FISTA can not only lead to faster convergence
   compared to existing methods but can also easily generalize to other
   cost functions.}},

   has potential utility in machine learning especially in online kernel

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to study the performance of diffusion-based
   distributed adaptive algorithms when relaxing the static assumption on
   network topology. Adaptive networks with topologies that change across
   time are useful to model a wide class of real-time sensor networks. This
   includes topologies where the number of nodes is variable and links are
   dynamic. We propose two schemes to accommodate dynamic topologies. The
   first proceeds following a probabilistic mechanism to add or remove
   nodes at each point in time. The second allows edges to be re-assigned
   at each iteration. The suggested changes allow retaining fundamental
   characteristics of the sensor graph, like maximum and minimum node
   degrees, as their significance impacts the network's throughput and its
   resistance to failures of neighbors. Simulations were carried for
   different node collaboration settings and averaged over Monte Carlo
   runs. Results show that no significant deterioration in performance is
   observed despite changes in the network size and connectivity, with a
   gained affinity to accommodate real sensor network systems.}},

Abstract = {{Instead of using single kernel, different approaches of using multiple
   kernels have been proposed recently in kernel learning literature, one
   of which is multiple kernel learning (MKL). In this paper, we propose an
   alternative to MKL in order to select the appropriate kernel given a
   pool of predefined kernels, for a family of online kernel filters called
   kernel adaptive filters (KAF). The need for an alternative is that, in a
   sequential learning method where the hypothesis is updated at every
   incoming sample, MKL would provide a new kernel, and thus a new
   hypothesis in the new reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated
   with the kernel. This does not fit well in the KAF framework, as
   learning a hypothesis in a fixed RKHS is the core of the KAF algorithms.
   Hence, we introduce an adaptive learning method to address the kernel
   selection problem for the KAF, based on competitive mixture of models.
   We propose mixture kernel least mean square (MxKLMS) adaptive filtering
   algorithm, where the kernel least mean square (KLMS) filters learned
   with different kernels, act in parallel at each input instance and are
   competitively combined such that the filter with the best kernel is an
   expert for each input regime. The competition among these experts is
   created by using a performance based gating, that chooses the
   appropriate expert locally. Therefore, the individual filter parameters
   as well as the weights for combination of these filters are learned
   simultaneously in an online fashion. The results obtained suggest that
   the model not only selects the best kernel, but also significantly
   improves the prediction accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this paper an analysis of bursts of fast pulses in current
   waveforms associated with positive lightning flashes of type 1 recorded
   on the Santis Tower in Switzerland. Type-1 flashes are characterized by
   the presence of a large unipolar current pulse with characteristics
   similar to those reported by Berger and co-workers. Several milliseconds
   to several tens of milliseconds prior to the main pulse, a train of
   damped oscillatory pulses separated by several milliseconds, exhibiting
   the highest current steepnesses of the flash have been observed in the
   majority of these flashes. An analysis reveals that these fast pulses
   can be categorized into two distinctive types: (A) Damped oscillatory
   pulses with a frequency of about 2 MHz and a duration of about 5 mu s,
   and (B) large bipolar pulses similar to a doublet of some 200 ns width,
   followed by a fast oscillation with a repetition frequency of the order
   of 20 MHz. The peak current derivatives associated with pulses of both
   types have a mean value of 3.2 kA/mu s. The time separation between two
   consecutive pulses is less than 15 ms with a mean value of 4.2 ms.}},

Title = {{A comparison of three pH control methods for revealing effects of
   undissociated butyric acid on specific butanol production rate in batch
   fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum}},
Journal = {{AMB EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{pH control has been essential for butanol production with Clostridium
   acetobutylicum. However, it is not very clear at what pH level the acid
   crash will occur, at what pH level butanol production will be dominant,
   and at what pH level butyric acid production will be prevailing.
   Furthermore, contradictory results have been reported about required
   acidic conditions for initiation of solventogenesis. In this study, with
   the aim of further understanding the role of undissociated butyric acid
   in butanol production, we investigated the correlation between
   undissociated butyric acid concentration and specific butanol production
   rate in batch fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum by comparing
   three pH control approaches: NaOH neutralization (at 12, 24 or 36 h),
   CaCO3 supplementation (2, 5, or 8 g/l) and NaOAc buffering (pH 4.6, 5.0
   or 5.6). By neutralizing the fermentation pH to similar to 5.0 at
   different time, we observed that neutralization should take place at the
   beginning of exponential phase (12 h), and otherwise resulting in lower
   concentrations of undissociated butyric acid, cell biomass and final
   butanol. CaCO3 supplementation extended cell growth to 36 h and resulted
   in higher butyrate yield under 8 g/L of CaCO3. In the NaOAc buffering,
   the highest specific butanol rate (0.58 h(-1)) was associated with the
   highest undissociated butyric acid (1.92 g/L). The linear correlation of
   the undissociated butyric acid with the specific butanol production
   rates suggested the undissociated butyric acid could be the major
   driving force for butanol production.}},

Title = {{A highly compliant serpentine shaped polymide interconnect for front-end
   strain relief in chronic neural implants}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{While the signal quality of recording neural electrodes is observed to
   degrade over time, the degradation mechanisms are complex and less
   easily observable. Recording microelectrodes failures are attributed to
   different biological factors such as tissue encapsulation, immune
   response, and disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and non-biological
   factors such as strain due to micromotion, insulation delamination,
   corrosion, and surface roughness on the recording site (1-4). Strain due
   to brain micromotion is considered to be one of the important abiotic
   factors contributing to the failure of the neural implants. To reduce
   the forces exerted by the electrode on the brain, a high compliance 2D
   serpentine shaped electrode cable was designed, simulated, and measured
   using polyimide as the substrate material. Serpentine electrode cables
   were fabricated using MEMS microfabrication techniques, and the
   prototypes were subjected to load tests to experimentally measure the
   compliance. The compliance of the serpentine cable was numerically
   modeled and quantitatively measured to be up to 10 times higher than the
   compliance of a straight cable of same dimensions and material.}},

Abstract = {{There is a recent increase in the use of multivariate analysis and
   pattern classification in prediction and real-time feedback of brain
   states from functional imaging signals and mapping of spatio-temporal
   patterns of brain activity. Here we present MANAS, a generalized

   fMRI signals. MANAS has been developed using MATLAB, LIBSVM, and SVM
   light packages to achieve a cross-platform environment. MANAS is
   targeted for neuroscience investigations and brain rehabilitation
   applications, based on neurofeedback and brain-computer interface (BCI)
   paradigms. MANAS provides two different approaches for real-time
   classification: subject dependent and subject independent
   classification. In this article, we present the methodology of real-time
   subject dependent and subject independent pattern classification of fMRI
   signals; the MANAS software architecture and subsystems; and finally
   demonstrate the use of the system with experimental results.}},

   a strong domain texture. The effect of electric field direction was
   investigated by applying the electric field parallel and perpendicular

   metal such as Pd or Pt to increase the detection sensitivity at room
   temperature. Functionalizing the surface with oxides, polymers and
   nitrides is also useful in enhancing the detection sensitivity for gases
   and ionic solutions. The use of enzymes or adsorbed antibody layers on
   the ZnO surface leads to highly specific detection of a broad range of
   antigens of interest in the medical and homeland security fields. We
   give examples of recent work showing sensitive detection of glucose and

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a mathematical formulation for the facility layout
   problem (FLP) based on the generalized quadratic assignment problem
   (GQAP). The GQAP is a generalization of the NP-hard quadratic assignment
   problem (QAP) that allows multiple facilities to be assigned to a single
   location as long as the capacity of the location allows. As a case
   study, we adapt the GRASP with path-relinking (GRASP-PR) heuristic
   introduced in Mateus et al. (J. Heuristics 17:527-565, 2011) for the
   hospital layout problem (HLP). In the HLP, we are given a set of areas
   in a hospital where medical facilities, such as surgery and recovery
   rooms, can be located and a set of medical facilities, each facility
   with a required area, that must be located in the hospital. Furthermore,
   we are given a matrix specifying, for each ordered pair of facilities,
   the number of patients that transition from the first to the second
   facility. The objective of the assignment is to minimize the total
   distance traveled by the patients. We illustrate our algorithm with a
   numerical example.}},

   market graph of the BRIC countries stock markets. We construct the stock
   market graph as follows: each vertex represents a stock, and the
   vertices are adjacent if the price correlation coefficient between them
   over a certain period of time is greater than or equal to specified
   threshold. The market graphs are constructed for different time periods
   to understand the dynamics of their characteristics such as correlation
   distribution histogram, mean value and standard deviation, size and
   structure of the maximum cliques. Our results show that we can split the
   BRIC countries into two groups. Brazil, Russia and India constitute the
   first group, China constitutes the second group.}},

Abstract = {{At room temperature, titanium materials display deformation and failure
   properties that are quite different from that of typical materials with
   cubic crystalline structure (aluminium, steels, etc). Rolled or extruded
   products exhibit a strong anisotropy and very pronounced difference in
   yielding and work-hardening evolution between tension and compression
   loadings. In this paper, a macroscopic elastic/plastic model that
   accounts for the key features of the plastic deformation of Ti, in
   particular the distortion of the yield surface induced by texture
   evolution is presented. Comparison with data demonstrates that the model
   predicts with accuracy the plastic response for a variety of loading
   conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that the model can be extended such
   as to incorporate damage. In contrast to existing approaches, the
   plasticity-damage couplings are deduced and not postulated. Hence, all
   material parameters have a clear physical significance, being related to
   plastic properties that can be determined from few simple mechanical
   tests. The new model predicts that in titanium materials damage
   accumulation is strongly influenced by the anisotropy and asymmetry in
   plastic flow. Moreover, it is shown that under uniaxial tension, the
   porosity evolution should be much slower than in materials with plastic
   flow obeying the classical von Mises criterion, and that the succession
   of damage events leading to failure should also be markedly different.}},

Abstract = {{Ductile damage is generally described by stress-space analytical
   potentials. In this contribution, it is shown that strain rate
   potentials, which are exact conjugate of the stress-based potentials,
   can be equally used to describe the dilatational response of porous
   metals. This framework is particularly appropriate for porous materials
   with matrix described by complex yield criteria for which a closed-form
   expression of the stress-based potential is not available. Illustration
   of the new approach is done for porous metals containing randomly
   distributed spherical voids in a von Mises elasto-plastic matrix.
   Furthermore, a general time integration algorithm for simulation of the
   mechanical response using this new formulation is developed and
   implemented in Abaqus/Standard. The proposed model and algorithm are
   validated with respect to the Abaqus built-in GTN model, which is based
   on a stress potential, through the simulation of a tensile test on a
   round bar.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of the boundary heat flux and total heat transfer in the
   lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) simulations is investigated. The
   boundary heat fluxes in the discrete velocity directions of the thermal
   LBE (TLBE) model are obtained directly from the temperature distribution
   functions at the lattice nodes. With the rectangular lattice uniformly
   spaced the effective surface area for the discrete heat flux is the unit
   spacing distance, thus the heat flux integration becomes simply a
   summation of all the discrete heat fluxes with constant surface areas.
   The present method for the evaluation of total heat transfer is very
   efficient and robust for curved boundaries because it does not require
   the determination of the normal heat flux on the boundary and the
   surface area. To validate its applicability and accuracy, several
   numerical tests with analytical solutions are conducted, including
   2-dimensional (2-D) steady thermal flow in a channel, 1-D transient heat
   conduction in an inclined semi-infinite solid, 2-D transient conduction
   inside a circle, and 3-D steady thermal flow in a circular pipe. For
   straight boundaries perpendicular to one of the discrete velocity
   vectors, the total heat transfer is second-order accurate. For curved
   boundaries only first-order accuracy is obtained for the total heat
   transfer due to the irregularly distributed lattice fractions cut by the
   curved boundary.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of spacecraft angular acceleration may benefit several methods
   used to estimate spacecraft dynamic parameters. As opposed to
   differentiation of angular velocity measurements which amplifies sensor
   noise, this paper presents a method to determine the angular
   acceleration using measurements of linear acceleration at pre-determined
   points in the spacecraft. Multiple linear accelerometers are selectively
   situated in a spacecraft for obtaining these measurements. Two such
   accelerometer configurations, using uniaxial, and triaxial
   accelerometers, respectively are presented. The effect of sensor bias,
   and noise on the angular acceleration estimates in both the cases are
   discussed and compared. The effective bias in the angular acceleration
   estimate is identified using a Kalman filter, and angular velocity
   measurements from a gyroscope. In addition to identifying the bias, the
   filter also produces smoothed angular velocity estimates. Simulations
   are performed using data from commercially available sensors.}},

Abstract = {{In large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), leveraging data sinks'
   mobility for data gathering has drawn substantial interests in recent
   years. Current researches either focus on planning a mobile sink's
   moving trajectory in advance to achieve optimized network performance,
   or target at collecting a small portion of sensed data in the network.
   In many application scenarios, however, a mobile sink cannot move freely
   in the deployed area. Therefore, the precalculated trajectories may not
   be applicable. To avoid constant sink location update traffics when a
   sink's future locations cannot be scheduled in advance, we propose two
   energy-efficient proactive data reporting protocols, SinkTrail and
   SinkTrail-S, for mobile sink-based data collection. The proposed
   protocols feature low-complexity and reduced control overheads. Two
   unique aspects distinguish our approach from previous ones: 1) we allow
   sufficient flexibility in the movement of mobile sinks to dynamically
   adapt to various terrestrial changes; and 2) without requirements of GPS
   devices or predefined landmarks, SinkTrail establishes a logical
   coordinate system for routing and forwarding data packets, making it
   suitable for diverse application scenarios. We systematically analyze
   the impact of several design factors in the proposed algorithms. Both
   theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithms reduce control overheads and yield satisfactory
   performance in finding shorter routing paths.}},

Abstract = {{Prosthetic vascular grafts do not mimic the antithrombogenic properties
   of native blood vessels and therefore have higher rates of complications
   that involve thrombosis and restenosis. We developed an approach for
   grafting bioactive heparin, a potent anticoagulant glycosaminoglycan, to
   the lumen of eFTFE vascular grafts to improve their interactions with
   blood and vascular cells. Heparin was bound to aminated
   poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) (POC) via its carboxyl functional groups
   onto POC-modified eFTFE grafts. The bioactivity and stability of the
   POC-immobilized heparin (POC-Heparin) were characterized via platelet
   adhesion and clotting assays. The effects of POC Heparin on the
   adhesion, viability and phenotype of primary endothelial cells (EC),
   blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) obtained from endothelial
   progenitor cells (EPCs) isolated from human peripheral blood, and smooth
   muscle cells were also investigated. POC-Heparin grafts maintained
   bioactivity under physiologically relevant conditions in vitro for at
   least one month. Specifically, POC-Heparin-coated ePTFE grafts
   significantly reduced platelet adhesion and inhibited whole blood
   clotting kinetics. POC-Heparin supported EC and BOEC adhesion,
   viability, proliferation, NO production, and expression of endothelial
   cell-specific markers von Willebrand factor (vWF) and vascular
   endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin). Smooth muscle cells cultured on
   POC-Heparin showed increased expression of a-actin and decreased cell
   proliferation. This approach can be easily adapted to modify other blood
   contacting devices such as stents where antithrombogenicity and improved
   endothelialization are desirable properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Strategies combatting cognitive decline among the growing aging
   population are vital. We tested whether environmental enrichment could
   reverse age-impaired rapid spatial search strategy acquisition
   concomitantly with hippocampal neurogenesis in rats. Young (5-8 months)
   and aged (20-22 months) male Fischer 344 rats were pair-housed and
   exposed to environmental enrichment (n = 7 young, 9 aged) or housed
   individually (n = 7 young, 7 aged) for 10 weeks. After 5 weeks, hidden
   platform trials (5 blocks of 3 trials; 15 m inter-block interval), a
   probe trial, and then visible platform trials (5 blocks of 3 trials; 15
   m inter-block interval) commenced in the water maze. One week after
   testing, rats were given 5 daily intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (50
   mg/kg) injections and perfused 4 weeks later to quantify neurogenesis.
   Although young rats outperformed aged rats, aged enriched rats
   outperformed aged individually housed rats on all behavioral measures.
   Neurogenesis decreased with age but enrichment enhanced new cell
   survival, regardless of age. The novel correlation between new neuron
   number and behavioral measures obtained in a rapid water maze task among
   aged rats, suggests that environmental enrichment increases their
   ability to rapidly acquire and flexibly use spatial information along
   with neurogenesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital elevation model (DEM) integration by optimally fusing multiple
   measurements having different characteristics can play an important role
   in estimation and prediction of environmental changes and natural
   disasters. Multiscale or multiresolution modelling used for this purpose
   has attracted attention in terms of its rich modelling capability as
   well as computational efficiency. In particular, a multiscale Kalman
   smoother (MKS) with tree structure graph can provide a powerful,
   efficient algorithm based on the Markov property. However, due to the
   stair-like correlation from the tree structure, unrealistic artefacts
   can be generated in the fusion result. This is especially prominent on
   geographic surfaces or ocean surfaces that have naturally smooth
   characteristics. In this article, a super-resolution (SR) algorithm is
   applied to remove blocky artefacts. Using the algorithm, new
   measurements are generated in the area where blocky artefacts can arise.
   The measurement is then fused with vector-valued MKS. The results show
   that this novel image fusion scheme provides a smaller root mean square
   error (RMSE) as well as better visual inspection.}},

Abstract = {{Given a simple undirected graph G = (V, E) and a constant gamma is an
   element of (0, 1), a subset of vertices is called a gamma-quasi-clique
   or, simply, a gamma-clique if it induces a subgraph with the edge
   density of at least gamma. The maximum gamma-clique problem consists in
   finding a gamma-clique of largest cardinality in the graph. Despite
   numerous practical applications, this problem has not been rigorously
   studied from the mathematical perspective, and no exact solution methods
   have been proposed in the literature. This paper, for the first time,
   establishes some fundamental properties of the maximum gamma-clique
   problem, including the NP-completeness of its decision version for any
   fixed gamma satisfying 0 < gamma < 1, the quasi-heredity property, and
   analytical upper bounds on the size of a maximum gamma-clique. Moreover,
   mathematical programming formulations of the problem are proposed and
   results of preliminary numerical experiments using a state-of-the-art
   optimization solver to find exact solutions are presented. (c) 2012

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{279-291}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in urban runoff can be
   controlled through a variety of nonstructural and structural controls
   commonly known as best management practices (BMPs). Manufactured
   treatment devices (MTDs) are structural BMPs that may be used in
   portions of a site, often when space is limited. MTDs use a variety of
   technologies to achieve potentially greater treatment efficiency while
   reducing spatial requirements. However, verifying the performance of
   MTDs is difficult because of the variability of runoff water quality,
   the variability in treatment technologies, and the lack of standardized
   protocols for field testing. Performance testing of MTDs has focused
   almost exclusively upon removal of sediment; however MTDs are now being
   applied to the task of removing other constituents of concern, including
   nutrients such as phosphorus. This paper reviews current methods of
   assessing treatment performance of MTDs and introduces the Virginia
   Technology Assessment Protocol (VTAP), a program developed to evaluate
   the removal of phosphorus by MTDs. The competing goals of various
   stakeholders were considered when developing the VTAP. A conceptual
   framework of the tradeoffs considered is presented; these tradeoffs
   require compromise among the competing interests in order that
   innovation proceeds and benefits accrue. The key strengths of VTAP are
   also presented and compared with other existing programs. (C) 2012

Title = {{A numerical study of granular shear flows of rod-like particles using
   the discrete element method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},

Abstract = {{The effect of particle aspect ratio and surface geometry on granular
   flows is assessed by performing numerical simulations of rod-like
   particles in simple shear flows using the discrete element method (DEM).
   The effect of particle surface geometry is explored by adopting two
   types of particles: glued-spheres particles and true cylindrical
   particles. The particle aspect ratio varies from one to six. Compared to
   frictionless spherical particles, smaller stresses are obtained for the
   glued-spheres and cylindrical particle systems in dilute and moderately
   dense flows due to the loss of translational energy, which is partially
   converted to rotational energy, for the non-spherical particles. For
   dilute granular flows of non-spherical particles, stresses are primarily
   affected by the particle aspect ratio rather than the surface geometry.
   As the particle aspect ratio increases, the effective particle projected
   area in the plane perpendicular to the flow direction increases, so that
   the probability of the occurrence of the particle collisions increases,
   leading to a reduction in particle velocity fluctuation and therefore a
   decrease in the stresses. Hence, a simple modification is made to the
   kinetic theory for granular flows to describe the stress tensors for
   dilute flows of non-spherical particles by incorporating a normalized
   effective particle projected area to account for the effect of particle
   collision probability. For dense granular flows, the stresses depend on
   both the particle aspect ratio and the surface geometry. Sharp stress
   increases at high solid volume fractions are observed for the
   glued-spheres particles with large aspect ratios due to the bumpy
   surfaces, which impede the flow. However, smaller stresses are obtained
   for the true cylindrical particles with large aspect ratios at high
   solid volume fractions. This trend is attributed to the combined effects
   of the smooth particle surfaces and the particle alignments such that
   the major/long axes of particles are aligned in the flow direction. In
   addition, the apparent friction coefficient, defined as the ratio of
   shear to normal stresses, is found to decrease as the particle aspect
   ratio increases and/or the particle surface becomes smoother at high
   solid volume fractions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare the performance of natural
   analog (NA) and constructed analog (CA) methods to produce both
   probabilistic and deterministic downscaled daily reference
   evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasts in the southeastern United States.
   The 1-15 day, 15-member ETo forecasts were produced from 1979 to 2009
   using the Penman-Monteith equation and a forecast analog approach with a
   combination of the Global Forecast System (GFS) reforecasts and NCEP-DOE
   Reanalysis 2 climatology, and were downscaled using the North American
   Regional Reanalysis (NARR). The Pearson correlation coefficient (R),
   mean squared error skill score (MSESS), and Bias were used to evaluate
   the skill of downscaled deterministic forecasts. The Linear Error in
   Probability Space (LEPS) skill score, Brier Skill Score (BSS), relative
   operating characteristic, and reliability diagrams were used to evaluate
   the skill of downscaled probabilistic forecasts. Overall, CA showed
   slightly higher skill than NA in terms of the metrics for deterministic
   forecasts, while for probabilistic forecasts NA showed higher skill than
   CA regarding the BSS in five categories (terciles, and 10th and 90th
   percentiles) and lower skill than CA regarding the LEPS skill score.
   Both CA and NA produced skillful deterministic results in the first 3
   lead days, while the skill was higher for CA than for NA. Probabilistic
   NA forecasts exhibited higher resolution and reliability than CA, likely
   due to a larger ensemble size. Forecasts by both methods showed the
   lowest skill in the Florida peninsula and in mountainous areas, likely
   due to the fact that these features were not well-resolved in the model
   forecast. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   ``Explosive''}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Recent reports suggest that evolving large-scale networks exhibit
   ``explosive percolation'': a large fraction of nodes suddenly becomes
   connected when sufficiently many links have formed in a network. This
   phase transition has been shown to be continuous (second-order) for most
   random network formation processes, including classical mean-field
   random networks and their modifications. We study a related yet
   different phenomenon referred to as dense percolation, which occurs when
   a network is already connected, but a large group of nodes must be dense
   enough, i.e., have at least a certain minimum required percentage of
   possible links, to form a ``highly connected'' cluster. Such clusters
   have been considered in various contexts, including the recently
   introduced network modularity principle in biological networks. We prove
   that, contrary to the traditionally defined percolation transition,
   dense percolation transition is discontinuous (first-order) under the
   classical mean-field network formation process (with no modifications);
   therefore, there is not only quantitative, but also qualitative
   difference between regular and dense percolation transitions. Moreover,
   the size of the largest dense (highly connected) cluster in a mean-field
   random network is explicitly characterized by rigorously proven tight
   asymptotic bounds, which turn out to naturally extend the previously
   derived formula for the size of the largest clique (a cluster with all
   possible links) in such a network. We also briefly discuss possible
   implications of the obtained mathematical results on studying
   first-order phase transitions in real-world linked systems.}},

Abstract = {{The thrust produced by a sinusoidally driven dielectric barrier
   discharge actuator in quiescent air is known to increase with a power

Abstract = {{Permeable pavement, as a sustainable infrastructure material can promote
   hydrologic restoration, particulate matter (PM) and solute control.
   However, filtration and commensurate clogging are two aspects of
   continued interest and discussion. This study quantifies filtration and
   clogging of cementitious permeable pavement (CPP) for loadings from 50
   to 200 mg/L of hetero-disperse sandy-silt PM. The CPP mix design
   provides a hetero-disperse pore size distribution (PSD)(pore), effective
   porosity (phi(e)) of 24\% and median pore size of 658 mu m with a
   standard deviation of 457 mu m. The PM mass separation across the entire
   particle size distribution (PSD)(PM) exceeds 80\%; with complete
   separation for PM greater than 300 mu m and 50\% separation for
   suspended PM. Turbidity is reduced (42-95\%), and effluent is below 10
   NTU in the first quartile of a loading period. Permeable pavement
   illustrates reductions in initial (clean-bed) hydraulic conductivity
   (k(0)) with loading time. For all PM loadings, k(0) (3.1 x 10(-1) mm/s)
   was reduced to 10(-4) mm/s for runoff loading durations from 100 to 250
   h, respectively. Temporal hydraulic conductivity (k) follows exponential
   profiles. Maintenance by vacuuming and sonication illustrate that
   96-99\% of k(0) is recovered. Permeable pavement constitutive properties
   integrated with measured PM loads and a year of continuous
   rainfall-runoff simulation illustrate k reduction with historical
   loadings. Study results measure and model filtration and hydraulic
   conductivity phenomena as well as maintenance requirements of permeable
   pavement directly loaded by urban drainage. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of different types of single-walled and

   The simulations report on the elastic properties of the different MoS2
   nanotube systems as well as the interrelationships between the buckling
   behavior and the structural parameters of the nanotubes, such as length,
   diameter, chirality, and number of walls. The simulations predict that
   the most important factor influencing mechanical response is the number
   of walls present and, to a lesser extent, the diameters of the
   nanotubes, with the other structural parameters predicted to have little

Abstract = {{The activation and thermal stability of ultra-shallow B+ implants in
   crystalline (c-Ge) and preamorphized Ge (PA-Ge) following rapid thermal
   annealing was investigated using micro Hall effect and ion beam analysis
   techniques. The residual implanted dose of ultra-shallow B+ implants in
   Ge was characterized using elastic recoil detection and was determined
   to correlate well with simulations with a dose loss of 23.2\%, 21.4\%,
   and 17.6\% due to ion backscattering for 2, 4, and 6 keV implants in Ge,
   respectively. The electrical activation of ultra-shallow B+ implants at
   2, 4, and 6 keV to fluences ranging from 5.0 x 10(13) to 5.0 x 10(15)
   cm(-2) was studied using micro Hall effect measurements after annealing
   at 400-600 degrees C for 60 s. For both c-Ge and PA-Ge, a large fraction
   of the implanted dose is rendered inactive due to the formation of a
   presumable B-Ge cluster. The B lattice location in samples annealed at
   400 degrees C for 60 s was characterized by channeling analysis with a
   650 keV H+ beam by utilizing the B-11(p, alpha)2 alpha nuclear reaction
   and confirmed the large fraction of off-lattice B for both c-Ge and
   PA-Ge. Within the investigated annealing range, no significant change in
   activation was observed. An increase in the fraction of activated dopant
   was observed with increasing energy which suggests that the surface
   proximity and the local point defect environment has a strong impact on
   B activation in Ge. The results suggest the presence of an inactive B-Ge
   cluster for ultra-shallow implants in both c-Ge and PA-Ge that remains
   stable upon annealing for temperatures up to 600 degrees C. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The performance of conventional La0.80Sr0.20MnO3-delta (LSM) cathodes
   was dramatically improved using a highly conductive Er-0.4Bi1.6O3 (ESB)
   phase. ESB was utilized not only as the ion-conducting phase in the
   LSM-ESB cathode, but also as an electrolyte coupled to the LSM-ESB
   cathode. The electrode area specific resistance (ASR) measured from a
   symmetric cell consisting of LSM-ESB electrodes on an ESB electrolyte
   was only 0.43 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, which is similar to 60\%
   lower than that of identical LSM-ESB cathodes on Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC)
   electrolytes (1.11 Omega cm(2)). Deconvolution of the impedance spectra
   reveals that this significantly smaller cathode ASR with an ESB
   electrolyte is due to a higher rate of oxygen incorporation at the
   cathode/ESB electrolyte interface. The maximum power density (MPD) of an
   anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with an LSM-ESB cathode on
   an ESB/GDC bilayered electrolyte reached similar to 1013 mW cm(-2) at
   650 degrees C. The measured MPDs at low temperatures, from 450 to 650
   degrees C, are to date the highest reported values for SOFCs using
   LSM-based composite cathodes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{ELF/VLF wave generation from the beating of two HF ionospheric heating
   sources}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that Extremely Low Frequency (ELF, 0.3-3 kHz) and
   Very Low Frequency (VLF, 3-30 kHz) radio waves can be generated via
   modulated High Frequency (HF, 3-10 MHz) heating of the lower ionosphere
   (60-100 km). The ionospheric absorption of HF power modifies the
   conductivity of the lower ionosphere, which in the presence of natural
   currents such as the auroral electrojet, creates an `antenna in the
   sky.' We utilize a theoretical model of the HF to ELF/VLF conversion and
   the ELF/VLF propagation, and calculate the amplitudes of the generated
   ELF/VLF waves when two HF heating waves, separated by the ELF/VLF
   frequency, are transmitted from two adjacent locations. The resulting
   ELF/VLF radiation pattern exhibits a strong directional dependence (as
   much as 15 dB) that depends on the physical spacing of the two HF
   sources. This beat wave source can produce signals 10-20 dB stronger
   than those generated using amplitude modulation, particularly for
   frequencies greater than 5-10 kHz. We evaluate recent suggestions that
   beating two HF waves generates ELF/VLF waves in the F-region (>150 km),
   and conclude that those experimental results may have misinterpreted,
   and can be explained strictly by the much more well established D region
   mechanism. Citation: Cohen, M. B., R. C. Moore, M. Golkowski, and N. G.

Abstract = {{A practical computational procedure has been proposed that provides key
   electronic parameters of a polymer (fundamental bandgap, ionization
   energy, electron affinity, and intrachain electron and hole mobilities)
   determining its suitability as a donor or acceptor in organic
   optoelectronic materials. Series of oligomer calculations at the
   Becke3-Lee-Yang-Parr level with and without a self-contained asymptotic
   correction using the 6-31G{*}{*} basis set were performed. The bandgap,
   ionization energy, and electron affinities of a polymer are extrapolated
   from those of its oligomers obtained from the highest occupied and
   lowest unoccupied orbital energies in the Koopmans-like approximation.
   This scheme has been applied to conjugated polymers having the
   poly(p-phenylene), poly(thiophene), or poly(pyrrole) backbone as well as
   to PCBM. The observed values of the electronic parameters have been
   reproduced within less than 1 eV in most cases. With the predicted
   values of these parameters, estimates of the open-circuit voltage and
   drift potential have been made for 22 valid donor acceptor combinations.
   Several potentially useful combinations have been identified including
   the poly(thiophene):PCBM. The electron and hole mobilities have been
   found to correlate more strongly with the conformation (planarity) than
   the bandgap, but otherwise do not differ significantly.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of complete turbulence suppression in turbidity currents driven
   by monodisperse suspensions of sediment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{712}},
Pages = {{384-417}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Turbidity currents derive their motion from the excess density imposed
   by suspended sediments. The settling tendency of sediments is countered
   by flow turbulence, which expends energy to keep them in suspension.
   This interaction leads to downward increasing concentration of suspended
   sediments (stable stratification) in the flow. Thus in a turbidity
   current sediments play the dual role of sustaining turbulence by driving
   the flow and damping turbulence due to stable stratification. By means
   of direct numerical simulations, it has been shown previously that
   stratification above a threshold can substantially reduce turbulence and
   possibly extinguish it. This study expands the simplified model by
   Cantero et a l. (J. Geophys. Res., vol. 114, 2009 a, C03008), and puts
   forth a proposition that explains the mechanism of complete turbulence
   suppression due to suspended sediments. In our simulations it is
   observed that suspensions of larger sediments lead to stronger
   stratification and, above a threshold size, induce an abrupt transition
   in the flow to complete turbulence suppression. It has been widely
   accepted that hairpin and quasi-streamwise vortices are key to
   sustaining turbulence in wall-bounded flows, and that only vortices of
   sufficiently strong intensity can spawn the next generation of vortices.
   This auto-generation mechanism keeps the flow populated with hairpin and
   quasi-streamwise vortical structures and thus sustains turbulence. From
   statistical analysis of Reynolds stress events and visualization of flow
   structures, it is observed that settling sediments damp the Reynolds

   generation of turbulent vortical structures, which ultimately leads to

Abstract = {{Dual-beam ELF wave generation experiments performed at the
   High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) HF transmitter
   are used to investigate the dependence of the generated ELF wave
   magnitude on HF power, HF frequency, modulation waveform, and receiver
   location. During the experiments, two HF beams transmit simultaneously:
   one amplitude modulated (AM) HF beam modulates the conductivity of the
   lower ionosphere at ELF frequencies while a second HF beam broadcasts a
   continuous waveform (CW) signal, modifying the efficiency of ELF
   conductivity modulation and thereby the efficiency of ELF wave
   generation. We report experimental results for different ambient
   ionospheric conditions, and we interpret the observations in the context
   of a newly developed dual-beam HF heating model. A comparison between
   model predictions and experimental observations indicates that the
   theoretical model includes the essential physics involved in
   multifrequency HF heating of the lower ionosphere. In addition to the HF
   transmission parameters mentioned above, the model is used to predict
   the dependence of ELF wave magnitude on the polarization of the CW beam
   and on the modulation frequency of the modulated beam. We consider how
   these effects vary with ambient D-region electron density and electron
   temperature. Citation: Agrawal, D., and R. C. Moore (2012), Dual-beam

Abstract = {{Gene delivery technologies to introduce foreign genes into highly
   differentiated mammalian cells have improved significantly over the last
   few decades. Relatively new techniques such as magnetic
   nanoparticle-based gene transfection technology are showing great
   promise in terms of its high transfection efficiency and wide-ranging
   research applications. We have developed a novel gene delivery
   technique, which uses magnetic nanoparticles moving under the influence
   of an oscillating magnetic array. Herein we successfully introduced
   short interfering RNA (siRNA) against green fluorescent protein (GFP) or
   actin into stably-transfected GFP-HeLa cells or wild-type HeLa and rat
   aortic smooth muscle cells, respectively. This gene silencing technique
   occurred in a dose-and cell density-dependent manner, as reflected using
   fluorescence intensity and adhesion assays. Furthermore, using
   endocytosis inhibitors, we established that these magnetic
   nanoparticle-nucleic acid complexes, moving across the cell surface
   under the influence of an oscillating magnet array, enters into the
   cells via the caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway.}},

Title = {{Strain incompatibility and residual strains in ferroelectric single

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Residual strains in ferroelectrics are known to adversely affect the
   material properties by aggravating crack growth and fatigue degradation.
   The primary cause for residual strains is strain incompatibility between
   different microstructural entities. For example, it was shown in
   polycrystalline ferroelectrics that residual strains are caused due to
   incompatibility between the electric-field-induced strains in grains
   with different crystallographic orientations. However, similar
   characterization of cause-effect in multidomain ferroelectric single
   crystals is lacking. In this article, we report on the development of
   plastic residual strains in {[}111]-oriented domain engineered BaTiO3
   single crystals. These internal strains are created due to strain
   incompatibility across 90 degrees domain walls between the differently
   oriented domains. The average residual strains over a large crystal
   volume measured by in situ neutron diffraction is comparable to previous
   X-ray measurements of localized strains near domain boundaries, but are
   an order of magnitude lower than electric-field-induced residual strains
   in polycrystalline ferroelectrics.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to help a bank originator of a
   collateralized debt obligation (CDO) to build a maximally profitable
   CDO. We consider an optimization framework for structuring CDOs. The
   objective is to select attachment/detachment points and underlying
   instruments in the CDO pool. In addition to ``standard{''} CDOs we study
   so-called ``step-up{''} CDOs. In a standard CDO contract the
   attachment/detachment points are constant over the life of a CDO. In a
   step-up CDO the attachment/detachment points may change over time. We
   show that step-up CDOs can save about 25-35\% of tranche spread payments
   (ie, profitability of CDOs can be boosted by about 25-35\%). Several
   optimization models are developed from the bank originator perspective.
   We consider a synthetic CDO where the goal is to minimize payments for
   the credit risk protection (premium leg), while maintaining a specific
   credit rating (assuring the credit spread) of each tranche and
   maintaining the total incoming credit default swap spread payments. The
   case study is based on the time-to-default scenarios for obligors
   (instruments) generated by the Standard \& Poor's CDO Evaluator. The
   Portfolio Safeguard package by AORDA was used to optimize the
   performance of several CDOs based on example data.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents a millimeter-wave (mm-wave) slow-wave elevated
   coplanar waveguide (ECPW) power divider/combiner fabricated in the
   back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) of a 90 nm CMOS technology. Design
   techniques using periodical loading stubs and elevated signal conductors
   are applied toward the CPWs that enable i) an aggressive size-reduction
   by increasing the artificial effective dielectric constant
   (epsilon(eff)) ii) realization of high-impedance transmission lines at
   mm-wave. The measurement results reveal that the insertion loss is 2.3
   and 2.4 dB at 60 and 67 GHz, respectively. The measured isolation of
   over 13 dB is observed from 59 GHz to at least 110 GHz. The divider also
   achieves an excellent amplitude imbalance and phase imbalance of less
   than 0.16 dB and less than 0.45 degrees, respectively, up to 67 GHz
   (limited by test setup). The core size of the proposed divider is only
   205 mu m x 250 mu m (0.051 mm(2)) equivalent to a size-reduction of over
   70\% compared to a conventional Wilkinson power divider. To the best of
   authors' knowledge, this is the first Wilkinson power divider/combiner
   that has demonstrated the highest operating frequency characterized
   among all other known semiconductor technologies reported.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs), a novel technique in
   industry control, can greatly reduce the cost of measurement and control
   and improve productive efficiency. Different from Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSNs) in non-industrial applications, the communication
   reliability of IWSNs has to be guaranteed as the real-time field data
   need to be transmitted to the control system through IWSNs. Obviously,
   the network architecture has a significant influence on the performance
   of IWSNs, and therefore this paper investigates the optimal node
   placement problem of IWSNs to ensure the network reliability and reduce
   the cost. To solve this problem, a node placement model of IWSNs is
   developed and formulized in which the reliability, the setup cost, the
   maintenance cost and the scalability of the system are taken into
   account. Then an improved adaptive mutation probability binary particle
   swarm optimization algorithm (AMPBPSO) is proposed for searching out the
   best placement scheme. After the verification of the model and
   optimization algorithm on the benchmark problem, the presented AMPBPSO
   and the optimization model are used to solve various large-scale optimal
   sensor placement problems. The experimental results show that AMPBPSO is
   effective to tackle IWSNs node placement problems and outperforms
   discrete binary Particle Swarm Optimization (DBPSO) and standard Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) in terms of search accuracy and the convergence speed
   with the guaranteed network reliability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the synthesis of two new blue to transmissive
   donor-acceptor electrochromic polymers: a polymer synthesized using an
   alternating copolymerization route (ECP-Blue-A) and a polymer
   synthesized using a random copolymerization (ECP-Blue-R) by Stifle
   polymerization. These polymers utilize side chains with four ester
   groups per donor moiety, allowing organic solubility in the ester form,
   and water solubility upon saponification to their carboxylate salt form.
   We demonstrate that the saponified polymer salts of ECP-Blue-A and
   ECP-Blue-R (WS-ECP-Blue-A and WS-ECP-Blue-R) can be processed from
   aqueous solutions into thin films by spray-casting. Upon the subsequent
   neutralization of the thin films, the resulting polymer acid films are
   solvent resistant and can be electrochemically switched between their
   colored state and a transmissive state in a KNO3/water electrolyte
   solution. The polymer acids, WS-ECP-Blue-A-acid and WS-ECP-Blue-R-acid,
   show electrochromic contrast Delta\%T of 38\% at 655 nm and 39\% at 555
   nm for a 0.5 s switch, demonstrating the advantage of an aqueous
   compatible electrochrome switchable in high ionic conductivity aqueous
   electrolytes. The results of the electrodiromic properties study
   indicate that these polymers are promising candidates for aqueous
   processable and aqueous switching electrochromic materials and devices
   as desired for applications where environmental impact is of importance.}},

Abstract = {{Structural health monitoring enables fatigue damage for in-service
   structures to be evaluated and the remaining useful life to predicted.
   In this paper, Bayesian inference using a random walk method was
   implemented to predict the remaining useful life of an aircraft fuselage
   panel subjected to repeated pressurization cycles. The Paris' law
   parameters, m and C, were treated as uncertain along with the initial
   crack size, Go. Random samples from the joint distribution of m, C, and
   at) were used to generate the fatigue crack growth curve using Paris'
   law. Using simulated crack size data, the probability that a selected
   fatigue crack growth curve represented the true fatigue crack growth
   curve was updated. Crack sizes were calculated using Paris' law with
   uncertain parameters and random noise and bias were added to the
   simulated crack sizes. With this approach, fatigue crack size was
   characterized by a probability distribution at each loading cycle. A
   detailed explanation of Bayesian updating using the random walk method
   is provided, crack size. The effect of the likelihood on the remaining
   useful life predictions was also evaluated. The proposed method takes
   into account model uncertainties as well as the presence of noise and
   bias in the measurement data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been gaining popularity for
   inventory control, object tracking, and supply-chain management in
   warehouses, retail stores, hospitals, etc. Periodically and
   automatically estimating the number of RFID tags deployed in a large
   area has many important applications in inventory management and theft
   detection. Prior works focus on designing time-efficient algorithms that
   can estimate tens of thousands of tags in seconds. We observe that for
   an RFID reader to access tags in a large area, active tags are likely to
   be used due to their longer operational ranges. These tags are
   battery-powered and use their own energy for information transmission.
   However, recharging batteries for tens of thousands of tags is
   laborious. Hence, conserving energy for active tags becomes critical.
   Some prior works have studied how to reduce energy expenditure of an
   RFID reader when it reads tag IDs. We study how to reduce the amount of
   energy consumed by active tags during the process of estimating the
   number of tags in a system. We design two energy-efficient probabilistic
   estimation algorithms that iteratively refine a control parameter to
   optimize the information carried in transmissions from tags, such that
   both the number and the size of transmissions are reduced. These
   algorithms can also take time efficiency into consideration. By tuning a
   contention probability parameter omega, the new algorithms can make
   tradeoff between energy cost and estimation time.}},

Abstract = {{Speed limits are usually imposed on roads in an attempt to enhance
   safety and sometimes serve the purpose of reducing fuel consumption and
   vehicular emissions as well. Most previous studies up to date focus on
   investigation of the effects of speed limits from a local perspective,
   while network-wide traffic reallocation effects are overlooked. This
   paper makes the first attempt to investigate how a link-specific speed
   limit law reallocates traffic flow in an equilibrium manner at a
   macroscopic network level. We find that, although the link travel
   time-flow relationship is altered after a speed limit is imposed, the
   standard traffic assignment method still applies. With the commonly
   adopted assumptions, the uniqueness of link travel times at user
   equilibrium (UE) remains valid, and the UE flows on links with
   non-binding speed limits are still unique. The UE flows on other links
   with binding speed limits may not be unique but can be explicitly
   characterized by a polyhedron or a linear system of equalities and
   inequalities. Furthermore, taking into account the traffic reallocation
   effects of speed limits, we compare the capability of speed limits and
   road pricing for decentralizing desirable network flow patterns.
   Although from a different perspective for regulating traffic flows with
   a different mechanism, a speed limit law may play the same role as a
   toll charge scheme and perform better than some negative (rebate) toll
   schemes under certain conditions for network flow management. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Conventional denuders made of glass or metal are too heavy and bulky to
   be used in personal sampling systems. In this study, a portable Porous
   Membrane Denuder (PMD) was developed for personal sampling. The PMD
   utilizes the porosity of the membrane material and a configuration of
   multiple parallel flow channels to reduce the size and weight of the
   device, while increasing the gas collection efficiency. Four types of
   PMDs (PMD I, II, III and IV) with increasing numbers of channels and
   smaller channel openings were constructed and tested. Using 10\% sodium
   carbonate coating and a feed concentration of 1 ppm, PMD Ia's collection
   efficiency for sulfur dioxide over 8 hours was higher than 99.9\%. For a
   feed concentration of 10 ppm, the 5-hr time-weighted-average collection
   efficiency for sulfur dioxide was 73.1\%, 82.8\%, 90.9\%, 97.2\% for PMD
   Ib, II, III and IV, respectively, compared with 96.6\% of the Glass
   Honeycomb Denuder (GHD), which has similar structure to PMD IV. However,
   the weight of PMD IV is only one-tenth of that of the GHD. It is clear
   that with a similar physical structure, PMDs have similar capacities to
   traditional Glass Honeycomb Denuders, yet are much lighter and less
   expensive. This study demonstrates the great potential of this new type
   of denuder for many applications in the field of environmental and
   industrial hygiene monitoring. Particle loss fractions of the four types
   of PMDs in the size range of 1 to 10 mu m were also measured and were
   2.9\%, 5.2\%, 5.7\% and 7.3\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial distribution of land use can have a substantial effect on
   surface and groundwater quality. Our objective was to test for trends in
   flow components and water quality related to changes in land use in the
   Alafia and Hillsborough River watersheds in Florida, USA, over the
   period 1974-2007. In addition, water quality statistics were evaluated
   in the perspective of numeric water quality criteria and proposed
   reclassification of segments of the Alafia River. Trends in 10 water
   quality parameters and three discharge variables were evaluated using a
   nonparametric trend detection test. Results of land use analysis
   indicated substantial urbanization and loss of agricultural land in the
   study area. Discharge variables did not exhibit significant trends,
   whereas trends in the majority of water quality concentrations were
   negative or nonsignificant with total nitrogen and total Kjeldahl
   nitrogen as exceptions showing positive trends. Changes in nutrient
   pathways could not be clearly identified. Considering recently
   promulgated numeric nutrient criteria and standards for dissolved
   fluoride, much of the Alafia River was found to be out of compliance.
   While there were land use changes and changes in water quality over the
   study period, it was difficult to identify a direct cause-effect
   relationship. Responses to regulatory efforts, such as the Clean Water
   Act and improvements in phosphate mining practices, may have had greater
   impacts on water quality than changes in land use.}},

Title = {{Feasibility of whitetopping pavements for resurfacing thin asphalt

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Many asphalt pavements have experienced rutting (wheel path deformation)
   while many others have experienced cracking. One of the possible
   solutions to this problem is the use of whitetopping, which is a
   composite section with a concrete layer over an existing asphalt
   pavement. Whitetopping has an advantage over an asphalt overlay in that
   the concrete surface is stronger and thus is more resistant to rutting
   and surface-initiated cracking.
   This research attempts to study the feasibility of whitetopping for
   resurfacing of thin asphalt pavements (less than 100 mm) in tropical and
   sub-tropical countries. Whitetopping pavement test track constructed at
   the acceleration testing facility in a tropical climate, at the Florida
   Department of Transportation (FDOT), was used for the study. A
   three-dimensional (3-D) finite element model (FEM) was developed to
   simulate the field conditions using SAP2000 structural analysis
   software. The developed model was verified with field measured strain
   data. The verified analytical model was used to perform a parametric
   study in order to find the sensitivity and effects of loading
   conditions, joint spacing, joint conditions, whitetopping thickness,
   asphalt thickness, interface bond between asphalt and whitetopping,
   elastic modulus of concrete and asphalt, base and subgrade layers and
   temperature differentials in concrete. This study found that the
   developed model can be used to estimate the maximum anticipated stresses
   in whitetopping pavements.
   The research revealed that ultra thin whitetopping pavement (less than
   50 mm thick) is not suitable for resurfacing of thin asphalt pavements.
   A minimum concrete thickness of 60 mm and 80 mm is required for a 80 mm
   asphalt thickness with a joint spacing of 0.9 m for axle load controlled
   at 80 KN (18 kips) and 98 KN (22 kips), respectively. The parametric
   study revealed that the minimum thickness needs to be adjusted with
   other design parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare the axial stiffness, maximum axial displacement,
   and ring deformation during axial loading of single complete and
   incomplete circular (ring) external skeletal fixator constructs.
   Sample-32 groups of single ring constructs (5 constructs/group).
   Procedures-Single ring constructs assembled with 2 divergent
   1.6-mm-diameter Kirschner wires were used to stabilize a 60-mm-long
   segment of 16-mm-diameter acetyl resin rod. Construct variables included
   ring type (complete or incomplete), ring diameter (50, 66, 84, or 118
   mm), and fixation wire tension (0, 30, 60, or 90 kg). Axial loading was
   performed with a materials testing system. Construct secant stiffness
   and maximum displacement were calculated from the load-displacement
   curves generated for each construct. Ring deformation was calculated by
   comparing ring diameter during and after construct loading to ring
   diameter prior to testing.
   Results-Complete ring constructs had greater axial stiffness than did
   the 66-, 84-, and 118-mm-diameter incomplete ring constructs. As
   fixation wire tension increased, construct stiffness increased in the
   66-, 84-, and 118-mm-diameter incomplete ring constructs. Maximum axial
   displacement decreased with increasing fixation wire tension, and
   complete ring constructs allowed less displacement than did incomplete
   ring constructs. Incomplete rings were deformed by wire tensioning and
   construct loading.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Mechanical performance of the 66-,
   84-, and 118-mm-diameter incomplete ring constructs improved when wire
   tension was applied, but these constructs were not as stiff as and
   allowed greater displacement than did complete ring constructs of
   comparable diameter. For clinical practice, tensioning the wires placed
   on 84- and 118-mm-diameter incomplete rings to 60 kg is recommended. (Am

Abstract = {{Single event rates (SER) can include contributions from low-energy
   particles such that the linear energy transfer (LET) is not constant.
   Previous work found that the environmental description that is most
   relevant to the low-energy contribution to the rate is a ``stopping rate
   per unit volume{''} even when the physical mechanisms for a single-event
   effect do not require an ion to stop in some device region. Stopping
   rate tables are presented for four heavy-ion environments that are
   commonly used to assess device suitability for space applications. A
   conservative rate estimate utilizing limited test data is derived, and
   the example of SEGR rate in a power MOSFET is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative networks provide enhanced system performance by exploiting
   spatial diversity in a distributed manner. Optimum resource allocation
   can help improve the performance of cooperative networks and increase
   the efficiency of resource usage. In the literature, various system
   performance and optimization results have been reported for different
   systems and with different optimization metrics. However, there lacks a
   unifying framework delineating the effects of different factors on
   resource optimization and the resultant benefit. In this paper, we
   investigate the relative effects of optimization metric (error rate
   versus outage probability), modulation type (coherent versus
   differential) and relaying protocol (amplify-and-forward (AF) versus
   decode-and-forward (DF)). To facilitate such a case study, we provide a
   comprehensive set of system performance for four commonly adopted
   cooperative systems: coherent amplify-and-forward (CAF), coherent
   decode-and-forward (CDF), differential amplify-and-forward (DAF), and
   differential decode-and-forward (DDF). A resource optimization problem
   that minimizes the total transmit energy is formulated. Since energy
   optimization has been intensively studied in the literature, location
   optimization will be investigated. The analyses and simulations suggest
   that: i) The error rate and outage probability metrics yield similar
   optimization results for AF relaying systems; ii) The relaying protocol
   determines the optimization results while the modulation type has no
   effect; and iii) The difference between different relaying protocols
   diminishes when the number of relays increases.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{A technique is presented to invert full waveforms using a genetic
   algorithm. The inversion scheme is based on a finite-difference solution
   of the 2-D elastic wave equation in the time-distance domain. The
   strength of this approach is the ability to generate all possible wave
   types (body waves and surface waves, etc.) and thus to simulate complex
   seismic wavefields that are then compared with observed data to infer
   subsurface properties. The capability of this inversion technique is
   tested with both synthetic and real experimental data sets. The
   inversion results from synthetic data show the ability of characterizing
   both low- and high-velocity layers, and the inversion results from real
   data are generally consistent with crosshole, SPT N-value, and material
   log results, including the identification of a buried low-velocity
   layer. Based upon the cases presented, coupling of global optimization
   with full waveforms is computationally practical, as the results
   presented herein were all achieved in about two hours of computer time
   on a standard laptop computer.}},

Title = {{Role of flue gas components in mercury oxidation over TiO2 supported
   MnOx-CeO2 mixed-oxide at low temperature}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{243}},
Pages = {{117-123}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{MnOx-CeO2 mixed-oxide supported on TiO2 (Mn-Ce/Ti) was synthesized by an
   ultrasound-assisted impregnation method and employed to oxidize
   elemental mercury (Hg-0) at 200 degrees C in simulated coal combustion
   flue gas. Over 90\% of Hg-0 oxidation was achieved on the Mn-Ce/Ti
   catalyst at 200 degrees C under simulated flue gas representing those
   from burning low-rank coals with a high gas hourly space velocity of
   60,000 h(-1). Gas-phase O-2 regenerated the lattice oxygen and
   replenished the chemisorbed oxygen, which facilitated Hg-0 oxidation.
   HCl was the most effective flue gas component responsible for Hg-0
   oxidation. 10 ppm HCl plus 4\% O-2 resulted in 100\% Hg-0 oxidation
   under the experimental conditions. SO2 competed with Hg-0 for active
   sites, thus deactivating the catalyst's capability in oxidizing Hg-0. NO
   covered the active sites and consumed surface oxygen active for Hg-0
   oxidation, hence limiting Hg-0 oxidation. Water vapor showed prohibitive
   effect on Hg-0 oxidation due to its competition with HCl and Hg-0 for
   active adsorption sites. This study provides information about the
   promotional or inhibitory effects of individual flue gas components on
   Hg-0 oxidation over a highly effective Mn-Ce/Ti catalyst. Such knowledge
   is of fundamental importance for industrial applications of the Mn-Ce/Ti
   catalyst in coal-fired power plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is needed for
   determining agricultural water demand and reservoir losses and driving
   hydrologic simulation models. This study was conducted to explore the
   application of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's
   (NCEP's) Global Forecast System (GFS) retrospective forecast
   (reforecast) dataset combined with the NCEP-U.S. Department of Energy
   (DOE) Reanalysis 2 dataset (R2) to forecast ET0 in the southeastern
   United States using a forecast analog approach. Seven approaches of
   estimating ET0 using the Penman-Monteith (PM) and Thornthwaite equations
   were evaluated by substitution of climatological mean values of
   variables or by bias correcting variables including solar radiation,
   maximum temperature, and minimum temperature using the R2 dataset. The
   skill of both terciles and extremes (10th and 90th percentiles) were
   evaluated. Overall, for the ET0 forecast approaches that combined R2
   solar radiation with temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed from
   GFS, the reforecasts produced higher skill than methods that estimated
   parameters using GFS the reforecasts data only. The primary increase in
   skill was due to the use of relative humidity from the GFS reforecasts

Abstract = {{As the utilization of advanced composites in structural applications
   grows, the need for improving their through-thickness properties becomes
   imperative. Although the behavior of composite laminates under
   structural and thermal loads has received much attention with their
   growth in safety critical structures, more effort needs to go into
   selectively improving their electrical and thermal conductivities.
   Additionally, the ability to manufacture composite structures that can
   inherently monitor their own health will be exceedingly beneficial. This
   paper provides an overview of advances made towards multiscale composite
   manufacturing. Multiscale composites, especially with the use of carbon
   nanotubes, have been sought to provide enhanced structural
   (through-thickness) properties and increased electrical and thermal
   conductivities. This report will review the state of art in the
   manufacturing of multiscale composites, their scalability, and their
   inherent potential for multifunctionality. Current techniques mostly
   result in the application of carbon nanotubes throughout the entire
   laminates, rather than in selected areas. Subsequently, one of the main
   barriers, to the widespread use of carbon nanotube-applied composites,
   is an efficient mass-producible manufacturing process. This paper
   attempts to highlight the current knowledge gaps in this critical area
   of composites manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue cracking is a major problem in asphalt pavement. It would be
   beneficial for predictions of the fatigue life of asphalt mixtures to be
   made with minimal effort and time, both at the design stage and the
   operating stage of pavement. For practicality, the indirect tension
   (IDT) test has widely been used for testing both laboratory-made and
   field-cored mixtures; however, a fatigue test using the IDT test needs
   to be performed in the stress-controlled mode rather than in the
   strain-controlled mode. Results may not be comparable to those from
   other mixture tests, such as the flexural beam fatigue or uniaxial
   tension test, so this study employed the viscoelastic continuum damage
   (VECD) model. The C-1-S-1 curve, which is a final product of the VECD
   model, is known as a single-characteristic curve of an asphalt mixture
   and is independent of loading types. Three C-1-S-1 curves obtained from
   two fatigue tests and one monotonic strength test using the IDT test
   were similar when superimposed into a single C-1-S-1 curve, indicating
   that the VECD model can be applicable both to the IDT fatigue test and
   the strength test. This also indicates that the fatigue life of a
   mixture subjected to sinusoidal strain loading can be determined through
   the model's damage principles using the IDT test results. Consequently,
   a system for predicting the fatigue life of asphalt mixtures was
   developed. It is expected that the predictive system will be useful in
   estimating the fatigue life of asphalt mixtures fabricated in the
   laboratory and those cored from field pavements. DOI:

Abstract = {{We present a review of reliability issues in AlGaN/GaN and AlGaAs/GaAs
   high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as well as Heterojunction
   Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) in the AlGaAs/GaAs materials systems. Because
   of the complex nature and multi-faceted operation modes of these
   devices, reliability studies must go beyond the typical Arrhenius
   accelerated life tests. We review the electric field driven degradation
   in devices with different gate metallization, device dimensions,
   electric field mitigation techniques (such as source field plate), and
   the effect of device fabrication processes for both DC and RF stress
   conditions. We summarize the degradation mechanisms that limit the
   lifetime of these devices. A variety of contact and surface degradation
   mechanisms have been reported, but differ in the two device
   technologies: For HEMTs, the layers are thin and relatively lightly
   doped compared to HBT structures and there is a metal Schottky gate that
   is directly on the semiconductor. By contrast, the HBT relies on pn
   junctions for current modulation and has only Ohmic contacts. This leads
   to different degradation mechanisms for the two types of devices.}},

   Boeing Company specifications for the fuselage array application,
   including sensitivities of 32.1 mu V/Pa to 43.7 mu V/Pa, minimum
   detectable pressures as low as 40 dB (1 Hz bin at 1 kHz), confirmed
   bandwidths up to 20 kHz, >100 kHz resonant frequencies, and 3\%
   distortion limits between 160 and 172 dB sound pressure level. With this

Abstract = {{Blueberry spectral analysis can provide necessary wavelengths, for use
   in multispectral imaging that could be applied in blueberry yield
   estimation system. Samples of fruit and leaves were obtained from a
   commercial blueberry field in Waldo, Florida and an experimental field
   in Citra, Florida, USA in 2011. Samples were also collected in 2010 in
   Waldo. Seven representative southern highbush varieties were chosen for
   the experiment. Spectral reflectance was measured in the 200-2500 nm
   with an increment of 1 nm. Samples were divided into leaf, mature fruit,
   near-mature fruit, near-young fruit and young fruit. Normalised indices
   were used as the candidate variables for classification. Each index was
   composed of the two wavelengths that had the greatest difference in
   reflectance between two classes. Classification tree, principal
   component analysis (PCA) and multinomial logistic regression (MNR) were
   conducted to develop classification models. An MNR model with six
   wavelengths (233, 551, 554, 691, 699 and 1373 nm) performed the best for
   the 2011 dataset, with a prediction accuracy of 100\% for leaf and
   mature fruit, 97.8\% for young fruit, 97.9\% for near-young fruit and
   94.6\% for near-mature fruit. Four wavelengths (553, 688, 698 and 1373
   nm) were used in the classification models of two years' data with four
   classes (mature fruit, intermediate fruit, young fruit and leaf), and
   accuracies of 100\%, 100\%, 99\%, and 98.5\% were obtained for the
   classification of leaf, mature fruit, intermediate fruit and young
   fruit, respectively. An easy-to-use and low cost blueberry fruit
   detector could thus be developed using multispectral imaging. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In addition to improving oxygen permeability, modern silicone-hydrogel
   (SiHy) soft contact lenses (SCLs) exceed a limiting diffusive ion
   permeability to aqueous sodium chloride. Below the ion-permeability
   threshold, siloxane-based SCLs are prone to bind against the corneal
   epithelium. Salt permeability is argued to reflect indirectly water
   hydraulic permeability. However, no quantitative explanation is
   available to date for a threshold salt permeability. We hypothesize that
   molecular salt diffusion through a SCL supports the postlens tear film
   (PoLTF) by enhancing water flow into the PoLTF from the cornea. Higher
   salt concentrations in the PoLTF raise the osmotic pressure there
   relative to that in the cornea increasing osmotic water withdrawal from
   the cornea. The proposed osmotic-withdrawal mechanism successfully
   predicts a self-consistent threshold lens salt permeability when
   thin-film attractive binding forces are introduced. For the first time,
   we present a quantitative picture for the possible origin of a threshold
   salt permeability in SCL manufacture. (C) 2012 British Contact Lens

   computations simulate the experiments of Inoue and Wagner et al.. In
   Inoue's experiment, a 12.65-mm radius, 1.4-km-long overhead wire was
   employed, and in Wagner et al.'s experiment, a 21- or 25-mm radius,
   2.2-km-long overhead horizontal wire was employed. The critical electric
   field on the surface of the 12.65-mm-radius wire for corona initiation
   is set to E-0 = 1.4, 2.4, or 2.9 MV/m, and those for 21- and
   25-mm-radius wires are set to E-0 = 2.2 and 2.1 MV/m, respectively. The
   critical background electric field for streamer propagation is set to
   E-cp = 0.5 MV/m for positive voltage application and E-cn = 1.5 MV/m for
   negative voltage application. The FDTD-computed waveforms (including
   wavefront distortion and attenuation at later times) of surge voltages
   at three different distances from the energized end of the wire agree
   reasonably well with the corresponding measured waveforms. Also, the
   FDTD-computed waveforms of surge voltages induced on a nearby parallel
   bundled conductor agree fairly well with the corresponding measured
   waveforms.}},

Abstract = {{Strain and texture evolution (domain switching) of polycrystalline,
   ferroelectric BaTiO3 was investigated in four-point bending geometry.
   Lattice strains were measured by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction

   X-ray diffraction was found to be smaller relative to both bulk strain
   measured by conventional, contact-based techniques and elastically
   computed strain, and reasons for this inconsistency are discussed. A
   self-consistent model with capabilities of quantifying domain switching

Abstract = {{AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) with gate lengths
   of 0.14-0.17 mu m were electrically stressed under on-state (V-G = 0 V),
   off-state (V-G = -5 V) and typical operating conditions (V-G = -2 V) and
   subsequently illuminated with below band-gap light to monitor changes in
   drain current corresponding to the changes in trapping and de-trapping
   of carriers within the band-gap. The changes in drain current are
   indicators of a change in trap density as a result of electrical
   stressing, since the energy from a specific wavelength of light fills
   traps whose activation energies are less than or equal to that of the
   light source. Changes in trap densities were minimal after both
   off-state and on-state stressing but significant trap creation in the
   range E-C-0.4-0.6 eV were observed in HEMTs exhibiting gradual
   degradation during stressing. Energy levels corresponding to these
   values in the literature have been suggested to correlate with Ga-N and
   N-Ga substitutional defects, as well as Ga-I interstitials. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Today's peer-to-peer networks are designed based on the assumption that
   the participating nodes are cooperative, which does not hold in reality.
   Incentive mechanisms that promote cooperation must be introduced.
   However, the existing incentive schemes (using either reputation or
   virtual currency) suffer from various attacks based on false reports.
   Even worse, a colluding group of malicious nodes in a peer-to-peer
   network can manipulate the history information of its own members, and
   the damaging power increases dramatically with the group size. Such
   malicious nodes/collusions are difficult to detect, especially in a
   large network without a centralized authority. In this paper, we propose
   a new distributed incentive scheme, in which the amount that a node can
   benefit from the network is proportional to its contribution, malicious
   nodes can only attack others at the cost of their own interests, and a
   colluding group cannot gain advantage by cooperation regardless of its
   size. Consequently, the damaging power of colluding groups is strictly
   limited. The proposed scheme includes three major components: a
   distributed authority infrastructure, a key sharing protocol, and a
   contract verification protocol. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Site characterization for design of deep foundations is very crucial, as
   unanticipated site conditions still represent significant problems and
   disputes occur during construction. Traditional surface-based
   geophysical methods, which use wave velocity dispersion or first-arrival
   times, have been widely used recently to assess spatial variation:
   however they cannot well characterize reverse profiles or buried
   low-velocity zones. For better characterization of these challenging
   site conditions, a full waveform inversion based on Gauss-Newton method
   is presented. The inversion scheme is based on a finite-difference
   solution of the 2-D elastic wave equation in the time domain. The
   strength of this approach is the ability to generate all possible wave
   types of seismic wavefields that are then compared with observed data to
   infer complex subsurface properties. Virtual sources and reciprocity of
   wavefields are used for calculation of partial derivative wavefields to
   reduce computer time. Cross convolution between observed and estimated
   wavefields are also employed to allow the technique to be independent of
   the source signatures. The capability of the presented technique is
   tested with both synthetic and real experimental data sets. The
   inversion results from synthetic data show the ability of characterizing
   anomalies of low- and high-velocity zones, and the inversion results
   from real data are generally consistent with SPT N-value, including the
   identification of a buried low-velocity layer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{To model the kinetics of penetration of fluorescein across the cornea
   from the endothelial surface.
   Rabbit corneas mounted in vitro were exposed to fluorescein at their
   endothelial surface. Trans-corneal fluorescence were acquired
   periodically for 6 h using a custom-built confocal microfluorometer. The
   profiles were then employed to fit a kinetic model for calculation of
   permeability and diffusion coefficients across the cellular layers and
   stroma, respectively.
   At the endothelium-stroma and stroma-epithelium interfaces, the
   fluorescence profile exhibited sudden jumps. In each case, the
   fluorescence was higher at the stroma, indicating reduced partitioning
   of the dye into the lipid-rich cellular layers. The stroma did not swell
   significantly until 180 min of perfusion. The fluorescence profiles
   reached a pseudo-steady state at similar to 6 h. A transport model,
   which included convective and diffusive fluxes into the stroma, showed a
   good fit to the trans-corneal profiles at different time points. The
   estimated permeability coefficients for the cellular layers were close
   to the values reported previously, but the diffusion coefficient of
   fluorescein in the stroma was found to be smaller than the values
   obtained previously using Ussing chambers.
   The penetration of fluorescein could be modeled accurately by a
   combination of diffusion and convection.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of silver

   Silver NPs (average diameter 50 nm) were intravenously injected into
   pregnant CD-1 mice on gestation days (GDs) 7, 8, and 9 at dose levels of
   0, 35, or 66 mu g Ag/mouse. Mice were euthanised on GD10, and tissue
   samples were collected and analysed for silver content. Compared with
   control animals injected with citrate buffer vehicle, silver content was
   significantly increased (p < 0.05) in nearly all tissues from silver
   NP-treated mice. Silver accumulation was significantly higher in liver,
   spleen, lung, tail (injection site), visceral yolk sac, and endometrium
   compared with other organs from silver NP-treated mice. Furthermore,
   silver NPs were identified in vesicles in endodermal cells of the
   visceral yolk sac. In summary, the results demonstrated that silver NPs
   distributed to most maternal organs, extra-embryonic tissues, and
   embryos, but did not accumulate significantly in embryos.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Approximately 30\% of epilepsy patients suffer from medically
   refractory epilepsy, in which seizures can not controlled by the use of
   anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Understanding the mechanisms underlying
   these forms of drug-resistant epileptic seizures and the development of
   alternative effective treatment strategies are fundamental challenges
   for modern epilepsy research. In this context, computational modeling
   has gained prominence as an important tool for tackling the complexity
   of the epileptic phenomenon. In this review article, we present a survey
   of computational models of epilepsy from the point of view that epilepsy
   is a dynamical brain disease that is primarily characterized by
   unprovoked spontaneous epileptic seizures.
   Method: We introduce key concepts from the mathematical theory of
   dynamical systems, such as multi-stability and bifurcations, and explain
   how these concepts aid in our understanding of the brain mechanisms
   involved in the emergence of epileptic seizures.
   Results: We present a literature survey of the different computational
   modeling approaches that are used in the study of epilepsy. Special
   emphasis is placed on highlighting the fine balance between the degree
   of model simplification and the extent of biological realism that
   modelers seek in order to address relevant questions. In this context,
   we discuss three specific examples from published literature, which
   exemplify different approaches used for developing computational models
   of epilepsy. We further explore the potential of recently developed
   optogenetics tools to provide novel avenue for seizure control.
   Conclusion: We conclude with a discussion on the utility of
   computational models for the development of new epilepsy treatment
   protocols. (C) 2012 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A substantial body of the literature exists addressing the capacity of
   wireless networks. However, it is commonly assumed that all nodes in the
   network are identical. The issue of heterogeneity has not been embraced
   into the discussions. In this paper, we investigate the throughput
   capacity of heterogeneous wireless networks with general network
   settings. Specifically, we consider an extended network with n normal
   nodes and m = n(b) (0 <= b <= 1) more powerful helping nodes in a
   rectangular area with width s(n) and length n/s(n), where s(n) = n(w)
   and 0 <= w <= 1/2. We assume that there are n flows in the network. All
   the n normal nodes are sources while only randomly chosen n(d) (0 <= d
   <= 1) normal nodes are destinations. We further assume that the n normal
   nodes are uniformly and independently distributed, while the m helping
   nodes are either regularly placed or uniformly and independently
   distributed, resulting in two different kinds of networks called Regular
   Heterogeneous Wireless Networks and Random Heterogeneous Wireless
   Networks, respectively. We show that network capacity is determined by
   the shape of the network area, the number of destination nodes, the
   number of helping nodes, and the bandwidth of helping nodes. We also
   find that heterogeneous wireless networks can provide throughput higher
   in the order sense than traditional homogeneous wireless networks only
   under certain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In a cognitive radio network, primary service providers (PSPs) set
   prices for the vacant licensed bands and sell/lease them for pecuniary
   gains while the secondary service provider (SSP) can buy/rent the bands
   and support opportunistic spectrum accessing (OSA). However, due to the
   unpredictable activities of primary services, the SSP may suffer the
   monetary risk or failure to meet the traffic demands from the secondary
   users (SUs). It is challenging for the SSP to measure the risk for OSA,
   to choose the bands to use, and to split the traffic on the band-mix,
   when there are multiple vacant bands from PSPs. In this paper, we first
   introduce the X loss, an intuitive measurement for the risk for OSA.
   Although the X loss is attractively simple, it underestimates the
   potential risk for OSA and is mathematically not subadditive, which
   makes it difficult to support the band-mix selection for traffic
   splitting. To overcome this problem, we propose a more suitable risk
   measurement, which is subadditive and consistent with the SSP's
   perception of the risk. Based on the proposed risk metric, we formulate
   the band-mix selection problem as an optimization problem and solve it
   by linear programming.}},

Abstract = {{Material compliance has been shown to be a predictor of vascular graft
   patency and as such is a critical parameter when designing new

   These investigations describe an approach to modulate the mechanical
   properties of an ex vivo derived scaffold by machining variable
   (discrete) wall thicknesses to control compliance. Human umbilical
   arteries (HUAs) were machine lathed directly from the umbilical cord at
   wall thicknesses of 250, 500, 750, and 1000 mu m then decellularized
   using 1\% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Compliance over physiological
   pressures, increased from 3.08 +/- 1.84\% to 11.47 +/- 4.11\% as direct
   function of each discrete vessel diameter. Radial stress strain analysis
   revealed primary and secondary failure points attributed to the discrete
   layers within the anisotropic scaffold. Maximum strength and suture
   retention were shown to increase with increasing wall thickness, by
   contrast stress failure decreased with increasing thickness due to
   increasing proportions of the mechanically weaker amorphous Wharton's
   jelly. Reseeded smooth muscle cells were shown to adhere, proliferate,
   and migrate from the scaffold surface showing the potential of the HUA
   as a mechanically tunable material with applications as an acellular
   implant or as a tissue engineered construct. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The phenomenon in which demand variability increases as one moves
   upstream in the supply chain has been often observed in practice. This
   so-called ``bullwhip effect{''} often increases upstream operations
   costs, including inventory holding and transportation costs. Price
   variations are considered to be one of the primary causes of the
   bullwhip effect, and thus everyday low price (EDLP) strategies are
   commonly recommended to counter the negative impacts of the bullwhip
   effect. However, trade promotions continue to play an important role in
   the U.S. supermarket industry as well as other industries. This paper
   investigates this apparent inconsistency between the literature and
   practice by employing a deterministic, two-stage supply chain model
   composed of a single supplier and a single retailer. We demonstrate that
   even though the use of trade promotions can indeed increase a retailer's
   and supplier's operations costs, these costs may be more than offset by
   increased revenues, even in the absence of explicit coordination. That
   is, if the supplier judiciously applies a trade promotion strategy and
   the retailer passes some of this discount to its customers, then under
   certain conditions, the resulting supply chain profit can exceed that
   under an EDLP strategy. We provide a broad set of computational results
   that validate this conclusion and discuss the resulting managerial
   insights. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Wind Speed Perception and Risk}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: How accurately do people perceive extreme wind speeds and
   how does that perception affect the perceived risk? Prior research on
   human-wind interaction has focused on comfort levels in urban settings
   or knock-down thresholds. No systematic experimental research has
   attempted to assess people's ability to estimate extreme wind speeds and
   perceptions of their associated risks.
   Method: We exposed 76 people to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mph (4.5,
   8.9, 13.4, 17.9, 22.3, and 26.8 m/s) winds in randomized orders and
   asked them to estimate wind speed and the corresponding risk they felt.
   Results: Multilevel modeling showed that people were accurate at lower
   wind speeds but overestimated wind speeds at higher levels. Wind speed
   perceptions mediated the direct relationship between actual wind speeds
   and perceptions of risk (i.e., the greater the perceived wind speed, the
   greater the perceived risk). The number of tropical cyclones people had
   experienced moderated the strength of the actual-perceived wind speed
   relationship; consequently, mediation was stronger for people who had
   experienced fewer storms.
   Conclusion: These findings provide a clearer understanding of wind and
   risk perception, which can aid development of public policy solutions
   toward communicating the severity and risks associated with natural
   disasters.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the magnetic-field-and temperature-dependent transport
   properties of CVD-grown graphene transferred to a flexible substrate
   (Kapton) and subjected to externally applied strain. In zero magnetic
   field, a logarithmic temperature-dependent conductivity correction,
   resulting from strong electron-electron interaction, becomes weaker with
   the application of strains as large as 0.6\% because of an increased
   rate of chiral-symmetry-breaking scattering. With the application of a
   perpendicular magnetic field, we also observe positive
   magnetoconductance at low temperature (T = 5 K) due to weak
   localization. This magnetoconductance is suppressed with increasing
   strain, concomitant with a rapid decrease of the intervalley scattering
   rate (tau(-1)(i)). Our results are in good agreement with theoretical
   expectations and are consistent with a strain-induced decoupling between
   graphene and its underlying Kapton substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial mapping of strain fields within compressed carbon nanotube (CNT)
   array columns is achieved using digital image correlation (DIC) analysis

   Full-field displacement and strain maps are generated based upon the

   speckle pattern for DIC analysis. The deformation modes and CNT array
   buckling characteristics vary systematically as a function of column
   aspect ratio, including bending, crushing, and bottom-up buckle
   accumulation behaviors. In spite of disparate appearing deformation
   modes, strain maps indicate that CNT array buckling consistently
   initiates at 5\% local principal strain (?2) for all columns. The
   ability to quantitatively assess the deformation modes and buckling
   behavior of CNT arrays at the nanoscale will enable their improved
   design for high-strain electrical contacts, compliant thermal
   interfaces, force sensors, energy-absorbing foams, or other

Abstract = {{Solvent additives provide an effective means to alter the morphology and
   thereby improve the performance of organic bulk-heterojunction
   photovoltaics, although guidelines for selecting an appropriate solvent
   additive remain relatively unclear. Here, a family of solvent additives
   spanning a wide range of Hansen solubility parameters is applied to a
   molecular bulk-heterojunction system consisting of an isoindigo and
   thiophene containing oligomer as the electron donor and
   {[}6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the electron
   acceptor. Hansen solubility parameters are calculated using the group
   contribution method and compared with the measured solubilities for use
   as a screening method in solvent additive selection. The additives are
   shown to alter the morphologies in a semipredictable manner, with the
   poorer solvents generally resulting in decreased domain sizes, increased
   hole mobilities, and improved photovoltaic performance. The additives
   with larger hydrogen bonding parameters, namely triethylene glycol (TEG)
   and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), are demonstrated to increase the open
   circuit voltage by similar to 0.2 V. Combining a solvent additive
   observed to increase short circuit current, poly(dimethylsiloxane), with
   TEG results in an increase in power conversion efficiency from 1.4 to
   3.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Protein binding in hydrogels adversely affects their performance and can
   interfere with their usage in several biomedical applications including
   contact lenses. In this study we focus on understanding and modeling the
   mechanisms of protein transport in hydrogels, specifically focusing on
   the effect of protein concentration and gel crosslinking on transport.
   Specifically, we focus on lysozyme, the most abundant protein in tear
   fluid, and hydrogels of poly-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (p-HEMA), a
   common contact lens material. Protein uptake experiments with gels of
   different thicknesses showed a time scale increase as the square of the
   thickness suggesting diffusion controlled transport. Partition
   coefficient was found to be dependent on the equilibrium concentration
   of lysozyme, and also on the degree of crosslinking. Since transport is
   related to mesh size, gel modulus was obtained for various crosslinkings
   and utilized to estimate the mesh size. The transport data were fitted
   to a diffusion model and the fitted diffusivity was compared to
   diffusivity predicted from a model based on hydrogel mesh size. Both
   protein absorption and desorption data fitted the diffusion model with
   the same value of diffusivity, but the experimentally measured
   diffusivities were significantly smaller than those estimated on the
   basis of the gel mesh size. Models were modified to take into account
   protein binding to the polymer but the modified predictions were still
   larger than the measured values. The results of this study could assist
   in the development of contact lens materials that exhibit minimal
   protein binding, in designing cleaning regimens for protein removal from
   contact lenses, and in applications related to protein binding in
   several other biomaterials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene, which is mechanically flexible, electrically conductively, and
   optically nearly transparent, is a promising contact material in
   semiconductor devices such as solar cells and touch screen sensors. We
   present a method of obtaining the barrier height and transport
   properties of graphene-silicon contacts by self-consistently solving the
   Poisson equation and carrier transport equation. It is found that the
   contact barrier height is sensitive to the doping density of silicon and
   can be modulated by gating, in contrast to conventional
   metal-semiconductor contacts. Despite of being a continuous film, the
   contact resistance of a monolayer graphene to silicon can be modulated
   by orders of magnitude by using a bottom gate. The modulation of the
   contact resistance decreases significantly as the number of graphene
   layers increases and becomes negligible when the number of the graphene
   layers is larger than about 6. The results indicate the unique
   properties of graphene-semiconductor contacts. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{An in situ measurement technique is developed and presented, which
   utilizes x-rays from a synchrotron source with a two-dimensional
   detector to measure thin film microstructural and crystallographic
   evolution during heating. A demonstration experiment is also shown
   wherein the measured diffraction patterns are used to describe phase and
   texture evolution during heating and crystallization of solution-derived
   thin films. The diffraction images are measured sequentially while
   heating the thin film with an infrared lamp. Data reduction
   methodologies and representations are also outlined to extract phase and
   texture information from the diffraction images as a function of time
   and temperature. These techniques and data reduction methods are
   demonstrated during crystallization of solution-derived lead zirconate
   titanate ferroelectric thin films heated at a rate of 30 degrees C/min
   and using an acquisition time of 8 s. During heating and
   crystallization, a PtxPb type phase was not observed. A pyrochlore phase
   was observed prior to the formation and growth of the perovskite phase.
   The final crystallized films are observed to have both 111 and 100
   texture components. The in situ measurement methodology developed in
   this work allows for acquiring diffraction images in times as low as
   0.25 s and can be used to investigate changes during crystallization at
   faster heating rates. Moreover, the experiments are shown to provide
   unique information during materials processing. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{This work investigated the effect of different surface modification
   methods, including oxidization, surfactant coating, and humic acid
   coating, on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) stability and their
   mobility in granular porous media under various conditions.
   Characterization and stability studies demonstrated that the three
   surface modification methods were all effective in solubilizing and
   stabilizing the SWNTs in aqueous solutions. Packed sand column
   experiments showed that although the three surface medication methods
   showed different effect on the retention and transport of SWNTs in the
   columns, all the modified SWNTs were highly mobile. Compared with the
   other two surface modification methods, the humic acid coating method
   introduced the highest mobility to the SWNTs. While reductions in
   moisture content in the porous media could promote the retention of the
   surface modified SWNTs in some sand columns, results from bubble column
   experiment suggested that only oxidized SWNTs were retention in
   unsaturated porous media through attachment on air-water interfaces.
   Other mechanisms such as grain surface attachment and thin-water film
   straining could also be responsible for the retention of the SWNTs in
   unsaturated porous media. An advection-dispersion model was successfully
   applied to simulate the experimental data of surface modified SWNT
   retention and transport in porous media. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{The properties of phosphorus doped ZnO thin films grown on sapphire by
   pulsed laser deposition were examined, specifically focusing on the
   effects of undoped ZnO buffer layers. In particular, buffer layers were
   grown under different conditions; the transport properties of
   as-deposited and rapid thermal annealed ZnO : P films were then
   examined. As-deposited films showed n-type conductivity. After rapid
   thermal annealing, the film on buffer layer grown at a low temperature
   showed the conversion of carrier type to p-type for specific growth
   conditions while the films deposited on buffer layer grown at a high
   temperature remained n-type regardless of growth condition. The films
   deposited on buffer layer grown at a low temperature showed higher
   resistivity and more significant change of the transport properties upon
   rapid thermal annealing. These results suggest that more dopants are
   incorporated in films with higher defect density. This is consistent
   with high resolution x-ray diffraction results for phosphorus doped ZnO
   films on different buffer layers. In addition, the microstructure of
   phosphorus doped ZnO films is substantially affected by the buffer
   layer.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently issued new rules for
   using ceftiofur in food animals in part because of an increasing
   prevalence of enteric bacteria that are resistant to 3rd-generation
   cephalosporins. Parenteral ceftiofur treatment, however, has limited
   effects on enteric bacteria so we tested the hypothesis that excreted
   ceftiofur metabolites exert significant selection pressure for
   ceftiofur-resistant Escherichia coli in soil. Test matrices were
   prepared by mixing soil with bovine feces and adding urine containing
   ceftiofur metabolites (CFM) (0 ppm, similar to 50 ppm and similar to 100
   ppm). Matrices were incubated at 23 degrees C or 4 degrees C for
   variable periods of time after which residual CFM was quantified using a
   bioassay. Bla(CMY-2) plasmid-bearing ceftiofur resistant (cef(R)) E.
   coli and one-month old calves were used to study the selection effects
   of CFM and transmission of cef(R) bacteria from the environment back to
   animals. Our studies showed that urinary CFM (similar to 13 ppm final
   concentration) is biologically degraded in soil within 2.7 days at 23
   degrees C, but persists up to 23.3 days at 4 degrees C. Even short-term
   persistence in soil provides a >1 log(10) advantage to resistant E. coli
   populations, resulting in significantly prolonged persistence of these
   bacteria in the soil (similar to two months). We further show that
   resistant strains readily colonize calves by contact with contaminated
   bedding and without antibiotic selection pressure. Ceftiofur metabolites
   in urine amplify resistant E. coli populations and, if applicable to
   field conditions, this effect is far more compelling than reported
   selection in vivo after parenteral administration of ceftiofur. Because
   ceftiofur degradation is temperature dependent, these compounds may
   accumulate during colder months and this could further enhance selection
   as seasonal temperatures increase. If cost-effective engineered
   solutions can be developed to limit ex vivo selection, this may limit
   proliferation for ceftiofur resistant enteric bacteria while preserving
   the ability to use this important antibiotic in food animal production.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of a recently developed concurrent
   atomistic continuum (CAC) methodology in coarse-grained (CG) atomistic
   simulations of dislocation nucleation and migration in face-centered
   cubic (fcc) Al, Ni and Cu crystals, using an EAM force field and an
   adaptive mesh refinement strategy. The CAC method is based on recently
   developed atomistic field theory (AFT) that frames the problem in terms
   of a continuum field representation of lattice and sublattice atomic
   arrangements. Four sets of CG models with different finite element mesh
   refinement are constructed to test the accuracy and efficiency of the CG
   method relative to full molecular dynamics (MD). Simulation results show
   that the CG method is able to reproduce key phenomena of dislocation
   dynamics in initially defect free fcc crystals, including strain bursts
   caused by dislocation nucleation and migration, the structure of leading
   and trailing partial dislocations separated by equilibrium stacking
   faults in Al, formation of intrinsic stacking fault ribbons in Ni and
   Cu, and 3D migration of curved dislocations, all comparable with results
   of MD simulations. CG simulations have also revealed that the yield
   strength of Al depends on the thickness of the specimens as well as the
   operative deformation mechanisms. The effects of mesh size and adaptive
   mesh refinement on CG simulation results are analyzed and discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{A new synthesis was developed to create highly porous nanocomposite
   material consisting of MgO nanoflakes within a biochar matrix that has
   high sorption ability for ionic contaminations. The synthesis method was
   used in laboratory to produce MgO-biochar nanocomposites from a variety
   of carbon-rich biomass. Physical and chemical properties of the
   synthesized nanocomposites were studied systematically with X-ray powder
   diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy,
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive
   X-ray analysis. In addition, batch sorption experiment was conducted to
   determine the sorption ability of the MgO-biochar nanocomposites to
   aqueous phosphate and nitrate. The results showed that the MgO
   nano-flakes have uniform morphologies and disperse uniformly on the
   surface of the biochar matrix. HR-TEM indicated that the biochar matrix
   is mesoporous with average pore size of 50 nm and the MgO nano-flakes
   have spacing between 2 and 4 nm, which can serve as adsorption sites for
   anions. As a result, all the tested MgO-biochar nanocomposites showed
   excellent removal efficiencies to phosphate and nitrate in water.
   Nanocomposites made from sugar beet tailings and peanut shells had the
   best performances with Langmuir adsorption capacities as high as 835 mg
   g(-1) for phosphate and 95 mg g(-1) for nitrate, respectively, much
   higher than the reported values of other adsorbents. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   heavy metals}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{210}},
Pages = {{557-563}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Although carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are well known to have a strong
   affinity to various heavy metals in aqueous solution, little research
   has been dedicated to exploit their use in fixed-bed water treatment
   systems (e.g., trickling filters). in this work, batch sorption and
   fixed-bed experiments were conducted to examine the ability of
   functionalized multi-walled CNTs as filter media to remove two heavy
   metal ions (Pb2+ and Cu2+) from infiltrating water. Batch sorption
   experiments confirmed the strong sorption affinity of the CNTs for Pb2+
   and Cu2+ in both single and dual metal solution systems. In addition,
   sonication-promoted dispersion of the CNT particles enhanced their heavy
   metal sorption capacity by 23.9-32.2\%. For column experiments,
   laboratory-scale fixed-bed columns were packed with CNTs and natural
   quartz sand by three different packing: layered, mixed, and deposited.
   While all the three packing methods enhanced the fixed-bed filtering
   efficiency of Pb2+ and Cu2+ from single and dual metal systems, the
   CNT-deposited packing method was superior. Although the amount of the
   CNTs added into the fixed-bed columns was only 0.006\% (w/w) of the
   sand, they significantly improved the fixed-bed's filtering efficiency
   of Pb2+ and Cu2+ by 55-75\% and 31-57\%, respectively. Findings from
   this study demonstrate that functionalized multi-walled CNTs, together
   with natural sand, can be used to effectively and safely remove heavy
   metals from water. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT}},

Pages = {{1965-1973}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The remaining useful life of a system can be predicted from available
   data and/or physical models, which is commonly known as prognosis. In
   this paper, the remaining useful life (e.g., the number of cycles to
   failure) of a system experiencing fatigue crack growth is estimated
   using a simple physical model. This paper shows that a simple model,
   such as the Paris model with an assumed analytical stress-intensity
   factor, can be used for complex geometries by compensating for the error
   in the assumed stress-intensity factor by adjusting model parameters.
   The adjustment is done automatically by a process of Bayesian
   identification. True damage growth is simulated using the extended
   finite-element method to model the effects of crack location and
   geometry on the relationship between crack size and stress-intensity
   factor. The detection process of crack size using structural health
   monitoring systems is modeled by adding random noise and a deterministic
   bias to the simulated damage growth. Equivalent model parameters are
   then identified using the Bayesian inference, from which the remaining
   useful life is estimated. Using three examples of damage geometries, it
   is shown that the remaining useful life estimates are accurate even with
   the use of an assumed analytical stress-intensity factor.}},

Abstract = {{Rain sensors are devices that connect to automatic irrigation systems to
   interrupt scheduled irrigation events as a result of rainfall. The
   objectives of this study were to evaluate the dry-out time of
   expanding-disk rain sensors and determine potential irrigation savings
   under several virtual irrigation schedules. Five rain sensor
   model/rainfall set point combinations were evaluated at a research site
   in north central Florida. The five configurations that were compared
   were Mini-Clik rain sensors with set points of 3, 6, and 13 mm (3MC,
   6MC, and 13MC), the Wireless Rain-Clik (WL) rain sensor, and Toro rain
   sensor at 6 mm setting (6T). The evaluation period ranged from 1,150
   days to 1,182 days across the various devices. For each configuration,
   data for each time a rain sensor switched between allow irrigation to
   interrupt irrigation modes were collected and compared with how long
   each stayed in interrupt mode and how much irrigation water a rain
   sensor could save. Changing the dry-out vents from fully open to fully
   closed increased the dry-out time by 14\%(3 h) but had no influence on
   irrigation savings. The hygroscopic disks significantly dry out 2 or 3 h
   after decreasing relative humidity and increasing temperature and solar
   radiation. Frequent irrigations such as 3 days/week or higher schedules
   had more potential savings than less frequent schedules. Savings for the
   WL, 3MC, 6MC, 13MC, and 6T treatments were 9, 11, 5, 8, and 5\%,
   respectively, compared with a schedule without a rain sensor. Lower set
   points trended toward higher percent irrigation reduction. Six
   irrigation schedules were included in the analysis with irrigation depth
   following University of Florida Institute of Agricultural and Food
   Sciences net irrigation requirement recommendations: 1, 2, 3, and 7
   days/week with changing irrigation depth based on recommendations,
   homeowner (HO, 2 days/week irrigation year round at annual peak ET), and
   without rain sensor (WORS, 2 days/week). Comparing schedules with WORS,
   the average percent water savings for 1, 2, 3, 7 days/week, and HO were
   6, 8, 10, 28, and -28\%, respectively. DOI:

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration-based irrigation controllers, also known as
   weather-based irrigation controllers, are a new water-saving technology
   that use evapotranspiration (ET) estimates to schedule irrigation. Many
   ET controllers have the ability to incorporate rainfall events into
   irrigation scheduling using onsite sensors attached to the controller or
   weather updates through weather-monitoring services. The Toro
   Intelli-Sense controller can use an onsite rain sensor (rain switch)
   that immediately interrupts irrigation or a weather service that causes
   the controller to enter a rain pause mode to incorporate rainfall into
   irrigation scheduling. Four treatments were created using the
   combination of rain delay features: no rain delay features (TN), rain
   pause (TRP), rain switch (TRS), and both rain delay features (TRP-RS). A
   fixed-time irrigation schedule with a rain switch and a fixed-time
   irrigation schedule without a rain switch were created for comparison:
   T, timer with a rain switch; and TWORS, timer without a rain switch.
   During relatively dry periods (72\% below historical seasonal rainfall)
   neither rain pause nor the rain switch resulted in irrigation reduction.
   However, during periods of rainfall (84\% of historically rainy days),
   both features resulted in significant irrigation savings. The
   combination of rain switch and rain pause reduced irrigation 41\%
   compared with the use of no rain features, whereas the rain pause
   feature alone saved 25\%. Because of the variability of rainfall in
   humid climates, using both a rain switch and the rain pause feature is
   recommended to delay irrigation on the Toro Intelli-Sense controller.

Abstract = {{Reconstructing the topology of a signaling network by means of RNA
   interference (RNAi) technology is an underdetermined problem especially
   when a single gene in the network is knocked down or observed. In
   addition, the exponential search space limits the existing methods to
   small signaling networks of size 10-15 genes. In this paper, we propose
   integrating RNAi data with a reference physical interaction network. We
   formulate the problem of signaling network reconstruction as finding the
   minimum number of edit operations on a given reference network. The edit
   operations transform the reference network to a network that satisfies
   the RNAi observations. We show that using a reference network does not
   simplify the computational complexity of the problem. Therefore, we
   propose two methods which provide near optimal results and can scale
   well for reconstructing networks up to hundreds of components. We
   validate the proposed methods on synthetic and real data sets.
   Comparison with the state of the art on real signaling networks shows
   that the proposed methodology can scale better and generates
   biologically significant results.}},

Title = {{Work-based criterion for particle motion and implication for turbulent
   bed-load transport}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A simple work-based criterion for the onset of downstream migration of a
   particle sitting on a rough bed in a turbulent flow is developed in the
   present work. The criterion is motivated by the fact that the geometric
   pocket formed by other bed particles within which the mobile particle is
   sitting can be viewed as a potential well and the gravitational and
   frictional mechanisms impose an energy barrier for the particle to fully
   escape the pocket and initiate irreversible downstream migration. The
   energy barrier is clearly a statistical quantity, as it depends on the
   shape, size, and other details of the mobile particle and the geometry
   of the pocket. The energy barrier imposes a threshold value for the
   hydrodynamic work that must be done on the particle in order to initiate
   downstream migration. The simple work-based criterion developed here is
   related to the critical force and critical impulse criteria that have
   been advanced in the past. The fluctuating nature of the effective
   hydrodynamic force that works towards dislodging the particle out of the
   pocket and migrating it downstream is explored with data from a direct
   numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow and the probabilities of
   instances when the force, impulse, and work-based criteria for particle
   motion are satisfied and computed. The work-based criterion for particle
   migration is used to obtain an expression for the bed load transport
   that can be applied on an instantaneous basis at any local region of the
   bed. The average nondimensional bed load transport rate, or Einstein
   number, computed based on the present work-based model is shown to
   compare well with existing experimental data and empirical models. In
   particular, at low mobility regime, the present model is able to
   naturally recover the well-accepted rapid increase in bed load transport
   as 16th power of average bed shear stress and at high mobility regime
   the present model captures the slower increase in bed load transport
   with increasing average bed shear stress. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Title = {{Interaction of a planar shock wave with a dense particle curtain:
   Modeling and experiments}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The interaction of a planar shock wave with a dense particle curtain is
   investigated through modeling and experiments. The physics in the
   interaction between a shock wave with a dense gas-particle mixture is
   markedly differently from that with a dilute mixture. Following the
   passage of the shock wave, the dense particle curtain expands rapidly as
   it propagates downstream and pressures equilibrate throughout the flow
   field. In the simulations, the particles are viewed as point-particles
   and are traced in a Lagrangian framework. A physics-based model is then
   developed to account for interphase coupling. Compared to the standard
   drag law, four major improvements are made in the present interphase
   coupling model to take into account: (1) unsteady force contributions to
   particle force; (2) effect of compressibility on hydrodynamic forces;
   (3) effect of particle volume fraction on hydrodynamic forces; (4)
   effect of inter-particle collision. The complex behavior of the dense
   particle curtain is due to the interplay between two-way coupling,
   finite particle inertia, and unsteady forces. Incorporation of these
   effects through significant modeling improvements is essential for the
   simulation results to agree well with the experimental data. As a result
   of the large pressure gradient inside the particle curtain, the unsteady
   forces remain significant for a long time compared to the quasi-steady
   force and greatly influence the particle curtain motion. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Ocean Afforestation, more precisely Ocean Macroalgal Afforestation
   (OMA), has the potential to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide
   concentrations through expanding natural populations of macroalgae,
   which absorb carbon dioxide, then are harvested to produce biomethane
   and biocarbon dioxide via anaerobic digestion. The plant nutrients
   remaining after digestion are recycled to expand the algal forest and
   increase fish populations. A mass balance has been calculated from known
   data and applied to produce a life cycle assessment and economic
   analysis. This analysis shows the potential of Ocean Afforestation to
   produce 12 billion tons per year of biomethane while storing 19 billion
   tons of CO2 per year directly from biogas production, plus up to 34
   billion tons per year from carbon capture of the biomethane combustion
   exhaust. These rates are based on macro-algae forests covering 9\% of
   the world's ocean surface, which could produce sufficient biomethane to
   replace all of today's needs in fossil fuel energy, while removing 53
   billion tons of CO2 per year from the atmosphere, restoring
   pre-industrial levels. This amount of biomass could also increase
   sustainable fish production to potentially provide 200 kg/yr/person for
   10 billion people. Additional benefits are reduction in ocean
   acidification and increased ocean primary productivity and biodiversity.

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the effect of proximal ulnar rotational osteotomy
   (PURO) on the contact mechanics and 3-dimensional (3D) alignment of
   cadaveric normal dog elbows.
   Study Design Ex vivo biomechanical study. Animals Unpaired thoracic
   limbs from 12 dogs (mean +/- SD weight, 26 +/- 4 kg).
   Methods PURO consisted of a transverse osteotomy with 30 degrees
   external rotation of the proximal segment. With the limb under 200 N
   axial load, contact area (CA), mean contact pressure (CP) and peak
   contact pressure (PCP) were measured using digital pressure sensors in
   the medial and lateral compartments and 3D static elbow poses were
   obtained, before and after PURO. Each specimen was tested at 115
   degrees, 135 degrees, and 155 degrees elbow flexion, with the
   antebrachium in neutral rotation, in 28 degrees supination, and in 16
   degrees pronation. Repeated measures ANOVAs with post-hoc Bonferroni (P
   = .05) were performed.
   Results PURO caused significant changes, mostly at 135 degrees elbow
   flexion and neutral antebrachial rotation, characterized by decreased CP
   (10\%) and PCP (10\%) in the medial compartment, and increased CP (27\%)
   and PCP (23\%) in the lateral compartment. The apex of the medial

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the stiffness, displacement, ring deformation and
   bone model motion of 3 configuations of linear-circular hybrid fixator
   constructs loaded in axial compression, craniocaudal and mediolateral
   bending, and torsion.
   Study Design: Biomechanical evaluation.
   Sample Population: Three hybrid construct configurations with 8
   replicates/configuration.
   Methods: Construct Ia used a single, 84 mm, incomplete ring and 2
   tensioned olive wires to stabilize 1 bone segment and a primary hybrid
   rod with 3 fixation pins to stabilize the other bone segment. Constructs
   Iad and Ib were similar to Ia with the addition of a secondary diagonal
   hybrid rod. Construct Ib had a fixation pin inserted orthogonally from
   the diagonal rod. Constructs were loaded for 10 cycles in each mode of
   loading using a materials testing machine. Ring deformation was assessed
   by obtaining serial ring measurements. Bone model motion at the fracture
   gap as a result of loading was also calculated.
   Results: Axial compression: constructs Iad and Ib were significantly
   stiffer than construct Ia. Craniocaudal bending: Construct Ib was
   significantly stiffer than construct Ia. Mediolateral bending: there
   were no significant differences between constructs. Torsion: Construct
   Ib was significantly stiffer than constructs Ia and Iad. Permanent ring
   deformation did not occur. Bone model translational motion decreased in
   constructs Iad and Ib compared to construct Ia.
   Conclusions: Addition of a secondary hybrid rod as well as biplanar
   fixation pin placement improved construct stiffness in several loading
   modes.}},

Title = {{On the Smoothed Minimum Error Entropy Criterion}},
Journal = {{ENTROPY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2311-2323}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion
   can outperform the traditional mean square error criterion in supervised
   machine learning, especially in nonlinear and non-Gaussian situations.
   In practice, however, one has to estimate the error entropy from the
   samples since in general the analytical evaluation of error entropy is
   not possible. By the Parzen windowing approach, the estimated error
   entropy converges asymptotically to the entropy of the error plus an
   independent random variable whose probability density function (PDF)
   corresponds to the kernel function in the Parzen method. This quantity
   of entropy is called the smoothed error entropy, and the corresponding
   optimality criterion is named the smoothed MEE (SMEE) criterion. In this
   paper, we study theoretically the SMEE criterion in supervised machine
   learning where the learning machine is assumed to be nonparametric and
   universal. Some basic properties are presented. In particular, we show
   that when the smoothing factor is very small, the smoothed error entropy
   equals approximately the true error entropy plus a scaled version of the
   Fisher information of error. We also investigate how the smoothing
   factor affects the optimal solution. In some special situations, the
   optimal solution under the SMEE criterion does not change with
   increasing smoothing factor. In general cases, when the smoothing factor
   tends to infinity, minimizing the smoothed error entropy will be
   approximately equivalent to minimizing error variance, regardless of the
   conditional PDF and the kernel.}},

Abstract = {{The size- and orientation-dependent uniaxial strain effects on ballistic
   hole transport in nanowire field-effect transistors are investigated
   using an sp(3)d(5)s{*}-based tight-binding formalism coupled with a
   compact electrostatics model and a semiclassical transport model. It is
   found that the strain-induced reduction of the valence band density of
   states leads to an increased ballistic hole current. This is explained
   by the product of a small reduction in hole density and a significant
   increase in the average ballistic hole velocity under uniaxial
   compression. While uniaxial compressive strain is beneficial for both <
   110 > and < 100 > devices, the strain response of < 110 > nanowires is
   much larger than their < 100 > counterparts. Ultrascaled < 110 >
   nanowires have the highest hole drive current under both strained and
   unstrained conditions, despite the reduction of strain-induced ballistic
   hole current enhancement for narrower devices.}},

Abstract = {{Optimized UV ozone cleaning of graphene layers on SiO2/Si substrates is
   shown to improve contact resistance of e-beam evaporated Ti/Au contacts

   Ozone exposure beyond an optimum time (6 min in these experiments) led
   to a sharp increase in sheet resistance of the graphene, producing
   degraded contact resistance. The UV ozone treatment is a simple and
   effective method for producing high quality contacts to graphene. (C)

Abstract = {{A set of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor devices has been
   investigated using step-stress testing, and representative samples of
   undegraded, source-side-degraded, and drain-side-degraded devices were
   examined using electron microscopy and microanalysis. An unstressed
   reference sample was also examined. All tested devices and their
   corresponding transmission electron microscopy samples originated from
   the same wafer and thus received nominally identical processing.
   Step-stressing was performed on each device and the corresponding
   current-voltage characteristics were generated. Degradation in
   electrical performance, specifically greatly increased gate leakage
   current, was shown to be correlated with the presence of crystal defects
   near the gate edges. However, the drain-side-degraded device showed a
   surface pit on the source side, and another region of the same device
   showed no evidence of damage. Moreover, significant metal diffusion into
   the barrier layer from the gate contacts was also observed, as well as
   thin amorphous oxide layers below the gate metal contacts, even in the
   unstressed sample. Overall, these observations emphasize that gate-edge
   defects provide only a partial explanation for device failure. (C) 2012

   with the effect being strongest for AlGaN/AlN/GaN HEMTs with the highest
   Al composition and for InAlN/GaN HEMTs. The results correlate with the
   increase in concentration of deep negatively charged traps in the AlGaN
   or InAlN barrier with neutron dose. For applications in which tolerance
   to neutron irradiation is a concern, current high Al content
   AlGaN/AlN/GaN HEMTs and also InAlN/GaN structures are less radiation
   hard than low-Al-composition AlGaN/AlN/GaN and Al0.25Ga0.75N/GaN HEMTs.

Abstract = {{A modified design of the composite right/left handed (CRLH) unit cell
   showing all-pass and triple band response is proposed. By using an
   additional inductance which cross-couples the input and output ports of
   the conventional CRLH, a bridged CRLH unit cell (B-CRLH) is created.
   This allows additional right-handed (RH) wave propagation below the
   cutoff frequency of the conventional CRLH to dc, forming a new
   low-frequency-RH band with a non-linear dispersion relationship.
   Meantime, a mid-frequency-LH band and a high-frequency-RH band, which
   are inherited from the conventional CRLH, are still present, resulting
   in triple band configuration. The dispersion relation and Bloch
   impedance of the B-CRLH are investigated by standard periodic analysis.
   Balanced conditions to close transitions between the three bands, to
   realize all-pass behavior, are derived. Full wave structure simulations
   show good agreement with circuital simulations and measurement. Also, a
   triband open-stub consisting of two B-CRLH unit cells is demonstrated as
   an application example.}},

Abstract = {{Road surface profile is an important factor that affects the dynamic
   responses of the vehicle, which in turn affects pavement responses. In
   this study, a complete two-dimensional (2D) axle-tire-pavement
   interaction finite-element model was developed to investigate the
   effects of a rutted surface on near-surface pavement responses. The
   results indicate there is a significant difference in tire-pavement
   contact stress distributions between a rutted surface and a flat
   surface. The presence of a rutted surface increases both the propensity
   for top-down cracking and the severity of instability rutting. The
   observed trend indicates that the greater the existing rut severity is,
   the more likely it is for top-down cracking and increased rutting to
   occur. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000526. (C) 2012 American Society

Title = {{A calibration-free, one-step method for quantitative photoacoustic

Abstract = {{Purpose: Recently reported quantitative photoacoustic tomography (PAT)
   has significantly expanded the utilities of PAT because it allows for
   recovery of tissue optical absorption coefficient which directly
   correlates with tissue physiological information. However, the recovery
   of optical absorption coefficient by the existing quantitative PAT
   approaches strongly depends on the accuracy of absorbed energy density
   distribution, and on the knowledge of accurate strength and distribution
   of incident light source. The purpose of this study is to develop a new
   algorithm for the reconstruction of optical absorption coefficient that
   does not depend on these initial parameters.
   Methods: Here the authors propose a novel one-step reconstruction
   approach that can directly recover optical absorption coefficient from
   photoacoustic measurements along boundary domain. The authors validate
   the method using simulation and phantom experiments.
   Results: The authors have demonstrated experimental evidence that it is
   possible to directly recover optical absorption coefficient maps using
   boundary photoacoustic measurements coupled with the photon diffusion
   equation in just one step. The authors found that the method described
   is able to quantitatively reconstruct absorbing objects with different
   sizes and optical contrast levels.
   Conclusions: Compared to the authors' previous two-step methods, the
   reconstruction results obtained here show that the one-step scheme can
   significantly improve the accuracy of absorption coefficient recovery.

Abstract = {{Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention as a clean and
   renewable energy convention system, owning to the low-cost and
   easy-processing nature of organic semiconductors. While indium tin oxide
   (ITO) is commonly used in OSCs as the transparent conductive electrode,
   the rising cost of indium, the high temperature process and the poor
   flexibility of ITO, make it incompatible with large-scale roll-to-roll
   manufacture of OSCs. In this paper, the MoO3/thin metal/MoO3 trilayer
   structure was used to replace the ITO electrode in OSCs. The optical and
   electrical properties of the trilayer were shown to depend on the
   material and thickness of the intermediate metal layer. The maximum
   power conversion efficiency of up to 2.5\% under simulated 1 sun AM 1.5
   solar illumination was achieved for OSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) and {[}6,6{[}-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM),
   compared to a maximum efficiency of 3.1\% for the ITO-based devices.
   Moreover, due to the flexible nature of the trilayer structure, the OSCs
   with the trilayer electrode exhibited good mechanical flexibility. The
   efficiency of the flexible device was only reduced by similar to 6\%
   from its original performance after 500 bending cycles with a bending
   radius of 1.3 cm. Therefore, the performance of the ITO-free devices on
   rigid/flexible substrates suggests that this oxide/metal/oxide trilayer
   electrode is a promising ITO replacement in OSCs. (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Atomistic simulations using classical empirical potentials are an
   invaluable tool for studying minerals in lower-mantle conditions. Here
   we systematically survey literature potentials for MgSiO3 perovskite.
   The value of the present work is two-fold: (i) a systematic data set for
   a large number of potentials is determined, reproducing previous results
   where they exist and filling in gaps where they do not, and (ii) the
   first predictions using these potentials for the thermal-transport
   properties critical to geothermal models is provided. We focus
   particularly on the thermal expansion and the thermal-transport
   properties, both of which probe the anharmonic structure of the
   potential. Simple two-body potentials with the partially-ionic charges
   are found to be the most successful representation of MgSiO3 perovskite
   properties. The addition of a shell model or many-body interactions does
   not lead to any systematic improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Games that use brainwaves via brain-computer interface (BCI) devices, to
   improve brain functions are known as BCI serious games. Due to the
   difficulty of developing BCI serious games, various BCI engines and
   authoring tools are required, and these reduce the development time and
   cost. However, it is desirable to reduce the amount of technical
   knowledge of brain functions and BCI devices needed by game developers.
   Moreover, a systematic BCI serious game development process is required.
   In this paper, we present a methodology for the development of BCI
   serious games. We describe an architecture, authoring tools, and
   development process of the proposed methodology, and apply it to a game
   development approach for patients with mild cognitive impairment as an
   example. This application demonstrates that BCI serious games can be
   developed on the basis of expert-verified theories.}},

Title = {{Impact of Assimilating Passive Microwave Observations on Root-Zone Soil
   Moisture Under Dynamic Vegetation Conditions}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{11, 1}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, L-band microwave observations were assimilated using the
   ensemble Kalman filter to improve root-zone soil moisture (RZSM)
   estimates from a coupled soil vegetation atmosphere transfer
   (SVAT)-vegetation model linked to a forward microwave model.
   Simultaneous state-parameter updates were performed by assimilating both
   synthetic and field observations during a growing season of sweet corn
   every three days, matching the temporal coverage of observations from
   the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active Passive
   missions. The sensitivities of parameters to the states were
   investigated using the information-theoretic measure of conditional
   entropy. Among the soil parameters, the pore-size index (lambda) was the
   most sensitive to brightness temperatures (T-B) during the early and
   midgrowth stages, while porosity (phi) was the most sensitive to T-B
   during the reproductive stage. In the microwave model, the soil
   roughness parameters, root mean square (RMS) height (r), and correlation
   length (l) were the most sensitive during the early and mid stages,
   while the vegetation regression parameter (b) was the most sensitive
   during the reproductive stage. In the synthetic experiment, assimilation
   of T-B provided RMS error reductions in RZSM estimates of 70\% compared
   to open loop estimates. Minimal variations in performance were observed
   across different stages of the season during the synthetic experiment.
   However, when field observations of T-B were assimilated, significant
   differences in RZSM estimates were observed during different growth
   stages. Maximum RMS difference (RMSD) reductions in RZSM estimates of
   33.3\% were observed compared to open loop estimates during the early
   stages, while improvements of 4.8\% and 16.7\% were observed in the
   mid-and reproductive stages, respectively. Further analyses of
   assimilation with field observations also suggest some improvements in
   the SVAT model are needed for moisture transport immediately following
   the precipitation/ irrigation events. In the microwave model, the linear
   vegetation formulation for estimating canopy opacity, parameterized by
   b, was inadequate in capturing the complexities in T-B during stages of
   high vegetative and reproductive growth rates.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys provide a rich data
   source of topographic information. However, beach monitoring with LiDAR
   data has been mostly limited to visualization and first-order measures
   derived from digital elevation models (DEMs). To exploit more
   information from multitemporal LiDAR data acquired over a beach, we
   extract surface features to detect morphologies that are indicative of
   shoreline change patterns. First, through cross-shore profile sampling
   of LiDAR-derived DEMs, the continuous 3-D beach surface is parameterized
   into several 1-D morphologic features progressing alongshore. Profiles
   are subsequently partitioned into binary erosion or accretion classes
   dependent on measured shoreline change between surveys. Then, a
   feature's class separability is quantified using information divergence
   measures nonparametrically constructed via Parzen windowing. The more
   interclass separation provided by a feature, the greater its
   discriminative potential, and the higher its ranking as a morphologic
   indicator. Rankings are computed across the survey epochs to evaluate
   performance stability of the features. Finally, the top-ranked features
   are implemented within a naive Bayes classifier to assess their ability
   to segment terrain more likely to erode. Results demonstrate the utility
   of the developed framework to systematically extract and incorporate
   useful morphologic information from LiDAR data for discerning patterns
   in beach change.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the optimization of components in a single-wavelength
   airborne laser bathymeter that is intended for a low-power unmanned
   aerial vehicle platform. The theoretical minimum energy requirement to
   detect the submerged sea floor in shallow (< 5 m) water using a low
   signal-to-noise ratio (LSNR) detection methodology is calculated.
   Results are presented from tests of a prototype light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) instrument that was developed by the University of
   Florida, Gainesville. A green wavelength (532 nm), 100-beamlet,
   low-energy (35-nJ/beamlet), short-pulse (480 ps) laser ranging system
   was operated from a low-altitude (500-m) aircraft, with a multichannel
   sensor that is capable of single photoelectron sensitivity and multiple
   stops. Data that were collected during tests display vertical structure
   in shallow-water areas based on fixed threshold crossings at a
   single-photon sensitivity level. A major concern for the binary
   detection strategy is the reliable identification and removal of noise
   events. Potential causes of ranging errors related to photomultiplier
   tube afterpulsing, impedance mismatching, and gain block overdrive are
   described. Data collection/processing solutions based on local density
   estimation are explored. Previous studies on LSNR performance metrics
   showed that short (15-cm) dead time could be expected in the case of
   multiple scattering objects, indicating the possibility of seamless
   topographic/bathymetric mapping with minimal discontinuity at the
   waterline. LiDAR depth estimates from airborne profiles are compared to
   on-site measurements, and near-shore submerged feature identification is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture surfaces of soda lime silica glass failed from controlled
   surface cracks in diametral compression, under mixed-mode loading
   conditions were studied using fractography. Mode mixity was introduced
   by orienting indent precracks in different directions with respect to
   the loading axis. The mixed-mode fracture surfaces were characterized by
   an absence of the mist region. The hackle markings on the mixed-mode
   fracture surfaces appear as lances and differ from those observed on
   surfaces failed in pure mode I. Atomic force microscopy on the
   mixed-mode fracture surfaces revealed that the features at different
   regions are similar and differ only by scale. Fracture surface
   measurements for mixed-mode loading are compared to the measurements for
   mode I loading. The stress intensity at microbranching was determined to
   be a constant irrespective of the loading conditions. The practical
   implications of these observations are that forensic analyses can be
   used without a priori knowledge of the loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The solid tumor is an abnormal environment that is resistant to
   systemically delivered drugs. Increased plasma leakiness and
   extracellular matrix density along with poor lymphatic function can
   result in interstitial flow that attenuates the effectiveness of
   therapeutics. This study expands upon a previously presented magnetic
   resonance (MR) imaging-based porous media model by investigating low
   permeability tumors, where interstitial flow may have increased effect
   on systemically delivered solutes. The solute transport of the porous
   media model is compared to that of experiment and the two-compartment
   model. Small non-necrotic tumors (n=3) were MR-imaged, serially, for 90
   min after a bolus injection of Gd-based contrast agent (CA). These data
   provided for the calculation of experimental CA concentration over 90
   min, while only early time points (15 min) were used to create vascular
   permeability, K-trans, maps for the porous media model. A K-trans scale
   factor (range = 1.3-2.5) in the porous media model was found to account
   for the reduction of permeability (measured by two-compartment model)
   due to interstitial flow. The optimized porous media simulations showed:
   1) better dynamic CA behavior agreement with the experimental data than
   the two-compartment model (>33\% reduction of RMS error); 2) similar
   spatial CA distribution trends across tumor with increased uptake at the
   tumor boundary. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   models for each mode compare the predicted performance with the
   experimental results. For a 7.1 mA(pk) sinusoidal current supplied to a
   transmitter coil with a 100 cm diameter, the torque mode receiver
   orientation has a maximum power transfer of 150 mu W (efficiency of
   12\%) at 2.2 cm at its resonance frequency of 38.4 Hz. For the same

Title = {{Managing mixed wheat-sheep farms with a seasonal forecast}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{50-56}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Seasonal rainfall forecasts have been shown to have significant skill in
   many parts of the world. In this study, seasonal forecasts were used
   together with a crop simulation model and a simple pasture growth curve
   to inform several decisions on year-to-year farm management, including
   on land-allocations in a mixed wheat-sheep farming system. In seasons
   where ``above-median{''} rainfall was forecast, N fertiliser
   applications in cropping were increased to support the higher grain
   yield potential, sheep stocking rates were increased to take advantage
   of higher pasture growth and unused pasture land was made available for
   cropping. In seasons where ``below-median{''} rainfall was forecast. N
   fertiliser applications in cropping were reduced to minimise costs, and
   traditional conservative sheep stocking rates were used. Application of
   the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA) seasonal
   rainfall forecast yielded additional profit of up to A\$66 ha(-1) per
   annum, equivalent to A\$200,000 y(-1) for an average size farm in
   Western Australia. The largest benefit from applying a forecast in
   wheat-sheep farms comes from the increase of more profitable cropping
   during ``above-median{''} rainfall seasons. This is well above the
   benefit of previous single-commodity forecast applications, and
   therefore has widespread potential to improve decision making on mixed
   crop-livestock farms. With the projected decline of rainfall in the
   Australian and other rain-fed crop-livestock regions of the world,
   skilful seasonal forecasting systems will become increasingly valuable
   as they will assist farm managers to capture the benefits in the
   declining number of potentially high-production seasons and minimise the
   input costs in the increasing number of low-production seasons. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Agriculture is a significant contributor to rising atmospheric
   greenhouse gas (GHG) levels, which is expected to result in sea level
   rise and increased frequency of extreme weather events and is of
   increasing global concern. Tomatoes are an important agricultural
   commodity in Florida, accounting for 40\% of the fresh market production
   in the United States. Quantification of GHG emissions from typical
   tomato production in Florida could improve understanding of the impact
   of different GHG emissions sources and identification of areas for
   potential GHG emissions reductions. A practical methodology was
   implemented to calculate a representative GHG emissions estimate using
   production inputs and practices used by the Florida tomato industry.
   Experts and grower surveys were used to characterize typical Florida
   tomato production practices. Existing methodologies were used to convert
   material use and farm operations into GHG emissions estimates. Results
   indicated that, depending on irrigation system type and water source,
   the overall average estimates of GHG emissions associated with a growing
   season ranged from 16,183 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) (0.19 kg CO2-eq kg fruit(-1))
   to 22,426 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) (0.27 kg CO2-eq kg fruit(-1)). Irrigation and
   nitrogen (N) fertilizer accounted for the most emissions, with
   irrigation accounting for between 2.8\% and 26.6\% of average GHG
   emissions and N fertilizer accounting for between 17.7\% and 22.8\%. It
   was concluded that increased efficiency in irrigation and N use, and
   improved methods for polyethylene mulch use and disposal, were the best
   areas for GHG emissions reductions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{TiN films thinner than 400 nm were grown on (1 0 0) Si substrates at
   room temperature and 300 degrees C by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD)
   technique using a KrF excimer laser (lambda = 248 nm, pulse duration tau
   = 25 ns, 6.0 J/cm(2) fluence, and 40 Hz repetition rate) under various
   atmospheres. Simulation of X-ray reflectivity curves acquired from films
   showed they were very dense and smooth, while X-ray diffraction
   investigations found they were crystalline, with crystallites size from
   10 to 35 nm and micro-strain values of 0.6-1.1\%. The oxygen content in
   bulk, measured by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), was below 3.1 at\%.
   Nanoindentation investigations found hardness values between 35 and 40
   GPa, amongst the highest values reported for TiN films. The high laser
   fluence used for ablation generated energetic ions and atomic species
   that bombarded the substrate during growth, resulting in the deposition
   of very dense films, exhibiting high micro-strain values and small
   crystallite sizes, which could explain the measured hardness values. (C)

Title = {{Effect of biochar amendment on sorption and leaching of nitrate,
   ammonium, and phosphate in a sandy soil}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1467-1471}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{When applied to soils, it is unclear whether and how biochar can affect
   soil nutrients. This has implications both to the availability of
   nutrients to plants or microbes, as well as to the question of whether
   biochar soil amendment may enhance or reduce the leaching of nutrients.
   In this work, a range of laboratory experiments were conducted to
   determine the effect of biochar amendment on sorption and leaching of
   nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate in a sandy soil. A total of thirteen
   biochars were tested in laboratory sorption experiments and most of them
   showed little/no ability to sorb nitrate or phosphate. However, nine
   biochars could remove ammonium from aqueous solution. Biochars made from
   Brazilian pepperwood and peanut hull at 600 degrees C (PH600 and BP600,
   respectively) were used in a column leaching experiment to assess their
   ability to hold nutrients in a sandy soil. The BP600 biochar effectively
   reduced the total amount of nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate in the
   leachates by 34.0\%, 34.7\%, and 20.6\%, respectively, relative to the
   soil alone. The PH600 biochar also reduced the leaching of nitrate and
   ammonium by 34\% and 14\%, respectively, but caused additional phosphate
   release from the soil columns. These results indicate that the effect of
   biochar on the leaching of agricultural nutrients in soils is not
   uniform and varies by biochar and nutrient type. Therefore, the nutrient
   sorption characteristics of a biochar should be studied prior to its use
   in a particular soil amendment project. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Matched comparison of kinematics in knees with mild and severe varus
   deformity using fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{924-928}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: We examined knee kinematics in three 16-knee cohorts with
   the same implant design to clarify the influence of bearing mobility and
   preoperative deformity on the kinematics of posterior-stabilized knee
   arthroplasty. Compared to knees with mild deformity and a fixed-bearing
   implant, we hypothesized that a matched group of knees with
   mobile-bearing prostheses would show greater tibial axial rotation. We
   hypothesized that knees with the same fixed-bearing implant, but severe
   preoperative deformity, would have less axial rotation.
   Methods: A total of 58 knees in 48 patients were involved in this study
   from a consecutive single-surgeon total knee arthroplasty series.
   Sixteen knees received mobile-bearing prostheses, and a best-matched
   cohort of knees with fixed-bearing implants was selected. The 16
   fixed-bearing knees with most severe preoperative deformity were
   selected as a third group. All knees were examined at least 1.5 years
   after surgery. Flexion, femoral external rotation, anteroposterior
   translation of both femoral condyles during squatting and deep knee
   flexion activities were evaluated using model-image registration
   techniques.
   Findings: We found some statistically significant, but small differences
   among the three groups in dynamic and static knee kinematics. In
   squatting, total femoral rotation for knees with fixed- and
   mobile-bearing implants, and knees with fixed-bearing implants after
   severe preoperative varus deformity, was not significantly different.
   {[}7 degrees (SD3 degrees), 9 degrees (SD3 degrees), 8 degrees (SD3
   degrees), respectively, P= 0.08].
   Interpretation: Similar kinematic results for knees with different
   tibial bearing surfaces and preoperative deformities indicate a robust
   treatment with this posterior stabilized implant. However, knees did not
   exhibit normal femoral rotations or functional flexion ranges. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We consider a supply chain setting where multiple uncapacitated
   facilities serve a set of customers with a single product. The majority
   of literature on such problems requires assigning all of any given
   customer's demand to a single facility. While this single-sourcing
   strategy is optimal under linear (or concave) cost structures, it will
   often be suboptimal under the nonlinear costs that arise in the presence
   of safety stock costs. Our primary goal is to characterize the
   incremental costs that result from a single-sourcing strategy. We
   propose a general model that uses a cardinality constraint on the number
   of supply facilities that may serve a customer. The result is a complex
   mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. We provide a generalized
   Benders decomposition algorithm for the case in which a customer's
   demand may be split among an arbitrary number of supply facilities. The
   Benders subproblem takes the form of an uncapacitated, nonlinear
   transportation problem, a relevant and interesting problem in its own
   right. We provide analysis and insight on this subproblem, which allows
   us to devise a hybrid algorithm based on an outer approximation of this
   subproblem to accelerate the generalized Benders decomposition
   algorithm. We also provide computational results for the general model
   that permit characterizing the costs that arise from a single-sourcing
   strategy.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We report a novel fabrication process for bimorph based electrothermal
   devices that involves surface and bulk micromachining on an SOI
   (silicon-on-insulator) wafer. The bimorph transducers consist of
   aluminum (Al)-tungsten (W) beams with a thin layer of SiO2 encapsulating
   the W-layer and electrically isolating it from the Al-layer. The widely
   different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of Al and W ensure
   high bimorph sensitivity. The W-layer acts as an active layer of the
   bimorph and also as a resistive heater for actuation by Joule heating.
   Proof mass and rigid beams can be incorporated into the design by
   utilizing the device layer of the wafer. Thermal isolation between the
   bimorphs and the substrate; and between bimorphs and the proof mass or
   rigid beams is achieved by a spin-coated polyimide layer. The process
   ensures improved robustness compared to comparable designs that
   typically utilize SiO2 thin-film for thermal isolation. The process can
   be adapted to a wide range of electrothermal devices, and enables design
   and layout engineers to trade off speed for achieving lower power
   consumption and vice versa. We report fabrication and test results on 1D
   (one-dimensional) electrothermal scanning micromirrors. The fabricated
   devices have significantly better robustness compared to previously
   reported mirrors with Al-SiO2 bimorphs and SiO2 thermal isolation.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of a simple model of a one-dimensional array of a

   explained by the Klein-Gordon equation. A perturbation of the K-G
   equation makes it possible to use this continuum model through a
   progressive-wave nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). The latter gives
   rise to a bright soliton that moves with a certain velocity. The bright
   soliton controls itself so that both bright and dark solitons appear at
   the same time with discrete energy levels that are estimated from a
   hypergeometric function, but the dark soliton is not visible as it is
   part of the complex solution that indicates absorption of energy, i.e.,
   the presence of an energy gap. The pulse width for switching of
   ferroelectrics can be estimated from the analysis of the NLSE and

Abstract = {{The prevalence of cardiovascular disease and the limited availability of
   suitable autologous transplant vessels for coronary and peripheral
   bypass surgeries is a significant clinical problem. A great deal of
   progress has been made over recent years to develop biodegradable
   materials with the potential to remodel and regenerate vascular tissues.
   However, the creation of functional biological scaffolds capable of
   withstanding vascular stress within a clinically relevant time frame has
   proved to be a challenging proposition. As an alternative approach, we
   report the use of a multilaminate rolling approach using the human
   amnion to generate a tubular construct for blood vessel regeneration.
   The human amniotic membrane was decellularized by agitation in 0.03\%
   (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate to generate an immune compliant material.
   The adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) and human
   vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) was assessed to determine initial
   binding and biocompatibility (monocultures). Extended cultures were
   either assessed as flat membranes, or rolled to form concentric
   multilayered conduits. Results showed positive EC adhesion and a
   progressive repopulation by SMC. Functional changes in SMC gene
   expression and the constructs' bulk mechanical properties were
   concomitant with vessel remodeling as assessed over a 40-day culture
   period. A significant advantage with this approach is the ability to
   rapidly produce a cell-dense construct with an extracellular matrix
   similar in architecture and composition to natural vessels. The capacity
   to control physical parameters such as vessel diameter, wall thickness,
   shape, and length are critical to match vessel compliance and tailor
   vessel specifications to distinct anatomical locations. As such, this
   approach opens new avenues in a range of tissue regenerative
   applications that may have a much wider clinical impact.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated solar thermochemical cycles comprise a range of promising
   novel process technologies that use concentrated solar energy to drive
   endothermic chemical reactions at elevated temperatures. The most
   promising application is the production of carbon-neutral fuels,
   particularly via single or multistep water and CO2 splitting or via the
   solar thermochemical upgrading of carbonaceous fuels such as biomass,
   waste, or oil residues. Furthermore, intermediate storage of solar
   energy in reversible reactions, the so-called solar thermochemical heat
   pipes, shows great promise to replace latent heat storage for
   concentrating solar power generation. Potential niche applications are
   material processing andmaterial testing. Widespread deployment of solar
   thermochemical cycles hinges on the development of several key
   technologies: (i) reaction systems and catalysts able to endure tens of
   thousands of conversion cycles without significant degradation, (ii)
   reactors and heat recuperation systems that fully exploit the
   theoretical potential of solar thermochemical cycles, (iii)
   industrial-scale reactor technologies, and (iv) process control
   technologies that address the inherently transient nature of solar
   power. (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that the peak current of a return stroke is determined by
   the background electric field that exists between the cloud and the
   ground. Assuming 150 kV/m as the largest background electric field that
   can exist below thunderclouds, it is estimated that the largest negative
   first return stroke peak current that can exist in nature is about 300
   kA in temperate regions and about 450 kA-500 kA in the tropics. Since
   corona discharges from trees, bushes and other protrusions and upward
   initiated discharges from tall structures limit the maximum electric
   field that can exist below thunderclouds over land, there is a high
   probability for these strong discharges to take place over the oceans.
   In the study it is also estimated that the smallest value of the return
   stroke current that can exist in nature lies in the range of 3.0 kA to
   1.5 kA with the most probable value located in the vicinity of 2 kA. (C)

Abstract = {{We examine initial rising portions of electric field waveforms of
   negative first return strokes in natural cloud-to-ground lightning
   recorded simultaneously at near and far distances from the lightning
   channel. The near and far field-measuring stations are located at Camp
   Blanding and in Gainesville, Florida, respectively, separated by a
   distance of about 45 km. A total of five return strokes had been
   recorded in 2007-2008, four of which were analyzed in detail (one was
   not suitable for analysis due to saturation of electric field waveform
   at the far station). Field waveform characteristics, including overall
   zero-to-peak and 10-to-90\% risetimes, duration of slow front, fast
   transition 10-to-90\% risetime, and magnitude of slow front relative to
   the peak, were found to be similar to those reported from other studies,
   in which the field propagation path was over ground (as opposed to sea
   water). It is shown, via modeling, that the slow front in electric field
   waveforms at far distances is primarily due to the radiation field
   component, while at near distances it is composed of comparable
   contributions from all three components of electric field. For both
   measured and model-predicted waveforms, the durations of the slow front
   appear to be similar at near and far distances from the lightning

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate that the search for weighing matrices

   together with two competent genetic algorithms to locate optima of an

   algorithm (mGA) is given from the pioneering results of Goldberg,
   regarding the ability of the mGA to put tight genes together in a
   solution which points directly to structural patterns in weighing
   matrices. In order to take into advantage certain properties of two
   ternary sequences with zero autocorrelation we use an adaptation of the
   fast messy GA (fmGA) where we combine mGA with advanced techniques, such
   as thresholding and tie-breaking. This transformation of the weighing
   matrices problem to an instance of a combinatorial optimization problem
   seems to be promising, since we resolved two open cases for weighing
   matrices as these are listed in the second edition of the Handbook of

Abstract = {{We propose a new behavior-oriented communication paradigm in mobile
   networks, profile-cast, motivated by tight user-network coupling in
   mobile societies. In this novel paradigm, messages are sent to
   sender-specified target profiles, instead of machine IDs. We present a
   systematic framework for such services. First, we analyze the
   spatio-temporal stability of user mobility profiles constructed from
   empirical data sets, and they turn out to be surprisingly stable. The
   similarity of the current mobility profile of a user to its future
   mobility profile remains above 0.6 for five weeks, while the correlation
   coefficient of the similarity metrics between a user pair at different
   time instants is above 0.5 for two weeks. Second, we present a protocol
   for the profile-cast service, named CSI, and provide a fully distributed
   solution utilizing behavioral profile space gradients and small world
   structures to selectively diffuse information across the network towards
   the intended recipients.
   Leveraging stability in user behaviors, the two modes of CSI achieve
   good performance compared to the theoretical optimal protocols. Both
   CSI:Target mode and CSI:Dissemination mode achieve more than 94\%
   delivery ratio. Comparing with the delay-optimal protocol, they show no
   more than 47\% and 32\% more delay, respectively, with at most 10\% more
   transmission overhead. Comparing with the overhead-optimal protocol,
   they use no more than 7\% more overhead while achieving dramatic
   improvement in delay (up to 150\% less). Both CSI:T and CSI:D
   significantly outperform the epidemic routing, using less than 7\%
   overhead, and variants of random walk, where CSI:T doubles the delivery
   ratio using less overhead, and CSI:D shows at least 50\% less delay
   under similar overhead.
   We believe the profile-cast paradigm would enable many behavior-oriented
   services efficiently, such as targeted announcements and profile-based
   alert notifications, in various mobile networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Wireless networks and personalized mobile devices are deeply integrated
   and embedded in our lives. Such wide adoptions of new technologies will
   impact user behavior and in turn will affect network performance. It is
   imperative to characterize the fundamental structure of wireless user
   behavior in order to model, manage, leverage and design efficient mobile
   networks. One major challenge in characterizing user behavior stems from
   the significant size and complexity of user behavioral data. Without
   summarization and dimension reduction, the sheer amount of data does not
   provide much useful information. The key contribution of the paper is a
   novel similarity metric based on a matrix representation of mobility
   preferences and its decomposition. This method provides an efficient way
   to reduce important spatiotemporal dynamics in user mobility into a few
   eigen-behavior vectors. This also facilitates nodes to exchange their
   mobility summaries and determine their mutual similarity locally.
   Without any assumption on the properties of user population, we use
   unsupervised learning (clustering) techniques to classify WLAN users.
   Such a user grouping scheme based on learned user behavior is crucial
   for applications relying on the usage context of each mobile device
   (e.g., participatory sensing, social-relationship-aware message
   forwarding). In this study, using our systematic TRACE approach, we
   analyze wireless users' behavioral patterns by extensively mining
   wireless network logs from two major university campuses to showcase its
   efficacy. While our findings partly validate intuitive repetitive
   behavioral trends and user grouping, it is surprising to find the
   qualitative commonalities and striking consistency of user behavior from
   the two universities. We discover multimodal user behavior for more than
   60 percent of the users, and there are hundreds of distinct groups with
   unique behavioral patterns in both campuses. The sizes of the major
   groups follow a power-law distribution.}},

   if active tags are in use). The problem of finding efficient solutions
   for the MTP problem from the communication protocol design perspective
   has never been investigated before. In this paper, we propose a series
   of protocols toward efficient MTP solutions in large RFID systems. The
   proposed protocols detect misplaced tags using reader positions instead
   of tag positions to guarantee the efficiency and scalability as system
   scale grows, because RFID readers are much fewer than tags. Considering
   applications that employ active tags, we further propose a solution
   requiring responses from only a subset of tags in favor of energy
   saving. We also design a distributed protocol that enables each reader
   to independently detect misplaced tags. We then investigate how to apply
   the proposed protocols in scenarios with tag mobility. To evaluate the
   proposed protocols, we analyze their optimal performances to demonstrate
   their efficiency potential and also conduct extensive simulation
   experiments. The results show that the proposed protocols can
   significantly increase the time efficiency and the energy efficiency by
   over 70 percent on average when compared with the best existing work.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a two-level fault tolerance strategy for
   wavelength-routed all-optical networks. The first-level strategy is
   applied to handle the large-scale disaster induced failures while the
   second-level strategy protects the network against regular single-link
   failures. The first-level fault tolerance is achieved by solving a
   topological optimization problem to re-regulate the traffic away from
   the disaster-affected area with minimum resource cost. Shared lightpath
   protection is applied in the second-level fault tolerance design to
   reduce resource allocation. First, by comparing with a simple greedy
   approach that we develop, we show that the traditional Routing and
   Wavelength Assignment (RWA) method, in which the routing and wavelength
   assignment are considered in a separate fashion, cannot lead to
   satisfying performance. Next, in order to obtain better performance,
   based on drawback analysis of the greedy approach, we propose a
   two-phase heuristic algorithm, in which the first phase is designed to
   generate an initial feasible solution and the second phase iteratively
   perfects the initial solution until no improvement can be made. For the
   design of the first phase, two variations are proposed featuring
   different types of initial solution generation. The numerical results
   show that, combined with perfection phase, both design variations can
   lead to considerable performance improvement over the greedy solutions.
   Finally, we propose a Performance Indicator (PI) that provides insight
   into the reason for performance difference among algorithms. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Selective dry etching of GaAs over Al0.2Ga0.8As in pulsed DC BCl3/SF6
   plasmas was studied. The process variable was the composition of SF6 gas
   flow rate (0-50\%) in the BCl3/SF6 plasmas. The total flow rate of the
   gases was 20 sccm. The other plasma conditions were held constant at
   13.33 Pa chamber pressure, 500 V pulsed DC voltage, 200 kHz frequency
   and 0.7 mu s reverse time. Only a mechanical pump was used for the
   processing. Oscilloscope data showed that there was little variation of
   the input voltage and current on the chuck with the composition change.
   10\% mixing of SF6 in the BCl3/SF6 plasma produced the highest etch
   selectivity (48:1) of the GaAs over the Al0.2Ga0.8As. However, further
   addition of the SF6 gas to the plasma reduced the etch rate of GaAs and
   the selectivity. The GaAs and AlGaAs would not etch when the SF6
   composition was >= 30\% in the plasma. The root mean square surface
   roughness of the GaAs was 0.7-1.3 nm after etching. The overall results
   indicated that the best selective etching was achieved at 10\% SF6

Abstract = {{Dynamics of absorption and desorption of a surfactant monomer into and
   out of a spherical non-ionic micelle is investigated by coarse-grained
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is shown that these processes
   involve a complex interplay between the micellar structure and the
   monomer configuration. A quantitative model for collective dynamics of
   these degrees of freedom is developed. This is accomplished by
   reconstructing a multi-dimensional free energy landscape of the
   surfactant-micelle system using constrained MD simulations in which the
   distance between the micellar and monomer centers of mass is held
   constant. Results of this analysis are verified by direct
   (unconstrained) MD simulations of surfactant absorption in the micelle.
   It is demonstrated that the system dynamics is likely to deviate from
   the minimum energy path on the energy landscape. These deviations create
   an energy barrier for the monomer absorption and increase an existing
   barrier for the monomer desorption. A reduced Fokker-Planck equation is
   proposed to model these effects. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Inferring Species Richness and Turnover by Statistical Multiresolution
   Texture Analysis of Satellite Imagery}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The quantification of species-richness and species-turnover
   is essential to effective monitoring of ecosystems. Wetland ecosystems
   are particularly in need of such monitoring due to their sensitivity to
   rainfall, water management and other external factors that affect
   hydrology, soil, and species patterns. A key challenge for environmental
   scientists is determining the linkage between natural and human
   stressors, and the effect of that linkage at the species level in space
   and time. We propose pixel intensity based Shannon entropy for
   estimating species-richness, and introduce a method based on statistical
   wavelet multiresolution texture analysis to quantitatively assess
   interseasonal and interannual species turnover.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We model satellite images of regions of
   interest as textures. We define a texture in an image as a spatial
   domain where the variations in pixel intensity across the image are both
   stochastic and multiscale. To compare two textures quantitatively, we
   first obtain a multiresolution wavelet decomposition of each. Either an
   appropriate probability density function (pdf) model for the
   coefficients at each subband is selected, and its parameters estimated,
   or, a non-parametric approach using histograms is adopted. We choose the
   former, where the wavelet coefficients of the multiresolution
   decomposition at each subband are modeled as samples from the
   generalized Gaussian pdf. We then obtain the joint pdf for the
   coefficients for all subbands, assuming independence across subbands; an
   approximation that simplifies the computational burden significantly
   without sacrificing the ability to statistically distinguish textures.
   We measure the difference between two textures' representative pdf's via
   the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). Species turnover, or b diversity,
   is estimated using both this KL divergence and the difference in Shannon
   entropy. Additionally, we predict species richness, or a diversity,
   based on the Shannon entropy of pixel intensity. To test our approach,
   we specifically use the green band of Landsat images for a water
   conservation area in the Florida Everglades. We validate our predictions
   against data of species occurrences for a twenty-eight years long period
   for both wet and dry seasons. Our method correctly predicts 73\% of
   species richness. For species turnover, the newly proposed KL divergence
   prediction performance is near 100\% accurate. This represents a
   significant improvement over the more conventional Shannon entropy
   difference, which provides 85\% accuracy. Furthermore, we find that
   changes in soil and water patterns, as measured by fluctuations of the
   Shannon entropy for the red and blue bands respectively, are positively
   correlated with changes in vegetation. The fluctuations are smaller in
   the wet season when compared to the dry season.
   Conclusions/Significance: Texture-based statistical multiresolution
   image analysis is a promising method for quantifying interseasonal
   differences and, consequently, the degree to which vegetation, soil, and
   water patterns vary. The proposed automated method for quantifying
   species richness and turnover can also provide analysis at higher
   spatial and temporal resolution than is currently obtainable from
   expensive monitoring campaigns, thus enabling more prompt, more cost
   effective inference and decision making support regarding anomalous
   variations in biodiversity. Additionally, a matrix-based visualization
   of the statistical multiresolution analysis is presented to facilitate
   both insight and quick recognition of anomalous data.}},

Title = {{Prosthesis alignment affects axial rotation motion after total knee
   replacement: a prospective in vivo study combining computed tomography
   and fluoroscopic evaluations}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinical consequences of alignment errors in total knee
   replacement (TKR) have led to the rigorous evaluation of surgical
   alignment techniques. Rotational alignment in the transverse plane has
   proven particularly problematic, with errors due to component
   malalignment relative to bone anatomic landmarks and an overall mismatch
   between the femoral and tibial components' relative positions. Ranges of
   nominal rotational alignment are not well defined, especially for the
   tibial component and for relative rotational mismatch, and some studies
   advocate the use of mobile-bearing TKR to accommodate the resulting
   small rotation errors. However, the relationships between prosthesis
   rotational alignment and mobile-bearing polyethylene insert motion are
   poorly understood. This prospective, in vivo study evaluates whether
   component malalignment and mismatch affect axial rotation motions during
   passive knee flexion after TKR.
   Methods: Eighty patients were implanted with mobile-bearing TKR.
   Rotational alignment of the femoral and tibial components was measured
   from postoperative CT scans. All TKR were categorized into nominal or
   outlier groups based on defined norms for surgical rotational alignment
   relative to bone anatomic landmarks and relative rotational mismatch
   between the femoral and tibial components. Axial rotation motion of the
   femoral, tibial and polyethylene bearing components was measured from
   fluoroscopic images acquired during passive knee flexion.
   Results: Axial rotation motion was generally accomplished in two phases,
   dominated by polyethylene bearing rotation on the tibial component in
   early to mid-flexion and then femoral component rotation on the
   polyethylene articular surface in later flexion. Opposite rotations of
   the femur-bearing and bearing-baseplate articulations were evident at
   flexion greater than 80. Knees with outlier alignment had lower
   magnitudes of axial rotation and distinct transitions from external to
   internal rotation during mid-flexion. Knees with femoral-tibial
   rotational mismatch had significantly lower total axial rotation
   compared to knees with nominal alignment. Conclusions: Maintaining
   relative rotational mismatch within +/- 5 degrees during TKR provided
   for controlled knee axial rotation during flexion. TKR with rotational
   alignment outside of defined surgical norms, with either positive or
   negative mismatch, experienced measurable kinematic differences and
   presented different patterns of axial rotation motions during passive
   knee flexion compared to TKR with nominal mismatch. These findings
   support previous studies linking prosthesis rotational alignment with
   inferior clinical and functional outcomes.

Abstract = {{We describe a novel multicomponent graphene nanostructured system that

   nanostructure system involves the covalent attachment of 3 components;
   Fe3O4(Fe) nanoparticles, PAMAM-G4-NH2 (G4) dendrimer and Cy5 (Cy) on a
   graphene oxide (GO) surface to synthesize a biologically relevant
   multifunctional system. The resultant GO-G4-Fe-Cy nanosystem exhibits
   high dispersion in an aqueous medium, and is magnetically responsive and
   fluorescent. In vitro experiments provide a clear indication of
   successful uptake of the GO-G4-Fe-Cy nanosystem by MCF-7 breast cancer
   cells, and it is seen to behave as a bright and stable fluorescent
   marker. The study also reveals varied cellular distribution kinetics
   profile for the GO nanostructured system compared to free Cy.
   Furthermore, the newly developed GO nanostructured system is observed to
   be non-toxic to MDA-MB-231 cell growth, in striking contrast to free G4
   dendrimer and GO-G4 conjugate. The GO-G4-Fe-Cy nanostructured system
   characterized by multifunctionality suggests the merits of graphene for

Abstract = {{Lead sulfide (PbS) nanoparticles of similar to 3-5 nm average diameter
   were codeposited into quaterthiophene (4T) organic films, which in some
   cases, were additionally modified by simultaneous 50 eV acetylene ion
   bombardment. The film composition and PbS-4T bonding were monitored by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and laser desorption
   postionization mass spectrometry (LDPI-MS). S2p core-level XP spectra
   indicated that ion-modified films displayed enhanced bonding between 4T
   and PbS nanoparticles. LDPI mass spectra found thiophene fragments bound
   to PbS in ion-modified films. Computational simulations were used to
   investigate the mechanisms by which the incident particles chemically
   modified the thiophene-PbS nanoparticle interactions: molecular
   dynamics, density functional theory simulations were carried out on
   a-terthiophene (3T) analogues of 4T films interacting with (PbS)16
   clusters. The simulations showed that, in the absence of acetylene ion
   modification, a weak charge transfer from the PbS cluster to the nearest
   3T molecule occurred, suggestive of little interaction between intact
   organic matrix molecules and PbS nanoparticles. However, the simulations
   predicted the formation of a covalent bond between PbS and the
   oligothiophene film as a result of acetylene ion modification, in
   support of the experimental observations. These results help explain the
   recent observation of enhanced photoconductivity in these films upon ion
   modification (Majeslci, M. W.; et al. J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 2012, 30,
   04D109).}},

Abstract = {{The late positive potential (LPP) is a reliable electrophysiological
   index of emotional perception in humans. Despite years of research, the
   brain structures that contribute to the generation and modulation of LPP
   are not well understood. Recording EEG and fMRI simultaneously, and
   applying a recently proposed single-trial ERP analysis method, we
   addressed the problem by correlating the single-trial LPP amplitude
   evoked by affective pictures with the blood oxygen level-dependent
   (BOLD) activity. Three results were found. First, relative to neutral
   pictures, pleasant and unpleasant pictures elicited enhanced LPP, as
   well as heightened BOLD activity in both visual cortices and
   emotion-processing structures such as amygdala and prefrontal cortex,
   consistent with previous findings. Second, the LPP amplitude across
   three picture categories was significantly correlated with BOLD activity
   in visual cortices, temporal cortices, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex,
   and insula. Third, within each picture category, LPP-BOLD coupling
   revealed category-specific differences. For pleasant pictures, the LPP
   amplitude was coupled with BOLD in occipitotemporal junction, medial
   prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and precuneus, whereas for unpleasant
   pictures significant LPP-BOLD correlation was observed in ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex, insula, and posterior cingulate cortex. These results
   suggest that LPP is generated and modulated by an extensive brain
   network composed of both cortical and subcortical structures associated
   with visual and emotional processing and the degree of contribution by
   each of these structures to the LPP modulation is valence specific.}},

Abstract = {{Significant buffering of storm surges by vegetation canopies has been
   suggested by limited observations and simple numerical studies,
   particularly following recent Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Here
   we simulate storm surge and inundation over idealized topographies using
   a three-dimensional vegetation-resolving storm surge model coupled to a
   shallow water wave model and show that a sufficiently wide and tall
   vegetation canopy reduces inundation on land by 5 to 40 percent,
   depending upon various storm and canopy parameters. Effectiveness of the
   vegetation in dissipating storm surge and inundation depends on the
   intensity and forward speed of the hurricane, as well as the density,
   height, and width of the vegetation canopy. Reducing the threat to
   coastal vegetation from development, sea level rise, and other
   anthropogenic factors would help to protect many coastal regions against
   storm surges. Citation: Sheng, Y. P., A. Lapetina, and G. Ma (2012), The

Abstract = {{The main objectives of this research were to quantify the risks/benefits
   and impacts of alternative water sources (AWSs) as perceived by expert
   stakeholders and to evaluate the overall support for multiple AWSs by
   expert stakeholders. The St. Johns River (SJR) basin, FL, USA was chosen
   as a case study for AWSs because it is a fresh groundwater depleted
   region and there are ongoing activities related to water supply
   planning. Expert stakeholders included federal, state, and local
   governments, public utilities, consulting engineering and industry, and
   environmental and social non-governmental organizations. AWSs under
   consideration in the SJR basin include surface water, desalination,
   water reclamation, and water conservation. A two-phase research approach
   was followed that focused on expert stakeholders. First, an elicitation
   study was used to identify salient beliefs about AWSs. Open-ended
   questions were asked about the risks/benefits of AWSs in terms of the
   three pillars of sustainability: ecological, economic, and human health
   impacts. Second, an online survey was constructed using beliefs
   identified during the elicitation study. The online survey was used to
   quantify attitudes toward and overall support for AWSs. The salient
   beliefs of expert stakeholders were dominated by the ecological pillar
   of sustainability. The support of expert stakeholders for AWSs, from
   least favorable to most favorable, was surface water
   withdrawals<desalination<water reclamation<water conservation, and was
   shaped by attitudes. The results of this research provide an improved
   understanding of the beliefs and attitudes that influence
   decision-makers involved in water supply planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Graphene photodetectors promise ultrafast speed and wide bandwidth.
   Interplay of quantum transport effects, such as Klein tunneling, with
   electron-photon coupling can play an important role in device physics of
   graphene photodetectors. A quantum mechanical simulation approach, which
   solves quantum transport equation using the non-equilibrium Green's
   function formalism and treats electron-photon and electron-phonon
   coupling in the self-consistent Born approximation, is developed to
   model graphene photodetectors. A mode space approach utilizing parallel
   computing is implemented to achieve ultimate computational efficiency.
   It is found that using two metal contacts with distinctively different
   work function significantly improves the device performance. The
   photoresponse is strongest when the light spot is focused at the contact
   regions and is insensitive to the photon energy, which is in qualitative
   agreement with experiment. The effect of different device designs on the
   quantum efficiency and the effect of phonon scattering are examined. The
   simulation results also indicate wide band response of graphene
   photodetectors. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Phase pure Ba2FeMoO6 thin films were grown by pulsed laser deposition at

   The grain size, the conductivity, the saturation magnetization, and the

   the Curie temperature remains relatively constant. All samples showed
   negative magnetoresistance which is consistent with the half metallic
   property of double perovskites. Interestingly, the samples grown on the
   higher temperature substrates showed a small low-field positive
   magnetoresistance which is not understood. We also have observed an
   anomalous Hall effect, due to spin-polarized itinerant electrons, in
   which the saturation field of the hole-like anomalous portion decreases
   with increasing temperature and at higher temperatures manifests a
   negative slope (ordinary Hall effect) indicative of negative charge

Abstract = {{Diffusion of tetrafluoromethane (CF4) in single-walled aluminosilicate
   nanotubes was studied by means of pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR and
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The application of a high magnetic
   field and high magnetic field gradients allowed C-13 PFG NMR
   measurements of diffusion to be performed under conditions of
   sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratios for a broad range of CF4
   loadings. The PFG NMR data were analyzed to obtain the diffusivities for
   diffusion of CF4 inside the nanotube aggregates, in which the sorbate
   displacements exceeded the average length of individual nanotubes. In
   addition, the corresponding diffusivities under conditions of fast
   exchange of CF4 molecules between nanotubes or nanotube aggregates and
   the surrounding gas phase in a nanotube bed were also estimated. The
   experimental CF4 diffusivities inside the nanotube aggregates were found
   to be several times smaller than the corresponding diffusivities
   obtained by MD for diffusion inside the defect-free nanotubes. This
   difference points to the existence of additional transport resistances
   inside the nanotube aggregates under the conditions of the reported PFG
   NMR measurements, i.e., when the gas molecules diffuse through several
   nanotubes interconnected along the nanotube lengths inside the
   aggregates. Such additional transport resistances are likely to
   originate from diffusion through thin layers of microporous material,
   which is expected to connect the individual nanorubes in the aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian grinding dentitions are composed of four major tissues that

   repeatedly in mammals (such as horses, bison, and elephants), a similar
   innovation occurred much earlier (similar to 85 million years ago)
   within the duck-billed dinosaur group Hadrosauridae, fueling their
   35-million-year occupation of Laurasian megaherbivorous niches. How this
   complexity was achieved is unknown, as reptilian teeth are generally
   two-tissue structures presumably lacking biomechanical attributes for
   grinding. Here we show that hadrosaurids broke from the primitive
   reptilian archetype and evolved a six-tissue dental composition that is
   among the most sophisticated known. Three-dimensional wear models

Abstract = {{The long-range and adhesion forces between a molecularly smooth silica
   sphere and a relatively smooth thin metallic film have been measured by
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) operating in contact mode. The majority of
   the dispersion force measurements have been done with root mean square
   (RMS) roughness of more than 10 nm. This paper investigates lower
   roughness to prove or disprove theory of the van der Waals force for
   irregularly distributed size of asperities. Metallic films of Cu, Al,
   and Ag were obtained by coating silicon wafers using an electron beam
   evaporation (e-beam) method. The e-beam deposition rates were within the
   range of 0.6-1.2 angstrom/s at vacuum pressures between 2 x 10(-6) and 3
   x 10(-6) mbar. The developed coatings had peak-to-peak distance ranges
   of 80-120 nm and 1-2 mu m. Long-range attractive forces were obtained
   from the extending portion of the force/distance curves measured between
   a silica particle attached to the AFM cantilever and the metallic film
   surface. Certain samples demonstrated an attractive force much larger
   than the theoretically calculated dispersion force, which we attribute
   to an electrostatic image force. For other samples, the extending curves
   were comparable with the theoretical dispersion forces, especially when
   the curves were shifted by a distance of 1.82 RMS. Adhesion forces were
   measured from the retracting portion of the force/distance curves. For
   peak-to-peak distance near 90 nm, films having an RMS roughness of 0.5-3
   nm displayed a force reduced by a factor of 3-40 from that predicted by
   theory. This effect of the surface roughness supports a DMT model for
   sample interaction at a single contact point after particle detachment.
   We also demonstrate the absence of any capillary forces under relative
   humidities up to 40\%. It was explained by the thickness of wetting film
   smaller than the peaks height. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are bright, sub-millisecond bursts
   of gamma-rays, originating within the Earth's atmosphere. Most TGFs have
   been detected by spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. Only two TGFs have
   previously been observed from within our atmosphere: one at ground level
   and one from an aircraft at 14.1 km. We report on a new TGF-like
   gamma-ray flash observed at ground level, detected by the 19-station
   Thunderstorm Energetic Radiation Array (TERA) at the University of
   Florida/Florida Tech International Center for Lightning Research and
   Testing (ICLRT). The gamma-ray flash, which had a duration of 52.7 mu s,
   occurred on June 30, 2009 during a natural negative cloud-to-ground
   lightning return stroke, 191 mu s after the start of the stroke. This
   event is the first definitive association of a gamma-ray flash with
   natural CG lightning and is among the most direct links to a specific
   lightning process so far. For this event, 19 gamma-rays were recorded,
   with the highest energy exceeding 20 MeV. The high-energy radiation
   exhibited very different behavior from the typical x-ray emission from
   lightning. Specifically, the gamma-ray flash had a much harder energy
   spectrum, consistent with relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA)
   multiplication; it did not arrive in sub-microsecond bursts, typical of
   leader emission from lightning, and it occurred well after the start of
   the return stroke, which has not been previously observed for the x-ray
   emission from lightning. Nevertheless, we present evidence that the
   source region for the gamma ray flash was the same as that for the
   preceding leader x-ray bursts.}},

Title = {{Determining Minimum Ion Exchange Resin Usage for NOM Removal}},

Abstract = {{For the design and analysis of an ion exchange (IEX) process, it is
   necessary to know the minimum IEX resin usage defined thermodynamically.
   Anion exchange resin sorption of dissolved natural organic matter (NOM)
   may follow an isotherm of either Type I or Type II, which are noticeably
   different at high surface coverage. The charge density of NOM, which
   monotonically increases with the pH, appears to play a critical role.
   Basic pH (high charge density) favors a Type I isotherm and acidic pH
   (low charge density) may change the isotherm to Type II. The Langmuir
   equation and the Wiegner-Jenny-Summers-Roberts (WJSR) equation can be
   used to quantify the Type I and Type II isotherms, respectively.
   Explicit relationships between minimum resin usage and desired level of
   removal are subsequently developed and the isotherm constants, along
   with the non-removable NOM fraction, are simultaneously estimated by an
   innovative least-squares regression (LSR) approach. The Langmuir
   isotherm-based model accurately describes the sorption removal of Type I
   isotherm, and the WJSR isotherm-based model accurately describes the
   sorption removal of Type II isotherm. At removals >30\%, however, the
   two sorption models offer comparable minimum IEX resin usages. The
   sorption models and LSR methods developed herein are applicable to resin
   slurry contactors, including batch reactors, plug flow reactors, or
   continuous-flow stirred tank reactors. DOI:

Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{87-99}},

Abstract = {{Observations of current velocity, sea surface elevation and vertical
   profiles of density were obtained in a tropical inlet to determine the
   effect of a bathymetric depression (hollow) on the tidal flows. Surveys
   measuring velocity profiles were conducted over a diurnal tidal cycle
   with mixed spring tides during dry and wet seasons. Depth-averaged tidal
   velocities during ebb and flood tides behaved according to Bernoulli
   dynamics, as expected. The dynamic balance of depth-averaged quantities
   in the along-channel direction was governed by along-channel advection
   and pressure gradients with baroclinic pressure gradients only being
   important during the wet season. The vertical structure of the
   along-channel flow during flood tides exhibited a mid-depth maximum with
   lateral shear enhanced during the dry season as a result of decreased
   vertical stratification. During ebb tides, along-channel velocities in
   the vicinity of the hollow were vertically sheared with a weak return
   flow at depth due to choking of the flow on the seaward slope of the
   hollow. The potential energy anomaly, a measure of the amount of energy
   required to fully mix the water column, showed two peaks in
   stratification associated with ebb tide and a third peak occurring at
   the beginning of flood. After the first mid-ebb peak in stratification,
   ebb flows were constricted on the seaward slope of the hollow resulting
   in a bottom return flow. The sinking of surface waters and enhanced
   mixing on the seaward slope of the hollow reduced the potential energy
   anomaly Ater maximum ebb. The third peak in stratification during early
   flood occurred as a result of denser water entering the inlet at
   mid-depth. This dense water mixed with ambient deep waters increasing
   the stratification. Lateral shear in the along-channel flow across the
   hollow allowed trapping of less dense water in the surface layers
   further increasing stratification. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Control of rainfall-runoff particulate matter (PM) and PM-bound chemical
   loads is challenging; in part due to the wide gradation of PM complex
   geometries of many unit operations and variable flow rates. Such
   challenges and the expense associated with resolving such challenges
   have led to the relatively common examination of a spectrum of unit
   operations and processes. This study applies the principles of
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to predict the particle and pollutant
   clarification behavior of these systems subject to dilute multiphase
   flows, typical of rainfall-runoff, within computationally reasonable
   limits, to a scientifically acceptable degree of accuracy. The
   Navier-Stokes (NS) system of nonlinear partial differential equations
   for multiphase hydrodynamics and separation of entrained particles are
   solved numerically over the unit operation control volume with the
   boundary and initial conditions defined and then solved numerically
   until the desired convergence criteria are met. Flow rates examined are
   scaled based on sizing of common unit operations such as hydrodynamic
   separators (HS), wet basins, or filters, and are examined from 1 to 100
   percent of the system maximum hydraulic operating flow rate. A standard
   turbulence model is used to resolve flow, and a discrete phase model
   (DPM) is utilized to examine the particle clarification response. CFD
   results closely follow physical model results across the entire range of
   flow rates. Post-processing the CFD predictions provides an in-depth
   insight into the mechanistic behavior of unit operations by means of
   three dimensional (3-D) hydraulic profiles and particle trajectories.
   Results demonstrate the role of scour in the rapid degradation of unit
   operations that are not maintained. Comparisons are provided between
   measured and CFD modeled results and a mass balance error is identified.
   CFD is arguably the most powerful tool available for our profession
   since continuous simulation modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Biochar has attracted much research attention recently because of its
   potential applications in many environmental areas. In this work, the
   biochar technology was combined with the emerging graphene technology to
   create a new engineered graphene-coated biochar from cotton wood. The
   biomass feedstock was first treated with graphene/pyrene-derivative and
   was then annealed at 600 degrees C in a quartz tube furnace under N-2
   environment. Laboratory characterization with different microscopy and
   spectrometry tools showed that the graphene sheets were ``soldered{''}
   by the pyrene molecules on the biochar surface during the annealing
   process. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the graphene ``skin{''}
   could improve the thermal stability of the biochar, making the
   engineered biochar a better carbon sequester for large scale land
   applications. Batch sorption experimental results indicated that the
   graphene-coated biochar has excellent adsorption ability of polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a maximum methylene blue adsorption
   capacity of 174 mg g(-1), which is more than 20 times higher than that
   of the unmodified cotton wood biochar and comparable to those of some
   physically or chemically activated carbons. The enhanced adsorption of
   methylene blue on the graphene-coated biochar is mainly controlled by
   the strong pi-pi interactions between aromatic molecules and the
   graphene sheets on biochar surface. It is anticipated that this novel,
   facile, and low-cost method can be expanded to other carbon-rich
   materials to create engineered biochar for various environmental
   applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic measurement provides critical real-world data for service
   providers and network administrators to perform capacity planning,
   accounting and billing, anomaly detection, and service provision. One of
   the greatest challenges in designing an online measurement module is to
   minimize the per-packet processing time in order to keep up with the
   line speed of the modern routers. To meet this challenge, we should
   minimize the number of memory accesses per packet and implement the
   measurement module in the on-die SRAM. The small size of SRAM requires
   extremely compact data structures to be designed for storing per-flow
   information. The best existing work, called counter braids, requires
   more than 4 bits per flow and performs six or more memory accesses per
   packet. In this paper, we design a fast and compact measurement function
   that estimates the sizes of all flows. It achieves the optimal
   processing speed: two memory accesses per packet. In addition, it
   provides reasonable measurement accuracy in a tight space where the
   counter braids no longer work. Our design is based on a new data
   encoding/decoding scheme, called randomized counter sharing. This scheme
   allows us to mix per-flow information together in storage for
   compactness and, at the decoding time, separate the information of each
   flow through statistical removal of the error introduced during
   information mixing from other flows. The effectiveness of our online
   per-flow measurement approach is analyzed and confirmed through
   extensive experiments based on real network traffic traces. We also
   propose several methods to increase the estimation range of flow sizes.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We propose a novel method for fusing different classifiers outputs. Our
   approach, called context extraction for local fusion with fuzzy
   integrals (CELF-FI), is a local approach that adapts a fuzzy integrals
   fusion method to different regions of the feature space. It is based on
   a novel objective function that combines context identification and
   multialgorithm fusion criteria into a joint objective function. This
   objective function consists of two terms: The first is designed to
   produce compact clusters, called contexts, and the second is designed to
   produce Sugeno measures for fuzzy integral fusion for each context. The
   terms are optimized simultaneously via alternating optimization. To test
   a new sample, first, its features (extracted by each algorithm) are used
   to assign it to each context with a fuzzy membership degree. Second, the
   sample confidence values (assigned by each algorithm) are fused within
   each context using the learned context fusion parameters. Then, the
   context-dependent partial confidence values are weighted by the
   membership degrees and averaged over all contexts to produce a final
   confidence value. We illustrate the performance of CELF using synthetic
   data, and we apply it to the problem of landmine detection using ground
   penetrating radar and wideband electromagnetic induction. Our extensive
   experiments have indicated that the proposed fusion approach outperforms
   all individual classifiers, the global fuzzy integral fusion method, and
   the basic local fusion with linear aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{A solar fuels generation research program is focused on hydrogen
   production by means of reactive metal water splitting in a cyclic
   iron-based redox process. Iron-based oxides are explored as an
   intermediary reactive material to dissociate water molecules at
   significantly reduced thermal energies. With a goal of studying the
   resulting oxide chemistry and morphology, chemical assistance via CO is
   used to complete the redox cycle. In order to exploit the unique
   characteristics of highly reactive materials at the solar reactor scale,
   a monolithic laboratory scale reactor has been designed to explore the
   redox cycle at temperatures ranging from 675 to 875 K. Using high
   resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the oxide morphology and the oxide state are
   quantified, including spatial distributions. These images show the
   change of the oxide layers directly after oxidation and after reduction.
   The findings show a significant non-stoichiometric O/Fe gradient in the
   atomic ratio following oxidation, which is consistent with a previous
   kinetics model, and a relatively constant, non-stoichiometric O/Fe
   atomic ratio following reduction.}},

Abstract = {{An improved process for graphene transfer was used to demonstrate high

   (G-VFETs). The process reduces disorder and eliminates the polymeric
   residue that typically plagues transferred films. The method also allows
   for purposely creating pores In the graphene of a controlled areal
   density. Transconductance observed in G-VFETs fabricated with a
   continuous (pore-free) graphene source electrode is attributed to
   modulation of the contact barrier height between the graphene and
   organic semiconductor due to a gate field induced Fermi level shift in
   the low density of electronic-states graphene electrode. Pores
   introduced in the graphene source electrode are shown to boost the
   G-VFET performance, which scales with the areal pore density taking
   advantage of both barrier height lowering and tunnel barrier thinning.
   Devices with areal pore densities of 20\% exhibit on/off ratios and
   output current densities exceeding 10(6) and 200 mA/cm(2), respectively,

Abstract = {{Lightning-induced voltages on a 738-m long overhead two-wire line have
   been computed using the 3-D finite-difference time-domain (3-D FDTD)
   method for solving Maxwell's equations. The 3-D FDTD method employed
   here uses a subgrid model, in which spatial discretization is fine (cell
   side length is 0.9 m) in the vicinity of overhead wires and coarse (cell
   side length is 4.5 m) in the rest of the computational domain. The
   overhead wires having radii of some millimeters are simulated by placing

Abstract = {{A numerical solution to the defect chemical equations was used to model
   the defect population in europium-doped strontium cerate (ESC) at vapor
   partial pressure and oxygen partial pressure range in hydrogen
   atmosphere. The results of the simulation compared well with the work
   previously reported in the literature. The numerically simulated defect
   concentrations were then used to predict the conductivity and hydrogen
   permeability of ESC membranes as a function of temperature. Uniquely,
   the model was then validated by comparing the predictions with
   experimental data for ESC membranes. The results of that exercise showed
   that the model is in good agreement with the experiment at temperatures
   high enough that the effects of defect interaction can be ignored; and
   where the assumption of a dilute solution of defects is valid. The
   agreement with the experiment further enabled the model to be used to
   obtain credible predictions for the ambipolar conductivity of ESC and
   hydrogen flux through ESC as a function of feed side hydrogen partial
   pressure. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{The influence of nonlinear advection on estuarine exchange flow was
   investigated with observations at the transition between the James River
   and Chesapeake Bay, Hampton Roads, Virginia. Data were collected under
   different tidal forcing, wind forcing, and river discharge in 2004 and
   2005. The relative contribution of nonlinear advective terms to the
   along-channel momentum balance had the same order of magnitude as
   pressure gradient and friction, verifying recent analytical and
   numerical model results. Both the magnitude and the spatial distribution
   of nonlinear advection showed fortnightly variability. Nonlinear
   advection was more influential on along-channel flow at spring tides
   than at neap tides because of increased tidal velocities, in a
   cross-sectionally averaged sense. The flow structures induced by each
   nonlinear advective process were investigated for the first time with
   observations. The lateral advection term vu(y). was found to enhance
   laterally sheared exchange acting along with Coriolis forcing at spring
   tides and opposing it at neap tides. Vertical advection wit,. showed
   similar spatial distribution as vuy, at spring tides but was vertically
   sheared (landward at middepth and seaward in the rest of the water
   column) at neaps. Longitudinal advection uu(x) augmented landward flow
   in the channel.}},

Abstract = {{Indium tin oxide (ITO) is extensively used as a transparent electrode in
   photovoltaic cells and organic light emitting diodes. High surface work
   function (WF) of ITO is a crucial parameter for enhanced device
   performance. The ITO WF is usually around 4.3 eV without any surface
   treatment. With surface treatments ITO WF, as high as 5.4 eV has been
   reported. We designed a surface treatment method with which we achieved
   substantially high ITO surface work function of over 6.1 eV. We observed
   changes in valence electronic structure and core levels, apart from
   surface cleaning. We also investigated interface formation of copper
   phthalocyanine (CuPc) on the high WF ITO. In the proximity of the
   interface the highest occupied energy level of CuPc was observed to be
   almost pinned to the Fermi level. We fabricated three simple devices
   with no to high treatment. The device results were observed to be
   consistent with the findings of electronic energy level alignment. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the effects of antebrachial rotation at 3 elbow
   flexion angles on contact mechanics and 3-dimensional (3D) alignment of
   normal dog elbows. Study Design Ex vivo biomechanical study. Animals
   Unpaired thoracic limbs from 18 dogs (mean +/- SD weight, 27 +/- 4 kg).
   Methods With the limb under 200 N axial load, digital pressure sensors
   measured contact area (CA), mean contact pressure (MCP), peak contact
   pressure (PCP), and PCP location in the medial and lateral elbow
   compartments, and 3D static poses of the elbow were obtained. Each
   specimen was tested at 115 degrees, 135 degrees, and 155 degrees elbow
   flexion, with the antebrachium in a neutral position, in 28 degrees
   supination, and in 16 degrees pronation. Repeated measure ANOVAs with
   post-hoc Bonferroni (P = .0167) were performed. Results Both pronation
   and supination decreased CA by 16\% and 8\% and increased PCP by 5\% and
   10\% in the medial and lateral compartments, respectively. PCP location
   moved 2.3 mm (1.83.2 mm) closer to the apex of the medial coronoid
   process in pronation and 2.0 mm (1.82.2 mm) farther away in supination.
   The radial head and medial coronoid process rotated 5.4 degrees and 1.9
   degrees internally during pronation and 7.2 degrees and 1.2 degrees
   externally during supination. Conclusions Contact mechanics and 3D
   alignment of normal dog elbows varied significantly at different elbow
   poses.}},

Abstract = {{Difference in strains in the layers of a multimorph beam causes it to
   curl, thereby leading to transduction. Straight multimorph beams have
   been widely used for thermal, piezoelectric, and
   shape-memory-alloy-based transducers that undergo out-of-plane bending,
   but curved multimorph beams have not been explored much. In this paper,
   we report thermal transducers based on curved multimorphs that have a
   nonzero curvature in the plane of the substrate. The distinguishing
   feature of curved multimorphs is that they undergo both out-of-plane
   bending and twisting deformations. We report the small-deformation
   analysis of curved multimorphs. The analytical expressions greatly
   expand the design space for microelectromechanical systems engineers and
   can lead to novel devices, including micromirrors and infrared sensors.
   The closed-form expressions were validated against finite-element (FE)
   simulation and experimental results. Experimental verification was done
   by monitoring a curved electrothermal multimorph beam at different
   temperatures. Good agreement between the analysis and experiments has
   been observed in the small-deformation range. At large deformations,
   in-plane displacement becomes significant. FE simulations and
   experiments are used to study large deformations.}},

Abstract = {{Oxides hold great promise as new and improved materials for
   thermal-barrier coating applications. The rich variety of structures and
   compositions of the materials in this class, and the ease with which
   they can be doped, allow the exploration of various mechanisms for
   lowering thermal conductivity. In this article, we review recent
   progress in identifying specific oxides with low thermal conductivity
   from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. We explore the
   mechanisms of lowering thermal conductivity, such as introducing
   structural/chemical disorder, increasing material density, increasing
   the number of atoms in the primitive cell, and exploiting the structural
   anisotropy. We conclude that further systematic exploration of oxide
   crystal structures and chemistries are likely to result in even further
   improved thermal-barrier coatings.}},

Abstract = {{Aims The aim of this project was to validate a method to deliver a
   reproducible, selected dose of infective bioaerosol through a
   respiratory protective technology to an animal that exhibits a
   proportional clinical response. Methods and Results The Controlled
   Aerosol Test System (CATS) was designed to generate and condition a
   viable infective aerosol, pass it through a treatment technology and
   thence to the breathing zone of a mouse constrained in a Nose-Only
   Inhalation Exposure System (NOIES). A scanning mobility particle sizer
   and impingers at sampling ports were used to show that viability is
   preserved and particle size distribution (PSD) is acceptably uniform
   throughout the open CATS, including the 12 ports of the NOIES, and that
   a particle filter used caused the expected attenuation of particle
   counts. Conclusions Controlled Aerosol Test System delivers uniformly to
   mice constrained in the NOIES a selectable dose of viral bioaerosol
   whose PSD and viable counts remain consistent for an hour. Significance
   and Impact of the Study This study's characterization of CATS provides a
   new test system in which a susceptible small-animal model can be used as
   the detector in a quantitative method to evaluate the ability of
   respiratory protective technologies to attenuate the infectivity of an
   inspired pathogenic aerosol. This provides a major improvement over the
   use of viable bioaerosol collectors (e.g. impactors and impingers),
   which provide data that are difficult to relate to the attenuation of
   pathogenicity.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive characterization and failure modes of tungsten microwire
   arrays in chronic neural implants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{For nearly 55 years, tungsten microwires have been widely used in
   neurophysiological experiments in animal models to chronically record
   neuronal activity. While tungsten microwires initially provide stable
   recordings, their inability to reliably record high-quality neural
   signals for tens of years has limited their efficacy for neuroprosthetic
   applications in humans. Comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of
   electrode performance and failure is necessary for developing next
   generation neural interfaces for humans. In this study, we evaluated the
   abiotic (electrophysiology, impedance, electrode morphology) and biotic
   (microglial reactivity, blood-brain barrier disruption, biochemical
   markers of axonal injury) effects of 16-channel, 50 mu m diameter,
   polyimide insulated tungsten microwires array for implant durations that
   ranged from acute to up to 9 months in 25 rats. Daily electrode
   impedance spectroscopy, electrophysiological recordings, blood and
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) withdrawals, and histopathological analysis
   were performed to study the time-varying effects of chronic electrode
   implantation. Structural changes at the electrode recording site were
   observed as early as within 2-3 h of electrode insertion. Abiotic
   analysis indicated the first 2-3 weeks following surgery was the most
   dynamic period in the chronic electrode lifetime as there were greater
   variations in the electrode impedance, functional electrode performance,
   and the structural changes occurring at the electrode recording tips.
   Electrode recording site deterioration continued for the long-term
   chronic animals as insulation damage occurred and recording surface
   became more recessed over time. In general, electrode impedance and
   functional performance had smaller daily variations combined with
   reduced electrode recording site changes during the chronic phase.
   Histopathological studies were focused largely on characterizing
   microglial cell responses to electrode implantation. We found that
   activated microglia were present near the electrode tracks in all
   non-acute animals studied, thus indicating presence of a
   neuroinflammatory response regardless of post-implantation survival
   times and electrode performance. Conversely, dystrophic microglia
   detectable as fragmented cells were found almost exclusively in acute
   animals surviving only few hours after implantation. While there was no
   consistent relationship between microglial cell responses and electrode
   performance, we noticed co-occurrence of high ferritin expression,
   intraparenchymal bleeding, and microglial degeneration suggesting
   presence of excessive oxidative stress via Fenton chemistry. Biochemical
   analysis indicated that these electrodes always caused a persistent
   release of axonal injury biomarkers even several months after
   implantation suggesting persistent tissue damage. Our study suggests
   that mechanisms of electrode failure are multi-factorial involving both
   abiotic and biotic parameters. Since these failure modes occur
   concurrently and cannot be isolated from one another, the lack of
   consistent relationship between electrode performance and microglial
   responses in our results suggest that one or more of the abiotic factors
   were equally responsible for degradation in electrode performance over
   long periods of time.}},

Title = {{Optimal placement of piezoelectric material on a cantilever beam for
   maximum piezoelectric damping and power harvesting efficiency}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The loss factor of an electromechanical system characterizes the induced
   piezoelectric damping of the system for shunt damping applications, and
   it can also be used to represent the power harvesting efficiency of the
   system. This paper investigates the effect of piezoelectric patch
   placement on the loss factor, with the aim of finding an optimal
   location for the same amount of piezoelectric material. An analytical
   relationship between the loss factor and placement is presented and
   discussed for beam configurations. In addition, a structural model is
   developed based on wave propagation which accounts for the effects of
   the PZT patch on the system and is used to obtain the natural
   frequencies and mode shapes of the composite system. After that,
   numerical studies demonstrate the effects of placement on damping of
   various vibration modes, and the effects of patch size on optimal
   placement. For small piezoelectric patches, the optimal location is very
   close to the location of the overall maximum bending moment, where the
   mechanical strain energy density is maximized. Larger patches could be
   used to improve the damping or power harvesting efficiency of the
   system; however, the associated optimal placement might not be at the
   point of overall maximum bending moment. Moreover, as the patch size
   extends beyond a critical point, increasing the size can actually
   deteriorate the system's performance.}},

Abstract = {{Crop simulation models have the potential to assess the risk associated
   with the selection of a specific N fertilizer rate, by integrating the
   effects of soil-crop interactions on crop growth under different
   pedo-climatic and management conditions. The objective of this study was
   to simulate the environmental and economic impact (nitrate leaching and
   N2O emissions) of a spatially variable N fertilizer application in an
   irrigated maize field in Italy. The validated SALUS model was run with 5
   nitrogen rates scenarios, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 kg N ha(-1), with
   the latter being the N fertilization adopted by the fanner. The
   long-term (25 years) simulations were performed on two previously
   identified spatially and temporally stable zones, a high yielding and
   low yielding zone. The simulation results showed that N fertilizer rate
   can be reduced without affecting yield and net return. The marginal net
   return was on average higher for the high yield zone, with values
   ranging from 1550 to 2650 (sic) ha(-1) for the 200 N and 1485 to 2875
   (sic) ha(-1) for the 250 N. N leaching varied between 16.4 and 19.3 kg N
   ha(-1) for the 200 N and the 250 N in the high yield zone. In the low
   yield zone, the 250 N had a significantly higher N leaching. N2O
   emissions varied between 0.28 kg N2O ha(-1) for the 50 kg N ha(-1) rate
   to a maximum of 1.41 kg N2O ha(-1) for the 250 kg N ha(-1) rate. (C)

Abstract = {{The Gordonia strain JW8 was successfully isolated, characterized, and
   tested for bioaugmentation of pulp and paper wastewater. With
   significant degradation of alkaline lignin, JW8 has the potential to
   render pulp and paper wastewater more biodegradable, which is of much
   interest to wastewater treatment. The sequencing batch reactor (SBR)
   inoculated with JW8 significantly enhanced the organic pollutants
   removal of pulp and paper wastewater compared to the control, achieving
   the best removal rates of 96.4\% and 87.8\% for biochemical oxygen
   demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively. A
   considerable decrease of BOD/COD ratio in wastewater was also achieved
   in the bioaugmented SBR. However, a drawback caused by JW8 inoculation
   was the resultant high sludge volume index and biological foaming and
   bulking, which can be controlled by food/mass adjustment. The denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis analysis suggested that bioaugmentation
   with JW8 had a slight effect on the microbial dynamics, but more
   research is needed to understand the relationship between the microbial

Abstract = {{Despite its popularity in the recent literature, plasma actuators lack a
   consistent study to identify limitations, and remedy thereof, of various
   thrust measurement techniques. This paper focuses on comparing two
   different experimental techniques commonly used to measure the global,
   plasma-induced thrust. A force balance is used to make a direct
   measurement of the thrust produced, which is then compared with a
   control volume analysis on data obtained through particle image
   velocimetry. The local velocity measured by particle image velocimetry
   is also validated with a fine-tip pressure probe. For the direct thrust
   measurements, the effect of varying the actuator plate length upon which
   the induced flow acts is investigated. The results from these tests show
   that the length of the actuator plate is most influential at higher
   voltages with the measured thrust increasing as much as 20 \% for a six
   times reduction in the length of the plate. For the indirect thrust
   measurement, the influence of the control volume size is analyzed. When
   the two methods are compared against each other, good agreement is found
   when the control volume size has a sufficient downstream extent. Also,
   the discharge length is optically measured using visible light emission.
   A linear correlation is found between the discharge length and the
   thrust measurements for the actuator configurations studied. Finally,
   the energy conversion efficiency curve for a representative actuator is
   also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This article summarizes the application and validation of a specific
   temperature-time indicator (TTI) to monitor the shelf life of
   refrigerated salmon throughout its cold chain distribution. Reaction
   kinetics of the spoilage process was characterized by determining the
   kinetics for microbial population growth and chemical degradation (break
   down of nucleotides). The combined effect of these reactions on
   perceived organoleptic quality deterioration (appearance, odor, texture,
   gapping and color) was measured by a trained sensory panel. The TTI
   color change reaction from green to yellow was monitored with a
   colorimeter. The activation energies (Ea) for the spoilage reactions in
   the salmon and the TTI color change reaction were determined and
   compared for the required similarity. The color change reaction in the
   TTIs had Ea of 2223 Kcal/mol, while the microbial growth and chemical
   degradation reactions were found to have Ea in the order of 17 and 15
   Kcal/mol, respectively. Performance of the TTIs was tested under
   controlled constant and variable time-temperature storage histories by
   comparing TTIs color change readings with sensory panel scores.
   Additionally, TTIs and data loggers were placed in a shipment of
   refrigerated salmon that traveled from Puerto Montt, Chile, to
   Gainesville, FL, U.S.A. via a combination of truck and air. Results
   showed that the TTIs used in this study with Ea of 2223 Kcal/mol were
   capable of predicting the shelf life of refrigerated salmon within 10\%
   error in cases of moderate temperature abuse (07C). However, TTIs with
   lower Ea closer to 1819 Kcal/mol would be needed to accurately predict
   shelf life if product were to be subjected to more extreme temperature
   abuse with temperatures reaching 1214C. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The list
   of products monitored by time-temperature integrators or indicators
   (TTIs) has been steadily increasing, these include: fresh fruits and
   vegetables, fresh fish, flowers, frozen foods, dairy products,
   chocolates, photographic films, medical films, drugs and vaccines,
   cosmetics, beer, dog food, etc. TTIs can be used to monitor the
   distribution, and food and biological materials, and more diverse
   products. A tentative classification of the various applications of TTIs
   in food products would be: 1 monitoring the distribution and storage; 2
   optimization of inventory management; 3 shelf-life prediction; and 4
   sanitary and quality prediction. Several studies have focused on the
   application of indicators for frozen and chilled foods. Our studies in
   the evaluation of chilled fish fillets have shown that indicators can be
   used satisfactorily to evaluate the quality of the product during
   distribution. The distribution of fish is one of the areas that had the
   greatest potential for implementation of the TTIs.}},

Abstract = {{Quantization is fundamental to analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and
   signal compression. In this paper, we propose an adaptive quantizer with
   piecewise companding and scaling for signals of Gaussian mixture model
   (GMM). Our adaptive quantizer operates under three modes, each of which
   corresponds to different types of GMM. Moreover, we propose a
   reconfigurable architecture to implement our adaptive quantizer in an
   ADC. We also use it to quantize images and design the tone mapping
   algorithm for high dynamic range (HDR) image compression. Our
   experimental results show that (I) the proposed quantizer is able to
   achieve performance close to the optimal quantizer (i.e., Lloyd-Max
   quantizer for GMM) in the sense of mean squared error (MSE), at much
   lower computational cost than it; (2) the proposed quantizer is able to
   achieve much better MSE performance than a uniform quantizer, at a cost
   similar to the uniform quantizer. The proposed adaptive quantizer holds
   great potential in the appilcations of the existing ADC and HDR image
   compression. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a method to simulate desired approach flow
   characteristics in a multiple controlled fan boundary layer wind tunnel
   (MCFWT) is described. A MCFWT uses flow control techniques to impart the
   desired turbulence characteristics in lieu of using a roughness grid
   upwind of the test section to generate a boundary layer. In contrast to
   other MCWFT techniques, the proposed approach (a) relies on the direct
   simulation of scaled wind speed and direction records and (b) implements
   a closed-loop proportional-integral-derivative controller to modulate
   the wind speed and control the turbulence characteristics. A case study
   is presented using a 1:10 scale model of the Full-Scale Test Facility at
   the Insurance Institute for Business \& Home Safety Research Center.
   Simulation of marine, open and suburban approach boundary layer flow
   yields good agreement between the model and measured values, including
   mean velocity and turbulence intensity profiles, integral length scales
   and power spectra. Control of longitudinal and lateral fluctuations is

Abstract = {{Efficient connection of multiple electrodes to the body for impedance
   measurement and voltage monitoring applications is of critical
   importance to measurement quality and practicality. Electrical impedance
   tomography (EIT) experiments have generally required a cumbersome
   procedure to attach the multiple electrodes needed in EIT. Once placed,
   these electrodes must then maintain good contact with the skin during
   measurements that may last several hours. There is usually also the need
   to manage the wires that run between the electrodes and the EIT system.
   These problems become more severe as the number of electrodes increases,
   and may limit the practicality and portability of this imaging method.
   There have been several trials describing humanelectrode interfaces
   using configurations such as electrode belts, helmets or rings. In this
   paper, we describe an electrode belt we developed for long-term EIT
   monitoring of human lung ventilation. The belt included 16 embossed
   electrodes that were designed to make good contact with the skin. The
   electrodes were fabricated using an Ag-plated PVDF nanofiber web and
   metallic threads. A large contact area and padding were used behind each
   electrode to improve subject comfort and reduce contact impedances. The
   electrodes were incorporated, equally spaced, into an elasticated fabric
   belt. We tested the electrode belt in conjunction with the KHU Mark1
   multi-frequency EIT system, and demonstrate time-difference images of
   phantoms and human subjects during normal breathing and running. We
   found that the Ag-plated PVDF nanofiber web electrodes were suitable for
   long-term measurement because of their flexibility and durability.
   Moreover, the contact impedance and stability of the Ag-plated PVDF
   nanofiber web electrodes were found to be comparable to similarly tested
   Ag/AgCl electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{We study the stability margin of a vehicular formation with distributed
   control, in which the control at each vehicle only depends on the
   information from its neighbors in an information graph. We consider a
   D-dimensional lattice as information graph, of which the 1-D platoon is
   a special case. The stability margin is measured by the real part of the
   least stable eigenvalue of the closed-loop state matrix, which
   quantifies the rate of decay of initial errors. In {[}1], it was shown
   that with symmetric control, in which two neighbors put equal weight on
   information received from each other, the stability margin of a 1-D
   vehicular platoon decays to 0 as O(1/N-2), where N is the number of
   vehicles. Moreover, a perturbation analysis was used to show that with
   vanishingly small amount of asymmetry in the control gains, the
   stability margin scaling can be improved to O(1/N). In this technical
   note, we show that, with judicious choice of non-vanishing asymmetry in
   control, the stability margin of the closed loop can be bounded away
   from zero uniformly in N. Asymmetry in control gains thus makes the
   control architecture highly scalable. The results are also generalized
   to D-dimensional lattice information graphs that were studied in {[}2],
   and the correspondingly stronger conclusions than those derived in {[}2]
   are obtained. In addition, we show that the size-independent stability
   margin can be achieved with relative position and relative velocity
   (RPRV) feedback as well as relative position and absolute velocity
   (RPAV) feedback, while the analysis in {[}1], {[}2] was only for the
   RPAV case.}},

Abstract = {{The exquisite human ability to perceive facial features has been
   explained by the activity of neurons particularly responsive to faces,
   found in the fusiform gyrus and the anterior part of the superior
   temporal sulcus. This study hypothesizes and demonstrates that it is
   possible to automatically discriminate face processing from processing
   of a simple control stimulus based on processed EEGs in an online
   fashion with high temporal resolution using measures of statistical
   dependence applied on steady-state visual evoked potentials.
   Correlation, mutual information, and a novel measure of association,
   referred to as generalized measure of association (GMA), were applied on
   filtered current source density data. Dependences between channel
   locations were assessed for two separate conditions elicited by distinct
   pictures (a face and a Gabor grating) flickering at a rate of 17.5 Hz.
   Filter settings were chosen to minimize the distortion produced by
   bandpassing parameters on dependence estimation. Statistical analysis
   was performed for automated stimulus classification using the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results show active regions in the
   occipito-parietal part of the brain for both conditions with a greater
   dependence between occipital and inferotemporal sites for the face
   stimulus. GMA achieved a higher performance in discriminating the two
   conditions. Because no additional face-like stimuli were examined, this
   study established a basic difference between one particular face and one
   nonface stimulus. Future work may use additional stimuli and
   experimental manipulations to determine the specificity of the current
   connectivity results.}},

Abstract = {{A constructive critique and a suite of proposed improvements for a
   recent one-dimensional semianalytical model of a direct methanol fuel
   cell are presented for the purpose of improving the predictive ability
   of the modeling approach. The model produces a polarization curve for a
   fuel cell system comprised of a single membrane-electrode assembly,
   based on a semianalytical one-dimensional solution of the steady-state
   methanol concentration profile across relevant layers of the membrane
   electrode assembly. The first improvement proposed is a more precise
   numerical solution method for an implicit equation that describes the
   overall current density, leading to better convergence properties. A
   second improvement is a new technique for identifying the maximum
   achievable current density, an important piece of information necessary
   to avoid divergence of the implicit-equation solver. Third, a modeling
   improvement is introduced through the adoption of a linear
   ion-conductivity model that enhances the ability to better match
   experimental polarization-curve data at high current densities. Fourth,
   a systematic method is advanced for extracting anodic and cathodic
   transfer-coefficient parameters from experimental data via a
   least-squares regression procedure, eliminating a potentially
   significant parameter estimation error. Finally, this study determines
   that the methanol concentration boundary condition imposed on the
   membrane side of the membrane-cathode interface plays a critical role in
   the model's ability to predict the limiting current density.
   Furthermore, the study argues for the need to carry out additional
   experimental work to identify more meaningful boundary concentration
   values realized by the cell. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006842]}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the Permutation Flowshop Problem with minimization
   of makespan, which is denoted by Fm|prmu|C (max). In the permutational
   scenario, the sequence of jobs has to remain the same in all machines.
   The Flowshop Problem (FSP) is known to be NP-hard when more than three
   machines are considered. Thus, for medium and large scale instances,
   high-quality heuristics are needed to find good solutions in reasonable
   time. We propose and analyse parallel hybrid search methods that fully
   use the computational power of current multi-core machines. The parallel
   methods combine a memetic algorithm (MA) and several iterated greedy
   algorithms (IG) running concurrently. Two test scenarios were included,
   with short and long CPU times. The tests were conducted on the set of
   benchmark instances introduced by Taillard (Eur. J. Oper. Res.
   64:278-285, 1993), commonly used to assess the performance of new
   methods. Results indicate that the use of the MA to manage a pool of
   solutions is highly effective, allowing the improvement of the best
   known upper bound for one of the instances.}},

   impossible to control these parameters independently in a conventional

Abstract = {{The grail of next-generation wireless networks is providing real-time
   services for delay-sensitive applications, which require that the
   wireless networks provide QoS guarantees. The effective capacity (EC)
   proposed by Wu and Negi provides a powerful tool for design of QoS
   provisioning mechanisms. In this paper, we intend to generalize their
   formula for the effective capacity of a correlated Rayleigh fading
   channel; specifically, we derive a closed form approximate EC formula
   for a special correlated Nakagami-m fading channel, for which the
   inverse of the correlation coefficient matrix is tridiagonal. To verify
   its accuracy via simulation, we develop a Green-matrix based approach,
   which allows us to analytically obtain the effective capacity (given the
   joint probability density function of a correlated Nakagami-m fading
   channel) while being able to simulate the corresponding channel gain
   process. Simulation results show that our EC formula is accurate.
   Furthermore, to facilitate the application of the EC theory to the
   design of practical QoS provisioning mechanisms, we propose a simple
   algorithm for estimating the EC of an arbitrary correlated Nakagami-m
   fading channel, given channel measurements; simulation results
   demonstrate the accuracy of our proposed EC estimation algorithm showing
   its suitability in practice. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   decompose the feed gas. This enables carbon diffusion into the work

   hardness during the turning operation. It is proposed that this approach
   may enable the machining of low hardness materials, while simultaneously
   providing increased surface hardness for the machined product. This
   could result in the reduction/elimination of post-machining heat

Abstract = {{Microparticulate systems for delivery of therapeutics to DCs for
   immunotherapy have gained attention recently. However, reports
   addressing the optimization of DC-targeting microparticle delivery
   systems are limited, particularly for cases where the goal is to deliver
   payload to DCs in a non-activating fashion. Here, we investigate
   targeting DCs using poly (d lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles (MPs)
   in a non-stimulatory manner and assess efficacy in vitro and in vivo. We
   modified MPs by surface immobilizing DC receptor targeting molecules
   antibodies (anti-CD11c, anti-DEC-205) or peptides (P-D2, RGD), where
   anti-CD11c antibody. P-D2 and RGD peptides target integrins and
   anti-DEC-205 antibody targets the c-type lectin receptor DEC-205. Our
   results demonstrate the modified MPs are neither toxic nor activating,
   and DC uptake of MPs in vitro is improved by the anti-DEC-205 antibody,
   the anti-CD11c antibody and the P-D2 peptide modifications. The P-D2
   peptide MP modification significantly improved DC antigen presentation
   in vitro both at immediate and delayed time points. Notably, MP
   functionalization with P-D2 peptide and anti-CD11c antibody increased
   the rate and extent of MP translocation in vivo by DCs and M Phi s, with
   the P-D2 peptide modified MPs demonstrating the highest translocation.
   This work informs the design of non-activating polymeric
   microparticulate applications such as vaccines for autoimmune diseases.

Abstract = {{Samples of SmxCe1-xO2-delta (0.05 <= x <= 0.55) were prepared by
   solid-state reactions and the disorder-order phase transition and grain
   ionic conductivity were investigated using XRD and ac impedance
   spectroscopy technique, respectively. For 0 <= x <= 0.35 the material
   has a fluorite structure and gradually stabilizes into a C-type
   rare-earth structure at 0.40 <= x <= 0.55 because of oxygen-vacancy
   ordering. The highest grain ionic conductivity observed is 0.0565(37) S
   cm(-1) at 700 degrees C for Sm0.20Ce0.80O2-delta with an associated
   activation energy (E-A) of 0.791(7) eV. The slopes for E-A and
   pre-exponential factor change during phase transition and the
   conductivity decreases monotonically. Upon comparison of the E-A between
   the SmO1.5-CeO2 and NdO1.5-CeO2 systems, it is seen E-A for the
   SmO1.5-CeO2 system is lower than NdO1.5-CeO2 system at compositions with
   less than 25\% trivalent rare earth element while higher E-A is observed
   for the SmO1.5-CeO2 system at Nd/Sm concentrations above 25\%. (c) 2012

Title = {{Enabling high-order integration of fatigue crack growth with surrogate
   modeling}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{150-159}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Modeling fatigue crack growth is computationally challenging because the
   crack growth rate can only be evaluated at the current crack size.
   Therefore, the forward Euler method has been a common choice in
   integrating fatigue crack growth. However, since its accuracy can only
   be guaranteed with a small,step size, the method cannot be applied to
   the investigation of systems with complex geometry (calling for
   expensive finite element simulations). Higher-order integration methods,
   such as the midpoint method, allow larger step size but require
   evaluation of crack growth rate at crack sizes larger than the current
   one. In arbitrary geometry, this is not an easy task because the
   direction of crack growth is unknown in advance. In this paper,
   surrogate models are generated for the prior crack growth direction and
   stress intensity factor data. These surrogates are cheap to evaluate and
   predict the crack growth rate without the need of additional finite
   element simulations. The step size for the numerical integration is
   chosen based on the accuracy of the extrapolated crack growth
   predictions for direction and stress intensity factor. Several examples
   were tested in which crack growth follows linear and curved paths under
   a range of boundary conditions leading to different relationships
   between stress intensity factor and crack size. Results showed that a
   large increase in the allowable step size may be used with increased
   accuracy over the Euler method with the need for fewer expensive
   function evaluations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{While functional imaging is widely used in studies of the brain, how
   well the hemodynamic signal represents the underlying neural activity is
   still unclear. And there is a debate on whether hemodynamic signal is
   more tightly related to synaptic activity or action potentials. This
   study intends to address these questions by examining neurovascular
   coupling driven by pyramidal cells in the motor cortex of rats.
   Pyramidal cells in the motor cortex of rats were selectively transduced
   with the light sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2).
   Electrophysiological recordings and optical intrinsic signal imaging
   were performed simultaneously and synchronously to capture the neural
   activity and hemodynamics induced by optical stimulation of
   ChR2-expressing pyramidal cells. Our results indicate that both synaptic
   activity (local field potential, LFP) and action potentials (multi-unit
   activity, MUA) are tightly related to hemodynamic signals. While LFPs in
   c band are better in predicting hemodynamic signals elicited by short
   stimuli, MUA has better predictions to hemodynamic signals elicited by
   long stimuli. Our results also indicate that strong nonlinearity exists
   in neurovascular coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Unplanned exploitation of groundwater from coastal aquifers may cause
   salt water intrusion in coastal aquifers. Coastal areas are generally
   overpopulated with fertile agricultural lands and diversified irrigated
   farming activities. The objective of this study was to develop a model
   to control/prevent seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer with a
   case study of the Silifke-Goksu Deltaic Plain. A computer program for
   the simulation of three-dimensional variable density groundwater flow,
   SEAWAT, is used to model the seawater intrusion mechanism of the Goksu
   Deltaic Plain along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The calibration
   analysis of the developed seawater intrusion model is performed using
   field measured data in the water-year of 2008 including static
   groundwater head, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solid (TDS),
   and chloride concentration values collected from 23 observation wells
   and the existing data which were compiled and reviewed. The main
   objectives for applying the seawater intrusion model to the Goksu
   Deltaic Plain were (1) to determine the hydraulic and hydrogeologic
   parameters of the aquifer, (2) to estimate the spatial variation of the
   salt concentration in the aquifer and (3) to investigate the impact of
   the increase and decrease in groundwater extractions. The simulation
   results show that the Goksu Deltaic Plain aquifer is especially
   sensitive to the increase in groundwater extraction. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{SMALL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{2856-2868}},

Abstract = {{Clinical applications of the indocyanine green (ICG) dye, the only near
   infrared (NIR) imaging dye approved by the Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA) in the USA, are limited due to rapid protein binding, fast
   clearance, and instability in physiologically relevant conditions.
   Encapsulating ICG in silica particles can enhance its photostability,
   minimize photobleaching, increase the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and
   enable in vivo studies. Furthermore, a combined magnetic resonance (MR)
   and NIR imaging particulate can integrate the advantage of
   high-resolution 3D anatomical imaging with high-sensitivity deep-tissue
   in-vivo fluorescent imaging. In this report, a novel synthesis technique
   that can achieve these goals is presented. A reverse-microemulsion-based
   synthesis protocol is employed to produce 25 nm ICG-doped silica
   nanoparticles (NPs). The encapsulation of ICG is achieved by
   manipulating coulombic attractions with bivalent ions and aminated
   silanes and carrying out silica synthesis in salt-catalyzed, mildly
   basic pH conditions using dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT)/heptane/water
   microemulsion system. Furthermore, paramagnetic properties are imparted
   by chelating paramagnetic Gd to the ICG-doped silica NPs. Aqueous
   ICG-dye-doped silica NPs show increased photostability (over a week) and
   minimal photobleaching as compared to the dye alone. The MR and optical
   imaging capabilities of these particles are demonstrated through
   phantom, in vitro and in vivo experiments. The described particles have
   the potential to act as theranostic agents by combining photodynamic
   therapy through the absorption of NIR irradiated light.}},

Abstract = {{Inorganic fullerene-like (IF) nanoparticles made of metal
   dichalcogenides have previously been recognized to be good friction
   modifiers and anti-wear additives under boundary lubrication conditions.
   The tribological performance of these particles appears to be a result
   of their size, structure and morphology, along with the test conditions.
   However, the very small scale of the IF nanoparticles makes
   distinguishing the properties which affect the lubrication mechanism
   exceedingly difficult.
   In this work, a high resolution transmission electron microscope
   equipped with a nanoindentation holder is used to manipulate individual
   hollow IF-WS2 nanoparticles and to investigate their responses to
   compression. Additional atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
   similarly structured, individual hollow IF-MoS2 nanoparticles are
   performed for compression studies between molybdenum surfaces on their
   major and minor axis diameters. MD simulations of these structures
   allows for characterization of the influence of structural orientation
   on the mechanical behavior and nano-sheet exfoliation of hollow-core IF
   nanoparticles. The experimental and theoretical results for these

Abstract = {{In this paper, an exact reanalysis algorithm based on an incremental
   Cholesky factorization is presented, which can solve a linear system of
   equations when a small portion of the coefficient matrix is modified.
   The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by modeling
   quasi-static crack growth in the extended finite element method. The
   example presented shows that a 60\% to 70\% reduction in computational
   time is achievable by using the reanalysis approach for solving crack
   growth problems. It is shown that the reanalysis approach has increasing
   benefits as the mesh density increases. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Wave, current, acoustic backscatter and suspended sediment concentration
   measurements (both single-point and vertical profiles estimated by
   conversion of acoustic backscatter data) are used to investigate
   wave-current-cohesive sediment interaction on the muddy Atchafalaya
   inner shelf. During an energetic storm, we propose that bed state
   follows a cycle of dilation due to fluidization, erosion, deposition
   with fluid mud formation and consolidation. A one-dimensional-vertical
   cohesive sediment transport model is calibrated using current and
   concentration profiles to estimate the physical parameters that could
   not be measured directly, e. g., bottom stresses. Estimated bed position
   and computed bottom stresses suggest that the critical erosion threshold
   is in the range of 0.3 Pa to 0.5 Pa. The study site is impacted by a
   sediment-laden fresh water plume coming from the Atchafalaya River
   mouth. Bed density evolution during the storm is estimated from vertical
   sediment exchange between the water column and the bed excluding the
   duration of passage of a sediment-carrying water front. The values are
   in the range of 1,030 kg/m(3) to 1,200 kg/m(3) and indicate that the bed
   density increases during the erosion phase and decreases during
   deposition. At the end of the storm, it shows a steady increasing trend
   during hindered settling and exceeds the space-filling value during
   consolidation. Both the critical erosion shear stress and bed density
   values are consistent with the results of laboratory tests on samples
   from the experimental site.}},

   Multispectral Diffuse Optical Tomography}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the main cause of
   cancer-related death in women worldwide. There are limitations
   associated with the existing clinical tools for breast cancer detection
   and alternative modalities for early detection and classification of
   breast cancer are urgently needed. Here we describe an optical imaging
   technique, called multispectral diffuse optical tomography (DOT), and
   demonstrate its ability of non-invasively evaluating nuclear morphometry
   for differentiating benign from malignant lesions. Photon densities
   along the surface of the breast were measured to allow for the
   extraction of three statistical parameters including the size,
   elongation and density of nuclei inside the breast tissue. The results
   from 14 patients (4 malignant and 10 benign lesions) show that there
   exist significant contrasts between the diseased and surrounding normal
   nuclei and that the recovered nuclear morphological parameters agree
   well the pathological findings. We found that the nuclei of cancer cells
   were less-spherical compared with those of surrounding normal cells,
   while the nuclear density or volume fraction provided the highest
   contrast among the three statistical parameters recovered. This pilot
   study demonstrates the potential of multispectral DOT as a cellular
   imaging method for accurate determination of breast cancer.}},
