Title = {{Spatiotemporal gait compensations following medial collateral ligament
   and medial meniscus injury in the rat: correlating gait patterns to
   joint damage}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: After transection of the medial collateral ligament and
   medial meniscus (MCLT + MMT) in the rat, focal cartilage lesions develop
   over 4-6 weeks; however, sham surgery (MCLT alone) does not result in
   cartilage damage over a similar period. Thus, comparison of MCLT + MMT
   with the MCLT sham group offers an opportunity to investigate behavioral
   modifications related to focal cartilage and meniscus damage in the rat.
   Methods: MCLT or MCLT + MMT surgery was performed in the right knees of
   male Lewis rats, with spatiotemporal gait patterns and hind limb
   sensitivity assessed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks postsurgery (n = 8 rats per
   group per time point, n = 64 total). After the animals were euthanized,
   Histology was performed to assess joint damage.
   Results: MCLT + MMT animals had unilateral gait compensations at early
   time points, but by week 6 bilateral gait compensations had developed in
   both the MCLT sham and MCLT + MMT groups. Conversely, heightened tactile
   sensitivity was detected in both MCLT sham and MCLT + MMT animals at
   week 1, but only the MCLT + MMT animals maintained heightened
   sensitivity to week 6. Cartilage lesions were found in the MCLT + MMT
   group but not in the MCLT sham group. Correlations could be identified
   between joint damage and gait changes in MCLT + MMT animals; however,
   the same gait changes were found with MCLT sham animals despite a lack
   of joint damage.
   Conclusions: Combined, our data highlight a common conundrum in
   osteoarthritis (OA) research: Some behavioral changes correlate to
   cartilage damage in the OA group, but the same changes can be identified
   in non-OA controls. Of the behavioral changes detected, allodynia was
   maintained in MCLT + MMT animals but not in the MCLT sham group.
   However, the correlation between cartilage damage and hind limb
   sensitivity is relatively weak (R = -0.4498), and the range of
   sensitivity measures overlaps between groups. The factors driving gait
   abnormalities in MCLT and MCLT + MMT animals also remain uncertain. The
   gait modifications are similar between groups and do not appear until
   weeks after surgery, despite cartilage damage being focused in the MCLT
   + MMT group. Combined, our data highlight the need to evaluate the links
   between noncartilage changes and behavioral changes following joint
   injury in the rat.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the emergence of in phase synchronization in a
   heterogeneous network of coupled inhibitory interneurons in the presence
   of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Using a simple network of
   two mutually coupled interneurons (2-MCI), we first study the effects of
   STDP on in-phase synchronization. We demonstrate that, with STDP, the
   2-MCI network can evolve to either a state of stable 1:1 in phase
   synchronization or exhibit multiple regimes of higher order
   synchronization states. We show that the emergence of synchronization
   induces a structural asymmetry in the 2-MCI network such that the
   synapses onto the high frequency firing neurons are potentiated, while
   those onto the low frequency firing neurons are de potentiated.
   resulting in the directed flow of information from low frequency firing
   neurons to high frequency firing neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that
   the principal findings from our analysis of the 2-MCI network contribute
   to the emergence of robust synchronization in the Wang-Buzsaki network
   (Wang and Buzsaki, 1996) of all-to-all coupled inhibitory interneurons
   (100-MCl) for a significantly larger range of heterogeneity in the
   intrinsic firing rate of the neurons in the network. We conclude that
   STDP of inhibitory synapses provide a viable mechanism for robust neural
   synchronization.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the role of divalent metal cations (Mg2+, Ca2+,

   removal of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate was lower for AER-HCO3
   than AER-Cl, and contaminant removal by AER-HCO3 was affected by the
   presence of metal cation. For instance, magnesium and cadmium exhibited
   the greatest and least interference, respectively, with contaminant
   removal by AER-HCO3. The results suggested that precipitation was not
   the cause of decreased contaminant removal by AER-HCO3, and instead
   implied that complex formation between the contaminant and divalent
   metal was responsible for differences in removal by AER}},

Abstract = {{A commercial coating (epoxy-polyaminoamide waterborne paint) deposited
   on a 2024 aluminium alloy was characterized by impedance measurements,
   first in dry conditions and then as a function of the immersion time in
   NaCl solutions (wet conditions). The behaviour of the dry coating was
   close to that of an ideal capacitor and could be accurately modelled
   with the power-law model corresponding to a constant phase element (CPE)
   behaviour. Upon immersion in NaCl solutions, the behaviour of the wet
   coating became progressively less ideal, i.e. farther from a capacitive
   behaviour. This result provided support to the hypothesis that an
   inhomogeneous uptake of the electrolyte solution was the cause of the
   often observed non-ideal responses of wet coatings. The experimental EIS
   data recorded for immersion times up to 504 hours were compared with
   models assuming either a power-law or an exponential variation of the
   coating resistivity along its thickness, respectively implying a phase
   angle independent of frequency or slightly dependent on it. (C) 2015

Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Network query problem aligns a small query network with an
   arbitrarily large target network. The complexity of this problem grows
   exponentially with the number of nodes in the query network if
   confidence in the optimality of result is desired. Scaling this problem
   to large query and target networks remains to be a challenge.
   Results: In this article, we develop a novel index structure that
   dramatically reduces the cost of the network query problem. Our index
   structure maintains a small set of reference networks where each
   reference network is a small, carefully chosen subnetwork from the
   target network. Along with each reference, we also store all of its
   non-overlapping and statistically significant alignments with the target
   network. Given a query network, we first align the query with the
   reference networks. If the alignment with a reference network yields a
   sufficiently large score, we compute an upper-bound to the alignment
   score between the query and the target using the alignments of that
   reference and the target (which is stored in our index). If the
   upper-bound is large enough, we employ a second round of alignment
   between the query and the target by respecting the mapping found in the
   first alignment. Our experiments on protein-protein interaction networks
   demonstrate that our index achieves a significant speed-up in running
   time over the state-of-the-art methods such as ColT. The alignment
   subnetworks obtained by our method are also statistically significant.
   Finally, we observe that our method finds biologically and statistically
   significant alignments across multiple species.
   Conclusions: We developed a reference network based indexing structure
   that accelerates network query and produces functionally and
   statistically significant results.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Forced expression of defined transcriptional factors has been well
   documented as an effective method for cellular reprogramming or directed
   differentiation. However, transgene expression is not amenable for
   therapeutic application due to potential insertional mutagenesis. Here,
   we have developed a bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS)-based
   protein delivery tool and shown its application in directing pluripotent
   stem cell differentiation by a controlled delivery of transcription
   factors relevant to early heart development. By fusing to an N-terminal
   secretion sequence for T3SSdependent injection, three transcriptional
   factors, namely Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (abbreviated as GMT), were
   translocated into murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where the proteins
   are effectively targeted to the nucleus with an average intracellular
   half-life of 5.5 hours. Exogenous GMT protein injection activated the
   cardiac program, and multiple rounds of GMT protein delivery
   significantly improved the efficiency of ESC differentiation into
   cardiomyocytes. Combination of T3SS-mediated GMT delivery and Activin A
   treatment showed an additive effect, resulting in on average 60\% of the
   ESCs differentiated into cardiomyocytes. ESC derived cardiomyocytes
   displayed spontaneous rhythmic contractile movement as well as normal
   hormonal responses. This work serves as a foundation for the bacterial
   delivery of multiple transcription factors to direct cell fate without
   jeopardizing genomic integrity.}},

Abstract = {{A new design of a fibre-optic probe system is presented which can be
   used to simultaneously detect scattering signals from multiple channels
   for spatially offset Raman spectroscopy and Raman tomography in
   reflection mode. The fibre setup contained 32 source fibres with an
   auto-controlled optical switch and 40 detector fibres, which were
   deployed in a large-area planar interface. Phantom experiments were
   conducted using a prototype of the Raman instrument, and have
   demonstrated the practical applicability of the system design. The
   presented area-detection instrument provides an efficient platform for
   various reflectance applications of Raman modalities over a large area.
   It could also be potentially adopted for other diffuse optical-based
   spectroscopic and tomographic applications.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a novel approach of incorporating UV-blocking features
   into contact lenses by dispersing nanoparticles into the lenses. The
   nanoparticles are prepared by controlling polymerization dynamics using
   chain terminating and chain transfer agents. A theoretical model is
   developed to predict the effect of various formulation parameters on the
   particle size. This approach can produce UV-blocking nanoparticles of
   controlled size below 10 nm in diameter with close to 10\% conversion.
   The model predictions for the mean size are in reasonable agreement with
   the experimental data. The nanoparticles are cleaned and loaded in
   silicone hydrogel contact lenses by soaking the lenses in a solution of
   particles in ethanol and acetone. Lenses loaded with about 6\% particles
   w/w in the hydrated lens block sufficient UV light to be classified as
   Class 1 blockers. The nanoparticles are retained in the lens during
   soaking in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and are stable to
   sterilization by autoclaving. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Ophthalmic drugs are almost exclusively delivered via eye
   drops in spite of several deficiencies, including low bioavailability
   and poor compliance. Contact lenses have the potential to increase
   bioavailability by an order of magnitude, while also improving
   compliance.Areas covered: In this review, the authors summarize advances
   in therapeutic contact lenses. The major focus of the review is on
   patents on drug-eluting contact lenses, but non-drug-eluting contacts
   that offer a therapeutic benefit are also included. The content is
   divided based on the broad technology of the patent, including novel
   materials, molecular imprinting, diffusion barriers, colloid
   encapsulation, surface modification, layering, and other novel
   approaches. In addition to patents, research publications are also
   included to facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms and
   challenges.Expert opinion: Among all non-invasive alternatives, contact
   lenses offer the highest bioavailability to the cornea due to the
   location of the lens in the immediate vicinity of the cornea. Several
   approaches have been patented to improve contact lens design for an
   extended release duration of drugs. Many technologies have successfully
   integrated suitable drug release profiles into contact lenses, but
   drug-eluting contacts are not yet commercialized likely due to
   regulatory challenges, including the high costs of clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management on space vehicles is dominated by passive systems,
   including materials, coatings, louvers and heat pipes, and active
   systems, including pumped liquid loops. Recently, the pulse thermal loop
   was proposed as a novel technology to provide improved heat transfer
   over passive systems in the moderate to high heat flux range and as a
   sustainable alternative to active systems, where an electric pump is
   undesirable. In this work, the performance of an experimental pulse
   thermal loop with refrigerant R-134a is characterized using a test
   facility incorporating variable heat input, driving pressure
   differential, and line lengths. Three automated control schemes are
   investigated, which provide flexibility in design. The performance of
   the device is mapped for a range of power levels and compared with data
   from the literature, highlighting the operating limits. The pulse
   thermal loop provides effective thermal control for a range of heat
   loads from 100 to 800 W while maintaining the source temperature at
   below 60 degrees C. It provides an approximately isothermal heat sink
   even though it is an oscillatory cycle. This is achieved at various
   driving pressure differentials from 3 to 14 bar and pulse frequencies
   from 0.42 to 0.08 Hz. A smaller pressure differential and an increased
   pulse frequency provide improved heat transfer at the source.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) laser-assisted orifice-free printing technique

   investigated the effects of operating conditions, including the laser

   terms of whether printed features are well-defined or not. Four main
   morphologies of printed lines before gelation have been identified
   during line printing: isolated droplets, discontinuous segments,
   well-defined lines, and over-printed lines. The 2125 mJ/cm(2) laser
   fluence and 100 mm/min substrate velocity conditions, corresponding to a
   0.42 overlap ratio, have been identified as a combination of optimal
   printing conditions by using an 8\% alginate solution under a 10 Hz
   laser repetition rate. Alginate straight and bifurcated Y-shaped tubes
   have been successfully printed by applying the identified optimal

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of placing sensors across some area of interest.
   The sensors must be placed so that they cover a fixed set of targets in
   the region, and should be deployed in a manner that allows sensors to
   communicate with one another. In particular, there exists a measure of
   communication effectiveness for each sensor pair, which is determined by
   a concave function of distance between the sensors. Complicating the
   sensor location problem are uncertainties related to sensor placement,
   for example, as caused by drifting due to air or water currents to which
   the sensors may be subjected. Our problem thus seeks to maximize a
   metric regarding intrasensor communication effectiveness, subject to the
   condition that all targets must be covered by some sensor, where sensor
   drift occurs according to a robust (worst-case) mechanism. We formulate
   an approximation approach and develop a cutting-plane algorithm to solve
   this problem, comparing the effectiveness of two different classes of
   inequalities. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of a giant dielectric constant of > 10(5) in calcium
   copper titanate (CCTO) has generated significant interest for
   application in electronic devices. Over the past decade, many methods
   have been developed to synthesize CCTO particles in an effort to
   capitalize upon the outstanding dielectric properties. Polymer film
   capacitors are one application where CCTO could greatly increase the
   typically low dielectric constant of the polymer. Recent work has shown
   that the aspect ratio of the dispersed filler can greatly affect the
   dielectric constant of the polymer with high aspect ratio nanowires
   (NWs) producing greater dielectric constant and energy density than
   spherical particles. While CCTO NWs hold great potential to improve the
   properties of nanocomposite capacitors, no method currently exists for
   their preparation and their integration is challenged by the barrier
   layer capacitance which leads to high dielectric loss. Here, a novel
   two-step hydrothermal reaction is developed for the large-scale
   synthesis of CCTO NWs and an insulating barrier layer is applied to
   greatly reduce the toss while preserving the high dielectric constant.

Abstract = {{Modulated ionospheric heating experiments are performed with the High
   Frequency Active Auroral Research Program facility in Gakona, Alaska,
   for the purpose of generating extremely low frequency (ELF) and very low
   frequency (VLF) waves. Observations are made at three different azimuths
   from the heating facility and at distances from 37 km to 99 km. The
   polarization of the observed waves is analyzed in addition to amplitude
   as a function of modulation frequency and azimuth. Amplitude and
   eccentricity are observed to vary with both azimuth and distance from
   the heating facility. It is found that waves radiated at azimuths
   northwest of the facility are generated by a combination of modulated
   Hall and Pedersen currents, while waves observed at other azimuths are
   dominated by modulated Hall currents. We find no evidence for vertical
   currents contributing to ground observations of ELF/VLF waves. Observed
   amplitude peaks near multiples of 2 kHz are shown to result from
   vertical resonances in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, and variations of
   the frequency of these resonances can be used to determine the D region
   ionosphere electron density profile in the vicinity of the HF heater.}},

Abstract = {{Data and technology are available to support a real-time irrigation
   smartphone app for turf that would result in more efficient irrigation
   scheduling which is needed to reduce water volumes applied and increase
   irrigation water conservation. Objectives were to (1) develop a turf
   irrigation smartphone app for warm season turf that would generate
   real-time irrigation schedules for users to program automatic timers and
   (2) evaluate app performance in regards to turf quality and water
   volumes applied with a field plot study. A smartphone app was developed
   and tested in a plot study in Homestead, Florida, USA, from December
   2013 to November 2014. Study treatments included different irrigation
   scheduling methods: time-based schedule, smartphone app, and two on-site
   evapotranspiration (ET) controllers. Results indicated that the app and
   ET controllers resulted in significantly lower irrigation depths
   compared to the time-based treatment, ranging in water savings from 42\%
   to 57\%. The difference among the app and ET controllers was how
   rainfall was integrated into the schedule. Use of the seasonal water
   conservation model in the smartphone app is recommended to compensate
   for the lack of on-site rainfall measurements in the generated
   irrigation schedule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Florida is a major fresh-market cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var.
   capitata) producing state in the United States. The current cabbage
   production system relies on bare ground and subirrigation that requires
   a large volume of water to irrigate the crop. The bare ground system
   facilitates a maximum of 48,438 plant/ha, while there is a potential to
   increase plant population per area using plasticulture and drip
   irrigation. The objectives of this study were to determine the optimum
   cabbage plant population and plant arrangement that maximizes marketable
   yield per area for a high cabbage population plasticulture system.
   Cabbage was grown on 1.2-m-wide raised beds with black plastic mulch and
   drip irrigation. Plants were grown in either three or four rows with
   in-row plant spacings ranging from 15 to 35 cm and plant populations
   ranging from 41,518 to 129,167 plants/ha. Cabbage marketable yield
   increased as in-row spacing increased. Yields ranged from 19.7 to 69.7
   Mg.ha(-1). Marketable yield was not different between 3 and 4 rows for
   in-row spacings above 25 cm. The 15 and 20 cm in-row spacing produced
   significantly lower yields in the 4-row configuration as compared with
   the 3-row configuration in Fall and Winter 2011. Wider in-row spacings
   produced a greater percentage of heads of marketable size while reducing
   the percentage of small heads when compared with narrower in-row
   spacings. Mean head weight increased as in-row spacing increased and a
   3- or 4-row configuration with an in-row spacing between 25 and 30 cm
   had consistently high yields in all three seasons compared with narrower
   in-row plant spacings. These results indicated that with a high
   population plasticulture system variable plant populations could be
   selected. In-row plant spacings between 30 and 35 cm may be beneficial
   for early plantings while a 25-cm spacing could be more productive for
   later plantings, especially when weather conditions are favorable.}},

Title = {{Mean force on a finite-sized rigid particle, droplet, or bubble in a
   viscous compressible medium}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A force formulation to compute the axial acoustic mean second-order
   force on finite-sized compressible and rigid particles is presented. The
   flow inside and outside the spherical inclusion is considered viscous
   and compressible. Other than for volumetric pulsations of the
   bubble/droplet, the sphericity of the inclusion is maintained (taken to
   be unity). A far-field derivation approach has been used to compute the
   force due to standing and traveling waves; and the force is expressed as
   a multipole expansion (infinite series). In case of a bubble and a rigid
   particle, there exist three length scales that govern the mean
   second-order force: mean radius of the spherical inclusion (R-0),
   wavelength of the incoming acoustics (lambda), and the momentum
   diffusion thickness of the ambient fluid (delta(o)). While R-0 and. are
   arbitrary, we assume the viscous length scale is negligibly small
   compared to the acoustic wavelength. In case of a droplet, however, the
   following additional parameters (inside to outside fluid ratios) also
   play a role: density ratio ((rho) over tilde), viscosity ratio ((mu)
   over tilde), and speed of sound ratio ((c) over tilde). The force
   expression yields the correct behavior in several limiting cases
   considered: (i) inviscid bubble and droplets with R-0/lambda << 1, (ii)
   inviscid bubbles with finite R-0/lambda, and (iii) finite size rigid
   immovable particles. In general, while the monopole alone is sufficient
   to capture the force for small bubbles, higher-order terms are found to
   be important when R-0/lambda >= 0.02. In addition to reporting similar
   behavior for droplets, we study the effect arising from (rho) over
   tilde, (mu) over tilde, (c) over tilde, and delta(o)/R-0 on the mean
   second-order force. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials present many unique materials concepts,
   including material properties that sometimes differ dramatically from
   those of their bulk counterparts. One of these properties,
   piezoelectricity, is important for micro- and nanoelectromechanical
   systems applications. Using symmetry analysis, we determine the
   independent piezoelectric coefficients for four groups of predicted and
   synthesized 2D materials. We calculate with density-functional
   perturbation theory the stiffness and piezoelectric tensors of these
   materials. We determine the in-plane piezoelectric coefficient d(11) for
   37 materials within the families of 2D metal dichalcogenides, metal
   oxides, and III-V semiconductor materials. A majority of the structures,
   including CrSe2, CrTe2, CaO, CdO, ZnO, and InN, have d(11) coefficients
   greater than 5 pm/V, a typical value for bulk piezoelectric materials.
   Our symmetry analysis shows that buckled 20 materials exhibit an
   out-of-plane coefficient d(31). We find that d(31) for 8 III-V
   semiconductors ranges from 0.02 to 0.6 pm/V. From statistical analysis,
   we identify correlations between the piezoelectric coefficients and the
   electronic and structural properties of the 20 materials that elucidate
   the origin of the piezoelectricity. Among the 37 2D materials, CdO, ZnO,
   and CrTe2 stand out for their combination of large piezoelectric
   coefficient and low formation energy and are recommended for
   experimental exploration.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this study, microstructures are employed to manipulate
   thermohydraulic characteristics of the lithium bromide (LiBr) solution
   flow in a membrane-based absorber in order to enhance the absorption
   rate. In a membrane-based absorber, the liquid absorbent is constrained
   between a solid wall and a highly permeable membrane, thus facilitating
   manipulation of the flow properties. Recent numerical studies have shown
   that transport mode in a laminar flow can be changed from diffusive to
   advective via the implementation of surface microstructures on the flow
   channel walls. Here, we experimentally evaluate the enhancement in
   absorption rate caused by the introduction of microstructures on the
   solution flow channel wall of a membrane-based absorber. The experiments
   are conducted in a fully instrumented membrane-based absorption
   refrigeration system. The geometry and dimensions of the microstructures
   are based on the optimal values determined in our previous numerical
   studies. Absorption rates as high as that of a 100-mu m-thick solution
   film (in the absence of wall features) is achieved but at two orders of
   magnitude less pressure drop. The achievement of a high absorption rate
   at a relatively low solution pressure drop in the proposed approach
   enhances the prospect of developing large-scale membrane-based
   absorbers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient stationary multivariate non-Gaussian simulation method is
   developed using spectral representation and third order Hermite
   polynomial translation. An approximate closed form relationship is
   employed to identify the Hermite translation parameters based on target
   skewness and kurtosis. This preserves a high degree of accuracy over the
   entire admissible range of the Hermite translation, and eliminates the
   need for iterative solution of the translation parameters. The Hermite
   PDF model is suitable for a wide range of strongly non-Gaussian
   stochastic process. In addition, an explicit bidirectional relationship
   between the target non-Gaussian and Gaussian correlation is developed to
   eliminate the need for iteration or numerical integration to identify
   the underlying Gaussian correlation. Examples apply the simulation
   method to both theoretical targets and experimental wind pressure data.

Abstract = {{BackgroundThis article reports on the findings of the effect of two
   structured exercise interventions on secondary cognitive outcomes that
   were gathered as part of the Progressive Resistance Exercise Training in
   Parkinson's disease (PD) randomized, controlled trial.
   MethodsThis study was a prospective, parallel-group, single-center
   trial. Fifty-one nondemented patients with mild-to-moderate PD were
   randomly assigned either to modified Fitness Counts (mFC) or to
   Progressive Resistance Exercise Training (PRET) and were followed for 24
   months. Cognitive outcomes were the Digit Span, Stroop, and Brief Test
   of Attention (BTA).
   ResultsEighteen patients in mFC and 20 patients in PRET completed the
   trial. At 12 and at 24 months, no differences between groups were
   observed. At 12 months, relative to baseline, mFC improved on the Digit
   Span (estimated change: 0.3; interquartile range: 0, 0.7; P=0.04) and
   Stroop (0.3; 0, 0.6; P=0.04), and PRET improved only on the Digit Span
   (0.7; 0.3, 1; P<0.01). At 24 months, relative to baseline, mFC improved
   on the Digit Span (0.7; 0.3, 1.7; P<0.01) and Stroop (0.3; 0.1, 0.5;
   P=0.03), whereas PRET improved on the Digit Span (0.5; 0.2, 0.8;
   P<0.01), Stroop (0.2; -0.1, 0.6; P=0.048), and BTA (0.3; 0, 0.8;
   P=0.048). No neurological or cognitive adverse events were observed.
   ConclusionsThis study provides class IV level of evidence that 24 months
   of PRET or mFC may improve attention and working memory in nondemented
   patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{We report a strategy for the preparation of semitelechelic polymers
   containing two distinct functionalities at one chain end by consecutive
   and chemoselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions on
   2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (TCT). Because of its commercial
   availability, well-defined nature, and ubiquity in biological
   applications, monomethyl ether poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) was chosen
   to demonstrate the utility of this omega,omega-heterodifunctional
   end-group modification strategy. TCT-functionalized mPEG underwent
   highly efficient omega,omega-heterodisubstitution via sequential
   chemoselective substitution with model thiols and amines. The efficiency
   of nucleophile conjugation to the polymer end group was confirmed by H-1
   NMR spectroscopy and matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In addition, density functional theory
   calculations provided insight into the importance of nucleophile
   addition order. This route introduces TCT derivatization as a powerful
   and facile tool to achieve specific polymeric end-group complexity and
   efficient heterogeneous functionalization.}},

Title = {{Designing an over-the-counter consumer decision-making tool for older
   adults}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{113-123}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Older adults are at increased risk of adverse drug events due
   to medication. Older adults tend to take more medication and are at
   higher risk of chronic illness. Over-the-counter (OTC) medication does
   not require healthcare provider oversight and understanding OTC
   information is heavily dependent on a consumer's ability to understand
   and use the medication appropriately. Coupling health technology with
   effective communication is one approach to address the challenge of
   communicating health and improving health related tasks. However, the
   success of many health technologies also depends on how well the
   technology is designed and how well it addresses users needs. This is
   especially true for the older adult population. This paper describes (1)
   a formative study performed to understand how to design novel health
   technology to assist older adults with OTC medication information, and
   (2) how a user-centered design process helped to refine the initial
   assumptions of user needs and help to conceptualize the technology.
   Methods: An iterative design process was used. The process included two
   brainstorming and review sessions with human-computer interaction
   researchers and design sessions with older adults in the form of
   semi-structured interviews. Methods and principles of user-centered
   research and design were used to inform the research design. Two
   researchers with expertise in human-computer interaction performed
   expert reviews of early system prototypes. After initial prototypes were
   developed, seven older adults were engaged in semi-structured interviews
   to understand usability concerns and features and functionality older
   adults may find useful for selecting appropriate OTC medication.
   Results: Eight usability concerns were discovered and addressed in the
   two rounds of expert review, and nine additional usability concerns were
   discovered in design sessions with older adults. Five themes emerged
   from the interview transcripts as recommendations for design. These
   recommendations represent opportunities for technology such as the one
   described in this paper to support older adults in the OTC
   decision-making process.
   Discussion: This paper illustrates the use of an iterative user-centered
   process in the formative stages of design and its usefulness for
   understanding aspects of the technology design that are useful to older
   adults when making decisions about OTC medication. The technology
   support mechanisms included in the initial model were revised based on
   the results from the iterative design sessions and helped to refine and
   conceptualize the system being designed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The catalytic activity of aqueous NaOH-quaternary ammonium surfactant
   (NaOH-QAS) solutions was studied for efficient and selective synthesis
   of flavanone by cross aldol reaction of benzaldehyde and o-hydroxy
   acetophenone (as model reaction) under ambient condition (at 30 degrees
   C). The surfactant's nature (alkyl chain length and head group size) and
   concentration influence the reaction in NaOH-QAS micellar solutions. The
   NaOH-QAS systems, with surfactant concentration below critical micelle
   concentration (CMC), showed high activity giving high conversion and
   flavanone selectivity. This result was interpreted as substrate induced
   micellization and favorable interactions of surfactant molecules with
   reactants and intermediates. The reduction in conversion and selectivity
   of flavanone was observed with NaOH-QAS solutions having surfactant
   concentration at CMC or above CMC, which was due to strong
   solubilization of o-hydroxy acetophenone and intermediates in the
   micelles. The highest conversion (92\% in 24 h) and selectivity of
   flavanone (98\%) were obtained with NaOH-cetylpyridinium chloride
   (NaOH-C(16)PQAS) system at surfactant concentration below CMC. The -OH
   group present in o-hydroxy acetophenone was observed to be responsible
   for its less reactivity in the aldol reaction. The reusability of
   NaOH-cationic surfactant solution was examined for three reaction
   cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{PTFE/alpha-alumina composites are well known to exhibit very low wear
   rates compared to unfilled PTFE and various other PTFE-matrix
   composites. The improved wear life of these composites is attributed in
   part to the formation of a uniform protective transfer film on the metal
   countersurface. It is postulated that the retention of transferred
   material and the recirculation of third bodies between the transfer film
   and running surface of the polymer composite are necessary for the
   maintenance of low wear within this tribological system. The
   accumulation of these third bodies was observed in reciprocating sliding
   tests on countersamples prescribed with aligned roughness. Wear
   performance of the polymer composite was tested as a function of the
   between the sliding direction and the aligned roughness of the
   countersample, ranging from parallel to perpendicular to the sliding
   direction. The wear rate of roughness oriented with the sliding
   direction was 300 times higher than roughness perpendicular to the
   sliding direction, revealing the importance of surface morphology and
   third body retention.}},

Abstract = {{Automated understanding and recognition of human activities and
   behaviors in a smart space (e.g., smart house) is of paramount
   importance to many critical human-centered applications. Recognized
   activities are the input to the pervasive computer (the smart space)
   which intelligently interacts with the users to maintain the
   application's goal be it assistance, safety, child-development,
   entertainment or other goals. Research in this area is fascinating but
   severely lacks adequate validation which often relies on datasets that
   contain sensory data representing the activities. Availing adequate
   datasets that can be used in a large variety of spaces, for different
   user groups, and aiming at different goals is very challenging. This is
   due to the prohibitive cost and the human capital needed to instrument
   physical spaces and to recruit human subjects to perform the activities
   and generate data. Simulation of human activities in smart spaces has
   therefore emerged as an alternative approach to bridge this deficit.
   Traditional event-driven approaches have been proposed. However, the
   complexity of human activity simulation was proved to be challenging to
   these initial simulation efforts. In this paper, we present Persim 3D-an
   alternative context-driven approach to simulating human activities
   capable of supporting complex activity scenarios. We present the
   context-activity-action nexus and show how our approach combines
   modeling and visualization of actions with context and activity
   simulation. We present the Persim 3D architecture and algorithms, and
   describe a detailed validation study of our approach to verify the
   accuracy and realism of the simulation output (datasets and
   visualizations) and the scalability of the human effort in using Persim
   3D to simulate complex scenarios. We show positive and promising results
   that validate our approach.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the rate-distortion (R-D) behavior, in a real-time
   wireless video communication system, the end-to-end delay would also
   significantly affect the overall video reception quality. To analyze,
   control, and optimize the R-D behavior under the end-to-end delay
   constraint, in this paper we extend the traditional R-D optimization
   (RDO) for the wireless video communication system and formulate a novel
   delay-RDO-based rate control problem, by investigating the allocation of
   end-to-end delay to different delay components. It aims at minimizing
   the average total end-to-end distortion under the transmission rate and
   end-to-end delay constraints, by a joint selection of both the source
   coding and the channel coding parameters. The wireless channel is
   represented by a finite-state Markov channel model characterizing the
   time-varying process and predicting the future channel condition. As
   applicable solutions, a practical algorithm based on the Lagrange
   multiplier approaches, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, and sequential
   quadratic programming methods is developed. The experimental results
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the existing
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity of risks posed by climate change and possible adaptations
   for crop production has called for integrated assessment and modelling
   (IAM) approaches linking biophysical and economic models. This paper
   attempts to provide an overview of the present state of crop modelling
   to assess climate change risks to food production and to which extent
   crop models comply with IAM demands. Considerable progress has been made
   in modelling effects of climate variables, where crop models best
   satisfy IAM demands. Demands are partly satisfied for simulating
   commonly required assessment variables. However, progress on the number
   of simulated crops, uncertainty propagation related to model parameters
   and structure, adaptations and scaling are less advanced and lagging
   behind IAM demands. The limitations are considered substantial and apply
   to a different extent to all crop models. Overcoming these limitations
   will require joint efforts, and consideration of novel modelling
   approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive mesh refinement method for solving optimal control problems
   is developed. The method employs orthogonal collocation at
   Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, and adjusts both the mesh size and the
   degree of the approximating polynomials in the refinement process. A
   previously derived convergence rate is used to guide the refinement
   process. The method brackets discontinuities and improves solution
   accuracy by checking for large increases in higher-order derivatives of
   the state. In regions between discontinuities, where the solution is
   smooth, the error in the approximation is reduced by increasing the
   degree of the approximating polynomial. On mesh intervals where the
   error tolerance has been met, mesh density may be reduced either by
   merging adjacent mesh intervals or lowering the degree of the
   approximating polynomial. Finally, the method is demonstrated on two
   examples from the open literature and its performance is compared
   against a previously developed adaptive method. (C) 2015 The Franldin

Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1274-1281}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Explaining variability in the strength and sign of trophic interactions
   between primary consumers and plants is a long-standing research
   challenge. Consumer density and body size vary widely in space and time
   and are predicted to have interactive effects on consumer-plant
   interactions. In a southern US salt marsh, we used replicate field
   enclosures to orthogonally manipulate the body size (mass) and density
   of a dominant consumer (a snail). We investigated impacts (leaf damage
   and biomass) on monocultures of cordgrass, the foundation species, over
   three months. Increasing consumer density and body size increased leaf
   damage additively and, as predicted, multiplicatively reduced plant
   biomass. Notably, size and density determined the sign of consumer
   impact on plants: low to medium densities of small consumers enhanced,
   while high densities of large consumers strongly suppressed, plant
   biomass. Finally, total consumer metabolic biomass (mass(0.75)) within
   an enclosure parsimoniously explained plant biomass response, supporting
   theoretical predictions and suggesting that multiplicative effects of
   density and body size resulted from their effects on total metabolic
   biomass. The consequences of changes in consumer density and body size
   resulting from anthropogenic perturbations may therefore be predicted
   based on metabolic biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Age-associated cognitive decline can reduce an individual's quality of
   life. As no single neurobiological deficit can account for the wide
   spectrum of behavioral impairments observed in old age, it is critical
   to develop an understanding of how interactions between different brain
   regions change over the life span. The performance of young and aged
   animals on behaviors that require the hippocampus and cortical regions
   to interact, however, has not been well characterized. Specifically, the
   ability to link a spatial location with specific features of a stimulus,
   such as object identity, relies on the hippocampus, perirhinal and
   prefrontal cortices. Although aging is associated with dysfunction in
   each of these brain regions, behavioral measures of functional change
   within the hippocampus, perirhinal and prefrontal cortices in individual
   animals are often not correlated. Thus, how dysfunction of a single
   brain region within this circuit, such as the hippocampus, impacts
   behaviors that require communication with the perirhinal and prefrontal
   cortices remains unknown. To address this question, young and aged rats
   were tested on the interregion dependent object-place paired association
   task, as well as a hippocampal-dependent test of spatial reference
   memory. This particular cohort of aged rats did not show deficits on the
   hippocampal-dependent task, but were significantly impaired at acquiring
   object-place associations relative to young. These data suggest that
   behaviors requiring functional connectivity across different regions of
   the memory network may be particularly sensitive to aging, and can be
   used to develop models that will clarify the impact of systems-level
   dysfunction in the elderly.}},

Title = {{Effect of uncertainties in wind speed and direction on the fatigue
   damage of long-span bridges}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{468-478}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{In order to estimate wind-induced fatigue damage, most methods use the
   probability density functions of wind speed and direction. Conventional
   approaches assume that these functions are error-free and provide a
   single estimated damage value. However, the estimated damage may contain
   significant errors because the probability density functions are
   generally inexact, and the parameters for the functions rely on limited
   measured data. We propose a Bayesian approach to determine the fatigue
   damage while considering the uncertainties in the probability model and
   the parameter. The proposed approach provides a distribution of damage
   values, which enables more comprehensive analysis of fatigue damage
   using bounds and exceedance probability. The approach is applied to the
   estimation of fatigue damage of long-span bridges. We also illustrate an
   additional feature of the Bayesian approach, which is to systematically
   update the damage index as more measurements become available over time.
   Effect of data size is investigated to quantify the error due to the
   limited measured data. The influence of uncertainties in other
   parameters and effects of long term wind speed variability is also
   included in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrothermal investigation on vertically aligned single-walled carbon
   nanotube (SWCNT) contacted phase-change memory (PCM) array is performed
   using the 3-D time-domain finite-element method. The in-house-developed
   algorithm is verified by comparing the simulated results with the
   experimental ones published by others. Thermal coupling between adjacent
   cells, which may cause current leakage and reliability degradation, is
   characterized for PCMs with different geometrical parameters, which
   could be caused by fabrication variation. It is shown that spacing
   variation between adjacent PCM cells draws a slight effect on their
   thermal coupling. However, thermal boundary resistance of the
   phase-change material-oxide interface and SWCNT diameter affect
   temperature rise and thermal coupling significantly. On the other hand,
   it is indicated that the SWCNT contacted PCM has microampere-scale
   programming current and nanosecond-scale thermal response time, which
   make it vulnerable to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Electrothermal
   responses to ESD are captured and compared, which show that
   unintentional ESD can change the state of PCM and result in error
   programming.}},

Abstract = {{Instead of charging tolls on individual links, this paper considers
   doing the same on paths. Path and link tolls are ``valid{''} if they
   encourage motorists to use routes that collectively lead to a target
   distribution, e.g., one that minimizes travel delay. Because the numbers
   of valid link and path tolls are typically infinite, an objective in
   pricing tolls is to find a set of valid tolls that yields the least
   revenue to lessen the financial burden on motorists.
   Path tolls are generally more flexible than link tolls and this paper
   shows that this flexibility can substantially reduce the financial
   burden on motorists. Additionally, valid path tolls yielding the least
   revenue possess characteristics with interesting policy implications. To
   determine these path tolls, it is natural to formulate the problem as a
   mathematical program with complementarity constraints. However, this
   paper also investigates alternative formulations that highlight the
   problem's complexity and suggest ways to solve the problem efficiently.

Abstract = {{A novel method involving the use of micromechanical analysis to predict
   elastic constants of a unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite is
   proposed. The method revolves around a model called the two-parameter
   model. The two parameters are obtained by performing one micromechanical
   analysis of the composite unit cell along one of its transverse
   directions. The method involves construction of response surfaces that
   act as surrogate models, for the prediction of the two parameters,
   corresponding to any fiber-reinforced composite design that uses a
   transversely isotropic fiber and an isotropic matrix. Using the two
   parameters, four of the five elastic constants can be computed. The
   fifth elastic constant, longitudinal shear modulus, is predicted using a
   separate response surface. The results indicate that the two-parameter
   model in conjunction with the response surface makes accurate prediction
   of composite elastic constants.}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamic performance of flapping micro air vehicles in hover
   conditions is dependent on many parameters, including the wing design.
   With the goal of optimizing the wing for hover performance, the initial
   focus was to reduce the uncertainty in the thrust measurements. This is
   because lower uncertainty in this metric enables better resolution in
   comparing the performance of different designs. Aerodynamic performance
   variability was deemed to be the fault of an imprecise manufacturing
   technique. Therefore, adjustments were made to the fabrication process
   until a permissible level of uncertainty was attained for optimization;
   the goal was less than 5\%. This paper chronicles the progression of the
   wing fabrication process and details how the uncertainty was evaluated.
   Four fabrication methods and two different wing designs are included in
   this study: a carbon fiber hand layup technique, carbon fiber cured in a
   machined mold, and two variations of a machined plastic skeleton
   reinforced with a carbon fiber rod. The uncertainty in thrust
   production, expressed in coefficient of variation, improved from 16.8\%
   for the hand layup method to 2.6\% for the computer numerically
   controlled plastic skeleton adhered to the nylon membrane with transfer
   tape. Additionally, the coefficient of variation for wing weight also
   reduced (from 11.4 to 2.0\%).}},

Title = {{Impacts of hazardous air pollutants emitted from phosphate fertilizer

Abstract = {{The concentrations and distribution of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)
   metals emitted from four phosphate fertilizer plants in Central Florida,
   as well as their environmental and health impacts, were investigated. It
   was hypothesized that the modern control devices employed in the plants
   would lower the exposure, if any, to an acceptable level. The dominant
   HAP metals emitted from the stacks of these plants were identified to be
   Mn, Cr, Ni, and Se. The ambient concentrations at six receptors
   (Zephyrhills, Plant City, Tampa, Lakeland, Tower Dairy, and Sydney)
   downwind the plants estimated by AERMOD revealed the maximum ground
   level concentrations were lower than the European Communities and USEPA
   standards. Source apportionment estimated by the chemical mass balance
   (CMB) model indicated that marine (45.5 +/- 17.1 \%) and geological
   (17.3 +/- 10.6 \%) were the top two contributors for 26 elements, while
   the phosphate fertilizer plants contributed only 1.14 +/- 0.55 \%.
   Unexpectedly, the maximum ground-level risks for Cr from plant A (1.3 x
   10(-6) +/- 8.4 x 10(-8)) and plant D (1.1 x 10(-6) +/- 6.7 x 10(-8))
   were slightly higher than the general guideline of 1 x 10(-6), but they
   occurred within the facility limit. No other metals approached levels of
   concern for non-cancer risks. One possible source for Cr emissions from
   these plants may be stainless steel milling balls used in the production
   process. Sensitivity analysis of the meteorological data in 2001-2005
   showed only 7.7 \% variation in the corresponding risk. Overall,
   phosphate fertilizer plants make minor contribution to the ambient
   levels of HAP metals compared to other sources for the general
   population in the Tampa Bay area, although more in-depth investigation
   into the Cr emissions is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{We trained and tested young (6-8 months; n = 13), middle-aged (12-14
   months; n = 41), and aged (22-24 months; n = 24) male Fischer 344 rats
   in a rapid acquisition water maze task and then quantified 27 stress
   hormones, cytokines and chemokines in their serum, hippocampi and
   frontal cortices using bead assay kits and xMAP technology. Middle-aged
   and aged rats learned the location of the hidden platform over training
   trials more slowly than their young counterparts. After training, young
   rats outperformed middle-aged and aged rats on both immediate and 24 h
   retention probe trials and about half of the middle-aged and aged
   (aging) rats exhibited impaired performances when tested on the
   retention probe trial 24 h later. The concentrations of many serum,
   hippocampal and cortical analytes changed with age often in networks
   that may represent age-sensitive signaling pathways and the
   concentrations of some of these analytes correlated with water maze
   learning and/or memory scores. Serum GRO/KC and RANTES levels,
   hippocampal GM-CSF levels and cortical IL-9 and RANTES levels were
   significantly higher in rats categorized as memory-impaired versus elite
   agers based upon their 24 h probe trial performances. Our data add to
   the emerging picture of how age-related changes in immune and
   neuroimmune system signaling impacts cognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{A numerical investigation of fine sediment resuspension in the wave
   boundary layer-Uncertainties in particle inertia and hindered settling}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{176-192}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The wave bottom boundary layer is a major conduit delivering fine
   terrestrial sediments to continental margins. Hence, studying fine
   sediment resuspensions in the wave boundary layer is crucial to the
   understanding of various components of the earth system, such as carbon
   cycles. By assuming the settling velocity to be a constant in each
   simulation, previous turbulence-resolving numerical simulations reveal
   the existence of three transport modes in the wave boundary layer
   associated with sediment availabilities. As the sediment availability
   and hence the sediment-induced stable stratification increases, a
   sequence of transport modes, namely, (I) well-mixed transport, (II)
   formulation of lutodine resembling a two-layer system, and (III)
   completely laminarized transport are observed. In general, the settling
   velocity is a flow variable due to hindered settling and particle
   inertia effects. Present numerical simulations including the particle
   inertia suggest that for a typical wave condition in continental
   shelves, the effect of particle inertia is negligible. Through
   additional numerical experiments, we also confirm that the particle
   inertia tends (up to the Stokes number St = 0.2) to attenuate flow
   turbulence. On the other hand, for flocs with lower gelling
   concentrations, the hindered settling can play a key role in sustaining
   a large amount of suspended sediments and results in the laminarized
   transport (III). For the simulation with a very significant hindered
   settling effect due to a low gelling concentration, results also
   indicate the occurrence of gelling ignition, a state in which the
   erosion rate is always higher than the deposition rate. A sufficient
   condition for the occurrence of gelling ignition is hypothesized for a
   range of wave intensities as a function of sediment/floc properties and
   erodibility parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Incorporating Transverse Curvature in the Substrate}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMP) have the potential to be utilized as a
   lightweight, solid state actuator in modern reconfigurable structures
   including as a deployment system for satellite solar panels or morphing
   aircraft wings. This paper is primarily concerned with the use of
   Veriflex-SA (R) shape memory polymer and bi-directional
   carbon-fiber-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) in a flexural unimorph actuator
   configuration. One of the major deficiencies of SMP unimorphs is the
   permanent set (unrecovered shape) after a single or multiple temperature
   cycle(s). The novel concept of incorporating transverse curvature in the
   CFRP substrate, similar to that of an extendable tape measurer, is
   proposed to improve the shape recovery by increasing the bending
   stiffness of the unimorph actuator to compensate for the lack of
   recovery of the SMP. A set of experiments was designed to investigate
   the influence of transverse curvature, the relative widths of SMP and
   CFRP substrates, and shape memory polymer thickness on actuator
   recoverability after multiple thermo-mechanical cycles. The performance
   of SMP unimorph actuators with varying degrees of transverse curvature
   were evaluated versus that of traditional SMP unimorphs incorporating a
   flat substrate. Digital image correlation was implemented to quantify
   the out-of-plane deflection of the unimorph composite actuators (UCAs)
   during the actuation cycle. Experimental results indicate that an
   actuator with transverse curvature significantly reduces the residual
   deformation by at least two orders of magnitude which could be further
   tailored to enhance the performance of shape memory polymers in
   reconfigurable arrangements.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling receptor-mediated processes in cells is paramount in many
   research areas. The activity of small molecules and growth factors is
   difficult to control and can lead to off-target effects through the
   activation of nonspecific receptors as well as binding affinity to

   molecular trigger in the form of a divalent nucleic acid aptamer
   assembly toward vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2).
   The assembly binds to VEGFR2 and functions as a receptor agonist with
   targeted receptor binding, promoting receptor phosphorylation,
   activation of the downstream Akt pathway, upregulation of endothelial
   nitric oxide synthase, and endothelial cell capillary tube formation.
   The agonist action we report makes this aptamer construct a promising
   strategy to control VEGFR2-mediated cell signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Regulations that dictate the management of asbestos-containing materials
   (ACM) and lead-based paint (LBP) debris in the United States require
   these materials to be managed in a specific manner at the job site to
   reduce potentially hazardous exposure to site workers, and the disposal
   of the materials is regulated through notification and special handling
   requirements. However, management of ACM and LBP from residential
   projects are afforded some exemptions in U.S. regulations; thus, some
   quantity of these materials may be delivered to a disposal facility,
   thus representing a potential exposure concern for landfill workers
   because ACM and LBP cannot be detected through visual inspection. A
   novel characterization framework was developed to quantify the
   occurrence of ACM and LBP in discarded construction and demolition
   (C\&D) debris. A total of 266 loads of debris and 307 samples of
   potential ACM were collected from 10 landfills in Georgia with a total
   of four detections of asbestos (frequency of 1.3\%). A total of 487
   painted surfaces of incoming waste were analyzed for lead using a
   handheld X-ray fluorescence device, with a total of 70 positive
   detections (defined as a concentration greater than 1 mg/cm(2)). The
   mass of debris corresponding to the positive lead detections comprised a
   mass fraction of 1.4\% of all waste that was sampled. The results
   represent the most extensive sampling and analysis of ACM and LBP in
   discarded C\&D debris, demonstrating that the U.S. federal regulatory
   scheme for management of ACM and LBP are generally effective at limiting
   indiscriminate disposal of ACM and LBP. The results were also likely
   impacted by the timeframe of ACM and LBP use in the United States and
   the typical service life of construction materials that used ACM and
   LBP. The framework developed in this study can be applied at other
   disposal and recycling facilities to characterize other waste streams of
   interest that are difficult to assess through visual approximation such
   as specific metal alloys. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Modulation of immunological responses to allografts following
   transplantation is of pivotal importance to improving graft outcome and
   duration. Of the many approaches, harnessing the dominant tolerance
   induced by regulatory T cells (T-reg) holds tremendous promise. Recent
   studies have highlighted the unique potency of cell surface-bound
   TGF-beta 1 on T-reg for promoting infectious tolerance, i.e. to confer
   suppressive capacity from one cell to another. To mimic this
   characteristic, TGF-beta 1 was chemoselectively tethered to inert and
   viable polymer grafting platforms using Staudinger ligation. We report
   the synthesis and functional characterization of these engineered
   TGF-beta 1 surfaces. Inert beads tethered with TGF-beta 1 were capable
   of efficiently converting naive CD4(+) CD62L(hi) T cells to functional
   T-reg. Concordantly, translation of conjugation scheme from inert
   surfaces to viable cells also led to efficient generation of functional
   T-reg. Further, the capacity of these platforms to generate
   antigen-specific T-reg was demonstrated. These findings illustrate the
   unique faculty of tethered TGF-beta 1 biomaterial platforms to function
   as an ``infectious{''} T-reg and provide a compelling approach for
   generating tolerogenic microenvironments for allograft transplantation.

Abstract = {{Accurate description of the mechanical response of AZ31 Mg requires
   consideration of its strong anisotropy both at the single crystal and
   polycrystal levels, and its evolution with accumulated plastic
   deformation. In this paper, a self-consistent mean field crystal
   plasticity model, viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC), is used for
   modeling the room-temperature deformation of AZ31 Mg. A step-by-step
   procedure to calibrate the material parameters based on simple tensile
   and compressive mechanical test data is outlined. It is shown that the
   model predicts with great accuracy both the macroscopic stress-strain
   response and the evolving texture for these strain paths used for
   calibration. The stress-strain response and texture evolution for
   loading paths that were not used for calibration, including off-axis
   uniaxial loadings and simple shear, are also well described. In
   particular, VPSC model predicts that for uniaxial tension along the
   through-thickness direction, the stress-strain curve should have a
   sigmoidal shape.}},

   Case-Hardened Bearing Steel Subjected to Rolling Contact Fatigue}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRIBOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{A combined experimental and numerical method is developed to estimate
   the continuously evolving cyclic plastic strain amplitudes in
   plastically deformed subsurface regions of a case-hardened M50 NiL steel
   rod subjected to rolling contact fatigue (RCF) over several hundred
   million cycles. The subsurface hardness values measured over the entire
   plastically deformed regions and the elastoplastic von Mises stresses
   determined from the three-dimensional (3D) Hertzian contact finite
   element (FE) model have been used in conjunction with Neuber's rule to
   estimate the evolved cyclic plastic strain amplitudes at various points
   within the RCF-affected zone. The cyclic stress-strain plots developed
   as a function of case depth revealed that cyclic hardening exponent of
   the material is greater than the monotonic strain-hardening exponent.
   Effective S-N diagram for the RCF loading of the case-hardened steel has
   been presented and the effect of compressive mean stress on its fatigue
   strength has been explained using Haigh diagram. The compressive mean
   stress correction according to Haigh diagram predicts that the allowable
   fatigue strength of the steel increases by a factor of two compared to
   its fatigue limit before mean stress correction, thus potentially
   allowing the rolling element bearings to operate over several hundred
   billion cycles. The methodology presented here is generalized and can be
   adopted to obtain the constitutive response and S-N diagrams of both
   through-and case-hardened steels subjected to RCF.}},

Abstract = {{This study considers a class of critical node detection problems that
   involves minimization of a distance-based connectivity measure of a
   given unweighted graph via the removal of a subset of nodes (referred to
   as critical nodes) subject to a budgetary constraint. The distance-based
   connectivity measure of a graph is assumed to be a function of the
   actual pairwise distances between nodes in the remaining graph (e.g.,
   graph efficiency, Harary index, characteristic path length, residual
   closeness) rather than simply whether nodes are connected or not, a
   typical assumption in the literature. We derive linear integer
   programming (IP) formulations, along with additional enhancements, aimed
   at improving the performance of standard solvers. For handling larger
   instances, we develop an effective exact algorithm that iteratively
   solves a series of simpler IPs to obtain an optimal solution for the
   original problem. The edge-weighted generalization is also considered,
   which results in some interesting implications for distance-based clique
   relaxations, namely, s -clubs. Finally, we conduct extensive
   computational experiments with real-world and randomly generated network
   instances under various settings that reveal interesting insights and
   demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. In
   particular, one important conclusion of our work is that vulnerability
   of real-world networks to targeted attacks can be significantly more
   pronounced than what can be estimated by centrality-based heuristic
   methods commonly used in the literature. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

   first framework that achieves approximation guarantees for the NP-hard
   Modularity maximization problem, especially on dynamic scale-free
   networks. To certify our approach, we conduct extensive experiments in
   comparison with other adaptive methods on both synthesized networks with
   known community structures and real-world traces including ArXiv e-print

Abstract = {{We investigated the adsorption of NO on the PdO(101) surface using

   From TPD, we find that NO reaches a saturation coverage of similar to

   saturated layer produces a complex TPD trace with five pronounced maxima
   between 100 and 550 K. We observe negligible quantities of desorbing
   products other than NO during TPD, indicating that NO does not react on

   reveal that NO adsorption at 90 K produces both flat-lying and atop
   configurations of NO on the coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Pd atoms of
   PdO(101), but that these configurations are meta-stable and transform to
   bridge-NO species at higher temperature. RAIRS measurements further show
   that NO binding on atop-Pd-cus sites becomes preferred with increasing
   coverage above similar to 25\% of the Pd-cus density, and provide
   evidence of a weakly-bound state at coverages above 100\% (035 ML).
   Consistent with our experimental findings, DFT predicts that NO
   preferentially adsorbs on bridge-Pd-cus sites at low coverage and that
   the site preference changes to atop-Pd-cus sites with increasing NO
   coverage, resulting in mixtures of atop-bridge NO configurations as well
   as an all-atop configuration. DFT also predicts that NO can adopt a
   flat-lying configuration on the Pd-cus row at low coverage, and can also
   achieve stable bonding on the fourfold Pd sites of PdO(101) at high NO
   coverages. Both the computational and experimental results show that NO
   binds on PdO(101) in multiple, local configurations even at low
   coverage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water treatment infrastructure faces numerous operational and financial
   challenges in most regions of the world. Ion exchange is a water
   treatment technology that can be used to remove various contaminants in
   drinking water and has shown increased adoption in recent years due to
   its operational advantages; however, limited research has been conducted
   on the environmental and economic sustainability of ion exchange
   systems. This study utilizes life cycle assessment and cost analysis to
   holistically evaluate environmental and economic impacts of ion exchange
   technology that is used for reduction of disinfection by-products via
   organics removal in eight drinking water treatment plants in Florida. A
   functional unit accounting for both water quantity and quality was used
   and showed to have a significant effect on the evaluation results.
   Impact assessment results show that the construction phase has
   negligible environmental impact in comparison to the operation phase.
   Systems that use fixed bed reactors with conventional resin were
   compared with systems using completely mixed flow reactors with magnetic
   ion exchange resin. Fixed bed systems evaluated have higher salt usage
   and brine waste production, but use less electricity, resin, and require
   less transport of materials. This tradeoff causes fixed bed systems to
   have a higher environmental impact in categories of eutrophication,
   carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, and ecotoxicity but lower impact in
   other categories. Furthermore, it causes fixed bed systems to have a
   lower operation cost compared with completely mixed systems. Results
   also show that both environmental impacts and operation costs per
   functional unit decrease with scale, similar to economies of scale
   effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface complexation of phosphate to aluminum oxyhydroxides can alter
   surface reactivity depending on the time-scale and mode of attachment.
   The effects of phosphate adsorption on reactivity of boehmite
   (gamma-AlOOH) particles were investigated using ion-probe flow
   adsorption microcalorimetry (ipFAMC). Consistent with previous studies
   on adsorption energetics, probing the surface of pristine gamma-AlOOH
   with chloride ions yielded endothermically unimodal temperature signals
   with a measured molar heat of exchange (Delta H-exc) of -3.1 kJ/mol.
   However, when the surface of gamma-AlOOH was probed with chloride
   following phosphate complexation, significant changes in surface
   reactivity resulted. Irrespective of phosphate loading, the typical
   endothermic response of the chloride-surface hydroxyl interaction was
   replaced with a multi-modal energy signature consisting of exothermic
   and endothermic features. These features indicate that in the presence
   of phosphate, the overall nature of the interaction of chloride with
   specific surface hydroxyls located on different exposed planes and their
   subsequent reactivity was transformed to a more complex environment
   accompanied by two or more short-lived secondary reactions. It was also
   shown that phosphate-promoted surface alteration of gamma-AlOOH was
   highly selective to probing with chloride since no changes in reactivity
   were observed when nitrate was employed as the primary ion probe under
   identical experimental conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Changes in cell size often accompany multicellular motion in tissue, and
   cell number density is known to strongly influence collective migration
   in monolayers. Density fluctuations in other forms of active matter have
   been explored extensively, but not the potential role of density
   fluctuations in collective cell migration. Here we investigate
   collective motion in cell monolayers, focusing on the divergent
   component of the migration velocity field to probe density fluctuations.
   We find spatial patterns of diverging and converging cell groups
   throughout the monolayers, which oscillate in time with a period of
   approximately 3-4 h. Simultaneous fluorescence measurements of a cytosol
   dye within the cells show that fluid passes between groups of cells,
   facilitating these oscillations in cell density. Our findings reveal
   that cell-cell interactions in monolayers may be mediated by
   intercellular fluid flow.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete element method (DEM) model is used to predict the internal
   load and moment distribution within rod-like particles in a low-speed,
   vertical axis mixer. The internal loads and moments are combined with
   small deformation beam bending theory to determine the internal stress
   distributions. Parametric studies using the model examined the influence
   of particle aspect ratio, blade rotational speed, and material
   properties. The spatial distributions of loads and moments, averaged
   over all particles and time steps, are symmetric about the particle
   center-plane with a maximum at the particle center-plane. In addition,
   the largest average maximum absolute principal stress is observed to
   occur along the particle circumference at the center-plane of the
   particle. These results indicate that particle failure is not only most
   likely to occur at the center-plane of the particle, but the failure
   will begin at the particle's circumference. The largest average loads,
   moments, and maximum absolute principal stress increase with particle
   aspect ratio. The frequency distributions of maximum absolute principal
   stress at the high stress range are fit well with a Weibull
   distribution. Increasing blade speed, bed height and particle particle
   friction coefficient generally lead to an increase in internal loads,
   moments, and stresses. The largest maximum absolute principal stresses
   occur at the base of the mixer and in front of the blades near the mixer
   circumference where the bed depth is the greatest. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{It was suggested that single-layer MoS2 at the 1T' phase is a
   topological insulator whose electronic structure can be modulated by a
   vertical electric field for field-effect transistor (FET) applications
   {[}X. Qian, J. Liu, L. Fu, and J. Li, Science 346, 1344 (2014)]. In this
   work, performance potential of FETs based on vertical field modulation
   of the topological edge states is assessed by using quantum transport
   device simulations. To perform efficient device simulations, a
   phenomenological Hamiltonian is first proposed and validated to capture
   the effects of electric fields. Because the ON-state conductance is
   determined by transport through gapless edge states with a long
   scattering mean free path and the OFF-state conductance by transport
   through the gapped bulk states, the ON/OFF ratio is sensitive to the
   channel length, which is different from conventional FETs. Although a
   high vertical electric field is required to modulate the topological
   edge state, a reasonably small subthreshold swing of 131 mV/dec can
   still be achieved for a practical value of the gate insulator thickness.

   enhancing and optimizing charge transport for the realization of
   next-generation low-cost, mechanically flexible, and easy to process
   high performance, organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Herein, we
   report donor acceptor alternating copolymers of dithienogermole (DTG)
   with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) and probe the importance of end groups
   on the control of molecular order and microstructure as it relates to
   the enhancement of charge carrier transport. Partial end-capping
   reactions, confirmed by 11-1 NMR and matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analyses, on the
   DTG-BTD copolymer provided significant improvement in grazing incidence
   wide angle X-Ray scattering (GIWAXS) determined polymer ordering in thin
   films. Consequently, OFETs exhibited charge-carrier mobilities up to
   0.60 cm(2)/(Vs) for the end-capped copolymer, which are an order of
   magnitude higher in comparison to the non-end-capped analogue, which
   displayed a mobility of 0.077 cm(2)/(Vs). We emphasize that a simple

Abstract = {{Stable solutions of a 2D symmetrical two-sided square lid-driven cavity
   are numerically determined with spectral accuracy. In addition to the
   expected symmetrical solutions, a set of two non-symmetrical solutions,
   mirror images of one another, are obtained for Reynolds number (Re)
   greater than a critical value, Re-1 by suitably eliminating one of the
   symmetrical solutions. The symmetrical solutions which are reported in
   this paper are obtained for Re <= 4000 and are all steady. The
   non-symmetrical solutions are computed for large values of Re until
   these solutions become unsteady, at a second critical Re, Re-2, viz.,
   for Re >= Re-2 > Re-1. The transition from a non-symmetrical solution to
   its symmetrical counterpart upon reducing the Re below Re-1 is
   addressed. It is observed that the symmetric solutions are those which
   maximize the flow kinetic energy per unit input energy. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Metal-semiconductor Schottky junction devices composed of chemical vapor
   deposition grown monolayer graphene on p-type silicon substrates are
   fabricated and characterized. Important diode parameters, such as the
   Schottky barrier height, ideality factor, and series resistance, are
   extracted from forward bias current-voltage characteristics using a
   previously established method modified to take into account the
   interfacial native oxide layer present at the graphene/silicon junction.
   It is found that the ideality factor can be substantially increased by
   the presence of the interfacial oxide layer. Furthermore, low frequency
   noise of graphene/silicon Schottky junctions under both forward and
   reverse bias is characterized. The noise is found to be 1/f dominated
   and the shot noise contribution is found to be negligible. The
   dependence of the 1/f noise on the forward and reverse current is also
   investigated. Finally, the photoresponse of graphene/silicon Schottky
   junctions is studied. The devices exhibit a peak responsivity of around
   0.13 A/W and an external quantum efficiency higher than 25\%. From the
   photoresponse and noise measurements, the bandwidth is extracted to be
   similar to 1 kHz and the normalized detectivity is calculated to be 1.2
   x 10(9) cm Hz(1/2) W-1. These results provide important insights for the
   future integration of graphene with silicon device technology. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Organic scintillators are frequently used for measurements that require
   sensitivity to both photons and Fast neutrons because of their pulse
   shape discrimination capabilities. In these measurement scenarios,
   particle identification is commonly handled using the charge-integration
   pulse shape discrimination method. This method works particularly well
   for high-energy depositions, but is prone to misclassification for
   relatively low-energy depositions. A novel algorithm has been developed
   for automatically performing charge-integration pulse shape
   discrimination in a consistent and repeatable manner. The algorithm is
   able to estimate the photon and neutron misclassification corresponding
   to the calculated discrimination parameters, and is capable of doing so
   using only the information measured by a single organic scintillator
   This paper describes the algorithm and assesses its performance by
   comparing algorithm-estimated misclassification to values computed via a
   more traditional time-of-flight estimation. A single data set was
   processed using four different low-energy thresholds: 40, 60, 90, and
   120 keVee. Overall, the results compared well between the two methods;
   in most cases, the algorithm-estimated values fell within the
   uncertainties of the TOF-estimated values. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{The neurobiological drive for overeating implicated in Prader-Willi

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic imprinting disorder
   characterized mainly by hyperphagia and early childhood obesity.
   Previous fMRI studies examined the activation of eating-related neural
   circuits in PWS patients with or without exposures to food cues and
   found an excessive eating motivation and a reduced inhibitory control of
   cognitive processing of food. However, the effective connectivity
   between various brain areas or neural circuitry critically implicated in
   both the biological and behavioral control of overeating in PWS is
   largely unexplored. The current study combined resting-state fMRI and
   Granger causality analysis (GCA) techniques to investigate interactive
   causal influences among key neural pathways underlying overeating in
   PWS. We first defined the regions of interest (ROIs) that demonstrated
   significant alterations of the baseline brain activity levels in
   children with PWS (n=21) as compared to that of their normal siblings
   controls (n=18), and then carried out GCA to characterize the
   region-to-region interactions among these ROIs. Our data revealed
   significantly enhanced causal influences from the amygdala to the
   hypothalamus and from both the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior
   cingulate cortex to the amygdala in patients with PWS (P<0.001). These
   alterations offer new explanations for hypothalamic regulation of
   homeostatic energy intake and impairment in inhibitory control circuit.
   The deficits in these dual aspects may jointly contribute to the extreme
   hyperphagia in PWS. This study provides both a new methodological and a
   neurobiological perspective to aid in a better understanding of neural
   mechanisms underlying obesity in the general public. This article is

Abstract = {{Nebulin is a giant filamentous protein that is coextensive with the
   actin filaments of the skeletal muscle sarcomere. Nebulin mutations are
   the main cause of nemaline myopathy (NEM), with typical adult patients
   having low expression of nebulin, yet the roles of nebulin in adult
   muscle remain poorly understood. To establish nebulin's functional roles
   in adult muscle, we studied a novel conditional nebulin KO (Neb cKO)
   mouse model in which nebulin deletion was driven by the muscle creatine
   kinase (MCK) promotor. Neb cKO mice are born with high nebulin levels in
   their skeletal muscles, but within weeks after birth nebulin expression
   rapidly falls to barely detectable levels Surprisingly, a large fraction
   of the mice survive to adulthood with low nebulin levels (<5\% of
   control), contain nemaline rods and undergo fiber-type switching toward
   oxidative types. Nebulin deficiency causes a large deficit in specific
   force, and mechanistic studies provide evidence that a reduced fraction
   of force-generating cross-bridges and shortened thin filaments
   contribute to the force deficit. Muscles rich in glycolytic fibers
   upregulate proteolysis pathways (MuRF-1, Fbxo30/MUSA1, Gadd45a) and
   undergo hypotrophy with smaller cross-sectional areas (CSAs), worsening
   their force deficit. Muscles rich in oxidative fibers do not have
   smaller weights and can even have hypertrophy, offsetting their
   specific-force deficit. These studies reveal nebulin as critically
   important for force development and trophicity in adult muscle. The Neb
   cKO phenocopies important aspects of NEM (muscle weakness, oxidative
   fiber-type predominance, variable trophicity effects, nemaline rods) and
   will be highly useful to test therapeutic approaches to ameliorate
   muscle weakness.}},

Abstract = {{Oxide materials are used in numerous applications such as thermal
   barrier coatings, nuclear fuels, and electrical conductors and sensors,
   all applications where nanometer-scale stoichiometric changes can affect
   functional properties. Atom probe tomography can be used to characterize
   the precise chemical distribution of individual species and spatially
   quantify the oxygen to metal ratio at the nanometer scale. However, atom
   probe analysis of oxides can be accompanied by measurement artifacts
   caused by laser-material interactions. In this investigation, two
   technologically relevant oxide materials with the same crystal structure
   and an anion to cation ratio of 2.00, pure cerium oxide (CeO2) and
   uranium oxide (UO2) are studied. It was determined that electronic
   structure, optical properties, heat transfer properties, and oxide
   stability strongly affect their evaporation behavior, thus altering
   their measured stoichiometry, with thermal conductance and thermodynamic
   stability being strong factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dust resuspension and deposition is a ubiquitous phenomenon in all lunar
   and Martian missions. The near-term plans to return to the Moon as a
   stepping stone to further exploration of Mars and beyond bring
   scientists' attention to development and evaluation of lunar and Martian
   dust mitigation technologies. In this paper, different lunar and Martian
   dust transport mechanisms are presented, followed by a review of
   previously developed dust mitigation technologies including fluidal,
   mechanical, electrical and passive self-cleaning methods for
   lunar/Martian installed surfaces along with filtration for dust control
   inside cabins. Key factors in choosing the most effective dust
   mitigation technology are recognized to be the dust transport mechanism,
   energy consumption, environment, type of surface materials, area of the
   surface and surface functionality. While electrical methods operating at
   higher voltages are identified to be suitable for small but light
   sensitive surfaces, pre-treatment of the surface is effective for
   cleaning thermal control surfaces, and mechanical methods are
   appropriate for surfaces with no concerns of light blockage, surface
   abrasion and 100\% cleaning efficiency. Findings from this paper can
   help choose proper surface protection/cleaning for future space
   explorations. Hybrid techniques combining the advantages of different
   methods are recommended. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Impact of climate change on wheat flowering time in eastern Australia}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{209}},
Pages = {{11-21}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The flowering time of wheat is strongly controlled by temperature and is
   potentially highly sensitive to climate change. In this study, we
   analysed the occurrence of last frost (days with minimum temperature
   under 2 degrees C) and first heat (days with maximum temperatures
   exceeding 30 degrees C) events of the year to determine the optimum
   flowering date in the wheat belt of New South Wales (NSW), eastern
   Australia. We used statistically downscaled daily maximum and minimum
   temperature data from 19 Global Climate Models (GCMs) with a
   vernalizing-photothermal model in order to simulate future flowering
   dates and the changes in frost and hot days occurrence at flowering date
   (+/- 7 days) for two future scenarios for atmospheric greenhouse gas
   concentrations (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in 2040s (2021-2060) and 2080s
   (2061-2100). Relative to the 1961-2000 period, the GCMs projected
   increased daily maximum and minimum temperatures for these future
   periods, accompanied by reduced frost occurrence and increased heat
   stress incidence. As a consequence, by the 2080s, simulations suggest a
   general advance in spring wheat flowering date by, on average, 10.2 days
   for RCP4.5 and 17.8 days for RCP8.5 across the NSW wheat belt. Winter
   wheat flowering dates were delayed by an average of 2.4 days for RCP4.5
   and 14.3 days for RCP8.5 in the warmest parts of the region (the
   northwest) due to reduced cumulative vernalization days (requiring cool
   conditions). In the cooler regions (the northeast, southeast and
   southwest), flowering date occurred earlier by 6.2 days for RCP4.5 and
   6.7 days for RCP8.5 on average. Moreover, in the western parts of the
   wheat belt the delay of winter wheat flowering date was about 9.5 days
   longer than that in the eastern parts. As a result of phenological
   responses to increasing temperatures, current wheat varieties may not be
   suitable for future climate conditions, despite reduced frost risk. In
   the future, it may be necessary to use longer-season wheat varieties and
   varieties with increased heat-stress resistance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We systematically elucidate the optoelectronic properties of rare-earth

   exchange-correlation functional based density functional theory. The

   for single doped Ce:YAG, Pr:YAG, and co-doped Er, Ce:YAG. We find that
   co-doping of Ce-doped YAG with any lanthanide except Eu and Lu lowers
   the transition energies; we attribute this behavior to the
   lanthanide-induced change in bonding environment of the dopant atoms.
   Furthermore, we find infrared transitions only in case of the Er, Tb,
   and Tm co-doped Ce:YAG and suggest Tm, Ce:YAG and Tb, Ce:YAG as possible
   functional materials for efficient spectral up-conversion devices. (C)

Abstract = {{The synthesis of well-defined nanoparticle materials has been an area of
   intense investigation, but size control in nanopartide syntheses is
   largely empirical. Here, we introduce a general method for fine size
   control in the synthesis of nanoparticles by establishing steady state
   growth conditions through the continuous, controlled addition of
   precursor, leading to a uniform rate of particle growth. This approach,
   which we term the ``extended LaMer mechanism{''} allows for
   reproducibility in particle size from batch to batch as well as the
   ability to predict nanopartide size by monitoring the early stages of
   growth. We have demonstrated this method by applying it to a challenging
   synthetic system: magnetite nanoparticles. To facilitate this reaction,
   we have developed a reproducible method for synthesizing an iron oleate
   precursor that can be used without purification. We then show how such
   fine size control affects the performance of magnetite nanoparticles in
   magnetic hyperthermia.}},

Abstract = {{Biocomposites with tunable properties were successfully prepared through
   ionic assembly between anionic carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and
   cationic copolymers (quaternized poly(L-lactide)-block-poly
   N,N-dimethylamino-2-ethyl methacrylate) (PLA-b-PDMAEMA). The quaternized
   PDMAEMA segment not only works as a compatibilizer between hydrophilic
   CMC and hydrophobic PLA, but also acts as a lubricant between these two
   rigid biopolymers. The H-1 NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra
   demonstrated successful synthesis of PLA-b-PDMAEMA with controlled
   molecular weight of PDMAEMA segment. The results from scanning
   electronic microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
   (FTIR) verified the interaction between quaternized copolymer micelles
   and anionic CMC networks. The resultant biocomposite could form a
   transparent and uniform film after casting. Both storage moduli and
   maximum degradation temperature of PLA/CMC composites were increased
   with the reduction of molecular weight of PDMAEMA segments. It suggests
   that the properties of biocomposite materials can be tailored by
   adjusting the chain length of inclusive PDMAEMA segment. (C) 2015

   higher than normal chalks. In many developing countries, chalk
   manufacturing is a home-based industry and supports the families.
   However, the fine dust produced by normal chalks has been of great
   concern for the health of teachers and students. In the present study,
   we have used XRD, water penetration, contact angle, particle size of
   dust generated, breaking strength of chalks, abrasion, weight/density,
   and surface morphology by SEM to delineate the differences in the
   properties and performance of these two classes of chalks. The results
   showed that the particle size of dustless chalks produced during
   writing/erasing process is significantly larger than that of normal
   chalks. The normal chalks are hydrophilic and absorb considerably more
   water than dustless chalks. This led to an approach to add a dewetting
   agent (surfactant) to normal chalk slurry to decrease water penetration
   in chalk. In addition, this improved mechanical strength and abrasion
   resistance of the normal chalks due to hydrophobic-hydrophobic
   interactions between particles. We were able to produce approximately
   similar quality chalks as the dustless chalks by addition of small
   concentration of surfactant (0.5 wt\% AOT) in gypsum slurry. This
   approach will assist many small-scale manufacturers for making better
   quality chalks and diminish occupational health hazard to teachers and
   students. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Exploring spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in single-layermaterials is
   important for potential spintronics applications. Using first-principles
   calculations, we show that single-layer antimony telluroiodide SbTeI
   behaves as a two-dimensional semiconductor exhibiting a G(0)W(0) band
   gap of 1.82 eV. More importantly, we observe the Rashba spin splitting
   in the SOC band structure of single-layer SbTeI with a sizable Rashba
   coupling parameter of 1.39 eV angstrom, which is significantly larger
   than that of a number of two-dimensional systems including surfaces and
   interfaces. The low formation energy and real phonon modes of
   single-layer SbTeI imply that it is stable. Our study suggests that
   single-layer SbTeI is a candidate single-layer material for applications
   in spintronics devices.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear motions like rotation, translation and deformation suggest that

   We developed an approach to apply reproducible, known mechanical forces

   response of the mechanically integrated nucleus-cell. The method is
   sensitive to molecular perturbations and revealed new insight into the
   function of the LINC complex. While these experiments revealed elastic
   behaviors, turnover of the cytoskeleton by assembly/disassembly and
   binding/unbinding of linkages are expected to dissipate any stored
   mechanical energy in the nucleus or the cytoskeleton. Experiments
   investigating nuclear forces over longer time scales demonstrated the
   mechanical principle that expansive/compressive stresses on the nuclear
   surface arise from the movement of the cell boundaries to shape and
   position the nucleus. Such forces can shape the nucleus to conform to
   cell shapes during cell movements with or without myosin activity.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to assess the viability of blanket
   sustainability policies, such as Building Rating Systems in achieving
   energy efficiency in university campus buildings. We analyzed the energy
   consumption trends of 10 LEED-certified buildings and 14 non-LEED
   certified buildings at a major university in the US. Energy Use
   Intensity (EUI) of the LEED buildings was significantly higher
   (EUILEED=331.20 kBtu/sf/yr) than non-LEED buildings (EUInon-LEED =
   222.70 kBtu/sf/yr); however, the median EUI values were comparable
   (EUILEED = 172.64 and EUInon-LEED = 178.16). Because the distributions
   of EUI values were non-symmetrical in this dataset, both measures can be
   used for energy comparisons this was also evident when EUI computations
   exclude outliers, EUILEED = 171.82 and EUInon-LEED = 195.41. Additional
   analyses were conducted to further explore the impact of LEED
   certification on university campus buildings energy performance. No
   statistically significant differences were observed between certified
   and non-certified buildings through a range of robust comparison
   criteria. These findings were then lever-aged to devise strategies to
   achieve sustainable energy policies for university campus buildings and
   to identify potential issues with portfolio level building energy
   performance comparisons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{617-629}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic equilibrium of dry reforming of methane (DRM) was studied
   by Gibbs free energy minimization at elevated pressures. CH4 and CO2
   conversions, carbon formation, H-2 yield, H-2/CO ratio and H2O formation
   were used to characterize the DRM performance using the reaction
   temperature as the primary parameter. The result shows that DRM is
   unfavorable at high pressure. CO2 and CH4 conversions decrease while the
   carbon formation increases as the pressure increases. With increasing
   CO2/CH4 ratio in the reaction, CH4 conversion is enhanced, carbon
   formation is suppressed, but CO2 conversion is lower due to the excess
   CO2 supply. The simulation results indicated that the introduction of
   inert gas in the system did not produce a significant effect on DRM
   performance. The performances of combined DRM and partial oxidation of
   methane (POM) and combined DRM and methane-steam reforming (MSR) were
   also studied to suppress the carbon formation. It was found that carbon
   formation can be reduced by introducing oxygen. However, the resulted
   H-2/CO ratio is less than 1. Introducing H2O into the reaction system
   can eliminate carbon formation when amount of H2O is large. However, the
   system must be operated at high temperature to produce high CH4 and CO2
   conversions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Mixing in microfluidic devices presents a challenge due to laminar flows
   in microchannels, which result from low Reynolds numbers determined by
   the channel's hydraulic diameter, flow velocity, and solution's kinetic
   viscosity. To address this challenge, novel methods of mixing
   enhancement within microfluidic devices have been explored for a variety
   of applications. Passive mixing methods have been created, including
   those using ridges or slanted wells within the microchannels, as well as
   their variations with improved performance by varying geometry and
   patterns, by changing the properties of channel surfaces, and by
   optimization via simulations. In addition, active mixing methods
   including microstirrers, acoustic mixers, and flow pulsation have been
   investigated and integrated into microfluidic devices to enhance mixing
   in a more controllable manner. In general, passive mixers are easy to
   integrate, but difficult to control externally by users after
   fabrication. Active mixers usually take efforts to integrate within a
   device and they require external components (e.g. power sources) to
   operate. However, they can be controlled by users to a certain degree
   for tuned mixing. In this article, we provide a general overview of a
   number of passive and active mixers, discuss their advantages and
   disadvantages, and make suggestions on choosing a mixing method for a
   specific need as well as advocate possible integration of key elements
   of passive and active mixers to harness the advantages of both types.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the microscale physics of heat transfer events in
   flow boiling of FC-72 in a microchannel. Experimental results presented
   here provide new physical insight on the nature of heat transfer
   processes during bubbles growth and flow through the microchannel. The
   study is enabled through development of a device with a composite heated
   wall that consists of a high thermal conductivity substrate coated by a
   thin layer of a low thermal conductivity material with embedded
   temperature sensors. This novel arrangement enables calculation of the
   local heat flux with a spatial resolution of 40-65 mu m and a temporal
   resolution of 50 mu s. The device generates isolated bubbles from a 300
   nm in diameter artificial cavity fabricated at the center of a pulsed
   function micro-heater. Analysis of the temperature and heat flux data
   along with synchronized images of bubbles show that four mechanisms of
   heat transfer are active as a bubble grows and flows through the
   channel. These mechanisms of heat transfer are (1) microlayer
   evaporation, (2) interline evaporation, (3) transient conduction, and
   (4) micro-convection. Details of these mechanisms including their time
   period of activation and corresponding surface heat flux and heat
   transfer coefficient are extensively discussed. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Lattice Boltzmann method for conjugate heat and mass transfer with
   interfacial jump conditions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{306-322}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this work we propose an interface treatment for conjugate heat and
   mass transfer with discontinuities or jumps of temperature
   (concentration) and/or heat (mass) flux at the interface using the
   lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) method. The present interface treatment
   is based on the second-order accurate boundary condition treatments for
   Dirichlet and Neumann problems (Li et al., 2013) and second-order
   accurate interface treatment for standard conjugate heat and mass
   transfer with the continuity of temperature (concentration) and flux at
   the interface (Li et al., 2014). The interfacial jump conditions are
   intrinsically satisfied in the present treatment without iterative
   computations that are typically needed in conventional finite-difference
   or finite-volume methods. The interfacial temperature (concentration)
   values and the fluxes into the adjacent domains are conveniently
   obtained from the microscopic distribution functions in the LBE model
   without finite-difference approximations. Since the local intersection
   link fraction is included in the present treatment, the interfacial
   geometry is preserved and the present interface schemes are capable of
   handling curved interfaces. The numerical accuracy and convergence of
   the present interface schemes are verified with several numerical tests,
   including (i) one-dimensional (1D) steady diffusion within a two-solid
   slab; the slab is either aligned with the lattice velocity vector or
   with an inclination angle, (ii) 2D steady diffusion in a circular domain
   of two concentric solids, (iii) 3D steady diffusion in a spherical
   domain of two concentric solids, and (iv) 2D steady convection-diffusion
   in a channel. The two adjacent domains have different thermal (mass)
   transport properties and specific temperature (concentration) and flux
   jump conditions are imposed at the interface in each of those tests. It
   is verified that the present interface treatment for jump conditions
   does not introduce additional errors compared to the case without jumps;
   and second-order accuracy in space is obtained for the interior
   temperature (concentration) field, the interfacial temperature
   (concentration) values and interfacial fluxes for straight interfaces
   aligned with the lattice velocity vector in both diffusion and
   convection-diffusion problems. The effects of inclined and curved
   interfacial geometry on the order-of-accuracy of the LBE results are
   also investigated and the results are compared with previous findings.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparison between experimental results from

   Reynolds (Re) numbers versus liquid nitrogen (LN2) experiments conducted
   at low Re numbers. Parasitic heat leak, inner wall temperatures, inner
   wall heat fluxes, and heat transfer coefficients are computed to compare
   between the two systems. Analysis of temperature traces and flow
   visualization indicates that the chilldown process evolves much more
   rapidly at higher Re numbers due to a quick transition from vapor flow
   to annular liquid flow and near immediate liquid contact along the pipe
   walls. The lower kinematic viscosity and surface tension of LH2, along
   with reduced parasitic heat leak and higher Re numbers relative to the
   LN2 experiments, causes chilldown to proceed almost immediately into the
   nucleate boiling regime, in comparison to low Re flows where >75\% of
   the chilldown is spent in vapor film boiling. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   highlight the role of solvent interactions on the morphology of the

   interactions on the morphology of the pores in the resulting

   urea templating methodology to prepare Bombyx mori silk protein-based
   biomaterials with pores that human dermal fibroblasts respond to by
   aligning with the long axis of the pores. This methodology has potential

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Tendon failures in bonded post-tensioned bridges over the last two
   decades have motivated ongoing investigations on various aspects of
   unbonded tendons and their monitoring methods. Recent research shows
   that change of strain distribution in anchor heads can be useful in
   detecting wire breakage in unbonded construction. Based on this strain
   variation, this paper develops a damage detection model that enables an
   automated tendon monitoring system to identify and locate wire breaks.
   The first part of this paper presents an experimental program conducted
   to study the strain variation in anchor heads by generating wire breaks
   using a mechanical device. The program comprised three sets of tests
   with fully populated 19-strand anchor head and evaluated the levels of
   strain variation with number of wire breaks in different strands. The
   sensitivity of strain variation with wire breaks in circumferential and
   radial directions of anchor head in addition to the axial direction
   (parallel to the strand) were investigated and the measured axial
   strains were found to be the most sensitive. The second part of the
   paper focuses on formulating the wire breakage detection framework. A
   finite element model of the anchorage assembly was created to
   demonstrate the algorithm as well as to investigate the asymmetric
   strain distribution observed in experimental results. In addition, as
   almost inevitably encountered during tendon stressing, the effects of
   differential wedge seating on the proposed model have been analyzed. A
   sensitivity analysis has been performed at the end to assess the
   robustness of the model with random measurement errors.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration-based monitoring is one approach used to perform structural
   condition assessment. By measuring structural response, such as
   displacement, dynamic characteristics of a structure may be estimated.
   Often, the primary dynamic responses in civil structures are below 5 Hz,
   making accurate low frequency measurement critical for successful
   dynamic characterization. In addition, static deflection measurements
   are useful for structural capacity and load rating assessments. This
   paper presents a DC coupled continuous wave radar to accurately detect
   both dynamic and static displacement. This low-cost radar sensor
   provides displacement measurements within a compact, wireless unit
   appropriate for a range of structural monitoring applications. The
   hardware components and operating mechanism of the radar are introduced
   and a series of laboratory experiments are presented to assess the
   performance characteristics of the radar. The laboratory and field
   experiments investigate the effect of factors such as target distance,
   motion amplitude, and motion frequency on the radar's measurement
   accuracy. The results demonstrate that the radar is capable of both
   static and dynamic displacement measurements with sub-millimeter
   accuracy, making it a promising technology for structural health
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolution of fractured rocks is often accompanied by the formation of
   highly localized flow paths. While the fluid flow follows existing
   fractures in the rock, these fissures do not, in general, open
   uniformly. Simulations and laboratory experiments have shown that
   distinct channels or wormholes develop within the fracture, from which a
   single highly localized flow path eventually emerges. The aim of the
   present work is to investigate how these emerging flow paths are
   influenced by the initial aperture field. We have simulated the
   dissolution of a single fracture starting from a spatially correlated
   aperture distribution. Our results indicate a surprising insensitivity
   of the evolving dissolution patterns and flow rates to the amplitude and
   correlation length characterizing the imposed aperture field. We connect
   the similarity in outcomes to the self-organization of the flow into a
   small number of wormholes, with the spacing determined by the length of
   the longest wormholes. We have also investigated the effect of a
   localized region of increased aperture on the developing dissolution
   patterns. A competition was observed between the tendency of the
   high-permeability region to develop the dominant wormhole and the
   tendency of wormholes to spontaneously nucleate throughout the rest of
   the fracture. We consider the consequences of these results for the
   modeling of dissolution in fractured and porous rocks.}},

   nitrogen, have been studied with respect to solution behavior and
   adsorption at the air-water, oil-water and calcium carbonate-water
   interfaces. It was found that the ability of the glycinate surfactant of
   forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds via the amide group leads to
   tighter molecular packing, which greatly influenced the behavior at
   interfaces. Based on this molecular observation, potential applications
   were considered and emulsification, foaming and wetting tests were
   carried out. It could be concluded from this work that a minor change in
   the structure of a surfactant molecule can be very significant for
   technological systems and processes.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse system identification has received a great deal of attention due
   to its broad applicability. The proportionate normalized least mean
   square (PNLMS) algorithm, as a popular tool, achieves excellent
   performance for sparse system identification. In previous studies, most
   of the cost functions used in proportionate-type sparse adaptive
   algorithms are based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion, which is
   optimal only when the measurement noise is Gaussian. However, this
   condition does not hold in most real-world environments. In this work,
   we use the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion, an alternative to the
   conventional MSE criterion, to develop the proportionate minimum error
   entropy (PMEE) algorithm for sparse system identification, which may
   achieve much better performance than the MSE based methods especially in
   heavy-tailed non-Gaussian situations. Moreover, we analyze the
   convergence of the proposed algorithm and derive a sufficient condition
   that ensures the mean square convergence. Simulation results confirm the
   excellent performance of the new algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the findings of an investigation on thermal behavior
   of mass concrete footings placed directly on soil using finite element
   analysis. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed to
   predict temperatures in a mass concrete footing-soil system and to
   assess cracking potential of the concrete at early age. Two bridge pier
   footings constructed in Florida were monitored for temperature
   development, and the measured temperatures were compared with the
   computed temperatures from the finite element model. The results show
   that the temperatures predicted by the model closely agree with those
   measured in the field. Several soils with varying thermal resistances
   were modeled in this study in order to find out which soils can be used
   as an insulator for mass concrete footings so that an insulation layer
   would not be needed at the bottom of the footings. The results suggest
   that dry sand and dry clay provide good insulation at the bottom of mass
   concrete footings, and soil with an R-value of 0.072 per m or greater
   (or thermal conductivity of 0.35W/m-K or lower) would provide adequate
   insulation at the bottom of concrete footings to prevent early-age
   cracking in the concrete.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the adsorption and reaction of methanol on continuous
   and discontinuous films of samarium oxide (SmOx) grown on Pt(111) in
   ultrahigh vacuum. The methanol decomposition was studied by temperature
   programmed desorption (TPD) and infrared reflection absorption
   spectroscopy (IRRAS), while structural changes of the oxide surface were
   monitored by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). Methanol
   dehydrogenates to adsorbed methoxy species on both the continuous and
   discontinuous SmOx films, eventually leading to the desorption of CO and
   H-2 which desorbs at temperatures in the range 400-600 K. Small
   quantities of CO2 are also detected mainly on as-prepared Sm2O3 thin
   films, but the production of CO2 is limited during repeated TPD runs.
   The discontinuous film exhibits the highest reactivity compared to the
   continuous film and the Pt(111) substrate. The reactivity of methanol on
   reduced and reoxidized films was also investigated, revealing how SmOx
   structures influence the chemical behavior. Over repeated TPD
   experiments, a SmOx structural/chemical equilibrium condition is found
   which can be approached either from oxidized or reduced films. We also
   observed hydrogen absence in TPD which indicates that hydrogen is stored
   either in SmOx films or as OH groups on the SmOx surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Scanning fiber tips provides the most convenient way for forward-viewing
   fiber-optic microendoscopy. In this paper, a distal fiber scanning
   method based on a large-displacement MEMS actuator is presented. A
   single-mode fiber is glued on the micro-platform of an electrothermal
   MEMS stage to realize large range non-resonant scanning. The
   micro-platform has a large piston scan range of up to 800 pm at only 6
   V. The tip deflection of the fiber can be further amplified by placing
   the MEMS stage at a proper location along the fiber. A quasi-static
   model of the fiber-MEMS assembly has been developed and validated
   experimentally. The frequency response has also been studied and
   measured. A fiber tip deflection of up to 1650 mu m for the 45 mm-long
   movable fiber portion has been achieved when the MEMS electrothermal
   stage was placed 25 mm away from the free end. The
   electrothermally-actuated MEMS stage shows a great potential for forward
   viewing fiber scanning and optical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Background: Ambient air pollution has been linked to the development of
   gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, evidence of the
   association is very limited, and no study has estimated the effects of
   ozone.
   Objective: Our aim was to determine the association of prenatal
   exposures to particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) with
   GDM.
   Methods: We used Florida birth vital statistics records to investigate
   the association between the risk of GDM and two air pollutants (PM2.5
   and O3) among 410,267 women who gave birth in Florida between 2004 and
   2005. Individual air pollution exposure was assessed at the woman's home
   address at time of delivery using the hierarchical Bayesian space-time
   statistical model. We further estimated associations between air
   pollution exposures during different -trimesters and GDM.
   Results: After controlling for nine covariates, we observed increased
   odds of GDM with per 5-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 (ORTrimester1 = 1.16;
   95\% CI: 1.11, 1.21; ORTrimester2 = 1.15; 95\% CI: 1.10, 1.20;
   ORPregnancy = 1.20; 95\% CI: 1.13, 1.26) and per 5-ppb increase in O3
   (ORTrimester1 = 1.09; 95\% CI: 1.07, 1.11; ORTrimester2 = 1.12; 95\% CI:
   1.10, 1.14; ORPregnancy = 1.18; 95\% CI: 1.15, 1.21) during both the
   first trimester and second trimester as well as the full pregnancy in
   single-pollutant models. Compared with the single-pollutant model, the
   ORs for O-3 were almost identical in the co-pollutant model. However,
   the ORs for PM2.5 during the first trimester and the full pregnancy were
   attenuated, and no association was observed for PM2.5 during the second
   trimester in the co-pollutant model (OR = 1.02; 95\% CI: 0.98, 1.07).
   Conclusion: This population-based study suggests that exposure to air
   pollution during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of GDM in
   Florida, USA.}},

Abstract = {{In Parallel File Systems (PFSs), a data file I/O request may be divided
   into multiple I/O sub-requests across the storage system. The latency of
   the original I/O request depends on the finish time of the last
   sub-request. Due to application multiplexing and various file data
   layouts employed in PFS, data servers may have very different workloads.
   Thus, the performance penalty caused by the finish time of different
   sub-requests can be significant. The Dispatch Time Aligning (DTA) I/O
   scheduling algorithm focuses on improving system throughput by
   prioritizing lagged sub-requests in PFS I/O requests. The DTA algorithm
   associates sub-requests from the same I/O request, detects and
   prioritizes the lagged-behind sub-requests. The dual-queue scheduling
   scheme in DTA provides I/O request latency control while improving
   system throughput. Simulation results show that the DTA algorithm can
   provide up to 83 \% higher total system throughput than the Earliest
   Deadline First algorithm, while offering similar latency guarantees.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing tolerances play an important role in designing low-cost
   and low-weight aircraft structures. A probabilistic cost model is
   developed that explicitly models performance cost along with quality and
   manufacturing costs to optimize manufacturing tolerances for
   damage-tolerant aircraft structures. The tolerance optimization is
   demonstrated for the design of a wing spar with fastener holes. The
   advantage of including performance cost is illustrated by comparing to
   an optimum found by ignoring the performance cost, showing substantial
   change in the optimum tolerance and total cost. The random aspect of
   quality cost is illustrated using measured manufacturing error data
   collected from the wing spar assemblies of a business jet. The paper
   also quantifies the uncertainties in the optimum due to finite samples
   of measured data used for modeling manufacturing error distributions,
   which were found to be small due to a large number of samples.}},

Abstract = {{Brachiaria and Cynodon are important pasture grasses in Brazil. Convert
   HD 364 (Dow AgroSciences, Sao Paulo, Brazil) brachiariagrass (Brachiaria
   hybrid CIAT 36087; also known as Mulato II) is a new hybrid released for
   use in a broad range of environments. It has high nutritive value and
   yield, but there are no year-round comparisons, including the dry
   season, with other pasture grasses. Forage accumulation and crude
   protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and in vitro digestible
   organic matter (IVDOM) concentrations were evaluated for Convert HD 364,
   Marandu palisadegrass \{B. brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R.D. Webster
   {[} syn. Urochloa brizantha (A. Rich.) Stapf]; CIAT 6297\}, and Tifton
   85 bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) during dry and rainy seasons from 2011 to
   2013. Irrigated and rainfed plots were harvested every 28 and 42 d.
   Convert HD 364 had similar or greater forage accumulation (17.9-22.8 Mg
   DM ha(-1)) than Marandu and Tift on 85 (15\% greater than Marandu and
   12\% greater than Tift on 85 when irrigated and harvested every 28 d).
   Tift on 85 CP concentration was 140 g kg(-1), greater than that of the
   other grasses when harvested every 28 d and irrigated. Convert HD 364
   (537 g kg(-1)) NDF concentration was least, regardless of irrigation,
   harvest frequency, or season. This was associated with IVDOM
   concentration greater than 650 g kg(-1), similar to that of Marandu.
   Convert HD 364 is a viable option for diversification of pasture-based
   animal production systems in tropical areas due to high forage
   accumulation and nutritive value when fertilized and well managed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of proton irradiation energy on dc characteristics of
   AlGaN/GaN metal-oxide semiconductor high electron mobility transistors
   (MOSHEMTs) using Al2O3 as the gate dielectric were studied.
   Al2O3/AlGaN/GaN MOSHEMTs were irradiated with a fixed proton dose of 5 x
   10(15) cm(-2) at different energies of 5, 10, or 15 MeV. More
   degradation of the device dc characteristics was observed for lower
   irradiation energy due to the larger amount of nonionizing energy loss
   in the active region of the MOSHEMTs under these conditions. The
   reductions in saturation current were 95.3\%, 68.3\%, and 59.8\% and
   reductions in maximum transconductance were 88\%, 54.4\%, and 40.7\%
   after 5, 10, and 15MeV proton irradiation, respectively. Both forward
   and reverse gate leakage current were reduced more than one order of
   magnitude after irradiation. The carrier removal rates for the
   irradiation energies employed in this study were in the range of 127-289
   cm(-1). These are similar to the values reported for conventional
   metal-gate high-electron mobility transistors under the same conditions
   and show that the gate dielectric does not affect the response to proton
   irradiation for these energies. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{ZnO is promising for a number of applications in light emission,
   sensors, and transparent conducting electronics, but its surface is
   susceptible to instabilities caused by atmospheric exposure. Thus, there
   is a need for stable passivation or gate dielectric layers that might
   obviate this issue. One potential candidate is Sc2O3. The authors have
   measured the band offsets of sputtered Sc2O3 on both Zn-and O-terminated
   ZnO using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and obtained the bandgaps of
   the materials using reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy. The
   valence band offset was determined to be similar to 1.67 +/- 0.16 eV for
   Sc2O3 on Zn-terminated ZnO (bandgap 3.26 eV) and 1.59 +/- 0.16 eV on
   O-terminated ZnO (bandgap 3.22 eV), i.e., similar within experimental
   error. The conduction band offset for Sc2O3/ZnO was then determined to
   be 4.92 eV. The Sc2O3/ZnO system has a staggered, type II alignment,
   meaning that it is not suitable for thin film transistors but it may
   still be useful for surface passivation. (C) 2015 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{Elevated temperature, nonamorphizing implants of Si+, and a second
   co-implant of either Al+, P+, or S+ at varying doses were performed into
   In0.53Ga0.47As to observe the effect that individual co-implant species
   had on the activation and diffusion of Si doping after postimplantation
   annealing. It was found that Al, P, and S co-implantation all resulted
   in a common activation limit of 1.7 x 10(19) cm(-3) for annealing
   treatments that resulted in Si profile motion. This is the same
   activation level observed for Si+ implants alone. The results of this
   work indicate that co-implantation of group V or VI species is an
   ineffective means for increasing donor activation of n-type dopants
   above 1.7 x 10(19) cm(-3) in InGaAs. The S+ co-implants did not show an
   additive effect in the total doping despite exhibiting significant
   activation when implanted alone. The observed n-type active carrier
   concentration limits appear to be the result of a crystalline
   thermodynamic limit rather than dopant specific limits. (C) 2015

Title = {{Investigation of long term reactive stability of ceria for use in solar
   thermochemical cycles}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{924-931}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The use of an intermediate reactive material composed of cerium (IV)
   oxide (ceria) is explored for solar fuel production through a
   CO2-splitting thermochemical redox cycle. To this end, powder and porous
   ceria samples are tested with TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) to
   ascertain their maximum fuel production potential from the CeO2 ->
   CeO2-delta cycle. A maximum value of the non-stoichiometric reduction
   factor delta of ceria powder was 0.0383 at 1450 degrees C. The reactive
   stability of a synthesized porous ceria sample is then observed with
   carbon dioxide splitting at 1100 degrees C and thermal reduction at 1450
   degrees C. Approximately 86.4\% of initial fuel production is retained
   after 2000 cycles, and the mean value of delta is found to be 0.0197.
   SEM (scanning electron microscopy) imaging suggests that the porous
   ceria structure is retained over 2000 cycles despite apparent loss of
   some surface area. EDS (energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy) line scans
   show that oxidation of porous ceria becomes increasingly homogenous
   throughout the bulk material over an increasing number of cycles.
   Significant retention of reactivity and porous structure demonstrates
   the potential of porous ceria for use in a commercial thermochemical
   reactor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deformable joint contact models can be used to estimate loading
   conditions for cartilage-cartilage, implant-implant, human-orthotic, and
   foot-ground interactions. However, contact evaluations are often so
   expensive computationally that they can be prohibitive for simulations
   or optimizations requiring thousands or even millions of contact
   evaluations. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel surrogate
   contact modeling method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). The
   method uses special sampling techniques to gather input-output data
   points from an original (slow) contact model in multiple domains of
   input space, where each domain represents a different physical situation
   likely to be encountered. For each contact force and torque output by
   the original contact model, a multi-layer feed-forward ANN is defined,
   trained, and incorporated into a surrogate contact model. As an
   evaluation problem, we created an ANN-based surrogate contact model of
   an artificial tibiofemoral joint using over 75,000 evaluations of a
   fine-grid elastic foundation (EF) contact model. The surrogate contact
   model computed contact forces and torques about 1000 times faster than a
   less accurate coarse grid EF contact model. Furthermore, the surrogate
   contact model was seven times more accurate than the coarse grid EF
   contact model within the input domain of a walking motion. For larger
   input domains, the surrogate contact model showed the expected trend of
   increasing error with increasing domain size. In addition, the surrogate
   contact model was able to identify out-of-contact situations with high
   accuracy. Computational contact models created using our proposed ANN
   approach may remove an important computational bottleneck from
   musculoskeletal simulations or optimizations incorporating deformable
   joint contact models. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Using acupuncture to treat cerebral hypoperfusion is a hot topic.
   However, there is a lack of effective tools to clarify the therapeutic
   effect of acupuncture on cerebral hypoperfusion. Here, we show in a
   mouse model of cerebral hypoperfusion that photoacoustic tomography
   (PAT) can noninvasively image cerebral vasculature and track total
   hemoglobin (HbT) concentration changes in cerebral hypoperfusion with
   acupuncture stimulation on the YangLingQuan (GB34) point. We measured
   the changes of HbT concentration and found that the HbT concentration in
   hypoperfusion regions was clearly lower than that in the control regions
   when the acupuncture was absent; however, it was significantly increased
   when the acupuncture was implemented on the GB34 point. We also observed
   the increase of vessel size and the generation of new vessels in
   cerebral hypoperfusion during acupuncture. Laser speckle imaging (LSI)
   was employed to validate some of the PAT findings. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{We developed a novel poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-based, microparticle
   (MP) system providing concurrent delivery of multiple encapsulated
   immuno-suppressive factors and antigen, for in vivo conditioning of
   dendritic cells (DCs) toward a tolerance promoting pathway. Subcutaneous
   administration prevents onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in NOD mice. Two
   MP sizes were made: phagocytosable MPs were fabricated encapsulating
   vitamin D3 or insulin B(9-23) peptide, while unphagocytosable MPs were
   fabricated encapsulating TGF-beta 1 or GM-CSF. The combination of Vit
   D3/TGF-beta 1 MPs confers an immature and LPS activation-resistant
   phenotype to DCs, and MP-delivered antigen is efficiently and
   functionally presented. Notably, two subcutaneous injections into 4 week
   old NOD mice using the combination of MPs encapsulating Vit D3, Ins B,
   TGF-beta 1 and GM-CSF protected 40\% of mice from T1D development,
   significant in comparison to the control. This work represents one of
   the first applications of a biomaterial-based, MP vaccine system to
   successfully prevent autoimmune diabetes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{High resolution functional photoacoustic tomography of breast cancer}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{5321-5328}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of functional photoacoustic
   tomography (fPAT) for high resolution detection and characterization of
   breast cancer and to demonstrate for the first time quantitative
   hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation images of breasts that
   were formed with model-based reconstruction of tomographic photoacoustic
   data.
   Methods: The study was HIPAA compliant and was approved by the
   university institutional review board. Written informed consents were
   obtained from all the participants. Ten cases, including six cancer and
   four healthy (mean age = 50 yr; age range = 41-66 yr), were examined.
   Functional images of breast tissue including absolute total hemoglobin
   concentration (Hb(T)) and oxygen saturation (StO(2)\%) were obtained by
   fPAT and cross validated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) readings
   and/or histopathology.
   Results: HbT and StO(2)\% maps from all six pathology-confirmed cancer
   cases (60\%) show clear detection of tumor, while MR images indicate
   clear detection of tumor for five of six cancer cases; one small tumor
   was read as near-complete-resolution by MRI. The average Hb(T) and
   StO(2)\% value of suspicious lesion area for the cancer cases was 61.6
   +/- 18.9 mu M/1 and 67.5\% +/- 5.2\% compared to 25.6 +/- 7.4 mu M/1 and
   65.2\% +/- 3.8\% for background normal tissue.
   Conclusions: fPAT has the potential to be a significant add-on in breast
   cancer detection and characterization as it provides submillimeter
   resolution functional images of breast lesions. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a particle batch smoother (PBS) to determine
   soil moisture profiles by assimilating soil temperatures at two depths
   (4 and 8 cm). The PBS can be considered as an extension of the standard
   particle filter (PF) in which soil moisture is updated within a window
   of fixed length using all observed soil temperatures in that window.
   This approach was developed with a view to assimilating temperature
   observations from distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observations, a
   technique which can provide temperature observations every meter or less
   along cables up to kilometers in length. Here, the PBS approach is
   tested using soil moisture and temperature, and meteorological data from
   an experimental site in Citra, Florida. Results demonstrate that the PBS
   provides a statistically significant improvement in estimated soil
   moisture compared to the PE, with only a marginal increase in
   computational expense (<3\% of CPU time). This confirms that
   assimilating a sequence of temperature observations yields a better soil
   moisture estimate compared to sequential assimilation of individual
   temperature observations. The impact of observation interval was
   investigated for both PF and PBS, and the optimal window length was
   determined for the PBS. While increasing the observation interval is
   essential to maintain the spread of particle values in the PE, the PBS
   performance is best when all available observations are assimilated. (C)

Abstract = {{Perception of sensory signals is strongly influenced by their context,
   both in space and time. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical
   model, called convolutional dynamic networks, that effectively utilizes
   this contextual information, while inferring the representations of the
   visual inputs. We build this model based on a predictive coding
   framework and use the idea of empirical priors to incorporate recurrent
   and top-down connections. These connections endow the model with
   contextual information coming from temporal as well as abstract
   knowledge from higher layers. To perform inference efficiently in this
   hierarchical model, we rely on a novel scheme based on a smoothing
   proximal gradient method. When trained on unlabeled video sequences, the
   model learns a hierarchy of stable attractors, representing low-level to
   high-level parts of the objects. We demonstrate that the model
   effectively utilizes contextual information to produce robust and stable
   representations for object recognition in video sequences, even in case
   of highly corrupted inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Galectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that act as extracellular
   signaling molecules in various normal and pathological processes.
   Galectin bioactivity is mediated by specific non-covalent interactions
   with cell-surface and extracellular matrix glycoproteins, which can
   enhance or inhibit signaling events that influence various cellular
   behaviors, including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and
   apoptosis. Here, we developed a materials approach to modulate galectin
   bioactivity by mimicking natural galectin-glycoprotein interactions.
   Specifically, we created a variant of a peptide that self-assembles into
   beta-sheet nanofibers under aqueous conditions, QQKFQFQFEQQ (Q11), which
   has an asparagine residue modified with the monosaccharide
   N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at its N-terminus (GlcNAc-Q11). GlcNAc-Q11
   self-assembled into beta-sheet nanofibers under similar conditions as
   Q11. Nanofibrillar GlcNAc moieties were efficiently converted to the
   galectin-binding disaccharide N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) via the
   enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase and the sugar donor UDP-galactose,
   while retaining beta-sheet structure and nanofiber morphology.
   LacNAc-Q11 nanofibers bound galectin-1 and -3 in a LacNAc
   concentration-dependent manner, although nanofibers bound galectin-1
   with higher affinity than galectin-3. In contrast, galectin-1 bound
   weakly to GlcNAc-Q11 nanofibers, while no galectin-3 binding to these
   nanofibers was observed. Galectin-1 binding to LacNAc-Q11 nanofibers was
   specific because it could be inhibited by excess soluble beta-lactose, a
   galectin-binding carbohydrate. LacNAc-Q11 nanofibers inhibited
   galectin-1-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat T cells in a LacNAc
   concentration-dependent manner, but were unable to inhibit galectin-3
   activity, consistent with galectin-binding affinity of the nanofibers.
   We envision that glycopeptide nanofibers capable of modulating
   galectin-1 bioactivity will be broadly useful as biomaterials for
   various medical applications, including cancer therapeutics,
   immunotherapy, tissue regeneration, and viral prophylaxis.}},

Journal = {{FIELD CROPS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp.) is an important crop in Asia,
   Africa, Latin America and Caribbean. Despite pigeonpea's global
   importance there is a dearth of crop simulation models available for
   studying pigeonpea growth. The objectives of this study were to adapt
   the CSM-CROPGRO model for simulating pigeonpea growth and development
   through parameter modification and to illustrate the use of a sequential
   parameter estimation technique using a dataset from Gainesville, FL in
   1984 and a dataset from India in 2003. The sequential approach to
   parameter estimation using a hybrid Metropolis-Hastings-Gibbs algorithm
   worked well at estimating physiologically plausible values for
   parameters with good correspondence to measured data. Reasonable results
   were obtained despite the use of approximations for measurement errors
   for the Gainesville dataset, which contained only treatment means. This
   study demonstrated that CROPGRO can be used to simulate the growth and
   development of pigeonpea. However, further testing of CROPGRO with more
   extensive pigeonpea datasets should be undertaken to confirm the
   accuracy of the parameter estimates developed from this study. Further
   theoretical and practical research into the parameter estimation
   approach is needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Matter from Stormwater}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the last several decades there has been a proliferation of structural
   best management practices (BMPs) for particulate matter (PM)
   sequestration. However, effective separation and continued retention of
   PM without washout throughout loading periods in which there is no
   maintenance remains challenging. In this study the physical modeling (in
   situ testing) of a volumetric clarifying filter (VCF) for separation and
   retention of PM was conducted for an urban source area (similar to 500
   m(2)) in north central Florida loaded by rainfall runoff. This paper
   examines the event-based response of a VCF unit for 25 events (384 mm of
   rainfall, 117 m(3) of runoff over 13 months with no maintenance),
   differentiating the role of volumetric sedimentation (2.3 m(3) tank) and
   depth filtration (106 m(2) of cartridge surface area). Manual sampling
   was conducted with a PM mass balance over the monitoring campaign.
   Suspended sediment concentration (SSC), suspended and settleable PM
   fractions, and turbidity were measured. PM was further differentiated as
   particle size distributions (PSDs). A two-parameter (shape and scale)
   gamma distribution for PSDs was used to examine sedimentation and
   filtration. The VCF separated and retained 99\% (median) of SSC, driven
   primarily by separation of sediment-size PM. Median values for
   settleable and suspended PM were 94 and 84\%, with an 85\% reduction for
   turbidity. The median mass-based d(50) of influent, primary effluent,
   and secondary effluent were 85, 10, and 3 mu m. While the VCF was
   designed to provide separation and retention of suspended and settleable
   PM through filtration, the dominant mass-based mechanism for PM
   separation was gravitational sedimentation. (C) 2015 American Society of

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{524-532}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Drinking water treatment residues (WTR), generated from the lime
   softening processes, are commonly reused or disposed of in a number of
   applications; these include use as a soil amendment or a subsurface
   fill. Recently questions were posed by the Florida regulatory community
   on whether lime WTR that contained a small percentage of other treatment
   additives could appropriately be characterized as lime WTR, in terms of
   total element content and leachability. A study was done using a broad
   range of leaching tests, including a framework of tests recently adopted
   by the United States-Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and tests
   that were modified to account for scenario specific conditions, such as
   the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). The results of these
   additional leaching tests demonstrated that certain applications,
   including disposal in a water body with NOM or in placement anaerobic
   environment, did result in increased leaching of elements such as Fe,
   and that a site specific assessment should be conducted prior to using
   WTR in these types of applications. This study illustrates the
   importance of leaching test selection when attempting to provide an
   estimation of release in practice. Although leaching tests are just one
   component in a beneficial use assessment and other factors including
   aquifer and soil properties play a significant role in the outcome,
   leaching tests should be tailored to most appropriately represent the
   scenario or reuse application being evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   full atomistic detail in regions of interest while using a continuum
   description to reduce the computational burden elsewhere. In most of
   these methods, however, lattice defects in the continuum are either
   implemented via constitutive relations, lattice elasticity with
   dislocation field interactions, or are not permitted at all. In such
   approaches, the transit of dislocations across the atomistic/continuum
   interface appeals to approximate heuristics intended to minimize the
   effects of the interface due to the change from atomistic to continuum
   degrees of freedom. The concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) method,
   originally developed for addressing dynamic dislocation behavior by
   Xiong et al. (2011), permits dislocations to propagate in a continuum
   domain that employs a piecewise continuous finite element description
   with interelement displacement discontinuities. The method avoids ghost
   forces at interfate between atomistically resolved and coarse-grained
   domains. CAC has subsequently been used to investigate complex
   dislocation behavior in face-centered cubic (FCC) metals (Xiong et al.,
   2012b,a,c, 2015). In this paper, we propose a quasistatic 3-D method to
   carry out sequential energy-minimized simulations at 0 K. This
   facilitates study of structure evolution along minimum energy pathways,
   avoiding over-driven conditions of high rate molecular dynamics.
   Parallelization steps in code implementation are described. Applications
   are presented for the quasistatic CAC method in FCC metal plasticity.
   Comparisons are made with a fully-resolved atomistic method for
   generalized stacking fault energy, core structure and stress field of a
   single 60 mixed type dislocation, surface indentation, and 60 mixed type
   dislocation migration through the interface between atomistic and
   coarse-grained domains. It is shown that 3-D CAC simulations are useful
   in substantially reducing the number of degrees of freedom while
   preserving key characteristics of dislocation structure, stacking
   faults, and plasticity, including the net Burgers vector and long range
   fields of interacting dislocations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop coefficient (K (c)) for
   drip-irrigated bell pepper grown on plastic-mulched beds for
   climatically different growing seasons were quantified using drainage
   lysimeters located in the Southwest Florida. We tested whether: (1) the
   literature K (c) (with climatic adjustment) yields accurate ETc
   estimates; (2) K (c) values are applicable across the growing seasons
   that are climatically different; and (3) a thermal-based generic model
   can be developed to accurately predict K (c) for gradually cooling
   (fall) and warming (spring) seasons. Spring ETc (229 mm) was
   statistically (p = 0.03) higher than fall (189 mm). Seasonal K (c)
   values were also statistically different, and average fall value (0.86)
   was 20 \% higher than spring (0.72), confirming K (c)'s seasonality. The
   K (c) values for the fall were statistically higher than FAO-56 K (c)'s
   which underestimated ETc by 22 \%. Use of fall K (c) overestimated
   spring ETc by 24 \%, while it was 12 \% underestimation for the
   opposite. These errors were 16-69 \% of rainfall and 26-46 \% of
   farm-scale surface flows highlighting the need for accurate ETc
   predictions. The seasonal differences in K (c) could be accurately
   predicted with a generic growing degree days (GDD) model (r (2) = 0.95).
   The results not only provide an improved ETc estimate for
   plastic-mulched pepper in the study area, but also for other regions
   using the GDD-based model that utilize readily available temperature
   data. The GDD model can be further improved using additional data in
   future.}},

Abstract = {{With their proliferation and increasing capabilities, mobile devices
   with local wireless interfaces can be organized into delay-tolerant
   networks (DTNs) that exploit communication opportunities arising out of
   the movement of their users. As the mobile devices are usually carried
   by people, these DTNs can also be viewed as social networks.
   Unfortunately, most existing routing algorithms for DTNs rely on
   relatively simple mobility models that rarely consider these social
   network characteristics, and therefore, the mobility models in these
   algorithms cannot accurately describe users' real mobility traces. In
   this paper, we propose two predict and spread (PreS) message routing
   algorithms for DTNs. We employ an adapted Markov chain to model a node's
   mobility pattern and capture its social characteristics. A comparison
   with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrates that PreS can yield better
   performance in terms of delivery ratio and delivery latency, and it can
   provide a comparable performance with the epidemic routing algorithm
   with lower resource consumption. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Processing ex vivo derived tissues to reduce immunogenicity is an
   effective approach to create biologically complex materials for vascular
   reconstruction. Due to the sensitivity of small diameter vascular grafts
   to occlusive events, the effect of graft processing on critical
   parameters for graft patency, such as peripheral cell adhesion and wall
   mechanics, requires detailed analysis. Isolated human umbilical vein
   sections were used as model allogenic vascular scaffolds that were
   processed with either: 1. sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 2.
   ethanol/acetone (EtAc), or 3. glutaraldehyde (Glu). Changes in material
   mechanics were assessed via uniaxial tensile testing. Peripheral cell
   adhesion to the opaque grafting material was evaluated using an
   innovative flow chamber that allows direct observation of the
   blood-graft interface under physiological shear conditions. All
   treatments modified the grafts tensile strain and stiffness properties,
   with physiological modulus values decreasing from Glu 240 +/- 12 kPa to
   SDS 210 +/- 6 kPa and EtAc 140 +/- 3 kPa, p<.001. Relative to
   glutaraldehyde treatments, neutrophil adhesion to the decellularized
   grafts increased, with no statistical difference observed between SDS or
   EtAc treatments. Early platelet adhesion (\% surface coverage) showed no
   statistical difference between the three treatments; however,
   quantification of platelet aggregates was significantly higher on SDS
   scaffolds compared to EtAc or Glu. Tissue processing strategies applied
   to the umbilical vein scaffold were shown to modify structural mechanics
   and cell adhesion properties, with the EtAc treatment reducing
   thrombotic events relative to SDS treated samples. This approach allows
   time and cost effective prescreening of clinically relevant grafting
   materials to assess initial cell reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{Gels made from soft microscale particles smoothly transition between the
   fluid and solid states, making them an ideal medium in which to create
   macroscopic structures with microscopic precision. While tracing out
   spatial paths with an injection tip, the granular gel fluidizes at the
   point of injection and then rapidly solidifies, trapping injected
   material in place. This physical approach to creating three-dimensional
   (3D) structures negates the effects of surface tension, gravity, and
   particle diffusion, allowing a limitless breadth of materials to be
   written. With this method, we used silicones, hydrogels, colloids, and
   living cells to create complex large aspect ratio 3D objects, thin
   closed shells, and hierarchically branched tubular networks. We
   crosslinked polymeric materials and removed them from the granular gel,
   whereas uncrosslinked particulate systems were left supported within the
   medium for long times. This approach can be immediately used in diverse
   areas, contributing to tissue engineering, flexible electronics,
   particle engineering, smart materials, and encapsulation technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile devices have increasingly been used to run multimedia
   applications which are extremely downlink-intensive. The conventional
   rate adaptive and/or margin adaptive approach for radio resource
   allocation may result in unnecessary energy consumption on mobile
   devices, which will not be energy efficient for mobile multimedia
   applications. In this paper, we develop an energy adaptive approach and
   design an energy-efficient downlink resource allocation scheme to
   support multimedia applications. The objective is to minimize the total
   energy consumption of mobile devices for data reception while meeting
   the data rate requirements at mobile devices and the transmit power
   constraint at the base station. We show that the optimization problem is
   NP-hard and then propose an efficient algorithm that has a provable
   performance guarantee under a certain condition. We have conducted
   extensive simulations to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm
   and our results provide useful insights into the design of

Abstract = {{A significant amount of research has been involved with the development
   of advanced driver-assistance systems. Such systems typically include
   radars, laser or video sensors that detect the vehicle trajectory and
   warn for an imminent lane departure, or sense the front vehicle's speed
   and apply the brakes of the following vehicle to maintain safe distance
   headways (i.e., collision avoidance system). However, most of these
   systems rely on the subject vehicle and surrounding vehicles' position
   and do not explicitly consider the driver's actions during the driving
   task. In addition, safety research has focused on eye tracking as a
   means of capturing driver's attention, fatigue, or drowsiness; however,
   the body posture has not been investigated in depth. This paper presents
   a novel approach for studying the actual movements of drivers inside the
   vehicle, when performing specific maneuver types such as lane changing
   and merging. A pilot study was conducted along a freeway and arterial
   segment, where the 3D shapes of selected participants were constructed
   with the use of Microsoft Kinect range camera while merging and changing
   lanes. A 7-point human skeletal model was fit to the captured range data
   (depth frame sequences) using the proposed framework. The analysis of
   the captured 3D data showed that there are important differences between
   participants when performing similar driving maneuvers. The preliminary
   results of this pilot research set the basis for implementing the
   proposed methodological framework for conducting full-scale experiments
   with a variety of participants, and exploring differences due to driver
   behavior attributes, such as age, gender and driving experience.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel technique to perform propellant-free
   chaser-target spacecraft relative maneuvers while simultaneously
   stabilizing the chaser's attitude with respect to the local vertical
   local horizontal coordinate system centered at its body center of mass.
   The control forces required for relative maneuvers at low Earth orbits
   can be generated by varying the relative aerodynamic drag via
   maneuverable sails placed in the back-end of the spacecraft. At the same
   time, aerodynamic torques resulting from the displacement of the centers
   of pressure of the sails can stabilize the orientation of the
   spacecraft. In this work, the target vehicle is assumed to maneuver an
   identical sail in a cooperative fashion and will be centered and
   attitude-stabilized in its local vertical local horizontal coordinate
   system. The proposed approach is based on the idea of virtual thrusters,
   emulating the sail's center of pressure offset in the controller.
   Several test cases are presented for various existing spacecraft,
   demonstrating successful propellant-less roto-translational control of
   the chaser spacecraft. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Para-aramid fibers, such as Kevlar, have been the most common material
   used for ballistic applications by providing a variety of energy
   absorption mechanisms to dissipate a projectile's momentum. One
   important mechanism is interyarn friction, which can be controlled
   through surface treatment of the fibers. It was recently shown that the
   growth of ZnO nanowires on the surface of the fibers could increase the
   interyam friction, producing 10.85 times higher peak load and 22.70
   times higher energy absorption compared to neat fabrics. Here, it is
   demonstrated that variation of the morphology of the nanowires produces
   a drastic change in the pullout behavior with low aspect ratio nanowires
   producing the largest increase in pullout force. While weight of the
   modified fabrics increased only 20\% compared to the bare ones, tensile
   test results show that the growth of ZnO nanowires enhances both tensile
   strength and elastic modulus of the fabrics by 13\% and 10\%,
   respectively. A comprehensive post-test micrograph analysis is performed
   to reveal possible enhancement mechanisms of modified aramid fabrics
   with different nanowire morphologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Cleaning-induced arsenic mobilization and chromium oxidation from
   CCA-wood deck: Potential risk to children}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{35-40}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Concern about children's exposure to arsenic (As) from wood treated with
   chromated-copper-arsenate (CCA) led to its withdrawal from residential
   use in 2004. However, due to its effectiveness, millions of American
   homes still have CCA-wood decks on which children play. This study
   evaluated the effects of three deck-cleaning methods on formation of
   dislodgeable As and hexavalent chromium (CrVI) on CCA-wood surfaces and
   in leachate. Initial wipes from CCA-wood wetted with water showed 3-4
   times more dislodgeable As than on dry wood. After cleaning with a
   bleach solution, 9.8-40.3 mu g/100 cm(2) of CrVI was found on the wood
   surface, with up to 170 mu g/L CrVI in the leachate. Depending on the
   cleaning method, 699-2473 mg of As would be released into the
   environment from cleaning a 18.6-m(2)-deck. Estimated As doses in
   children aged 1-6 after 1 h of playing on a wet CCA-wood deck were
   0.25-0.41 mu g/kg. This is the first study to identify increased
   dislodgeable As on wet CCA-wood and to evaluate dislodgeable CrVI after
   bleach application. Our data suggest that As and CrVI in 25-year old
   CCA-wood still show exposure risks for children and potential for soil
   contamination. Published by Elsevier Ltd}},

Title = {{Physicochemical and sorptive properties of biochars derived from woody
   and herbaceous biomass}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{257-262}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It is unclear how the properties of biochar control its ability to sorb
   metals. In this work, physicochemical properties of a variety of
   biochars, made from four types of feedstock at three pyrolysis
   temperatures (300, 450 and 600 degrees C) were compared to their ability
   to sorb arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) in aqueous solutions. Experimental
   results showed that both feedstock types and pyrolysis temperature
   affected biochar's production rate, i.e., ratio of mass of biochar and
   biomass, thermal stability, elemental composition, non-combustible
   component (NCC) content, pH values, surface areas and thus their
   sorption ability to the two metals in aqueous solution. In general, the
   high temperature biochars had low O/C and H/C ratios, were more
   carbonized with larger surface area, and were more concentrated with
   alkaline cations. In addition; biochars made from woody feedstocks had
   larger surface area, but lower NCC contents than that made from grasses
   under the same conditions. Although all the tested biochars removed both
   As and Pb from aqueous solutions, they showed different sorption
   abilities because of the variations in properties. Statistical analyses
   suggested that feedstock type affected the sorption ability of the
   biochars to both As and Pb significantly (p < 0.001). Pyrolysis
   temperature, however, showed little influence on biochar sorption of Pb
   in aqueous solutions. Statistical analyses also showed that
   electrostatic interaction played an important role in controlling the
   sorption of both As(V) and Pb(II) onto the biochar. Other mechanisms,
   such as precipitation and surface complexation, could also control the
   sorption of Pb(II) onto the biochars. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Antibiotics that enter the environment can present human and ecological
   health risks. An understanding of antibiotic hydrolysis rates is
   important for predicting their environmental persistence as biologically
   active contaminants. In this study, hydrolysis rates and Arrhenius
   constants were determined as a function of pH and temperature for two
   amphenicol (chloramphenicol and florfenicol) and two macrolide
   (spiramycin and tylosin) antibiotics. Antibiotic hydrolysis rates in pH
   4-9 buffer solutions at 25 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 60 degrees C
   were quantified, and degradation products were characterized. All of the
   antibiotics tested remained stable and exhibited no observable
   hydrolysis under ambient conditions typical of aquatic ecosystems. Acid-
   and base-catalyzed hydrolysis occurred at elevated temperatures (50-60
   degrees C), and hydrolysis rates increased considerably below pH 5 and
   above pH 8. Hydrolysis rates also increased approximately 1.5- to
   2.9-fold for each 10 degrees C increase in temperature. Based on the
   degradation product masses found, the functional groups that underwent
   hydrolysis were alkyl fluoride, amide, and cyclic ester (lactone)
   moieties: some of the resultant degradation products may remain
   bioactive, but to a lesser extent than the parent compounds. The results
   of this research demonstrate that amphenicol and macrolide antibiotics
   persist in aquatic systems under ambient temperature and pH conditions
   typical of natural waters. Thus, these antibiotics may present a risk in
   aquatic ecosystems depending on the concentration present. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Time-of-flight measurements were conducted to characterize the neutron
   energy response of pressurized He-4 fast neutron scintillation detectors
   for the first time, using the Van de Graaff generator at Ohio
   University. The time-of-flight spectra and pulse height distributions
   were measured. This data was used to determine the light output response
   function, which was found to be linear at energies below 3.5 MeV. The
   intrinsic efficiency of the detector as a function of incident energy
   was also calculated: the average efficiency up to 10 MeV was 3.1\%, with
   a maximum efficiency of 6.6\% at 1.05 MeV. These results will enable
   development of neutron spectrum unfolding algorithms for neutron
   spectroscopy applications with these detectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Identifying Cognitive States Using Regularity Partitions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Functional Magnetic Resonance (fMRI) data can be used to depict
   functional connectivity of the brain. Standard techniques have been
   developed to construct brain networks from this data; typically nodes
   are considered as voxels or sets of voxels with weighted edges between
   them representing measures of correlation. Identifying cognitive states
   based on fMRI data is connected with recording voxel activity over a
   certain time interval. Using this information, network and machine
   learning techniques can be applied to discriminate the cognitive states
   of the subjects by exploring different features of data. In this work we
   wish to describe and understand the organization of brain connectivity
   networks under cognitive tasks. In particular, we use a regularity
   partitioning algorithm that finds clusters of vertices such that they
   all behave with each other almost like random bipartite graphs. Based on
   the random approximation of the graph, we calculate a lower bound on the
   number of triangles as well as the expectation of the distribution of
   the edges in each subject and state. We investigate the results by
   comparing them to the state of the art algorithms for exploring
   connectivity and we argue that during epochs that the subject is exposed
   to stimulus, the inspected part of the brain is organized in an
   efficient way that enables enhanced functionality.}},

Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Perovskite structure (ABO(3)) thin films have wide applications in
   electronic devices due to their unique properties, including high
   dielectric permittivity, ferroelectricity and piezoelectric coupling.
   Here, we report an approach to grow highly textured thick lead titanate
   (PbTiO3) films on conductive substrates by a two-step hydrothermal
   reaction. Initially, vertically aligned TiO2 nanowire arrays are grown
   on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass, which act as template
   crystals for conversion to the perovskite structure. The PbTiO3 films
   are then converted from TiO2 NW arrays by diffusing Pb2+ ions into the
   template through a second hydrothermal reaction. The dielectric
   permittivity and piezoelectric coupling coefficient (d(33)) of the
   PbTiO3 films are as high as 795 at 1 kHz and 52 pm V-1, respectively.
   The reported process can also potentially be expanded for the assembly
   of other complex perovskite ATiO(3) (A = Ba, Ca, Cd, etc) films by using
   the highly aligned TiO2 NW arrays as templates. Therefore, the approach
   introduced here opens up a new door to synthesize ferroelectric thin
   films on conductive substrates for application in sensors, actuators,
   and ultrasonic transducers that are important in various industrial and
   scientific areas.}},

Abstract = {{We have computed lightning electromagnetic pulses (LEMPs), including the
   azimuthal magnetic field H-phi, vertical electric field E-z, and
   horizontal (radial) electric field E-h that propagated over 5 to 200 km
   of flat lossy ground, using the finite difference time domain (FDTD)
   method in the 2-D cylindrical coordinate system. This is the first
   systematic full-wave study of LEMP propagation effects based on a
   realistic return-stroke model and including the complete return-stroke
   frequency range. Influences of the return-stroke wavefront speed
   (ranging from c/2 to c, where c is the speed of light), current risetime
   (ranging from 0.5 to 5 mu s), and ground conductivity (ranging from 0.1
   S/m to infinity) on H-phi, E-z, and E-h have been investigated. Also,
   the FDTD-computed waveforms of E-h have been compared with the
   corresponding ones computed using the Cooray-Rubinstein formula. Peaks
   of H-phi, E-z, and E-h are nearly proportional to the return-stroke
   wavefront speed. The peak of E-h decreases with increasing current
   risetime, while those of H-phi and E-z are only slightly influenced by
   it. The peaks of H-phi and E-z are essentially independent of the ground
   conductivity at a distance of 5 km. Beyond this distance, they
   appreciably decrease relative to the perfectly conducting ground case,
   and the decrease is stronger for lower ground conductivity values. The
   peak of E-h increases with decreasing ground conductivity. The computed
   E-h/E-z is consistent with measurements of Thomson et al. (1988). The
   observed decrease of E-z peak and increase of E-z risetime due to
   propagation over 200 km of Florida soil are reasonably well reproduced
   by the FDTD simulation with ground conductivity of 1 S/m.}},

Abstract = {{For organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells based on the bulk heterojunction
   (BHJ) structure, it remains challenging to rationally control the degree
   of phase separation and percolation within blends of donors and
   acceptors to secure optimal charge separation and transport. Reported is
   a bottom-up, supramolecular approach to BHJ OPVs wherein tailored
   hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions between -conjugated electron
   donor molecules encourage formation of vertically aligned donor -stacks
   while simultaneously suppressing lateral aggregation; the programmed
   arrangement facilitates fine mixing with fullerene acceptors and
   efficient charge transport. The approach is illustrated using
   conventional linear or branched quaterthiophene donor chromophores
   outfitted with terminal functional groups that are either capable or
   incapable of self-complementary H-bonding. When applied to OPVs, the
   H-bond capable donors yield a twofold enhancement in power conversion
   efficiency relative to the comparator systems, with a maximum external
   quantum efficiency of 64\%. H-bond promoted assembly results in
   redshifted absorption (in neat films and donor:C-60 blends) and enhanced
   charge collection efficiency despite disparate donor chromophore
   structure. Both features positively impact photocurrent and fill factor
   in OPV devices. Film structural characterization by atomic force
   microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and grazing incidence wide
   angle X-ray scattering reveals a synergistic interplay of lateral
   H-bonding interactions and vertical -stacking for directing the
   favorable morphology of the BHJ.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{33}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{An interatomic potential for the Ni-Al system is presented within the
   third-generation charge optimized many-body (COMB3) formalism. The
   potential has been optimized for Ni3Al, or the gamma' phase in Ni-based
   superalloys. The formation energies predicted for other Ni-Al phases are
   in reasonable agreement with first-principles results. The potential
   further predicts good mechanical properties for Ni3Al, which includes
   the values of the complex stacking fault (CSF) and the anti-phase
   boundary (APB) energies for the (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) planes. It is also
   used to investigate dislocation propagation across the Ni3Al (1 1 0)-Ni
   (1 1 0) interface, and the results are consistent with simulation
   results reported in the literature. The potential is further used in
   combination with a recent COMB3 potential for Al2O3 to investigate the
   Ni3Al (1 1 1)-Al2O3 (0 0 01) interface, which has not been modeled
   previously at the classical atomistic level due to the lack of a
   reactive potential to describe both Ni3Al and Al2O3 as well as
   interactions between them. The calculated work of adhesion for this
   interface is predicted to be 1.85 J m(-2), which is in agreement with
   available experimental data. The predicted interlayer distance is
   further consistent with the available first-principles results for Ni (1
   1 1)-Al2O3 (0 0 0 1).}},

Abstract = {{Reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) has revolutionized
   modern polymer chemistry over the past two decades, thus laying the
   groundwork for the synthesis of complex macromolecules and enabling the
   preparation of previously inaccessible materials. Reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization has emerged
   as one of the most promising techniques because of its functional group
   tolerance, applicability to a wide range of vinyl monomers, and its
   nondemanding experimental conditions. However, despite the promise and
   clearly demonstrated utility of RAFT, limitations of the method
   sometimes still exist, including the occasional need for extended
   polymerization times, limited access to high molecular weight polymers,
   low ``livingness{''} due to unavoidable radical termination events, etc.
   This Perspective focuses on recent advances that have been specifically
   designed to address many of these perceived limitations to reinforce the
   promise of RAFT for the synthesis of complex and well-defined polymers

Title = {{Self-Regulation of Anterior Insula with Real-Time fMRI and Its
   Behavioral Effects in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Feasibility Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common and chronic condition
   that can have disabling effects throughout the patient's lifespan.
   Frequent symptoms among OCD patients include fear of contamination and
   washing compulsions. Several studies have shown a link between
   contamination fears, disgust over-reactivity, and insula activation in
   OCD. In concordance with the role of insula in disgust processing, new
   neural models based on neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormally high
   activations of insula could be implicated in OCD psychopathology, at
   least in the subgroup of patients with contamination fears and washing
   compulsions.
   Methods
   In the current study, we used a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based on
   real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) to aid OCD
   patients to achieve down-regulation of the Blood Oxygenation Level
   Dependent (BOLD) signal in anterior insula. Our first aim was to
   investigate whether patients with contamination obsessions and washing
   compulsions can learn to volitionally decrease (down-regulate) activity
   in the insula in the presence of disgust/anxiety provoking stimuli. Our
   second aim was to evaluate the effect of down-regulation on clinical,
   behavioural and physiological changes pertaining to OCD symptoms. Hence,
   several pre- and post-training measures were performed, i.e.,
   confronting the patient with a disgust/anxiety inducing real-world
   object (Ecological Disgust Test), and subjective rating and
   physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance level) of disgust
   towards provoking pictures.
   Results
   Results of this pilot study, performed in 3 patients (2 females), show
   that OCD patients can gain self-control of the BOLD activity of insula,
   albeit to different degrees. In two patients positive changes in
   behaviour in the EDT were observed following the rtfMRI trainings.
   Behavioural changes were also confirmed by reductions in the negative
   valence and in the subjective perception of disgust towards symptom
   provoking images.
   Conclusion
   Although preliminary, results of this study confirmed that insula
   down-regulation is possible in patients suffering from OCD, and that
   volitional decreases of insula activation could be used for symptom
   alleviation in this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the new development of a concurrent
   atomistic-continuum (CAC) method in simulation of the dynamic evolution
   of defects in polycrystalline polyatomic materials. The CAC method is
   based on a theoretical formulation that extends Kirkwood's statistical
   mechanical theory of transport processes to a multiscale description of
   crystalline materials. It solves for both the deformation of lattice
   cells and the internal deformation within each lattice cell, making it a
   suitable method for simulations of polyatomic materials. The simulation
   results of this work demonstrate that CAC can simulate the nucleation of
   dislocations and cracks from atomistically resolved grain boundary (GB)
   regions and the subsequent propagation into coarsely meshed grain
   interiors in polycrystalline strontium titanate without the need of
   supplemental constitutive equations or additional numerical treatments.
   With a significantly reduced computational cost, CAC predicts not only
   the GB structures, but also the dynamic behaviour of dislocations,
   cracks and GBs, all of which are comparable with those obtained from
   atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations. Simulation results also
   show that dislocations tend to initiate from GBs and triple junctions.
   The angle between the slip planes and the GB planes plays a key role in
   determining the GB-dislocation reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The ionization chamber volume averaging effect is a well-known issue
   without an elegant solution. The purpose of this study is to propose a
   novel convolution-based approach to address the volume averaging effect
   in model-based treatment planning systems (TPSs). Ionization
   chamber-measured beam profiles can be regarded as the convolution
   between the detector response function and the implicit real profiles.
   Existing approaches address the issue by trying to remove the volume
   averaging effect from the measurement. In contrast, our proposed method
   imports the measured profiles directly into the TPS and addresses the
   problem by reoptimizing pertinent parameters of the TPS beam model. In
   the iterative beam modeling process, the TPS-calculated beam profiles
   are convolved with the same detector response function. Beam model
   parameters responsible for the penumbra are optimized to drive the
   convolved profiles to match the measured profiles. Since the convolved
   and the measured profiles are subject to identical volume averaging
   effect, the calculated profiles match the real profiles when the
   optimization converges. The method was applied to reoptimize a CC13 beam
   model commissioned with profiles measured with a standard ionization
   chamber (Scanditronix Wellhofer, Bartlett, TN). The reoptimized beam
   model was validated by comparing the TPS-calculated profiles with
   diode-measured profiles. Its performance in intensity-modulated
   radiation therapy (IMRT) quality assurance (QA) for ten head-and-neck
   patients was compared with the CC13 beam model and a clinical beam model
   (manually optimized, clinically proven) using standard Gamma
   comparisons. The beam profiles calculated with the reoptimized beam
   model showed excellent agreement with diode measurement at all measured
   geometries. Performance of the reoptimized beam model was comparable
   with that of the clinical beam model in IMRT QA. The average passing
   rates using the reoptimized beam model increased substantially from
   92.1\% to 99.3\% with 3\%/3 mm and from 79.2\% to 95.2\% with 2\%/2 mm
   when compared with the CC13 beam model. These results show the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. Less inter-user variability can be
   expected of the final beam model. It is also found that the method can
   be easily integrated into model-based TPS.}},

Abstract = {{The nucleus has a smooth, regular appearance in normal cells, and its
   shape is greatly altered in human pathologies. Yet, how the cell
   establishes nuclear shape is not well understood. We imaged the dynamics
   of nuclear shaping in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Nuclei translated toward the
   substratum and began flattening during the early stages of cell
   spreading. Initially, nuclear height and width correlated with the
   degree of cell spreading, but over time, reached steady-state values
   even as the cell continued to spread. Actomyosin activity, actomyosin
   bundles, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, as well as the LINC
   complex, were all dispensable for nuclear flattening as long as the cell
   could spread. Inhibition of actin polymerization as well as myosin light
   chain kinase with the drug ML7 limited both the initial spreading of
   cells and flattening of nuclei, and for well-spread cells, inhibition of
   myosin-II ATPase with the drug blebbistatin decreased cell spreading
   with associated nuclear rounding. Together, these results show that cell
   spreading is necessary and sufficient to drive nuclear flattening under
   a wide range of conditions, including in the presence or absence of
   myosin activity. To explain this observation, we propose a computational
   model for nuclear and cell mechanics that shows how frictional
   transmission of stress from the moving cell boundaries to the nuclear
   surface shapes the nucleus during early cell spreading. Our results
   point to a surprisingly simple mechanical system in cells for
   establishing nuclear shapes.}},

Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Targeted delivery of self-antigens to the immune system in a mode that
   stimulates a tolerance-inducing pathway has proven difficult. To address
   this hurdle, we developed a vaccine based-approach comprised of two
   synthetic controlled-release biomaterials, poly(lactide-co-glycolide;
   PLGA) microparticles (MPs) encapsulating denatured insulin (key
   self-antigen in type 1 diabetes; T1D), and PuraMatrix (TM) peptide
   hydrogel containing granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
   (GM-CSF) and CpG ODN1826 (CpG), which were included as vaccine adjuvants
   to recruit and activate immune cells. Although CpG is normally
   considered pro-inflammatory, it also has anti-inflammatory effects,
   including enhancing IL-10 production. Three subcutaneous administrations
   of this hydrogel (GM-CSF/CpG)/insulin-MP vaccine protected 40\% of NOD
   mice from T1D. In contrast, all control mice became diabetic. In vitro
   studies indicate CpG stimulation increased IL-10 production, as a
   potential mechanism. Multiple subcutaneous injections of the insulin
   containing formulation resulted in formation of granulomas, which
   resolved by 28 weeks. Histological analysis of these granulomas
   indicated infiltration of a diverse cadre of immune cells, with
   characteristics reminiscent of a tertiary lymphoid organ, suggesting the
   creation of a microenvironment to recruit and educate immune cells.
   These results demonstrate the feasibility of this injectable hydrogel/MP
   based vaccine system to prevent T1D.}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Subcooled flow boiling is a significant heat transfer regime in
   pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and also occurs in boiling water
   reactors (BWRs) prior to the onset of saturated nucleate boiling. In
   subcooled boiling, individual bubbles experience a life-cycle of
   nucleation from the wall, (possible) departure from the wall, and
   transport along the channel during condensation/collapse. The present
   paper focuses on the last stage of this life cycle. CFD analysis of a
   single bubble behavior in upward subcooled flow boiling was performed
   using volume-of-fluid (VOF) interface tracking method and large eddy
   simulation (LES) turbulence model. High pressure steam-water conditions
   at high flow velocity were simulated due to their relevance to the
   nuclear application. The numerical solutions were compared with terminal
   velocity correlations. Bubble behavior was investigated at different
   system pressure, subcooling temperature, bubble diameter, pipe diameter,
   and bulk fluid velocity, corresponding to bulk Reynolds number range of
   0-410,000. The effects of these parametric variations on bubble rise
   velocity, deformation rate, trajectory, and distortion are presented.
   Results show that bubble rise velocity increases with bulk velocity, and
   bubble size, but decreases with increasing pipe diameter. A reverse
   bubble velocity trend with varying system pressure is observed with and
   without bulk velocity. Bubble condensation rate decreased with
   increasing system pressure, bubble size and pipe diameter, but increased
   with increasing subcooling temperature and bulk fluid velocity. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We present a method for noninvasively imaging the hand joints using a
   three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) system. This 3D PAI
   system utilizes cylindrical scanning in data collection and
   virtual-detector concept in image reconstruction. The maximum lateral
   and axial resolutions of the PAI system are 70 mu m and 240 mu m. The
   cross-sectional photoacoustic images of a healthy joint clearly
   exhibited major internal structures including phalanx and tendons, which
   are not available from the current photoacoustic imaging methods. The in
   vivo PAI results obtained are comparable with the corresponding 3.0 T
   MRI images of the finger joint. This study suggests that the proposed
   method has the potential to be used in early detection of joint diseases
   such as osteoarthritis. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{173}},
Pages = {{416-424}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Finite-element simulations were used to calculate the influence of
   surface roughness of V-shaped grooves on the impedance of ideally
   polarized disk electrodes. The characteristic length associated with
   roughness was found to depend on the width or period of the roughness as
   well as the roughness factor. The characteristic dimension associated
   with a rough disk was shown to be the disk radius multiplied by the
   roughness factor. This work shows that for small roughness factors,
   while roughness causes frequency dispersion, the frequency dispersion is
   seen only at frequencies that are much higher than those associated with
   the disk geometry. Thus, a constant-phase element associated with a
   surface distribution of time constants cannot be attributed to surface
   roughness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity reduction is one of the potential routes to improve
   the performance of thermoelectric materials. However, detailed
   understanding of the thermal transport of many promising materials is
   still missing. In this paper, we employ electronic-structure
   calculations at the level of density functional theory to elucidate
   thermal transport properties of the Mg2X (X = C, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb)
   family of compounds, which includes Mg2Si, a material already identified
   as a potential thermoelectric. All these materials crystallize into the
   same antifluorite structure. Systematic trends in the anharmonic
   properties of these materials are presented and examined. Our
   calculations indicate that the reduction in the group velocity is the
   main driver of the thermal conductivity trend in these materials, as the
   phonon lifetimes in these compounds are very similar. We also examine
   the limits of the applicability of perturbation theory to study the
   effect of point defects on thermal transport and find that it is in good
   agreement with experiment in a wide range of scattering parameter
   values. The thermal conductivity of the recently synthesized Mg2C is
   computed and predicted to be 34 W/mK at 300 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Two sets of conjugated polyelectrolytes with different molecular weights
   (M-n) in each set were synthesized. All polymers feature the same
   conjugated backbone with alternating (1,4-phenylene) and (2,5-thienylene
   ethynylene) repeating units, but different linkages between the backbone
   and side chains, namely, oxy-methylene (-O-CH2-) (P1-O-n, where n = 7,
   9, and 14) and methylene (-CH2-) (P2-C-n, n = 7, 12, and 18). They all
   bear carboxylic acid moieties as side chains, which bind strongly to
   titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles. The two sets of polymers were
   used as light-harvesting materials in dye-sensitized solar cells.
   Despite the difference in molecular weight, polymers within each set
   have very similar light absorption properties. Interestingly, under the
   same working conditions, the overall cell efficiency of the P1-O-n
   series increases with a decreasing molecular weight while the efficiency
   of the P2-C-n series remains constant regardless of the molecular
   weight. Steady state photophysical measurements and dynamic light
   scattering investigation prove that P1-O-n polymers aggregate in
   solution while P2-C-n series are in the monomeric state. In P1-O-n
   series, a higher-molecular weight polymer results in a larger aggregate,
   which reduces the amount of polymers that are adsorbed onto TiO2 films
   and overall cell efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the development and applications of a new empirical,
   variable charge potential for Al2O3 systems within the charge optimized
   many-body (COMB) potential framework. The potential can describe the
   fundamental physical properties of Al2O3, including cohesive energy,
   elastic constants, defect formation energies, surface energies and
   phonon properties of alpha-Al2O3 comparable to that obtained from
   experiments and first-principles calculations. The potential is further
   employed in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to validate
   and predict the properties of the Al (1 1 1)-Al2O3 (0 0 0 1) interface,
   tensile properties of Al nanowires, Al2O3 nanowires, Al2O3-covered Al
   nanowires, and defective Al2O3 nanowires. The results demonstrate that
   the potential is well-suited to model heterogeneous material systems
   involving Al and Al2O3. Most importantly, the parameters can be
   seamlessly coupled with COMB3 parameters for other materials to enable
   MD simulations of a wide range of heterogeneous material systems.}},

Abstract = {{More than 1,500 construction and demolition debris (CDD) landfills
   operate in the United States (U.S.), and U.S. federal regulations do not
   require containment features such as low-permeability liners and
   leachate collection systems for these facilities. Here we evaluate
   groundwater quality from samples collected in groundwater monitoring
   networks at 91 unlined, permitted CDD landfills in Florida, U.S. A total
   of 460,504 groundwater sample results were analyzed, with a median of 10
   years of quarterly or semiannual monitoring data per site including more
   than 400 different chemical constituents. Downgradient concentrations of
   total dissolved solids, sulfate, chloride, iron, ammonia-nitrogen, and
   aluminum were greater than upgradient concentrations (p < 0.05). At
   downgradient wells where sulfate concentrations were greater than 150
   mg/L (approximately 10\% sulfate concentration in water, which suggests
   the presence of leachate from the landfill), iron and arsenic were
   detected in 91\% and 43\% of samples, with median concentrations of
   1,900 mu g/L and 11 mu g/L, respectively. These results show that
   although health-based standards can be exceeded at unlined CDD
   landfills, the magnitude of detected chemical concentrations is
   generally small and reflective of leached minerals from components
   (wood, concrete, and gypsum drywall) that comprise the bulk of discarded
   CDD by mass.}},

Abstract = {{The soluble bis(fluoroalkOxide) dioxo tungsten(VI) complexes
   WO2(OR)(2)(DME) {[}1,R = C(CF3)(2)CH3; 2, R = C(CF3)(3)] have been
   synthesized by alkoxide-chloride metathesis and evaluated as precursors
   for aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) of WOx. The H-1
   NMR and F-19 NMR spectra of 1 and 2 are consi\$tent with an equilibrium
   between the dimethoxyetharie (DME) complexes 1 and 2 and the solvato
   complexes WO2(OR)(2)(CD3CN)(2) {[}1b, R = C(CF3)(2)CH3; 2b, R =
   C(CF3)(3)] in acetonitrile-d(3) solution. Studies of the fragmentation
   of 1 and 2 by mass spectrometry and therrnolysis resulted in observation
   of DME and the corresponding alcohols, with hexafluoroisobutylene also
   generated from 1. DFT calculations on possible decomposition mechanisms
   for 1 located pathways for hydrogen abstraction by a terminal oxo to
   form hexafluoroisobutylene, followed by dimetization of the resulting
   terminal hydroxide complex and dissociation of the alcohol. AACVD using
   1 occurred between 100 and 550 degrees C and produced both

Abstract = {{Sapphire (alpha-Al2O3) is a common substrate for the growth of single-to
   few-layer MoS2 films, and amorphous aluminium oxide serves as a
   high-kappa dielectric gate oxide for MoS2 based transistors. Using
   density-functional theory calculations with a van der Waals functional,
   we investigate the structural, energetic, and electronic properties of
   n-layer MoS2 (n = 1 and 3) on the alpha-Al2O3 (0001) surface. Our
   results show that the sapphire stabilizes single-layer and tri-layer
   MoS2, while having a negligible effect on the structure, band gap, and
   electron effective masses of MoS2. This combination of a strong
   energetic stabilization and weak perturbation of the electronic
   properties shows that alpha-Al2O3 can serve as an ideal substrate for
   depositing ultra-thin MoS2 layers and can also serve as a passivation or
   gate-oxide layer for MoS2 based devices. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient non-viral plasmid DNA transfection of most stem cells,
   progenitor cells and primary cell lines currently presents an obstacle
   for many applications within gene therapy research. From a standpoint of
   efficiency and cell viability, magnetic nanoparticle-based DNA
   transfection is a promising gene vectoring technique because it has
   demonstrated rapid and improved transfection outcomes when compared to
   alternative non-viral methods. Recently, our research group introduced
   oscillating magnet arrays that resulted in further improvements to this
   novel plasmid DNA (pDNA) vectoring technology. Continued improvements to
   nanomagnetic transfection techniques have focused primarily on magnetic
   nanoparticle (MNP) functionalization and transfection parameter
   optimization: cell confluence, growth media, serum starvation, magnet
   oscillation parameters, etc. Noting that none of these parameters can
   assist in the nuclear translocation of delivered pDNA following MNP-pDNA
   complex dissociation in the cell's cytoplasm, inclusion of a cassette
   feature for pDNA nuclear translocation is theoretically justified. In
   this study incorporation of a DNA targeting sequence (DTS) feature in
   the transfecting plasmid improved transfection efficiency in model
   neurons, presumably from increased nuclear translocation. This
   observation became most apparent when comparing the response of the
   dividing SH-SY5Y precursor cell to the non-dividing and differentiated
   SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.}},

Abstract = {{Time series of horizontal velocities, echo intensity, wind velocity, and
   atmospheric pressure were collected for similar to 200 days in a
   Patagonian fjord to explore pycnocline motions produced by the Southern
   Hemisphere's baroclinic annular mode (BAM). The BAM variability occurs
   between 20 and 30 days and is associated with fluctuations in
   atmospheric kinetic energy and in turbulent fluxes of heat. Spectra of
   horizontal velocities and normalized echo intensity in the fjord's water
   showed highest energy between 25 and 30 days. This was explained by
   sustained westerly winds associated with extreme low-pressure systems
   (similar to 900 hPa) that had periodicity related to the BAM. Wind
   forcing produced > 40 cm s(-1) along-channel and cross-channel currents
   in the surface layer, which in turn created a wind-induced setup toward
   the head of the fjord. The setup was accompanied by a deepening of the
   pycnocline (from 5 to 15 m depth) with similar to 25 to 30 day
   periodicity, as derived from the normalized echo intensity. The dominant
   empirical orthogonal function mode of the normalized echo intensity
   profiles explained 70.8\% of the variance and also exhibited a similar
   to 25-30 day periodicity. Further, a wavelet and spectral analysis of 10
   years of atmospheric pressure indicated peaks between 25 and 30 days
   each year, indicating that the BAM consistently influences weather
   patterns in Chilean Patagonia. This is the first documented case of
   baroclinic annular variability in a specific region of the Southern
   Hemisphere, and of its effects on fjord systems.}},

Abstract = {{This study determines the optimal electric driving range of plug-in
   hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that minimizes the daily cost borne by
   the society when using this technology. An optimization framework is
   developed and applied to datasets representing the US market. Results
   indicate that the optimal range is 16 miles with an average social cost
   of \$3.19 per day when exclusively charging at home, compared to \$3.27
   per day of driving a conventional vehicle. The optimal range is found to
   be sensitive to the cost of battery packs and the price of gasoline.
   When workplace charging is available, the optimal electric driving range
   surprisingly increases from 16 to 22 miles, as larger batteries would
   allow drivers to better take advantage of the charging opportunities to
   achieve longer electrified travel distances, yielding social cost
   savings. If workplace charging is available, the optimal density is to
   deploy a workplace charger for every 3.66 vehicles. Moreover, the
   diversification of the battery size, i.e., introducing a pair and triple
   of electric driving ranges to the market, could further decrease the
   average societal cost per PHEV by 7.45\% and 11.5\% respectively. (C)

   previous analyses of early/slow events. We separately identify and
   analyze three early VLF events that definitively exhibit slow scattered
   field behavior. Additionally, we identify a significant number of events
   which have onset durations between the current definitions of fast and
   slow. Four events are observed which unambiguously exhibit a rapid
   initial rotation of the scattered field phasor during the first few
   seconds of the recovery stage. Possible physical mechanisms are

Title = {{Evaluating Florida Homeowner Response to Smart Irrigation Controllers}},
Journal = {{HORTTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Smart irrigation controllers are capable of substantially decreasing
   landscape water applications under residential high water-use conditions
   in Florida. Their implementation has been incentivized by governmental
   agencies and water utilities in an effort to reduce public-supply water
   demand and conserve water resources. However, the bulk of the research
   on smart controllers for urban landscapes has focused on performance
   dimensions. To successfully promote them, feedback from end-users is
   critical. This paper provides an evaluation of homeowner response to
   evapotranspiration (ET)-based and soil moisture sensor (SMS)-based smart
   controllers installed as part of a pilot project conducted in Orange
   County, FL. The objectives of the study were to collect demographic
   information, assess conservation attitudes and irrigation system
   knowledge, and gather feedback on the use of smart controllers from the
   pilot project's residential cooperators. Data were collected through an
   online survey and analyzed using relative frequency distributions, text
   analysis, independent means t tests, and logistic regression. Results
   indicated that a majority of survey participants were satisfied with
   their controllers and planned to continue using them. Both ET and SMS
   controllers were consistently praised for saving money and irrigating
   efficiently. However, the likelihood that participants would continue
   using their controllers after the completion of the project was only
   significantly predicted by their levels of technical knowledge regarding
   the workings of the devices and whether they had experienced any
   challenges operating them. Efforts to promote both initial and long-term
   adoption may be most effective by emphasizing the economic benefits of
   investing in smart irrigation controllers and by disseminating best
   management practices that facilitate their understanding and successful
   operation.}},

Title = {{Parenteral emulsions and liposomes to treat drug overdose}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Drug overdoses from both pharmaceutical and recreational drugs are a
   major public health concern. Although some overdoses may be treated with
   specific antidotes, the most common treatment involves providing
   supportive care to allow the body to metabolize and excrete the
   toxicant. In many cases, supportive care is limiting, ineffective, and
   expensive. There is a clear medical need to improve the effectiveness of
   detoxification, in particular by developing more specific therapies or
   antidotes for these overdoses.
   Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs) have been investigated as a potential
   treatment for overdoses of local anesthetics and other hydrophobic
   drugs. While ILE therapy has been successful in several cases, its use
   beyond local anesthetic systemic toxicity is controversial and its
   mechanism of detoxification remains a subject of debate. ILEs were not
   originally developed to treat overdose, but clarifying the mechanisms of
   detoxification observed with ILE may allow us to design more effective
   future treatments.
   Liposomes are highly biocompatible and versatile formulations, thus it
   was a natural step to explore their use for drug overdose therapy as
   well. Several researchers have designed liposomes using a variety of
   approaches including surface charge, pH gradients, and inclusion of
   enzymes in the liposome core to optimize the formulations for
   detoxification of a specific drug or toxicant. The in vitro results for
   drug sequestration by liposomes are very promising and animal trials
   have in some cases shown comparable performance to ILE at reduced lipid
   dosing. This narrative review summarizes the current status and advances
   in the use of emulsions and liposomes for detoxification and also
   suggests several areas in which studies are needed for developing future
   therapies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion is an important learning
   criterion in information theoretical learning (ITL). However, the MEE
   solution cannot be obtained in closed form even for a simple linear
   regression problem, and one has to search it, usually, in an iterative
   manner. The fixed-point iteration is an efficient way to solve the MEE
   solution. In this work, we study a fixed-point MEE algorithm for linear
   regression, and our focus is mainly on the convergence issue. We provide
   a sufficient condition (although a little loose) that guarantees the
   convergence of the fixed-point MEE algorithm. An illustrative example is
   also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The basal ganglia-thalamocortical and
   cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits are important for motor control.
   Whether their functioning is affected in a similar or different way by
   progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease (PD) is not
   clear.
   Methods: A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) force production
   paradigm and voxel-based morphometry were used to assess differences in
   brain activity and macrostructural volumes between PSP, PD, and healthy
   age-matched controls.
   Results: We found that PSP and PD share reduced functional activity of
   the basal ganglia and cortical motor areas, but this is more pronounced
   in PSP than in PD. In PSP the frontal regions are underactive, whereas
   the posterior parietal and occipital regions are overactive as compared
   with controls and PD. Furthermore, lobules I through IV, V, and VI of
   the cerebellum are hypoactive in PSP and PD, whereas Crus I and lobule
   IX are hyperactive in PSP only. Reductions in gray and white matter
   volume are specific to PSR Finally, the functional status of the caudate
   as well as the volume of the superior frontal gyrus predict clinical
   gait and posture measures in PSR
   Conclusions: PSP and PD share hypoactivity of the basal ganglia, motor
   cortex, and anterior cerebellum. These patients also display a unique
   pattern, such that anterior regions of the cortex are hypoactive and
   posterior regions of the cortex and cerebellum are hyperactive.
   Together, these findings suggest that specific structures within the
   basal ganglia, cortex, and cerebellum are affected differently in PSP
   relative to PD. (C) 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The Faraday instability arising in distinct miscible fluid layers, when
   the parametric forcing is parallel to the gravity vector, is analysed. A
   time-dependent density gradient is established from the moment the fluid
   layers are placed in contact with one another. The operating parameters
   in a miscible Faraday system are the frequency of parametric forcing and
   the wait time between the initial contact of fluids and the commencement
   of oscillations. Using a linearized theory that invokes a quasi-steady
   approximation, the vibrational threshold required for the onset of
   Faraday instability is evaluated for these parameters and several
   observations are made. First, the criticality is observed to occur at a
   sub-harmonic frequency. Second, the large magnitude of the concentration
   gradient at early wait times is found to make the thin layers highly
   unstable. Third, the stability increases with forcing frequency, owing
   to the increased dissipation of the resulting choppy waves. All these
   observations qualitatively agree with experiments. Finally, a
   calculation reveals that an increase in gravity increases the critical
   wavelength of flow onset and results in the reduction of critical input
   acceleration. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Propagation and deposition of non-circular finite release particle-laden
   currents}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of non-axisymmetric turbidity currents is considered here
   for a range of Reynolds numbers of O (10(4)) when based on the initial
   height of the release. The study comprises a series of experiments and
   highly resolved simulations for which a finite volume of particle-laden
   solution is released into fresh water. A mixture of water and
   polystyrene particles of mean diameter (d) over tilde (p) = 300 mu m and
   mixture density (rho) over tilde (c) = 1012 kg/m(3) is initially
   confined in a hollow cylinder at the centre of a large tank filled with
   fresh water. Cylinders with two different cross-sectional shapes, but
   equal cross-sectional areas, are examined: a circle and a rounded
   rectangle in which the sharp corners are smoothened. The time evolution
   of the front is recorded as well as the spatial distribution of the
   thickness of the final deposit via the use of a laser triangulation
   technique. The dynamics of the front and final deposits are
   significantly influenced by the initial geometry, displaying substantial
   azimuthal variation especially for the rectangular case where the
   current extends farther and deposits more particles along the initial
   minor axis of the rectangular cross section. Several parameters are
   varied to assess the dependence on the settling velocity, initial height
   aspect ratio, and volume fraction. Even though resuspension is not taken
   into account in our simulations, good agreement with experiments
   indicates that it does not play an important role in the front dynamics,
   in terms of velocity and extent of the current. However, wall shear
   stress measurements show that incipient motion of particles and particle
   transport along the bed are likely to occur in the body of the current
   and should be accounted to properly capture the final deposition profile
   of particles. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Distributed collaborative 3D pose estimation of robots from
   heterogeneous relative measurements: an optimization on manifold
   approach}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We propose a distributed algorithm for estimating the 3D pose (position
   and orientation) of multiple robots with respect to a common frame of
   reference when Global Positioning System is not available. This
   algorithm does not rely on the use of any maps, or the ability to
   recognize landmarks in the environment. Instead, we assume that noisy
   relative measurements between pairs of robots are intermittently
   available, which can be any one, or combination, of the following:
   relative pose, relative orientation, relative position, relative
   bearing, and relative distance. The additional information about each
   robot's pose provided by these measurements are used to improve over
   self-localization estimates. The proposed method is similar to a
   pose-graph optimization algorithm in spirit: pose estimates are obtained
   by solving an optimization problem in the underlying Riemannian manifold
   (SO(3) x R-3)(n(k)). The proposed algorithm is directly applicable to 3D
   pose estimation, can fuse heterogeneous measurement types, and can
   handle arbitrary time variation in the neighbor relationships among
   robots. Simulations show that the errors in the pose estimates obtained
   using this algorithm are significantly lower than what is achieved when
   robots estimate their pose without cooperation. Results from experiments
   with a pair of ground robots with vision-based sensors reinforce these
   findings. Further, simulations comparing the proposed algorithm with two
   state-of-the-art existing collaborative localization algorithms identify
   under what circumstances the proposed algorithm performs better than the
   existing methods. In addition, the question of trade-offs between cost
   (of obtaining a certain type of relative measurement) and benefit
   (improvement in localization accuracy) for various types of relative
   measurements is considered.}},

   free-water values - which may reflect the volume of the extracellular

   develop non-invasive markers of substantia nigra progression in
   Parkinson's disease. We previously found elevated free-water levels in
   the substantia nigra for patients with Parkinson's disease compared with
   controls in single-site and multi-site cohorts. Here, we test the
   hypotheses that free-water levels in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's
   disease increase following 1 year of progression, and that baseline
   free-water levels in the substantia nigra predict the change in
   bradykinesia following 1 year. We conducted a longitudinal study in
   controls (<italic toggle={''}yes{''}>n = 19) and patients with
   Parkinson's disease (<italic toggle={''}yes{''}>n = 25). Diffusion
   imaging and clinical data were collected at baseline and after 1 year.
   Free-water analyses were performed on diffusion imaging data using
   blinded, hand-drawn regions of interest in the posterior substantia
   nigra. A group effect indicated free-water values were increased in the
   posterior substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease compared
   with controls (<italic toggle={''}yes{''}>P = 0.003) and we observed a
   significant group x time interaction (<italic toggle={''}yes{''}>P <
   0.05). Free-water values increased for the Parkinson's disease group
   after 1 year (<italic toggle={''}yes{''}>P = 0.006), whereas control
   free-water values did not change. Baseline free-water values predicted
   the 1 year change in bradykinesia scores (r = 0.74, <italic
   toggle={''}yes{''}>P < 0.001) and 1 year change in Montreal Cognitive
   Assessment scores (r = -0.44, <italic toggle={''}yes{''}>P = 0.03).
   Free-water in the posterior substantia nigra is elevated in Parkinson's
   disease, increases with progression of Parkinson's disease, and predicts
   subsequent changes in bradykinesia and cognitive status over 1 year.
   These findings demonstrate that free-water provides a potential
   non-invasive progression marker of the substantia nigra.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-based therapy exploits modified human cells to treat diseases but
   its targeted application in specific tissues, particularly those lying
   deep in the body where direct injection is not possible, has been
   problematic. Here we use a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system to
   direct macrophages carrying an oncolytic virus, Seprehvir, into primary
   and metastatic tumour sites in mice. To achieve this, we magnetically
   label macrophages with super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and
   apply pulsed magnetic field gradients in the direction of the tumour
   sites. Magnetic resonance targeting guides macrophages from the
   bloodstream into tumours, resulting in increased tumour macrophage
   infiltration and reduction in tumour burden and metastasis. Our study
   indicates that clinical MRI scanners can not only track the location of
   magnetically labelled cells but also have the potential to steer them
   into one or more target tissues.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in understanding ambient bioaerosols due
   to their roles both in health and in climate. Here, we deployed an
   Ultraviolet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer to monitor viable (fluorescent)
   bioaerosol concentration levels at city centers (highly polluted) and
   their corresponding suburbs (near pristine) (total 40 locations) in 11
   provinces featuring different climate zones in China between July 16 and
   28, 2013. The concentration levels of viable bioaerosol particles
   (BioPM) of > 0.5 A mu m were measured, and corresponding percentages of
   BioPM\% (biological fraction of total PM) and BioPM(2.5)\% (biological
   fraction of PM2.5) in particulate matter (PM) and BioPM, respectively,
   were determined. For some key cities, indoor viable bioaerosol levels
   were also obtained. In addition, bacterial structures of the air samples
   collected across these monitoring locations were studied using
   pyrosequencing. BioPM concentration levels ranged from 2.1 x 10(4) to
   2.4 x 10(5)/m(3) for city centers {[}BioPM\% = 6.4 \% (+/- 6.3 \%)] and
   0.5 x 10(4) to 4.7 x 10(5)/m(3) for suburbs {[}BioPM\% = 10 \% (+/- 8.7
   \%)]. Distinctive bioaerosol size distribution patterns were observed
   for different climate zones, e.g., some had fluorescence peaks at 3 A mu
   m, while the majority had peaks at 1 A mu m. Ambient bacterial aerosol
   community structures were also found different for different geophysical
   locations. Results suggest that there was a poor overall relationship
   between PM and BioPM across 40 monitoring locations (R (2) = 0.081,
   two-tailed P value = 0.07435). Generally, city centers had higher PM
   concentrations than suburbs, but not BioPM and BioPM\%. Indoor
   bioaerosol levels were found at least tenfold higher than those
   corresponding outdoors. Bacillus was observed to dominate the bacterial
   aerosol community in the air sample.}},

   Jianghan Basin: Constrained by Water Column Stratification}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{2,3,4-Trimethyl aryl isoprenoid (ALP) hydrocarbons as well as their
   2,3,6 homologues were found in most Paleocene crude oils from the
   Jianghan Basin, China. We interpret their concurrence as evidence for
   the presence of both purple sulfur bacteria (PSB, family of
   Chromatiaceae) and green sulfur bacteria (GSB, family of Chlorobiaceae)
   in the water body during deposition. The GSB and PSB contributions are
   also evidenced by the presence of the monoaromatic carotenoid
   derivatives chlorobactane and okenane as well as C-40 diaromatic
   carotenoid derivatives, including isorenieratane and renierapurpurane.
   The presence of related biomarkers of gammacerane, phytane and methyl
   trimethyltridecyl chromans (MTTCs) in the oil samples implies that these
   prolific photosynthetic sulfur bacteria grew in a mesosaline condition,
   which is consistent with their niches above and below the oxic anoxic
   chemocline in a stratified water column. Thus, the general presence of
   2,3,6-AIPs, chlorobactane, and isorenieratane sourced from GSB is
   consistent with sulfidic (euxinic) conditions in the photic zone of the
   water column, while their concurrence with 2,3,4-AIPs and okenane
   further indicates a permanent stratified water column with sulfidic
   (euxinic) conditions. In such a paleowater-column redox state with ideal
   growing conditions for the photosynthetic bacteria, PSB likely lived
   beneath the GSB layer and/or co-existed in the same layer with a
   symbiotic relationship and/or even as a ``Chlorochromatium{''} aggregate
   with an endosymbiont relationship. This ecosystem model helps further
   explain the concurrence of similar amounts of 2,3,6- and 2,3,4-ALPs in
   the Jianghan Basin oils.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammation is a significant detriment to the engraftment of cells and
   tissues, particularly for islet transplantation, where a low tolerance
   for the inflammatory milieu results in significant graft loss. Local
   treatment with anti-inflammatories, such as glucocorticoids, provides
   the benefits of site-targeted delivery with minimization of the broad
   side effects associated with systemic delivery. Polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS) is a flexible platform that is capable of providing sustained
   delivery of hydrophobic drugs. Here, we evaluated the capacity of PDMS
   constructs loaded with the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid
   dexamethasone (Dex) to locally mitigate inflammation in islet grafts.
   Dex-PDMS constructs, fabricated in rod or disk geometries, demonstrated
   prolonged and sustained release at therapeutically relevant levels. In
   vitro, Dex-PDMS constructs inhibited endotoxin-induced human monocyte
   and macrophage activation, but they did not impair islet viability or
   function. Dex-PDMS rods, co-transplanted with islet-seeded scaffolds in
   a murine model, demonstrated suppression of host inflammatory responses
   during early- and late-phase engraftment, without significantly altering
   islet graft potency. The facile nature of these glucocorticoid-doped
   PDMS constructs allows for the optimization of targeted dose delivery
   with wide applicability in cell and tissue transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{This study performs a spatial stability analysis of several jets that
   have previously been investigated in terms of their noise radiation. The
   cases include a round jet and two chevron nozzle jets with varying
   penetration angle. The instability wave evolution in the near-nozzle
   region is examined to seek for clues as to how and why the mean flow
   azimuthal inhomogeneity introduced by chevrons modifies the
   low-frequency noise component. A biglobal stability analysis is
   performed to determine the most unstable modes on an initial plane. The
   downstream evolution of the most unstable modes is then computed via
   three-dimensional parabolized stability equations. The azimuthal mean
   flow inhomogeneity introduced by chevrons is found to modify instability
   wave growth rates and phase speeds. Findings indicate that the
   near-field hydrodynamic pressure oscillations of round jet instability
   modes are suppressed by chevron jets. For the same modal excitation
   amplitude at the inlet, the two chevron jets generate considerably lower
   pressure fluctuations than the round jet. It is also shown that the
   chevron jet with the lowest hydrodynamic pressure fluctuation levels is
   the jet with the lowest far-field low-frequency noise output among the
   three jets.}},

Title = {{Role of Polymer Architecture on the Activity of Polymer-Protein
   Conjugates for the Treatment of Accelerated Bone Loss Disorders}},
Journal = {{BIOMACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2374-2381}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Polymers of similar molecular weights and chemical constitution but
   varying in their macromolecular architectures were conjugated to
   osteoprotegerin (OPG) to determine the effect of polymer topology on
   protein activity in vitro and in vivo. OPG is a protein that inhibits
   bone resorption by preventing the formation of mature osteoclasts from
   the osteoclast precursor cell. Accelerated bone loss disorders, such as
   osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and metastatic bone disease, occur
   as a result of increased osteoclastogenesis, leading to the severe
   weakening of the bone. OPG has shown promise as a treatment in bone
   disorders; however, it is rapidly cleared from circulation through rapid
   liver uptake, and frequent, high doses of the protein are necessary to
   achieve a therapeutic benefit. We aimed to improve the effectiveness of
   OPG by creating OPG-polymer bioconjugates, employing reversible addition
   fragmentation chain transfer polymerization to create well-defined
   polymers with branching densities varying from linear, loosely branched
   to densely branched. Polymers with each of these architectures were
   conjugated to OPG using a ``grafting-to{''} approach, and the
   bioconjugates were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The OPG polymer bioconjugates showed
   retention of activity in vitro against osteoclasts, and each
   bioconjugate was shown to be nontoxic. Preliminary in vivo studies
   further supported the nontoxic characteristics of the bioconjugates, and
   measurement of the bone mineral density in rats 7 days post-treatment
   via peripheral quantitative computed tomography suggested a slight
   increase in bone mineral density after administration of the loosely
   branched OPG polymer bioconjugate.}},

Title = {{Dual drug delivery from vitamin E loaded contact lenses for glaucoma
   therapy}},

Abstract = {{Glaucoma patients frequently instill eye drops multiple times each day,
   which is a cause for reduced compliance. Additionally, eye drops suffer
   from other limitations including low bioavailability, which can lead to
   side effects. We propose to develop drug-eluting contact lenses for
   managing glaucoma with increased bioavailability and improved
   compliance.
   Contact lenses are developed for extended simultaneous release of
   timolol and dorzolamide, both of which are commonly prescribed
   hydrophilic drugs. The extended release is achieved by loading lenses
   with vitamin E barriers. In vitro release studies are performed with
   control and vitamin E loaded lenses for both drugs loaded separately and
   then together in the same lens. The safety and efficacy of combination
   therapy by contacts are demonstrated in a Beagle model of glaucoma.
   Simultaneous loading of timolol and dorzolamide increases the release
   duration of both drugs. Also vitamin E incorporation is highly effective
   in increasing the release durations of both drugs to about 2-days. The
   lenses loaded with both drugs exhibited superior IOP reduction compared
   to eye drops with about 6-fold lower drug loading. More importantly,
   combination therapy by continuous wear of vitamin E loaded contact for
   2-days, followed by a new set of contacts for another two days, reduced
   `OP during the 4 days of wear time and for another 8 days after removal
   of the contacts.
   Vitamin E loading is very effective for providing combination therapy by
   contact lenses due to the increase in release durations of several
   drugs. The contact lens based therapy reduces lOP with lower drug dose
   compared to eye drops and may significantly improve the compliance as
   the effect of the therapy lasts significantly longer than the
   wear-duration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of end-to-end network distances is essential to many
   service-oriented applications such as distributed content delivery and
   overlay network multicast, in which the clients have the flexibility to
   select their servers from among a set of available ones based on network
   distance. However, due to the high cost of global measurements in
   large-scale networks, it is infeasible to actively probe end-to-end
   network distances for all pairs. In order to address this issue, network
   distance prediction has been proposed by measuring a few pairs and then
   predicting the other ones without direct measurements, or splicing the
   path segments between each pair via observation. It is considered
   important to improve network performance, and enables service-oriented
   applications over large-scale networks. In this article, we first
   illustrate the basic ideas behind network distance prediction, and then
   categorize the current research work based on different criteria. We
   illustrate how different protocols work, and discuss their merits and
   drawbacks. Finally, we summarize our findings, and point out potential
   issues and future directions for further research.}},

Abstract = {{In order to explore the feasibility of prediction soluble solid contents

   features were discussed respectively. The prediction models were
   established by using partial least squares regression (PLSR), principal
   components regression (PCR) and least squares support vector machines
   (LS-SVM) algorithms. Besides, three different selected wavelengths
   algorithms such as successive projection (SPA) algorithms, intervals
   partial least squares (iPLS) algorithms and uninformation variables
   elimination (UVE) algorithm were analyzed after building partial least
   squares regression model. The results indicate that partial least
   squares regression model based on spectral features can be an steady
   model to predict SSC and the correlation coefficient (R-2) of

Abstract = {{Duplication of the genome in mammalian cells occurs in a defined
   temporal order referred to as its replication-timing (RT) program. RT
   changes dynamically during development, regulated in units of 400-800 kb
   referred to as replication domains (RDs). Changes in RT are generally
   coordinated with transcriptional competence and changes in subnuclear
   position. We generated genome-wide RT profiles for 26 distinct human
   cell types, including embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived, primary cells
   and established cell lines representing intermediate stages of endoderm,
   mesoderm, ectoderm, and neural crest (NC) development. We identified
   clusters of RDs that replicate at unique times in each stage (RT
   signatures) and confirmed global consolidation of the genome into larger
   synchronously replicating segments during differentiation. Surprisingly,
   transcriptome data revealed that the well-accepted correlation between
   early replication and transcriptional activity was restricted to
   RT-constitutive genes, whereas two-thirds of the genes that switched RT
   during differentiation were strongly expressed when late replicating in
   one or more cell types. Closer inspection revealed that transcription of
   this class of genes was frequently restricted to the lineage in which
   the RT switch occurred, but was induced prior to a late-to-early RT
   switch and/or down-regulated after an early-to-late RT switch. Analysis
   of transcriptional regulatory networks showed that this class of genes
   contains strong regulators of genes that were only expressed when early
   replicating. These results provide intriguing new insight into the
   complex relationship between transcription and RT regulation during
   human development.}},

Abstract = {{With the increased use of smart phones and mobile tablets, video
   encoding and streaming over wireless networks become a big concern.
   Real-time video service requires low end-to-end delay, which mainly
   consists of video encoding delay, queuing delay, and transmission delay.
   Previous works either assume video encoding delay to be constant or
   infinite and neglect it from end-to-end delay. However, encoding time
   has an effective impact on encoding rate (R) and distortion (D). Hence,
   the optimal R-D performance based on the assumption of infinite encoding
   time is neither accurate nor realistic. To achieve the optimal
   end-to-end performance under low delay constraint, we extend the
   traditional R-D model to a novel delay-rate-distortion (d-R-D) model,
   which quantifies the relationship among source coding time, rate, and
   distortion for IPPPP coding mode in H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC).
   On the other hand, a delay insensitive video communication application
   can afford hierarchical bidirectional prediction mode that introduces
   extra encoding delay than IPPPP mode in H.264/AVC, as it achieves higher
   encoding efficiency when delay is not a top priority. However, coding
   efficiency does not always increase with delay, and delay is not
   unlimited as well. How to maximize coding efficiency in hierarchical B
   mode with limited encoding time constraint is not a well-addressed
   problem. With the proposed d-R-D model, we can mathematically formulate
   this problem and provide a practical solution for the first time.}},

Abstract = {{We present a noninvasive method of photoacoustic tomography (PAT) for
   imaging cerebral hemodynamics in awake-moving rats. The wearable PAT
   (wPAT) system has a size of 15mm in height and 33mm in diameter, and a
   weight of similar to 8 g (excluding cabling). The wPAT achieved an
   imaging rate of 3.33 frames/s with a lateral resolution of 243 mu m.
   Animal experiments were designed to show wPAT feasibility for imaging
   cerebral hemodynamics on awake-moving animals. Results showed that the
   cerebral oxyhemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin changed significantly in
   response to hyperoxia; and, after the injection of pentylenetetrazol
   (PTZ), cerebral blood volume changed faster over time and larger in
   amplitude for rats in awake-moving state compared with rats under
   anesthesia. By providing a light-weight, high-resolution technology for
   in vivo monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics in awake-behaving animals,
   it will be possible to develop a comprehensive understanding on how
   activity alters hemodynamics in normal and diseased states.}},

Abstract = {{Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) elicits stomatal closure in many plant species.
   Stomatal closure is accompanied by large ion fluxes across the plasma
   membrane (PM). Here, we recorded the transmembrane ion fluxes of H+,
   Ca2+ and K+ in guard cells of wild-type (Col-0) Arabidopsis, the
   CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) mutant coi1-1 and the PM H+-ATPase
   mutants aha1-6 and aha1-7, using a non-invasive micro-test technique. We
   showed that MeJA induced transmembrane H+ efflux, Ca2+ influx and K+
   efflux across the PM of Col-0 guard cells. However, this ion transport
   was abolished in coi1-1 guard cells, suggesting that MeJA-induced
   transmembrane ion flux requires COI1. Furthermore, the H+ efflux and
   Ca2+ influx in Col-0 guard cells was impaired by vanadate pre-treatment
   or PM H+-ATPase mutation, suggesting that the rapid H+ efflux mediated
   by PM H+-ATPases could function upstream of the Ca2+ flux. After the
   rapid H+ efflux, the Col-0 guard cells had a longer oscillation period
   than before MeJA treatment, indicating that the activity of the PM
   H+-ATPase was reduced. Finally, the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+
   concentration and the depolarized PM drive the efflux of K+ from the
   cell, resulting in loss of turgor and closure of the stomata.
   Significance Statement Our findings provide insight into early signal
   transduction in guard cells in response to MeJA.}},

Title = {{An RFID-based inventory management framework for emergency relief

Abstract = {{In the aftermath of super storm Sandy, a large region from North
   Carolina to Maine endured food shortages, power outages, and long lines
   at gas stations forced to ration fuel due to low supply and high demand.
   These issues were largely the result of the affected transportation
   network's inability to effectively cope with random and highly dynamic
   changes, and a lack of available resources and suppliers who were
   capable of enacting adequate emergency response measures. These problems
   experienced during super storm Sandy further underscored the need for a
   robust emergency inventory management system, where planning policies
   can be integrated with real-time on-line inventory management strategies
   to keep track of fluctuations of vital commodities such as food, water,
   medicine, fuel and power supplies. Motivated by this important problem,
   this paper investigates a comprehensive feedback-based emergency
   management framework for disasters such as super storm Sandy that
   provides integration with an emerging intelligent transportation systems
   technology, namely Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID). Within
   this framework, the offline-planning problem is solved by the stochastic
   humanitarian inventory management approach; and the online modeling
   strategy includes the application of a continuous time model predictive
   control technique. After introducing the mathematical background, the
   proposed framework is discussed using case studies built based on super
   storm Sandy in order to understand the efficiency and practicality of
   this RFID-based methodology. Results suggest that the methodology can
   properly account for and react to the rapidly changing needs for vital
   supplies that occur during the emergency relief operations. Based on
   this approach, planners and decision makers can be aware of the time
   delay that can happen due to disaster-related disruptions and thus
   maintain a safe level of buffer for vital supplies. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Soil and sediments adjacent to roadways often contain elevated
   concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The sources
   of these PAH compounds include atmospheric deposition from automobile
   emissions and abraded bituminous asphalt particles from paved roads.
   Research was conducted to evaluate the relative contribution of each
   source on PAH concentrations in roadway-impacted soil and sediments by
   examining size fractionation and associated PAH content in roadway and
   stormwater system residuals. Analysis of five fractions (< 75, 75-150,
   150-212, 212-425 and > 425 mu m) of roadway and storm system residuals
   yielded varied results among the samples. The total PAH concentrations
   in the fractions ranged from 45 to 24,800 mu g/kg with PAHs being most
   often encountered in the fine (< 75 mu m) and medium coarse (75-150 and
   150-212 mu m) fractions. The total PAH concentrations in the < 75,
   75-150, 150-212, 212-425 and > 425 mu m size fractions were 1070-21,100,
   609-24,800, 185-22,500, 110-16,900, and 45-7730 mu g/kg, respectively.
   The highest concentration of individual PAH detected in the size
   fractions was benzo(g,h,i)perylene (6050 mu g/kg) in one catch basin
   sediment sample. Although abraded asphalt particles from roadways were
   likely a source of PAHs in the coarse fractions, the predominance of PAH
   in the fine or median coarse size fractions suggests that other pathways
   such as atmospheric deposition from vehicle emissions are the major
   contributor. Additionally, calculated ratios between selected PAH
   analogs with molecular masses 178, 202, 228 and 276 also support the
   inference that atmospheric deposition from combustion is a major source
   of PAHs.}},

Abstract = {{An all-digital programmable and reconfigurable stochastic
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is presented in this work. This ADC
   directly benefits from scaling by using only digital gates and relying
   on an increased mismatch between minimum-sized transistors. The
   programmability and reconfigurability are achieved by dividing the
   design into eight channels. The mean of each channel is set
   independently using a digitally generated analog reference voltage with
   a 10-bit control word. The output of each channel is linearized using
   Gaussian linear interpolation. The entire ADC is written in Verilog and
   synthesized into digital standard cells using regular digital design
   tools. Fabricated in a 130-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
   process, the ADC covers signal-to-noise and distortion ratio from 28 to
   34.9 dB with a programmable differential input range of 400-800 mVpp at
   140 MS/s and 0.7-V supply.}},

   (0.87m) when compared with the grain size of conventionally processed
   samples (0.30m) at the same temperature. Microwave processing led to
   significant enhancement of the conductivity when compared with
   conventional processing for all crystallization temperatures
   investigated. The highest total conductivity achieved was of glass

Abstract = {{An approximate online equilibrium solution is developed for an N-player
   nonzero-sum game subject to continuous-time nonlinear unknown dynamics
   and an infinite horizon quadratic cost. A novel actor-critic-identifier
   structure is used, wherein a robust dynamic neural network is used to
   asymptotically identify the uncertain system with additive disturbances,
   and a set of critic and actor NNs are used to approximate the value
   functions and equilibrium policies, respectively. The weight update laws
   for the actor neural networks (NNs) are generated using a
   gradient-descent method, and the critic NNs are generated by least
   square regression, which are both based on the modified Bellman error
   that is independent of the system dynamics. A Lyapunov-based stability
   analysis shows that uniformly ultimately bounded tracking is achieved,
   and a convergence analysis demonstrates that the approximate control
   policies converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solutions. The actor,
   critic, and identifier structures are implemented in real time
   continuously and simultaneously. Simulations on two and three player
   games illustrate the performance of the developed method.}},

Abstract = {{Ensuring high data availability is a vital prerogative for Content
   Delivery Networks (CDN), and as we look to deploy CDN mechanisms onto
   mobile platforms, this imperative becomes ever more challenging. In
   traditional CDNs, replication ensures high availability of data, with
   server-loads and content-popularity often used as parameters to tightly
   control the process. However, the highly transient properties of such
   wireless and mobile devices constitute a major hurdle for any
   replication algorithm, rendering most simplified methods inadequate. Our
   contribution begins with a unique message-pulsing mechanism operating
   within a wireless cluster, that detects devices and ascertains their
   reliability. Results show the viability of our pulsing algorithm in
   determining a base replication level. Next, a Markovian queueing model
   is introduced, allowing us to induce replication based on the required
   speed of service. This affords finer control over the replication
   process, creating a more effective replication strategy suited for
   mobile-based CDNs. Extensive analysis of the model were performed, with
   parameters derived from real-world conditions. Results indicate that the
   model is able to compute logical values for the expected waiting times
   in service and thus, control the speed of replication within the CDN.}},

Title = {{Spillover of Secondary Foundation Species Transforms Community Structure

Abstract = {{Secondary foundation species facilitate biodiversity by providing
   complex habitat within the protective structures of many primary
   foundation species; whether they retain this role when they are
   dispersed in novel environments is unclear. Here, we explore how
   secondary foundation species' density within hosts controls the rate at
   which individuals accrue and test if dislodged secondary foundation
   species then bolster the abundance and diversity of associated species
   and decomposition in a widespread system: southern live oaks, Quercus
   virginiana, hosting festoons of the bromeliad, Tillandsia usneoides, in
   southeastern US savannas. One year of monitoring showed that as
   Tillandsia density within oaks increases, Tillandsia deposition beneath
   oaks increases linearly in kind. Once on the ground, two manipulative
   experiments revealed that: on small scales, individual festoons retain
   moisture, reduce temperature, and facilitate invertebrates and fungi
   which combine to accelerate litter decomposition and, on larger scales,
   continual deposition of festoons dramatically reduces grass cover and
   increases litter layer depth, invertebrate and fungi richness and
   density, and decomposition. Surveys further suggest that Tillandsia
   populations within oaks, in moderating festoon accumulation, are shaping
   understory communities throughout this geographic region. Thus,
   disturbance-induced spillover enables secondary foundation species to
   define biodiversity and ecosystem functioning beyond the boundaries of
   their hosts.}},

   Problems with Limited Duration}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, as a result of the increase in environmental problems,
   green logistics has become a focus of interest by researchers,
   governments, policy makers, and investors. In this study, a cumulative
   multi-trip vehicle routing problem with limited duration (CumMTVRP-LD)
   is modelled by taking into account the reduction of CO (2) emissions. In
   classical vehicle routing problems (VRP), each vehicle can perform only
   one trip. Because of the high investment costs of additional vehicles,
   organizations allow the vehicles to perform multiple trips as in
   multi-trip vehicle routing problems (MTVRP), which reflects the real
   requirements better than the classical VRP. This study contributes to
   the literature by using a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation
   and a simulated annealing (SA) based solution methodology for
   CumMTVRP-LD, which considers the minimization of fuel consumption as the
   objective function. According to preliminary computational results using
   benchmark problems in the literature, the proposed methodology obtained
   promising results in terms of solution quality and computational time.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a directed network in which each arc can fail with some
   specified probability. An entity arrives on this network at a designated
   origin node and traverses the network in a random-walk fashion until it
   either terminates at a destination node, or until an arc fails while
   being traversed. We study the problem of assessing the probability that
   the random walk reaches the destination node, which we call the survival
   probability of the network. Complicating our analysis is the assumption
   that certain arcs have memory, in the sense that after a memory arc is
   successfully traversed, it cannot fail on any subsequent traversal
   during the walk. We prove that this problem is \#P-hard, provide methods
   for obtaining lower and upper bounds on the survival probability, and
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounding methods on randomly
   generated networks. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol.

   effective MSWI ash reuse policy in the United States}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{304-312}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) in the United States generates
   a significant amount (similar to 6.6 million mtons) of ash annually, yet
   the utilization of this ash in beneficial use applications is nearly
   non-existent. In some European and Asian nations, policy regulates the
   use of MSWI bottom ash in construction with an accepted degree of
   environmental and human health risk. Both federal and state-level solid
   waste policy in the United States largely does not address ash reuse.
   U.S. MSWI industry practices have been adapted to avoid hazardous waste
   generation and primarily practice ash disposal in monofills. Numerous
   case studies and laboratory experiments have characterized MSWI ashes
   with regard to the potential environmental contaminants and have
   demonstrated the efficacy of bottom ash in specific reuse scenarios. In
   reviewing these studies, and by analyzing the reuse policy in several
   nations, the authors identify key aspects of effective MSWI ash reuse.
   These are discussed within the framework of available data and
   information, and examples are provided. Moving toward the sustainable
   management of resources such as MSWI bottom ash will require U.S.
   state-level policy to address the conditions under which ashes may or
   may not be reused. Suggestions on practices (often already occurring in
   many other areas of the world) to facilitate the reuse of MSWI ashes are
   provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Life cycle comparison of centralized wastewater treatment and urine
   source separation with struvite precipitation: Focus on urine nutrient
   management}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{88-103}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Alternative approaches to wastewater management including urine source
   separation have the potential to simultaneously improve multiple aspects
   of wastewater treatment, including reduced use of potable water for
   waste conveyance and improved contaminant removal, especially nutrients.
   In order to pursue such radical changes, system-level evaluations of
   urine source separation in community contexts are required. The focus of
   this life cycle assessment (LCA) is managing nutrients from urine
   produced in a residential setting with urine source separation and
   struvite precipitation, as compared with a centralized wastewater
   treatment approach. The life cycle impacts evaluated in this study
   pertain to construction of the urine source separation system and
   operation of drinking water treatment, decentralized urine treatment,
   and centralized wastewater treatment. System boundaries include
   fertilizer offsets resulting from the production of urine based struvite
   fertilizer. As calculated by the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment
   of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), urine source
   separation with MgO addition for subsequent struvite precipitation with
   high P recovery (Scenario B) has the smallest environmental cost
   relative to existing centralized wastewater treatment (Scenario A) and
   urine source separation with MgO and Na3PO4 addition for subsequent
   struvite precipitation with concurrent high P and N recovery (Scenario
   C). Preliminary economic evaluations show that the three urine
   management scenarios are relatively equal on a monetary basis (<13\%
   difference). The impacts of each urine management scenario are most
   sensitive to the assumed urine composition, the selected urine storage
   time, and the assumed electricity required to treat influent urine and
   toilet water used to convey urine at the centralized wastewater
   treatment plant. The importance of full nutrient recovery from urine in
   combination with the substantial chemical inputs required for N recovery
   via struvite precipitation indicate the need for alternative methods of
   N recovery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic conductor-free FeF2 films deposited by pulsed laser
   deposition (PLD) were studied as potential cathode materials for Li-ion
   batteries. The correlation between microstructural evolution and
   electrochemical cycling of PLD FeF2 films was investigated.
   Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (X-TEM) of the films
   indicates that they are composed of particles varying in size between 10
   and 50 nm. 20-50 nm particles were initially deposited on the sample
   substrate and were not cycled, irrespective of film thickness and
   applied C-rate; 10 nm particles were cycled at low C-rates.
   Cross-sectional TEM of delithiated films shows that the reconversion
   process starts from the bottom to the top of the film by forming FeF2 on
   the 20-50 nm FeF2 particles. Galvanostatic measurements show that
   thinner FeF2 films have higher capacities and expansion percentages than
   thick films, but the measured capacity of these films is still less than
   the theoretical capacity. These results suggest that the cycling
   performance of PLD FeF2 is limited by electron transport and that the

Title = {{Assessing uncertainty in soil organic carbon modeling across a highly
   heterogeneous landscape}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{251}},
Pages = {{105-116}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{To understand if soil carbon acts as a sink or source in the global
   carbon cycle it is not only important to make reliable estimates, but
   also determine upper and lower prediction bounds through uncertainty
   analysis that represent best and worst case conditions. In this study,
   the Bayesian geostatistics was applied to assess the uncertainty
   associated with the predictive models of SOC (top soils) in a large
   region - Florida, USA. Results showed that the Bayesian estimates of
   model parameters were comparable to the conventional geostatistical
   methods especially the restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The
   Bayesian prediction uncertainty assessment was encouragingly accurate
   based on the validation of 50 and 95\% prediction intervals with the
   validation dataset. Generally, the width of prediction intervals
   increased with the posterior mean SOC predictions - large prediction
   intervals were found in the Everglades Agricultural Area (Histosols) and
   the wetland areas in the Suwannee River Basin. The Bayesian constant
   mean model (high model inadequacy) had marked prediction uncertainty
   which was reduced by accounting for the effects of environmental
   covariates in the Bayesian linear trend model (low model inadequacy),
   indicating that model inadequacy had a negative impact on prediction
   uncertainty. Analyses of factors impacting SOC prediction uncertainty
   suggest that effects that explained more of the SOC variance contributed
   more uncertainty to the SOC prediction. These findings are critical to
   quantify SOC stocks in the southeastern USA where a heterogeneous mosaic
   of high and low carbon in soils occurs ranging from 0.45 to 34.15 kg
   m(-2). Although this study considers only the topsoil, the results are
   valuable for global carbon cycling research. The uncertainty of SOC
   predictions not only enables identification of ``hot{''} and ``cold{''}
   spots in a landscape to mitigate and adapt to global climate change, but
   also informs scenario assessment to imagine possible carbon- rich,
   -neutral, and -poor futures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Functional Roles of Neural Preparatory Processes in a Cued Stroop Task
   Revealed by Linking Electrophysiology with Behavioral Performance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that cuing facilitates behavioral performance and
   that different aspects of instructional cues evoke specific neural
   preparatory processes in cued task-switching paradigms. To deduce the
   functional role of these neural preparatory processes the majority of
   studies vary aspects of the experimental paradigm and describe how these
   variations alter markers of neural preparatory processes. Although these
   studies provide important insights, they also have notable limitations,
   particularly in terms of understanding the causal or functional
   relationship of neural markers to cognitive and behavioral processes. In
   this study, we sought to address these limitations and uncover the
   functional roles of neural processes by examining how variability in the
   amplitude of neural preparatory processes predicts behavioral
   performance to subsequent stimuli. To achieve this objective 16 young
   adults were recruited to perform a cued Stroop task while their brain
   activity was measured using high-density electroencephalography. Four
   temporally overlapping but functionally and topographically distinct
   cue-triggered event related potentials (ERPs) were identified: 1) A
   left-frontotemporal negativity (250-700 ms) that was positively
   associated with word-reading performance; 2) a midline-frontal
   negativity (450-800 ms) that was positively associated with color-naming
   and incongruent performance; 3) a left-frontal negativity (450-800 ms)
   that was positively associated with switch trial performance; and 4) a
   centroparietal positivity (450-800 ms) that was positively associated
   with performance for almost all trial types. These results suggest that
   at least four dissociable cognitive processes are evoked by
   instructional cues in the present task, including: 1) domain-specific
   task facilitation; 2) switch-specific task-set reconfiguration; 3)
   preparation for response conflict; and 4) proactive attentional control.
   Examining the relationship between ERPs and behavioral performance
   provides a functional link between neural markers and the cognitive
   processes they index.}},

Abstract = {{An acoustic camera comprising a linear microphone array is used to image
   the thunder signature of triggered lightning. Measurements were taken at
   the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing in Camp
   Blanding, FL, during the summer of 2014. The array was positioned in an
   end-fire orientation thus enabling the peak acoustic reception pattern
   to be steered vertically with a frequency-dependent spatial resolution.
   On 14 July 2014, a lightning event with nine return strokes was
   successfully triggered. We present the first acoustic images of
   individual return strokes at high frequencies (>1kHz) and compare the
   acoustically inferred profile with optical images. We find (i) a strong
   correlation between the return stroke peak current and the radiated
   acoustic pressure and (ii) an acoustic signature from an M component
   current pulse with an unusual fast rise time. These results show that
   acoustic imaging enables clear identification and quantification of
   thunder sources as a function of lightning channel altitude.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed video and electric field records of 43 first and 7
   new-ground-termination subsequent strokes in negative lightning flashes,
   obtained at the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville, Florida, were
   examined. Eighteen (36\%) of these strokes exhibited faintly luminous
   formations (FLFs) below the downward leader tip just prior to the return
   stroke. All the 18 FLFs were connected to the strike object on the
   ground, with 14 of them being also in contact with the downward leader
   tip. For 11 located events showing FLFs in contact with the downward
   leader tip, the FLF 2-D length ranged from 51 to 200m and the time
   interval between the end of exposure of the FLF frame and the return
   stroke onset ranged from 42 to 106s. We inferred that the FLFs mostly
   consisted of relatively low conductivity streamers, based on the
   following observations and estimates. (a) The rates at which the 11 FLFs
   were replaced by channels capable of guiding return stroke waves ranged
   from 0.7x10(6)m/s to 2.2x10(6)m/s, which is comparable to leader speeds
   in virgin air (in the same records). (b) The overwhelming majority of
   downward leaders continued stepping while being connected to ground via
   FLFs. (c) The average electric field along FLFs is 1 to 2 orders of
   magnitude higher than expected for hot, leader-like channels. Since in
   all cases the FLF determined the strike point, we conclude that its
   inferred initiation up to a few hundreds of microseconds before the
   return stroke onset signified the beginning of the lightning attachment
   process.}},

   Also, the lenticular Han phase was observed in the aged 3-5\% Al alloys
   in accordance with previous studies in literature performed at a similar
   aging temperature. Though no transformation was detected after DSC
   cycling down to -60 degrees C for the aged 4\% and 5\% Al alloys,
   mechanical testing confirmed pseudoelasticity. Additionally, TEM and
   atom probe analysis confirmed that aging at 600 degrees C resulted in
   precipitation of the Ni2TiAl Heusler phase and determined the Al
   solubility limit in the matrix as near 3 at.\%. Lastly, precipitation
   strengthening by the Heusler phase was observed when comparing the

Abstract = {{The kinetics of CO2 reduction over nonstoichimetric ceria, CeO2-d, a
   material of high potential for thermochemical conversion of sunlight to
   fuel, has been investigated for a wide range of nonstoichiometries (0.02
   <= delta <= 0.25), temperatures (693 <= T <= 1273 K), and CO2
   concentrations (0.005 = p(CO2) = 0.4 atm). Samples were reduced
   thermally at 1773 K to probe low nonstoichiometries (d < 0.05) and
   chemically at lower temperatures in a H-2 atmosphere to prevent particle
   sintering and probe the effect of higher nonstoichiometries (d < 0.25).
   For extents greater than delta = 0.2, oxidation rates at a given
   nonstoichiometry are hindered for the duration of the reaction,
   presumably because of near-order changes, such as lattice compression,
   as confirmed via Raman Spectroscopy. Importantly, this behavior is
   reversible and oxidation rates are not affected at lower delta.
   Following thermal reduction at very low d, however, oxidation rates are
   an order of magnitude slower than those of chemically reduced samples,
   and rates monotonically increase with the initial nonstoichiometry (up
   to delta = 0.05). This dependence may be attributed to the formation of
   stable defect complexes formed between oxygen vacancies and polarons.
   When the same experiments are performed with 10 mol \% Gd3+ doped ceria,
   in which defect complexes are less prevalent than in pure ceria, this
   dependence is not observed.}},

Title = {{Orbital engineering of two-dimensional materials with hydrogenation: A
   realization of giant gap and strongly correlated topological insulators}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{Orbital interaction plays an important role in topological insulators.
   Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that hydrogenation
   can change two-dimensional (2D) trivial insulator/semimetal-like Pb, Mo,
   and W to a Z(2) topological insulator with giant gaps by filtering
   unwanted orbitals such as the p(z) orbital in Pb, and the d(3z2-r2) in
   Mo andW. For PbH, the large intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) confined
   in the in-plane orbitals p(x,y) results in a bulk gap of 1.07 eV. For
   the case of MoH andWH, hydrogenation results in a novel sd(4)
   hybridization with a Dirac cone formed by the out-of-plane orbital
   d(yz/xz) orbitals. Furthermore, due to the electron-electron interaction
   and the strong SOC in the 4d and 5d elements, the bulk band gap is
   significantly enhanced with a value of 1.28 eV for MoH and 0.30 eV for
   WH. The strong correlation effect also induces several topological phase
   transitions in WH like the Dirac semimetal and Mott insulating phase,
   while MoH remains a topological insulator even with large correlation
   effect. We propose that these new strongly correlated 2D materials can
   be realized experimentally by using substrate such as the boron nitride
   sheet, which can exhibit various novel properties such as the Dirac
   semimetal phase with large spin-orbit energy splitting as well as the
   quantum spin Hall property.}},

Title = {{Foundation species' overlap enhances biodiversity and multifunctionality
   from the patch to landscape scale in southeastern United States salt
   marshes}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{282}},

Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Although there is mounting evidence that biodiversity is an important
   and widespread driver of ecosystem multifunctionality, much of this
   research has focused on small-scale biodiversity manipulations. Hence,
   which mechanisms maintain patches of enhanced biodiversity in natural
   systems and if these patches elevate ecosystem multifunctionality at
   both local and landscape scales remain outstanding questions. In a 17
   month experiment conducted within southeastern United States salt
   marshes, we found that patches of enhanced biodiversity and
   multifunctionality arise only where habitat-forming foundation species
   overlap-i.e. where aggregations of ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa)
   form around cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) stems. By empirically
   scaling up our experimental results to the marsh platform at 12 sites,
   we further show that mussels-despite covering only approximately 1\% of
   the marsh surface-strongly enhance five distinct ecosystem functions,
   including decomposition, primary production and water infiltration rate,
   at the landscape scale. Thus, mussels create conditions that support the
   co-occurrence of high densities of functionally distinct organisms
   within cordgrass and, in doing so, elevate salt marsh multifunctionality
   from the patch to landscape scale. Collectively, these findings suggest
   that patterns in foundation species' overlap drive variation in
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning within and across natural
   ecosystems. We therefore argue that foundation species should be
   integrated in our conceptual understanding of forces that moderate
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, approaches for
   conserving species diversity and strategies to improve the
   multifunctionality of degraded ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires have recently been
   utilized as an interphase to increase the interfacial strength of carbon
   fiber Composites. It was shown that the interaction between the carbon
   fiber and the ZnO nanowires was a critical parameter in adhesion;
   however, fiber based testing techniques are dominated by local defects
   and cannot be used to effectively study the bonding interaction
   directly. Here, the strength of the interface between ZnO and graphitic
   carbon is directly measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM) using
   oxygen plasma treated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and an
   AFM tip coated with ZnO nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   analysis is used to compare the surface chemistry of HOPG and carbon
   fiber and to quantify the presence of various oxygen functional groups.
   An indirect measurement of the interfacial strength is then performed
   through single fiber fragmentation testing (SFF) on functionalized
   carbon fibers coated with ZnO nanowires to validate the AFM
   measurements. The SFF and AFM methods showed the same correlation,
   demonstrating the capacity Of the AFM method to study the interfacial
   properties in composite materials. Additionally, the chemical
   interactions between oxygen functional groups and the ionic structure of
   ZnO suggest that intermolecular forces at the interface are responsible
   for the strong interface.}},

Abstract = {{Epitaxial Ba2FeMoO6 thin films were grown via pulsed laser deposition
   under low oxygen pressure and their structural, chemical, and magnetic
   properties were examined, focusing on the effects of oxygen pressure.
   The chemical disorder, off-stoichiometry in B site cations (Fe and Mo)
   increased with increasing oxygen pressure and thus magnetic properties
   were degraded. Interestingly, in contrast, negative magneto-resistance,
   which is the characteristics of this double perovskite material, was
   enhanced with increasing oxygen pressure. It is believed that phase
   segregation of highly disordered thin films is responsible for the
   increased magneto-resistance of thin films grown at high oxygen
   pressure. The anomalous Hall effect, which behaves hole-like, was also
   observed due to spin-polarized itinerant electrons under low magnetic
   field below 1 T and the ordinary electron-like Hall effect was dominant
   at higher magnetic fields. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and testing of VirtualDose-a
   software for reporting organ doses for adult and pediatric patients who
   undergo x-ray computed tomography (CT) examinations. The software is
   based on a comprehensive database of organ doses derived from Monte
   Carlo (MC) simulations involving a library of 25 anatomically realistic
   phantoms that represent patients of different ages, body sizes, body
   masses, and pregnant stages. Models of GE Lightspeed Pro 16 and Siemens
   SOMATOM Sensation 16 scanners were carefully validated for use in MC
   dose calculations. The software framework is designed with the `software
   as a service (SaaS)' delivery concept under which multiple clients can
   access the web-based interface simultaneously from any computer without
   having to install software locally. The RESTful web service API also
   allows a third-party picture archiving and communication system software
   package to seamlessly integrate with VirtualDose's functions. Software
   testing showed that VirtualDose was compatible with numerous operating
   systems including Windows, Linux, Apple OS X, and mobile and portable
   devices. The organ doses from VirtualDose were compared against those
   reported by CT-Expo and ImPACT-two dosimetry tools that were based on
   the stylized pediatric and adult patient models that were known to be
   anatomically simple. The organ doses reported by VirtualDose differed
   from those reported by CT-Expo and ImPACT by as much as 300\% in some of
   the patient models. These results confirm the conclusion from past
   studies that differences in anatomical realism offered by stylized and
   voxel phantoms have caused significant discrepancies in CT dose
   estimations.}},

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet (UV) light has the potential to cause many adverse effects
   on the body including causing the cancers melanoma and squamous cell
   carcinoma. The use of sunscreens to protect against these harmful
   effects has become common practice. However, many of the sunscreens
   currently being used have the ability to cross the skin barrier and
   enter the body. These components can produce reactive oxygen species
   inside the body which can cause damage to cells. We have developed a
   sunscreen product that contains organic particles that are too large to
   diffuse into the skin. These particles are formed from four FDA approved
   UV blocking molecules that are solids at room temperature. The
   components are first mixed together, melted, and then emulsified in
   water and allowed to cool. Once cooled, the particles slowly crystallize
   in the solution forming sphere to rod-like particles about one micron
   wide and one to tens of microns in length. SPF measurements of the
   samples showed comparable results to two commercially available
   sunscreens with SPFs of 50. The particles were shown to maintain their
   excellent UV blocking properties after exposure to UV light and show
   great promise as possible sunscreens. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{145}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Partial least squares (PLS) regression has achieved desirable
   performance for modeling the relationship between a set of dependent
   (response) variables with another set of independent (predictor)
   variables, especially when the sample size is small relative to the
   dimension of these variables. In each iteration, PLS finds two latent
   variables from a set of dependent and independent variables via
   maximizing the product of three factors: variances of the two latent
   variables as well as the square of the correlation between these two
   latent variables. In this paper, we derived the mathematical formulation
   of the relationship between mean square error (MSE) and these three
   factors. We find that MSE is not monotonous with the product of the
   three factors. However, the corresponding optimization problem is
   difficult to solve if we extract the optimal latent variables directly
   based on this relationship. To address these problems, a novel
   multilinear regression model-variance constrained partial least squares
   (VCPLS) is proposed. In the proposed VCPLS, we find the latent variables
   via maximizing the product of the variance of latent variable from
   dependent variables and the square of the correlation between the two
   latent variables, while constraining the variance of the latent variable
   from independent variables must be larger than a predetermined
   threshold. The corresponding optimization problem can be solved
   computational efficiently, and the latent variables extracted by VCPLS
   are near-optimal. Compared with classical PLS and it is variants, VCPLS
   can achieve lower prediction error in the sense of MSE. The experiments
   are conducted on three near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) data sets. To
   demonstrate the applicability of our proposed VCPLS, we also conducted
   experiments on another data set, which has different characteristics
   from NIR data. Experimental results verified the superiority of our
   proposed VCPLS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Precise motor control requires the ability to scale the parameters of
   movement. Theta oscillations across the cortex have been associated with
   changes in memory, attention, and sensorimotor processing. What has
   proven more elusive is pinpointing the region-specific frequency band
   oscillations that are associated with specific parameters of movement
   during the acceleration and deceleration phases. We report a study using
   3D analytic techniques for high density electroencephalography that
   examines electrocortical dynamics while participants produce upper limb
   movements to different distances at varying rates. During fast ballistic
   movements, we observed increased theta band activity in the left motor
   area contralateral to the moving limb during the acceleration phase of
   the movement, and theta power correlated with the acceleration of
   movement. In contrast, beta band activity scaled with the type of
   movement during the deceleration phase near the end of the movement and
   correlated with movement time. In the ipsilateral motor and
   somatosensory area, alpha band activity decreased with the type of
   movement near the end of the movement, and gamma band activity in visual
   cortex increased with the type of movement near the end of the movement.
   Our results suggest that humans use distinct lateralized cortical
   activity for distance and speed dependent arm movements. We provide new
   evidence that a temporary increase in theta band power relates to
   movement acceleration and is important during movement execution.
   Further, the theta power increase is coupled with desychronization of
   beta band power and alpha band power which are modulated by the task
   near the end of movement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An in vitro method to manipulate the direction and functional strength
   between neural populations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{We report the design and application of a Micro Electro Mechanical
   Systems (MEMs) device that permits investigators to create arbitrary
   network topologies. With this device investigators can manipulate the
   degree of functional connectivity among distinct neural populations by
   systematically altering their geometric connectivity in vitro. Each
   polydimethylsilxane (PIDMS) device was cast from molds and consisted of
   two wells each containing a small neural population of dissociated rat
   cortical neurons. Wells were separated by a series of parallel
   micrometer scale tunnels that permitted passage of axonal processes but
   not somata; with the device placed over an 8 x 8 microelectrode array,
   action potentials from somata in wells and axons in microtunnels can be
   recorded and stimulated. In our earlier report we showed that a one week
   delay in plating of neurons from one well to the other led to a filling
   and blocking of the microtunnels by axons from the older well resulting
   in strong directionality (older to younger) of both axon action
   potentials in tunnels and longer duration and more slowly propagating
   bursts of action potentials between wells. Here we show that changing
   the number of tunnels, and hence the number of axons, connecting the two
   wells leads to changes in connectivity and propagation of bursting
   activity. More specifically, the greater the number of tunnels the
   stronger the connectivity, the greater the probability of bursting
   propagating between wells, and shorter peak-to-peak delays between
   bursts and time to first spike measured in the opposing well. We
   estimate that a minimum of 100 axons are needed to reliably initiate a
   burst in the opposing well. This device provides a tool for researchers
   interested in understanding network dynamics who will profit from having
   the ability to design both the degree and directionality connectivity
   among multiple small neural populations.}},

Abstract = {{A new paradigm in oncology establishes a spectrum of tumorigenic
   potential across the heterogeneous phenotypes within a tumor. The cancer
   stem cell hypothesis postulates that a minute fraction of cells within a
   tumor, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), have a tumor-initiating capacity
   that propels tumor growth. An application of this discovery is to target
   this critical cell population using chemotherapy; however, the process
   of isolating these cells is arduous, and the rarity of CSCs makes it
   difficult to test potential drug candidates in a robust fashion,
   particularly for individual patients. To address the challenge of
   screening drug libraries on patient-derived populations of rare cells,
   such as CSCs, we have developed a drug-eluting microarray, a
   miniaturized platform onto which a minimal quantity of cells can adhere
   and be exposed to unique treatment conditions. Hundreds of drug-loaded
   polymer islands acting as drug depots colocalized with adherent cells
   are surrounded by a nonfouling background, creating isolated culture
   environments on a solid substrate. Significant results can be obtained
   by testing <6\% of the cells required for a typical 96-well plate.
   Reliability was demonstrated by an average coefficient of variation of
   14\% between all of the microarrays and 13\% between identical
   conditions within a single microarray. Using the drug-eluting array,
   colorectal CSCs isolated from two patients exhibited unique responses to
   drug combinations when cultured on the drug-eluting microarray,
   highlighting the potential as a prognostic tool to identify personalized
   chemotherapeutic regimens targeting CSCs.}},

Abstract = {{Successful implementation of solar thermochemical metal oxide water
   splitting cycles is dependent upon the ability to reach low partial
   pressures of oxygen during the thermal reduction step. Low partial
   pressures of oxygen are required to provide a thermodynamic driving
   potential for the thermal reduction reaction and avoidance of
   recombination. Achieving low partial pressures of oxygen (e.g., <10(-2)
   may require a nontrivial energy input to the solar-to-fuel conversion
   process, negatively impacting the solar to fuel energy conversion
   efficiency. Three different strategies to reduce the partial pressure
   associated with oxygen generated during an iron oxide thermal reduction
   process were investigated using an open system thermodynamic analysis.
   These strategies include vacuum pumping, purging with an inert gas, and
   purging with steam. If the difficult to achieve solid-phase heat
   recuperation is neglected, open-system thermodynamic simulations show
   that vacuum pumping will have over twice the overall cycle energetic and
   exergetic efficiencies than those of inert purging; assuming oxygen
   separation is required every cycle in the case of inert or steam
   purging. To demonstrate the concept of vacuum pumping, thermal reduction
   of an iron zirconia bed in a tubular reactor was performed at low
   pressures of approximately 10(-4) bar at a temperature of 1450 degrees
   C. The maximum extent of reduction (14.2 +/- 1.7 mol \%) was reached
   after approximately 1 h of reduction at 1450 degrees C, while the
   predicted theoretical extent of reduction ranges from 16.5 mol \% at
   10(-2) bar to 76.9 mol \% at 10(-4) bar. In the present analysis,
   reaction kinetics are not considered, and its application is limited to
   the thermodynamically driven processes.}},

Title = {{Combined Experimental and Computational Methods Reveal the Evolution of
   Buried Interfaces during Synthesis of Ferroelectric Thin Films}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Understanding interfaces between dissimilar materials is crucial to the
   development of modern technologies, for example,
   semiconductor-dielectric and thermoelectric-semiconductor interfaces in
   emerging electronic devices. However, the structural characterization of
   buried interfaces is challenging because many measurement techniques are
   surface sensitive by design. When interested in interface evolution
   during synthesis, the experimental challenges multiply and often
   necessitate in situ techniques. For solution-derived lead zirconate
   titanate (PZT) ferroelectric thin films, the evolution of buried
   interfaces during synthesis (including dielectric-metal and metal-metal)
   is thought to dramatically influence the resultant dielectric and
   ferroelectric properties. In the present work, multiple experimental and
   computational methods are combined to characterize interface evolution
   during synthesis of ferroelectric PZT films on platinized Si
   wafers-including in situ X-ray diffraction during thermal treatment,
   aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy of
   samples quenched from various synthesis states, and calculations using
   density functional theory. Substantial interactions at buried interfaces
   in the PZT/Pt/Ti/SiOx/Si heterostructure are observed and discussed
   relative to their role(s) in the synthesis process. The results prove
   that perovskite PZT nucleates directly from the platinum (111)-oriented
   bottom electrode and reveal the roles of Pb and O diffusion and
   intermetallic Pt3Pb and Pt3Ti phases.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a model including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) effect on
   high-temperature water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) performance was built
   using coal-derived syngas as feedstock. Based on this model, it was
   found that the H2S coverage rate increases with the decrease in reaction
   temperature, leading to more significant carbon monoxide (CO) conversion
   reduction at low reaction temperature. It was also found that the H2S
   effect can be ignored when the reaction temperature is in the range at
   which reverse WGSR occurs. In such a temperature range, CO conversion
   for both with and without the H2S effect approaches equilibrium result.
   Through parametric studies using this model, it was found that CO
   conversion depends significantly on the residence time which can be
   adjusted by varying the flow rate, steam to carbon molar ratio, inlet
   pressure of syngas and reactor size. For syngas with fixed CO/H-2 molar
   ratio, CO conversion was found to decrease with the increase in carbon
   dioxide (CO2) content. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Abstract = {{A systematic method for the steady-state modeling of mass transport
   phenomena and electrochemical behavior focusing on the cathode side of a
   direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with an open-cathode design is
   presented and demonstrated using an experimental system. The
   architecture features an internal water-recovery technology that
   promotes back-convection of water from the cathode to the anode through
   a polymer electrolyte permeable membrane that includes laser-drilled
   holes. Eight adjustable modeling parameters are estimated from
   experimental data from a prototype system, and a model validation study
   shows that predictions of water venting rates and of cell voltage have
   errors better than 9\% when extrapolating to conditions not used for
   parameter estimation. Illustrations of the use of the model include an
   analysis of performance at various flow rates of feed air, operating
   temperatures and currents, and a prediction of the effect of alternative
   material designs for selected cell layers. The approach serves as a
   paradigm for the development of general models for open-cathode

Abstract = {{A rapid three-dimensional (3-D) ultraviolet (UV) lithography process for
   the fabrication of millimeter-tall high aspect ratio complex structures
   is presented. The liquid-state negative-tone photosensitive
   polyurethane, LF55GN, has been directly photopatterned using
   multidirectionally projected UV light for 3-D micropattern formation.
   The proposed lithographic scheme enabled us to overcome the maximum
   height obtained with a photo-patternable epoxy, SU8, which has been
   conventionally most commonly used for the fabrication of tall and high
   aspect ratio microstructures. Also, the fabrication process time has
   been significantly reduced by eliminating photoresist-baking steps.
   Computer-controlled multidirectional UV lithography has been employed to
   fabricate 3-D structures, where the UV-exposure substrate is dynamically
   tilt-rotating during UV exposure to create various 3-D ray traces in the
   polyurethane layer. LF55GN has been characterized to provide feasible
   fabrication conditions for the multidirectional UV lithography. Very
   tall structures including a 6-mm tall triangular slab and a 5-mm tall
   hexablaze have been successfully fabricated. A 4.5-mm tall air-lifted
   polymer-core bowtie monopole antenna, which is the tallest monopole
   structure fabricated by photolithography and subsequent metallization,
   has been successfully demonstrated. The antenna shows a resonant
   radiation frequency of 12.34 GHz, a return loss of 36 dB, and a 10 dB

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1287-1294}},

Abstract = {{Cultivar Tifton 85 bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) is often propagated using
   stolons, but the planting rate required for successful establishment
   varies under different soil conditions and on-farm irrigation
   management. In the sandy soils of the U.S. Gulf Coast, desiccation of
   planting material can occur rapidly even under irrigated conditions due
   to variable on-farm irrigation management, and few studies have
   evaluated stolon planting rate effects under these conditions. The
   objective was to assess the effect of stolon planting densities on
   establishment of Tifton 85. Treatments in this 2-yr field study were
   five planting rates including 1120, 1570, 2020, 2470, and 2920 kg ha(-1)
   arranged in four replicates of a randomized complete block design.
   Increasing planting rates increased bermudagrass frequency, ground
   cover, and dry matter harvested and decreased weed cover. All treatments
   had >80\% bermudagrass frequency of occurrence and ground cover 3 mo aft
   er planting in 2011, but the three greatest planting rates achieved 80\%
   frequency at 40 days aft er planting (DAP) compared with 68 DAP for the
   other treatments. In 2012, no treatment reached 80\% frequency or ground
   cover until 118 DAP. The lowest stolon-planting rate had 38\% weed cover
   in April the year following planting compared with <15\% for the three
   greatest planting rates. Independent of the year, the three highest
   rates presented greater cumulative herbage harvested than the lowest
   densities. These data suggest that planting rates of 2000 kg ha(-1) or
   greater will likely be required to achieve rapid and successful Tifton
   85 establishment in sandy soil environments.}},

   velocities are similar, consistent with strong vertical mixing and 2-D
   hydrodynamics. Drifters were preferentially entrained in the channelized
   jets where drifter cluster lateral spreading rates mu(in) were small
   (mu(in) approximate to 0.5 m(2) s (1)). At the seaward edge of the ebb
   shoal, jet velocities decrease linearly with distance (to <= 0.2 ms(-1),
   about 1 km from shore), and cluster spreading rates are larger with
   mu(out) approximate to 3 m(2) s(-1). Although the models COAWST and
   NearCom generally reproduce the observed trajectory directions, certain
   observed drifter properties are poorly modeled. For example, modeled
   mean drifter velocities are smaller than observed, and upon exiting the
   inlet, observed drifters turn north more than modeled drifters. The
   model simulations do reproduce qualitatively the spreading rates
   observed in the inner inlet, the flow deceleration, and the increase in
   mu(out) observed in the outer inlet. However, model spreading rates
   increase only to mu(out) < 1 m(2) s(-1). Smaller modeled than observed
   mu(out) may result from using unstratified models. Noncoincident (in
   space) observations show evidence of a buoyant plume (Delta rho = 1 kg
   m(-3)) in the outer inlet, likely affecting drifter lateral spreading.
   Generally, drifter-based model performance is good within the inlet
   channels where tidal currents are strongest, whereas model-data
   differences are significant farther offshore.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, shear flows of dry flexible fibres are numerically
   modelled using the discrete element method (DEM), and the effects of
   fibre properties on the flow behaviour and solid-phase stresses are
   explored. In the DEM simulations, a fibre is formed by connecting a
   number of spheres in a straight line using deformable and elastic bonds.
   The forces and moments induced by the bond deformation resist the
   relative normal, tangential, bending and torsional movements between two
   bonded spheres. The bond or deforming stiffness determines the
   flexibility of the fibres and the bond damping accounts for the energy
   dissipation in the fibre vibration. The simulation results show that
   elastically bonded fibres have smaller effective coefficients of
   restitution than rigidly connected fibres. Thus, smaller solid-phase
   stresses are obtained for flexible fibres, particularly with bond
   damping, compared with rigid fibres. Frictionless fibres tend to align
   with a small angle from the flow direction as the solid volume fraction
   increases, and fibre deformation is minimized due to the alignment.
   However, jamming, with a corresponding sharp stress increase, large
   fibre deformation and dense contact force network, occurs for fibres
   with friction at high solid volume fractions. It is also found that
   jamming is more prevalent in dense flows with larger fibre friction
   coefficient, rougher surface, larger stiffness and larger aspect ratio.}},

Title = {{Cavity-based flameholding for chemically-reacting supersonic flows}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN AEROSPACE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{24-41}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recesses in the walls of supersonic combustion chambers - cavities -
   have emerged as a preferred flameholding device since they are
   non-intrusive, hence resulting in reduced drag, lower total pressure
   losses and minimal aerodynamic heating when compared with other means of
   piloting core combustion such as, for example, struts. The flowfield
   within and in the vicinity of a cavity is complex involving a strong
   coupling between hydrodynamics and acoustics. When employed as a
   flameholding device both fuel injection and heat release - which is
   closely coupled to local mixing processes - alter the flowfield and
   further complicate the interaction between the cavity and the core
   supersonic flow. The complexity of this flowfield makes the
   identification of the dominant flameholding mechanisms and prediction of
   flame stability limits substantially more difficult than in the case of
   premixed systems. The following sections review the current knowledge of
   the mechanics of cavity-based flameholding in supersonic flows. Aspects
   of the non-reacting and reacting cavity flowfield are discussed with
   particular emphasis on the impact of fuel injection location relative to
   the flameholder. Results obtained to date in the attempt to describe the
   operability of cavity flameholders in terms of experimentally determined
   flame stability limits are also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effect of a back gate on the dc performance of AlGaN/GaN high

   reverse bias gate leakage current decreased from 3.9 x 10(-5) to 1.2 x
   10(-5) mA/mm by applying -10V at the back gate. Because of the
   suppression of gate leakage current by the back gate, the drain on/off
   ratio improved from 1.8 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(6) and the subthreshold
   swing from 204 to 137 mV/dec. Moreover, the drain breakdown voltage

   field}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Analytical solutions are obtained for the steady, fully developed flow
   of two layers of immiscible ferrofluids of different thicknesses between
   two parallel plates. Interfacial linear and internal angular momentum
   balance relations are derived for the case when there is a
   ferrofluid-ferrofluid interface to obtain the translational and spin
   velocity profiles in the gap. As expected for the limit of low applied
   field amplitude, the magnitude of the translational velocity is directly
   proportional to the frequency of the applied magnetic field and to the
   square of the magnetic field amplitude. Expressions for the velocity
   profiles are obtained for the zero spin viscosity and non-zero spin
   viscosity cases and the effect of applied pressure gradient on the flows
   is studied. The spin velocity in both ferrofluid phases is in the
   direction of the rotating magnetic field, except for cases of extreme
   applied pressure gradients for which the fluid vorticity opposes the
   spin. We find that for the case of non-zero spin viscosity, flow
   reversals are predicted using representative ferrofluid property values
   and field conditions. The unique predictions of the solution with
   non-zero spin viscosity could be used to experimentally test the
   existence of couple stresses in ferrofluids and the validity of
   previously reported values of the so-called spin viscosity. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Two methods are presented for approximating the costate of optimal
   control problems in integral form using orthogonal collocation at
   Legendre-Gauss (LG) and Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) points. It is shown
   that the derivative of the costate of the continuous-time optimal
   control problem is equal to the negative of the costate of the integral
   form of the continuous-time optimal control problem. Using this
   continuous-time relationship between the differential and integral
   costate, it is shown that the discrete approximations of the
   differential costate using LG and LGR collocation are related to the
   corresponding discrete approximations of the integral costate via
   integration matrices. The approach developed in this paper provides a
   way to approximate the costate of the original optimal control problem
   using the Lagrange multipliers of the integral form of the LG and LGR
   collocation methods. The methods are demonstrated on two examples where
   it is shown that both the differential and integral costate converge

Abstract = {{A mesh refinement method is described for solving a continuous-time
   optimal control problem using collocation at Legendre-Gauss-Radau
   points. The method allows for changes in both the number of mesh
   intervals and the degree of the approximating polynomial within a mesh
   interval. First, a relative error estimate is derived based on the
   difference between the Lagrange polynomial approximation of the state
   and a Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature integration of the dynamics within
   a mesh interval. The derived relative error estimate is then used to
   decide if the degree of the approximating polynomial within a mesh
   should be increased or if the mesh interval should be divided into
   subintervals. The degree of the approximating polynomial within a mesh
   interval is increased if the polynomial degree estimated by the method
   remains below a maximum allowable degree. Otherwise, the mesh interval
   is divided into subintervals. The process of refining the mesh is
   repeated until a specified relative error tolerance is met. Three
   examples highlight various features of the method and show that the
   approach is more computationally efficient and produces significantly
   smaller mesh sizes for a given accuracy tolerance when compared with
   fixed-order methods. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This article demonstrates single-pass fabrication of thick, crack-free
   deposits of Rene 80, a high gamma-prime ``non-weldable{''} superalloy,
   atop like-chemistry substrates through scanning laser epitaxy (SLE), a
   metal powder bed-based laser additive manufacturing (AM) technique.
   Microstructural investigations and processing zone identification are
   presented. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy reveal
   the segregated dendritic microstructure with the presence of finer
   carbides and primary gamma' particles. Transmission electron microscopy
   reveals a bimodal distribution of finer secondary gamma' particles in
   the deposit region. Microindentation hardness measurements show an
   increase in the hardness value by 25\% in the deposit region compared to
   the cast substrate due to microstructural refinement. In addition to the
   achievement of metallurgical continuity across the interface and
   improved hardness in the deposit, the crack-free deposits obtained here
   for Rene 80 represent one of the few successes reported for a
   non-weldable alloy of its kind. The results presented here illustrate
   the significant potential of SLE for the AM-based repair of existing and
   AM-based construction of entirely new gas turbine hot-section components
   utilizing powders of high gamma' nickel-based superalloys that have long
   been known to have high tendency for cracking under the processing
   conditions associated with traditional welding, joining, and cladding
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is an important source of greenhouse gases (GHG), especially
   from crop production practices and enteric fermentation by ruminant
   livestock. Improved production practices in agriculture and increase in
   terrestrial carbon sinks are alternatives for mitigating GHG emissions
   in agriculture. The objective of this study was to estimate GHG
   emissions from hypothetical farm enterprise combinations in the
   southeastern United States with a mix of cropland and livestock
   production and estimate the area of forest plantation necessary to
   offset these emissions. Four different farm enterprise combinations
   (Cotton; Maize; Peanut; Wheat + Livestock + Forest) with different
   production practices were considered in the study resulting in different
   emission scenarios. We assumed typical production practices of farm
   operations in the region with 100 ha of cropland area and a herd of 50
   cows. GHG emissions were calculated regarding production, storage and
   transportation of agrochemicals (pre-farm) and farm activities such as
   fertilization, machinery operation and irrigation (on-farm). Simulated
   total farm GHG emissions for the different farm enterprise combinations
   and production practices ranged from 348.8 t CO(2)e year(-1) to 765.6 t
   CO(2)e year(-1). The estimated forest area required to neutralize these
   emissions ranged from 19 ha to 40 ha. In general, enterprise
   combinations with more intense production practices that include the use
   of irrigation resulted in higher total emissions but lower emissions per
   unit of commodity produced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2503-2517}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Habitat suitability index (HSI) models are commonly used to predict
   habitat quality and species distributions and are used to develop
   biological surveys, assess reserve and management priorities, and
   anticipate possible change under different management or climate change
   scenarios. Important management decisions may be based on model results,
   often without a clear understanding of the level of uncertainty
   associated with model outputs. We present an integrated methodology to
   assess the propagation of uncertainty from both inputs and structure of
   the HSI models on model outputs (uncertainty analysis: UA) and relative
   importance of uncertain model inputs and their interactions on the model
   output uncertainty (global sensitivity analysis: GSA). We illustrate the
   GSA/UA framework using simulated hydrology input data from a
   hydrodynamic model representing sea level changes and HSI models for two
   species of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in southwest Everglades
   National Park: Vallisneria americana (tape grass) and Halodule wrightii
   (shoal grass). We found considerable spatial variation in uncertainty
   for both species, but distributions of HSI scores still allowed
   discrimination of sites with good versus poor conditions. Ranking of
   input parameter sensitivities also varied spatially for both species,
   with high habitat quality sites showing higher sensitivity to different
   parameters than low-quality sites. HSI models may be especially useful
   when species distribution data are unavailable, providing means of
   exploiting widely available environmental datasets to model past,
   current, and future habitat conditions. The GSA/UA approach provides a
   general method for better understanding HSI model dynamics, the spatial
   and temporal variation in uncertainties, and the parameters that
   contribute most to model uncertainty. Including an uncertainty and
   sensitivity analysis in modeling efforts as part of the decision-making
   framework will result in better-informed, more robust decisions.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{270-278}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, an absorber design suitable for the plate-and-frame
   absorber configuration is introduced. The design utilizes a fin
   structure installed on a vertical flat plate to produce a uniform
   solution film and minimize its thickness and to continuously interrupt
   the boundary layer. Using numerical models supported by experiments
   employing dye visualization, the suitable fin spacing and size and
   surface wettability are determined. The solution flow thickness is
   measured using the laser confocal displacement measurement technique.
   The new surface structure is tested in an experimental absorption
   system. A significantly high absorption rate (6 x 10(-3) kg/m(2)s at a
   pressure potential of 700 Pa) is achieved in comparison with the
   conventional absorption systems. The effect of absorber water vapor
   pressure, solution flow rate, solution inlet concentration, cooling
   water inlet temperature and solution inlet temperature on the absorption
   rate is investigated. The proposed design provides a potential framework
   for development of highly compact absorption refrigeration systems.

Abstract = {{Automatic target recognition in sidescan sonar imagery is vital to many
   applications, particularly sea mine detection and classification. We
   expand upon the traditional offline supervised classification approach
   with an active learning method to automatically label new objects that
   are not present in the training set. This is facilitated by the option
   of sending difficult samples to an outlier bin, from which models can be
   built for new objects. The decisions of the classifier are improved by a
   novel active learning approach, called model trees (MT), which builds an
   ensemble of hypotheses about the classification decisions that grows
   proportionally to the amount of uncertainty the system has about the
   samples. Our system outperforms standard active learning methods, and is
   shown to correctly identify new objects much more accurately than a pure
   clustering approach, on a simulated sidescan sonar data set.}},

Abstract = {{Online social networks (OSNs), which attract thousands of million people
   to use everyday, greatly extend OSN users' social circles by friend
   recommendations. OSN users' existing social relationship can be
   characterized as 1-hop trust relationship, and further establish a
   multi-hop trust chain during the recommendation process. As the same as
   what people usually experience in the daily life, the social
   relationship in cyberspaces are potentially formed by OSN users' shared
   attributes, e.g., colleagues, family members, or classmates, which
   indicates the attribute-based recommendation process would lead to more
   fine-grained social relationships between strangers. Unfortunately,
   privacy concerns raised in the recommendation process impede the
   expansion of OSN users' friend circle. Some OSN users refuse to disclose
   their identities and their friends' information to the public domain. In
   this paper, we propose a trust-based privacy-preserving friend
   recommendation scheme for OSNs, where OSN users apply their attributes
   to find matched friends, and establish social relationships with
   strangers via a multi-hop trust chain. Based on trace-driven
   experimental results and security analysis, we have shown the
   feasibility and privacy preservation of our proposed scheme.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2195-2200}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The electrothermal (ET) energetic plasma source (ETEPS) is a different
   concept in which the ablation mechanism is forced inside of the
   open-ended capillary that has energetic liner, a propellant. The
   generation of the ET plasma results from Joule heating and radiant heat
   transport to the liner. The discharge initiates erosive burn of the
   propellant, and the mixed plasma-propellant gasification produces
   high-enthalpy energetic flow. In the ablation-dominated source, the
   eroded materials from the solid propellant liner are mixed inside the
   source before they flow out as a result of the large pressure gradient.
   The energetic ET source also has another concept in which no ablation
   occurs and the plasma is generated from the injection of energetic
   gasses or liquids into the confined open-ended capillary. The
   ablation-free source generates the plasma from the dissociation of the
   gaseous/liquid components, which in turn releases the chemical energy of
   these propellants and mixes the energy with the electrical energy of the
   plasma. This concept is different from ET chemical (ETC) sources; it
   generates the propellant or energetic flow without requiring a
   combustion chamber. It also provides mixing at the ionic level not
   available in current configurations of ETC launchers, igniters, or
   thrusters. The ET plasma code ETFLOW-EN was developed to computationally
   simulate the plasma generation and flow in energetic ET capillary
   discharges to predict the behavior of the energetic source with the use
   of lined solid propellants. Operation with liquid/gaseous energetic
   forms in a nonablative capillary is also a character of this concept and
   is part of the ETFLOW code. The results of using different forms of
   energetic materials in solid, liquid, and gaseous mixtures have shown
   the applicability of ETEPS to produce high-enthalpy energetic plasma
   flows with sufficient parameters suitable for ETC launch applications.
   Plasma and flow parameters at the capillary exit were investigated at
   different mixing ratios.}},

   electrothermal nature of thermal torches and electrical-to-thermal
   energy conversion. Power for this torch is supplied from the electric
   mains and the voltage is stepped up to 6 kV. However, the torch can also
   operate on dc or pulsed mode. The electrical operation is characterized
   by the voltampere relationship to determine the power rating of the
   torch as well as diagnosing the dynamic behavior of the plasma.
   Experiments on the torch using air and argon have shown plasma
   temperatures in the range of 0.4-0.6 eV with plasma number density in
   the range of 10(24)-10(25)/m(3), indicating a dense plasma regime with
   the plasma tends to be weakly nonideal. Plasma kinetic temperature and
   electron number density were obtained from optical emission spectroscopy
   using the relative line method as the plasma is near local thermodynamic
   equilibrium condition. Plasma temperature has its peak for low flow
   rates and decreases for increased flow rates. The torch modeling was
   conducted using an electrothermal plasma code to simulate and predict
   the parameters for pulsed mode operation. Simulation was conducted on a
   single channel as the dual torch is symmetric. Code results for extended
   pulselength show a plasma temperature between 0.6 and 0.8 eV for
   nitrogen, oxygen, and helium; which are in good correlation with plasma
   temperatures obtained from optical emission spectra and measured plasma
   resistivity. A set of computational experiments using short pulses at
   higher discharge currents has shown temperature in the range of 2.0-2.5
   eV for nitrogen and helium.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents adaptive phase-only memory digital pre-distortion
   (DPD) and gain/phase/delay imbalance correction techniques for
   outphasing power amplifiers (PAs). Least squares adaptation is used for
   the phase-only DPD and imbalance correction techniques. The performance
   of these techniques is verified by co-simulations and measurements of an
   outphasing PA implemented with two identical class-F PAs and a Chireix
   combiner. The Chireix combiner with compensating stubs added to achieve
   high efficiency introduces nonlinearity. The proposed adaptive
   phase-only memory DPD corrects for the nonlinearity due to the Chireix
   combiner. The proposed gain/phase/delay imbalance correction technique
   achieves total lower/upper adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)
   improvements of 43.8/37.6 dB for 5-MHz and 46.2/38.3 dB for 10-MHz
   long-term-evolution signals in measurements. The fractional-sample delay
   imbalance correction reduces distortion at low input amplitudes and
   demonstrates on the order of a 10-dB ACPR improvement compared to
   full-sample delay imbalance correction.}},

Abstract = {{GaN-based devices are more radiation hard than their Si and GaAs
   counterparts due to the high bond strength in III-nitride materials. In
   this paper, we review data on the radiation resistance of GaN-based
   transistors such as AlGaN/GaN and InAlN/GaN high electron mobility
   transistors (HEMTs) to different types of ionizing radiation. The
   primary energy levels introduced by different forms of radiation,
   carrier removal rates and role of existing defects are discussed. The
   carrier removal rates are a function of initial carrier concentration,
   dose and dose rate but not of hydrogen concentration in the nitride
   material grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. Proton and
   electron irradiation damage in HEMTs creates positive threshold voltage
   shifts due to a decrease in the two-dimensional electron gas
   concentration resulting from electron trapping at defect sites, as well
   as a decrease in carrier mobility and degradation of drain current and
   transconductance. Neutron irradiation created more extended damage
   regions and at high doses leads to Fermi level pinning, while Co-60
   gamma-ray irradiation leads to much smaller changes in HEMT drain
   current relative to the other forms of radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud gaming, also called gaming on demand, is a new kind of service
   that provides real-time video game experience to the players over the
   Internet. Although cloud gaming services are getting more and more
   popular recently, its performance is highly limited by the network
   bandwidth and latency. This work makes use of the unique characteristics
   of human visual system (HVS) of video game players to improve bandwidth
   efficiency. In this work, discussions about the characteristics of game
   players' HVS are conducted. The discussions can be further extended to
   all interactive video on demand systems. Then, some schemes of
   extracting region of interest and key frames from gaming videos are
   raised. Based on that, a Macro-block level rate control scheme is
   proposed based on region of interest and scene-change detection. The
   simulation results show that, under the same bandwidth constraint, the
   video quality of proposed method outperforms other methods. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents seasonal variation of surface ozone monitored
   continuously at site of the meteorological observatory at Port Blair, a
   maritime site of the Bay of Bengal for the period of August, 2005-March,
   2007. Present observation depicts the characteristics of surface ozone
   at the remote marine site and the long range transport of pollutants
   from three different sides i.e., Indian Subcontinent, South East Asia
   and Indian Ocean. Very high ozone mixing ratio (similar to 70-80 ppbv)
   is occasionally observed during March and November at this site. A
   campaign mode of observation of trace gases (surface ozone, CO, NOR,
   CO2), aerosol concentration and its size, UV radiation at Port Blair was
   made to understand the role of transport on pollutants during March
   16-26, 2002. During this period of observation, a near zero surface
   ozone of different time scales (few hours) has been observed several
   times during the period of midnight to early morning. Simultaneously NOx
   (NO+NO2) (similar to 40 ppbv) and carbon monoxide was observed very high
   (300-600 ppbv) during this period. Source of this high pollutant are not
   expected at this remote marine sites although wind patterns, 7-days
   isentropic back Trajectory analysis and MATCH Model output suggest that
   polluted air mass has come from eastern side of Indian subcontinent. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper examines the design and efficiency of a highway use
   reservation system where commuters need reservations to access a highway
   facility at specific times. We show that, by accommodating reservation
   requests to the level that the highway capacity allows, traffic
   congestion can be relieved. Generally, a more differentiated design of
   the reservation system yields a higher reduction of travel cost and thus
   achieves a higher efficiency. The efficiency bound of the system is
   established. We also show that braking or tactical waiting behaviors of
   drivers would cause a loss of efficiency, which thus need be proactively
   accommodated. Given that user heterogeneity cause further loss of
   efficiency, we explore how two specific types of user heterogeneity
   affect the system efficiency. Auction-based reservation is then proposed
   to mitigate the efficiency loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks(WSNs) have been widely investigated in the past
   decades because of its applicability in various extreme environments. As
   sensors use battery, most works on WSNs focus on energy efficiency
   issues(e.g., local energy balancing problems) in statically deployed
   WSNs. Few works have paid attention to the global energy balancing
   problem for the scenario that mobile sensor nodes can move freely. In
   this paper, we propose a new routing protocol called global energy
   balancing routing protocol (GEBRP) based on an active network framework
   and node relocation in mobile sensor networks. This protocol achieves
   global energy efficiency by repairing coverage holes and replacing
   invalid nodes dynamically. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate
   that the proposed GEBRP achieves superior performance over the existing
   scheme. In addition, we analyze the delay performance of GEBRP and study
   how the delay performance is affected by various system
   parameters.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Impacts of heterogeneous HONO formation on radical sources and ozone
   chemistry in Houston, Texas}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{344-355}},

Abstract = {{The chemical mechanisms used in regulatory air quality models typically
   allow for only homogeneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO), an
   important radical precursor. This study adds heterogeneous formation on
   surfaces as a HONO source to the Comprehensive Air quality Model with
   extensions (CAMx). Modeling was performed for the Houston, Texas, region
   on April 21, 2009. Comparisons to measurements made at Moody Tower
   during the Study of Houston Atmospheric Radical Precursors (SHARP) show
   that adding heterogeneous formation increases HONO concentrations,
   particularly in the early morning and at night. Heterogeneous HONO
   formation reduces normalized mean error for morning, daytime, and
   nighttime HONO concentrations from 77\% to 67\%, 66\%-28\%, and
   99\%-67\%. Maximum daily 8-hr O-3 concentrations were up to 3.5 ppb
   greater as a result of heterogeneous HONO formation. Direct HONO
   emissions equal to 0.8\% of NOx emissions were also added to the model,
   but they were considered separately from heterogeneous HONO formation.
   Increases over the base case of HONO and O-3 were seen, though the
   magnitudes are not as great as with heterogeneous HONO formation.
   Maximum daily 8-hr O-3 concentrations were up to 0.4 ppb greater than
   with homogeneous HONO formation alone. Significant early morning and
   nighttime HONO under predictions were seen compared to SHARP
   measurements in the direct emissions scenario. Direct HONO emissions led
   to local increases of HONO and O-3 in areas with high NOx emissions, but
   heterogeneous HONO formation led to regional increases of both. Process
   analysis was used to determine the effect on O-3 chemistry in downtown
   Houston. Daily total hydroxyl radical (OH) production from HONO
   photolysis was 3.94 ppb/day with heterogeneous HONO formation, 2.40
   ppb/day with direct emissions, and 1.40 ppb/day in the base case. A 10\%
   increase of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide oxidation by OH was seen
   with heterogeneous HONO formation, while the increase in the direct
   emissions scenario was 3\%. Nitric oxide (NO) to NO2 conversion
   increased by 8\% with heterogeneous formation, while the increase was
   only 3\% with direct HONO emissions. Radical sources, radical
   propagation, and oxidant production were enhanced at each step in the
   chemical cycle particularly just after sunrise by the addition of
   heterogeneous HONO formation and direct HONO emissions, but the effects
   were greater with heterogeneous formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Landscape Irrigation Soil Moisture Sensor Systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that soil moisture sensor systems (SMSs)
   designed for landscape irrigation can save water. However, SMSs have not
   been tested with reclaimed wastewater. Both salts contained in the
   irrigation water and temperature might alter the soil water content
   (SWC) sensed by SMSs. The objective of this research was to quantify the
   effect of salinity and/or temperature on the precision and accuracy of
   three different commercially available SMSs. The brands, controllers,
   and probes selected for this experiment were as follows: Acclima, SCX,
   and Digital TDT, Baseline, WaterTec S100, and biSensor, and Dynamax,
   IL200-MC, and SM200. Every SMS was replicated three times. Each SMS
   probe was installed in the center of different containers filled with an
   Arredondo fine sand. The containers were placed in a
   controlled-temperature chamber and were saturated and dried down across
   a combination of three temperatures (10, 25, or 35 degrees C) and three
   electrical conductivities (0, 0.7, or 5dS/m). Each container was placed
   on a platform scale to determine soil water losses, by weight variation
   over time. The actual or measured SWCs were then compared with their
   respective SMS readings. A regression analysis was performed, per brand,
   for each combination of salinity and temperature. Acclima resulted in
   the most robust and reliable system, with no practical reading
   variations when exposed to different combinations of temperatures and
   salinities. Both Baseline and Dynamax systems were sensitive to high
   salinity and/or high temperature, making their use more difficult in
   extreme or changing situations. However, all tested SMSs followed with
   adequate precision the SWC under the different salinity and temperature
   scenarios. Consequently, these SMSs might achieve an adequate landscape
   irrigation control, even when their readings might not correspond to the
   actual SWC. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Sprinkler Distribution Uniformity for Strawberry Cold Protection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Effective sprinkler irrigation for cold protection requires an adequate
   and uniform water application rate (AR) in order to provide enough heat
   by freezing to compensate for heat loss by other means
   (i.e.,evaporation). Several models have estimated the sufficient AR for
   cold protection as 6.35mm/h; however, this value has little field
   verification. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   sprinkler type, sprinkler spacing, and water supply pressure under
   varied wind conditions on low quarter irrigation distribution uniformity
   (DUlq) and AR. Distribution uniformity was tested using four sprinkler
   types (Wade Rain WR-32 and Nelson: R33, R33LP, and R2000WF) assessed at
   three pressure levels (345, 276, and 207kPa), two sprinkler spacings
   (14.6 and 12.2m), and varied wind conditions ranging from low (0.2m/s)
   to high (7.2m/s). The interactions (1)sprinkler type-pressure,
   (2)sprinkler type-spacing, and (3)pressure-spacing resulted in a
   significant effect on DUlq and AR, as well as, the effect of wind speed,
   which was included as a covariate in the analysis. The R2000WF and WR-32
   sprinklers at 345kPa and 12.2m spacing resulted in the highest
   uniformity, and by contrast, obtained the lowest AR when evaluated at
   207kPa and 14.6m spacing. Overall DUlq did not differ drastically across
   the factors tested, whereas AR was substantially impacted by these
   factors. Current strawberry growers systems are set up at 14.6m
   sprinkler spacing with 2-3mm/h AR, which is substantially lower than the
   recommended AR of 6mm/h and may result in inadequate cold protection.
   Using manufacturer recommended spacing with commonly used sprinklers
   (WR-32) would result in 4-5mm/h AR depending on supply pressure
   available; hence, a greater level of cold protection. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Quantitative laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analysis
   operates on the assumption that the sample is completely dissociated and
   diffused within the highly energetic plasma on time-scales of analyte
   analysis, resulting in analyte emission ideally at the bulk plasma
   temperature and a signal that is linear with analyte mass concentration.
   However, recent studies focusing on aerosol analysis have found the heat
   and mass diffusion rates within laser-induced plasmas to be finite,
   resulting in particle-rich, locally perturbed areas within the hot bulk
   plasma. The goal of this study is to observe any related plasma
   differences, by calculating the bulk and local (i.e. analyte rich
   regions) plasma temperatures and electron density, to better understand
   the time frame of equilibrium between the local and bulk plasma
   properties. This study also seeks to determine whether the presence of
   large quantities of a matrix element can significantly alter the local
   plasma conditions, thereby generating matrix effects. We report the
   temporal profiles of particle-derived species, adding additional insight
   into the effect of local perturbation of plasma properties, with the
   conclusion that significant plasma residence (tens of microseconds) is
   necessary to minimize such effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Scapulohumeral rhythm in shoulders with reverse shoulder arthroplasty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1129-1134}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about kinematic function of reverse total
   shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) is a common
   metric for assessing muscle function and shoulder joint motion. The
   purpose of this study was to compare SHR in shoulders with RTSA to
   normal shoulders.
   Methods: Twenty-eight subjects, more than 12 months after unilateral
   RTSA, were recruited for an Institutional Review Board-approved study.
   Subjects performed arm abduction in the coronal plane with and without a
   1.4-kg hand-held weight. Three-dimensional model-image registration
   techniques were used to measure orientation and position for the humerus
   and scapula from fluoroscopic images. Analysis of variance and Tukey
   tests were used to assess groupwise and pairwise differences.
   Results: SHR in RTSA shoulders (1.3: 1) was significantly lower than in
   normal shoulders (3: 1). Below 30 degrees abduction, RTSA and normal
   shoulders show a wide range of SHR (1.3: 1 to 17: 1). Above 30 degrees
   abduction, SHR in RTSA shoulders was 1.3: 1 for unweighted abduction and
   1.3: 1 for weighted abduction. Maximum RTSA shoulder abduction in
   weighted trials was lower than in unweighted trials. SHR variability in
   RTSA shoulders decreased with increasing arm elevation.
   Conclusion: RTSA shoulders show kinematics that are significantly
   different from normal shoulders. SHR in RTSA shoulders was significantly
   lower than in normal shoulders, indicating that RTSA shoulders use more
   scapulothoracic motion and less glenohumeral motion to elevate the arm.
   With these observations, it may be possible to improve rehabilitation
   protocols, with particular attention to the periscapular muscles, and
   implant design or placement to optimize functional outcomes in shoulders
   with RTSA.

Title = {{Consumptive water use and crop coefficients for warm-season turfgrass

Abstract = {{Increased urban demand for landscape irrigation, as well as interest in
   promoting water-use efficient species by municipalities, water
   purveyors, and homeowners associations emphasize the need for
   comparative data on consumptive water use by warm-season lawn grasses.
   The objective of this study was to quantify actual evapotranspiration
   (ETa) and to develop crop coefficients (K-c) for four warm-season
   turfgrass species, namely `Tifway' bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.)
   Pers. x Cynodon transvaalensis Burtt-Davy), `Empire' zoysiagrass (Zoysia
   japonica Steud.), `Floratam' St. Augustinegrass {[}Stenotaphrum
   secundatum (Walter) Kuntze], and `Argentine' bahiagrass (Paspalum
   notatum Flugge). Crop coefficients were derived by dividing ETa
   (measured directly from lysimeter weight change over 24 to 72-h periods)
   by reference evapotranspiration (ETo) calculated from the ASCE-EWRI
   Standardized Method using onsite weather station data. Data were
   collected over three seasons from non-stressed, well-watered turf. For
   17 of the 30 measurement periods, K-c did not differ among the 4
   species, and on 24 of 30 periods zoysiagrass, bermudagrass, and St.
   Augustinegrass K-c did not differ from one another. A trend toward
   elevated K-c was observed in bahiagrass in years.2 and 3, particularly
   during early spring measurement periods. K-c values for all species
   fluctuated across seasons and years, peaking to similar to 0.8 during
   active growth periods when vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation
   were greatest, and declining to similar to 0.3 in late fall and winter.
   Root growth differences among the species appeared to have a stronger
   relationship to ET rates than did shoot growth rate. Results
   demonstrated that the commonly recommended warm-season turf coefficient
   of 0.6, while approximating overall average annual ETa, under-predicted
   ETa during active growth periods and over-predicted ETa during late fall
   and winter periods, when turf was slowly growing or quiescent. The
   results indicate seasonal refinement of K-c values may be needed to more
   effectively meet consumptive water use requirements of warm-season
   turfgrasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   a strict observer function from the differential equation of the

Abstract = {{Application services based on cloud computing infrastructure are
   proliferating over the Internet. In this paper, we investigate the
   problem of how to minimize cloud resource rental cost associated with
   hosting such cloud-based application services, while meeting the
   projected service demand. This problem arises when applications generate
   high volume of data that incurs significant cost on storage and
   transfer. As a result, an application service provider (ASP) needs to
   carefully evaluate various resource rental options before finalizing the
   application deployment. We choose Amazon EC2 marketplace as a case of
   study, and analyze the economical trade-off for on-demand resource
   rental strategies. Given fixed resource pricing, we first develop a
   deterministic model, using a mixed integer linear program, to facilitate
   resource rental decision making. Evaluation results show that our
   planning optimization model reduces resource rental cost by as much as
   50 percent compared with a baseline strategy. Next, we further
   investigate planning solutions to resource market featuring time-varying
   pricing (Amazon Spot Instance Market). We perform time-series analysis
   over the spot price trace and examine its predictability using
   auto-regressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA). We also develop a
   stochastic planning model based on multistage recourse. By comparing
   these two approaches, we discover that spot price forecasting does not
   provide our planning model with a crystal ball due to the weak
   correlation of past and future price, and the stochastic planning model
   better hedges against resource pricing uncertainty than resource rental
   planning using forecast prices.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1054-1060}},

Abstract = {{Inverse dynamics analysis is commonly used to estimate the net loads at
   a joint during human motion. Most lower-limb models of movement
   represent the knee as a simple hinge joint when calculating muscle
   forces. This approach is limited because it neglects the contributions
   from tibiofemoral joint contact forces and may therefore lead to errors
   in estimated muscle forces. The aim of this study was to quantify the
   contributions of tibiofemoral joint contact loads to the net knee loads
   calculated from inverse dynamics for multiple subjects and multiple gait
   patterns. Tibiofemoral joint contact loads were measured in four
   subjects with instrumented implants as each subject walked at their
   preferred speed (normal gait) and performed prescribed gait
   modifications designed to treat medial knee osteoarthritis. Tibiofemoral
   contact loads contributed substantially to the net knee extension and
   knee adduction moments in normal gait with mean values of 16\% and 54\%,
   respectively. These findings suggest that knee-contact kinematics and
   loads should be included in lower-limb models of movement for more
   accurate determination of muscle forces. The results of this study may
   be used to guide the development of more realistic lower-limb models
   that account for the effects of tibiofemoral joint contact at the knee.

Abstract = {{The interwinding parasitic capacitance of transformers and the parasitic
   capacitance between semiconductor switches and the ground are two major
   contributors to the common-mode (CM) noise currents in switched mode
   power converters. In this paper, a generalized CM current cancelation
   approach is proposed for the reduction of CM noise in isolated power
   converters. The approach is demonstrated in a forward converter. In this
   approach, the total effect of the two parasitic capacitances on CM noise
   is represented with an equivalent parasitic capacitance (EPC) at low
   frequencies. With this EPC, different CM current cancelation techniques
   can be efficiently organized to simultaneously cancel the low-frequency
   CM noise caused by these two parasitic capacitances. Furthermore, the
   EPC can be used to evaluate and quantify the performance of CM noise
   reduction techniques. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results
   show that the proposed approach is easy to implement and can
   significantly attenuate low frequency CM noise and therefore greatly
   reduce CM filter size and cost.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal, conductivity prediction remains an important subject in many
   scientific and engineering areas. Only recently has such prediction
   become possible on the basis of the first principles calculations, thus
   ensuring high quality results. Implementation of the methodology,
   however, is technically challenging and requires a lengthy development
   process. We thus introduce the Phonon Transport Simulator (PhonTS), a
   Fortran90, fully parallel code to perform such calculations. PhonTS
   possesses a large array of options and returns the thermal conductivity
   tensor together with related quantities, such as spectral thermal
   conductivity, phonon lifetimes, mean free paths and Gruneisen
   parameters. First principles calculations are implemented via convenient
   interfaces to widely-used third-party codes, while many classical
   potentials are included in PhonTS itself. The code is carefully
   validated against data published in the literature from various thermal
   conductivity computational techniques and against experimental data.

Abstract = {{In general, agricultural soil surfaces being hydrophilic in nature get
   easily wetted by water. The water beneath the soil moves through
   capillary effect and comes to the surface of the soil and thereafter
   evaporates into the surrounding air due to atmospheric conditions such
   as sunlight, wind current, temperature and relative humidity. To lower
   the water loss from soil, an experiment was designed in which a layer of
   hydrophobic soil was laid on the surface of ordinary hydrophilic soil.
   This technique strikingly decreased loss of water from the soil. The
   results indicated that the evaporation rate significantly decreased and
   90\% of water was retained in the soil in 83 h by the hydrophobic layer
   of 2 cm thickness. A theoretical calculation based on diffusion of water
   vapour (gas phase) through hydrophobic capillaries provide a meaningful
   explanation of experimental results. A greater retention of water in the
   soil by this approach can promote the growth of plants, which was
   confirmed by growing chick pea (Cicer arietinum) plants and it was found
   that the length of roots, height of shoot, number of branches, number of
   leaves, number of secondary roots, biomass etc. were significantly
   increased upon covering the surface with hydrophobic soil in comparison
   to uncovered ordinary hydrophilic soil of identical depth. Such approach
   can also decrease the water consumption by the plants particularly grown
   indoors in residential premises, green houses and poly-houses etc. and
   also can be very useful to prevent water loss and enhance growth of
   vegetation in semi-arid regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Watering or buffering? Runoff and sediment pollution control from furrow
   irrigated fields in arid environments}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{205}},
Pages = {{90-101}},

Abstract = {{Surface irrigated agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions contributes
   to downstream environmental degradation. Changes in irrigation system
   operational scenarios (ISOS) can represent an economic alternative to
   reduce surface runoff impacts. At the same time the use of vegetative
   filter strips (VFS) can have a positive impact on the ecological health
   of rural landscapes by reducing erosion, improving water quality,
   increasing biodiversity, and expanding wildlife habitat. The goal of
   this paper is, using a combination of field data and mechanistic
   modeling results, to evaluate and compare the spatial effectiveness of
   improvements in ISOS and introduction of VFS to reduce surface runoff
   pollution in the semi-arid/arid furrow irrigation agroecosystem that
   exceeds current regulatory turbidity limits (25 NTU). Five main factor
   interactions were studied: four soil textures, two field slopes, three
   ISOS, six filter vegetation types, and ten filter lengths. Slope and
   runoff volume were identified as the two main drivers of sediment export
   from furrows. Shifting from current ISOS to less water consumptive
   irrigation practices reduce runoff in addition to sediment delivery to
   comply with environmental regulations. The implementation of 3-9 m
   vegetative buffers on experimental parcels were found to mitigate
   sediment delivery (greater than 90\% sediment reduction) on tail
   drainage ditches but had limited effect in the reduction of runoff flow
   that can transport other dissolved pollutants. These findings were
   insensitive to filter vegetation type. Thus, introduction of improved
   ISOS is desirable while VFS may be targeted to specific hot spots within
   the irrigation district. This study shows that the adoption of dense
   vegetation buffers in vulnerable semi-arid irrigated regions can be
   effective to mitigate agricultural impacts and provide environmental
   protection. However, it should not be adopted as an alternative to
   proper on-site irrigation practices, rather as a complementary off-site
   pollution control practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the coordinated scheduling problem of production
   and transportation in a two-stage supply chain, where the actual job
   processing time is a linear function of its starting time. During the
   production stage the jobs are first processed in serial batches on a
   bounded serial batching machine at the manufacturer's site. Then, the
   batches are delivered to a customer by a single vehicle with limited
   capacity during the transportation stage, and the vehicle can only
   deliver one batch at one time. The objective of this proposed scheduling
   problem is to make decisions on job batching and batch sequencing so as
   to minimize the makespan. Moreover, we consider two different models.
   With regards to the scheduling model with a buffer for storing the
   processed batches before transportation, we develop an optimal algorithm
   to solve it. For the scheduling model without buffer, we present some
   useful properties and develop a heuristic H for solving it. Then a novel
   lower bound is derived and two optimal algorithms are designed for
   solving two special cases. Furthermore, computational experiments with
   random instances of different sizes are conducted to evaluate the
   proposed heuristic H, and the results show that our proposed algorithm
   is superior to other four approaches in the literature. Besides,
   heuristic H in our experiments can effectively and efficiently solve
   both small-size and large-size problems in a reasonable time. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Microwave backscatter from vegetated surfaces is influenced by
   vegetation structure and vegetation water content (VWC), which varies
   with meteorological conditions and moisture in the root zone. Radar
   backscatter observations are used for many vegetation and soil moisture
   monitoring applications under the assumption that VWC is constant on
   short timescales. This research aims to understand how backscatter over
   agricultural canopies changes in response to diurnal differences in VWC
   due to water stress. A standard water-cloud model and a two-layer
   water-cloud model for maize were used to simulate the influence of the
   observed variations in bulk/leaf/stalk VWC and soil moisture on the
   various contributions to total backscatter at a range of frequencies,
   polarizations, and incidence angles. The bulk VWC and leaf VWC were
   found to change up to 30\% and 40\%, respectively, on a diurnal basis
   during water stress and may have a significant effect on radar
   backscatter. Total backscatter time series are presented to illustrate
   the simulated diurnal difference in backscatter for different radar
   frequencies, polarizations, and incidence angles. Results show that
   backscatter is very sensitive to variations in VWC during water stress,
   particularly at large incidence angles and higher frequencies. The
   diurnal variation in total backscatter was dominated by variations in
   leaf water content, with simulated diurnal differences of up to 4 dB in
   X-through K-u-bands (8.6-35 GHz). This study highlights a potential
   source of error in current vegetation and soil monitoring applications
   and provides insights into the potential use for radar to detect
   variations in VWC due to water stress.}},

Abstract = {{Low-energy electron microscopy and micro-illumination low-energy
   electron diffraction (mu LEED) were used to investigate the structural
   properties of TbOx films grown on Cu(111) in ultrahigh vacuum. Our
   results reveal that the morphology and structure of the terbia films
   depend sensitively on the surface temperature during growth. Deposition
   at room temperature produces terbia films that uniformly cover the
   surface but lack long-range order that is detectable with LEED.
   Annealing in O-2 induces the formation of three-dimensional TbOx islands
   that grow as dendrites and cause the disordered terbia to dewet from the
   Cu(111) substrate. LEED measurements show that the terbia dendrites are
   crystalline with a hexagonal (1.4 x 1.4) structure with respect to the
   Cu(111) surface, which is consistent with cubic fluorite-like TbOx(111).
   In contrast to room temperature growth, deposition at 475 degrees C
   produces mainly rectangular TbOx islands that coexist with smaller
   quantities of irregularly shaped islands. Utilizing mu LEED, we identify
   the rectangular domains as the cubic fluorite-like TbOx(112) structure
   while the irregularly shaped islands are TbOx(111). The TbOx(112)
   structure has a rectangular unit cell of dimensions (3.58 angstrom X
   8.86 angstrom) that grows in registry with the Cu(111) surface by
   aligning the short side of the rectangular cell parallel to a
   close-packed direction of Cu(111). Analysis shows that the longer
   lattice vector of TbOx(112) coincides with every fourth row of the
   Cu(111) surface, while the shorter lattice vector has a 5:7 coincidence
   relation with Cu(111). Lastly, we find that the TbOx(112) phase is less
   stable than the (111) phase and incorporates into the TbOx(111) domains
   above 530 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing number of high-performance periodic real-time
   applications in areas such as control systems, autonomous robots and
   financial systems. This article presents a novel algorithm, called
   Notional Approximation for Balancing Load Residues (NABLR), for
   scheduling these applications on high-performance computing resources.
   The algorithm utilizes a combination of task residual loads and runtime
   laxities to carefully plan task execution between two consecutive job
   arrivals, so that available resources can be fully utilized and avoid
   deadline misses as possible. The empirical study in our article
   presented at the 2011 International Conference on High Performance
   Computing and Simulation (HPCS) was further extended by including
   additional static task sets and a new adaptive task set generated by our
   motivating application in brain-machine interfaces, which simulates the
   control of movement of a prosthetic limb according to activities of
   input signals. Out of 25,000 task sets, NABLR can schedule up to 76\% of
   the sets versus 43\% by the best known efficient algorithm (named
   anticipating slack earliest deadline first until zero laxity
   {[}ASEDZL]), while incurring significantly smaller overheads than those
   of a known optimal algorithm (on average, 80\% fewer preemptions,
   migrations, and 75\% fewer scheduler invocations), and being comparable
   to those of suboptimal schedulers (within only 12\% more
   preemptions/migrations). Additionally, the evaluation results show that
   NABLR completes more task instances when compared with ASEDZL, which
   yields a greater system output accuracy. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)- and near-infrared (NIR)-active,
   multimodal composite nanocarriers (CNCs) are prepared using a simple
   one-step process, flash nanoprecipitation (FNP). The FNP process allows
   for the independent control of the hydrodynamic diameter, co-core
   excipient and NIR dye loading, and iron oxide-based nanocrystal (IONC)
   content of the CNCs. In the controlled precipitation process, 10 nm
   IONCs are encapsulated into poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) stabilized CNCs
   to make biocompatible T2 contrast agents. By adjusting the formulation,
   CNC size is tuned between 80 and 360 nm. Holding the CNC size constant
   at an intensity weighted average diameter of 99 +/- 3 nm (PDI width 28
   nm), the particle relaxivity varies linearly with encapsulated IONC
   content ranging from 66 to 533 x 10(-3)m(-1) s(-1) for CNCs formulated
   with 4-16 wt\% IONC. To demonstrate the use of CNCs as in vivo MRI
   contrast agents, CNCs are surface functionalized with liver-targeting
   hydroxyl groups. The CNCs enable the detection of 0.8 mm(3) non-small
   cell lung cancer metastases in mice livers via MRI. Incorporating the
   hydrophobic, NIR dye tris-(porphyrinato)zinc(II) into CNCs enables
   complementary visualization with long-wavelength fluorescence at 800 nm.
   In vivo imaging demonstrates the ability of CNCs to act both as MRI and
   fluorescent imaging agents.}},

Abstract = {{Light harvesting and triplet energy transport is investigated in
   chromophore-functionalized polystyrene polymers featuring light
   harvesting and energy acceptor chromophores (traps) at varying loading.
   The series of precision polymers was constructed via reversible addition
   fragmentation transfer polymerization and functionalized with platinum
   acetylide triplet chromophores by using an azide-alkyne ``click{''}
   reaction. The polymers have narrow polydispersity and degree of
   polymerization similar to 60. The chromophores have the general
   structure, trans-{[}-R-C6H4 C  C-Pt(PBu3)(2)-C  C-Ar], where R is the
   attachment point to the polystyrene backbone and Ar is either -C6H4-C 
   C-Ph or -pyrenyl (PE2-Pt and Py-Pt, respectively, with triplet energies
   of 2.35 and 1.88 eV). The polychromophores contain mainly the
   high-energy PE2-Pt units (light absorber and energy donor), with
   randomly distributed Py-Pt units (3-20\% loading, energy acceptor).
   Photophysical methods are used to study the dynamics and efficiency of
   energy transport from the PE2-Pt to Py-Pt units in the polychromophores.
   The energy transfer efficiency is >90\% for copolymers that contain 5\%
   of the Py-Pt acceptor units. Time-resolved phosphorescence measurements
   combined with Monte Carlo exciton dynamics simulations suggest that the
   mechanism of exciton transport is exchange energy transfer hopping
   between PE2-Pt units.}},

Abstract = {{Electron recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) results in
   significant electron loss and performance degradation. However, the
   reduction of electron recombination via blocking layers in
   nanowire-based DSSCs has rarely been investigated. In this study, HfO2
   or TiO2 blocking layers are deposited on nanowire surfaces via atomic
   layer,deposition (ALD) to reduce electron recombination in
   nanowire-based DSSCs. The control cell consisting of ITO nanowires
   coated with a porous shell of TiO2 by TiCl4 treatment yields an
   efficiency of 2.82\%. The efficiency increases dramatically to 5.38\%
   upon the insertion of a 1.3 nm TiO2 compact layer between the nanowire
   surface and porous TiO2 shell. This efficiency enhancement implies that
   porous sol-gel coatings on nanowires (e.g., via TiCl4 treatment) result
   in significant electron recombination in nanowire-based DSSCs, while
   compact coatings formed by ALD are more advantageous because of their
   ability to act as a blocking layer. By comparing nanowire-based DSSCs
   with their nanoparticle-based counterparts, we find that the
   nanowire-based DSSCs suffer more severe electron recombination from ITO
   due to the much higher surface area exposed to the electrolyte. While
   the insertion of a high band gap compact layer of HfO2 between the
   interface of the conductive nanowire and TiO2 shell improves
   performance, a comparison of the cell performance between TiO2 and HfO2
   compact layers indicates that charge collection is suppressed by the
   difference in energy states. Consequently, the use of high band gap
   materials at the interface of conductive nanowires and TiO2 is not
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the modification and dispersion and of

   mixing technique based on noncovalent interactions between
   poly(phenylene ethynylene)-based conjugated polyelectrolytes
   functionalized with cationic imidazolium solubilizing groups (PIM-2 and
   PIM-4) and MWCNTs. Spectroscopic studies demonstrated the ability of
   PIMs to strongly interact with and efficiently disperse MWCNTs in
   different solvents, mainly due to pi interactions between the PIMs and
   the MWCNTs. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy
   revealed the coating of the polyelectrolytes on the walls of the
   nanotubes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies confirm the
   homogeneous dispersion of PIM-modified MWCNTs in the poly(methyl
   methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix The addition of 1 wt \% PIM-modified MWCNTs
   to the matrix has led to a significant decrease in DC resistivity of the
   composite (13 orders of magnitude). The increase in electrical
   conductivity and the improvement in the thermal and mechanical
   properties of the membranes containing the PIM-modified MWCNTs is
   ascribed to the formation of MWCNT networks and cross-linking sites that
   provided channels for the electrons to move in throughout the matrix and
   reinforced the interface between MWCNTs and PMMA.}},

Title = {{SCR Atmosphere Induced Reduction of Oxidized Mercury over CuO-CeO2/TiO2
   Catalyst}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{7373-7379}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{CuO-CeO2/TiO2 (CuCeTi) catalyst synthesized by a sol gel method was
   employed to investigate mercury conversion under a selective catalytic
   reduction (SCR) atmosphere (NO, NH3 plus O-2). Neither NO nor NH3
   individually exhibited an inhibitive effect on elemental mercury (Hg-0)
   conversion in the presence of O-2. However, Hg-0 conversion over the
   CuCeTi catalyst was greatly inhibited under SCR atmosphere. Systematic
   experiments were designed to investigate the inconsistency and explore
   the in-depth mechanisms. The results show that the copresence of NO and
   NH3 induced reduction of oxidized mercury (Hg2+, HgO in this study),
   which offset the effect of catalytic Hg-0 oxidation, and hence resulted
   in deactivation of Hg-0 conversion. High NO and NH3 concentrations with
   a NO/NH3 ratio of 1.0 facilitated Hg2+ reduction and therefore lowered
   Hg-0 conversion. Hg2+ reduction over the CuCeTi catalyst was proposed to
   follow two possible mechanisms: (1) direct reaction, in which NO and NH3
   react directly with HgO to form N-2 and Hg-0; (2) indirect reaction, in
   which the SCR reaction consumed active surface oxygen on the CuCeTi
   catalyst, and reduced species on the CuCeTi catalyst surface such as
   Cu2O and Ce2O3 robbed oxygen from adjacent HgO. Different from the
   conventionally considered mechanisms, that is, competitive adsorption
   responsible for deactivation of Hg-0 conversion, this study reveals that
   oxidized mercury can transform into Hg-0 under SCR atmosphere. Such
   knowledge is of fundamental importance in developing efficient and
   economical mercury control technologies for coal-fired power plants.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix-assisted pulsed-laser evaporation direct-write (MAPLE DW) has
   been successfully implemented as a promising laser printing technology
   for various fabrication applications, in particular, three-dimensional
   bioprinting. Since most bioinks used in bioprinting are viscoelastic, it
   is of importance to understand the jetting dynamics during the laser
   printing of viscoelastic fluids in order to control and optimize the
   laser printing performance. In this study, MAPLE DW was implemented to
   study the jetting dynamics during the laser printing of representative
   viscoelastic alginate bioinks and evaluate the effects of operating
   conditions (e.g., laser fluence) and material properties (e.g., alginate
   concentration) on the jet formation performance. Through a time-resolved
   imaging approach, it is found that when the laser fluence increases or
   the alginate concentration decreases, the jetting behavior changes from
   no material transferring to well-defined jetting to well-defined jetting
   with an initial bulgy shape to jetting with a bulgy shape to
   pluming/splashing. For the desirable well-defined jetting regimes, as
   the laser fluence increases, the jet velocity and breakup length
   increase while the breakup time and primary droplet size decrease. As
   the alginate concentration increases, the jet velocity and breakup
   length decrease while the breakup time and primary droplet size
   increase. In addition, Ohnesorge, elasto-capillary, and Weber number
   based phase diagrams are presented to better appreciate the dependence
   of jetting regimes on the laser fluence and alginate concentration.}},

   through which optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM),
   optical coherence tomography (OCT), and pulse-echo ultrasound (US)
   images can be coaxially acquired and displayed simultaneously. The probe
   consists of a common optical path for OR-PAM (light delivery) and OCT
   (light delivery/detection), and a 40-MHz unfocused ultrasound transducer
   for OR-PAM (photoacoustic detection) and US (ultrasound
   transmission/receiving) with an overall diameter of 2 mm. Combining
   OR-PAM, OCT, and US would provide complementary information including
   optical absorption (OR-PAM), optical back-scattering (OCT), and deep
   tissue structures (US) about biological tissue. Based on an integrated
   imaging system consisting of OR-PAM, time-domain OCT, and US, phantom
   images and in vivo images of rat ear were acquired to demonstrate the
   capabilities of the integrated tri-modality imaging probe. The probe
   yields a lateral resolution of 13.6 mu m for OR-PAM and OCT, and an
   axial resolution of 43 mu m for OR-PAM and US. Currently, for a scanning

Title = {{A novel operant-based behavioral assay of mechanical allodynia in the
   orofacial region of rats}},

Abstract = {{Background: Detecting behaviors related to orofacial pain in rodent
   models often relies on subjective investigator grades or methods that
   place the animal in a stressful environment. In this study, an
   operant-based behavioral assay is presented for the assessment of
   orofacial tactile sensitivity in the rat.
   New methods: In the testing chamber, rats are provided access to a
   sweetened condensed milk bottle; however, a 3600 array of stainless
   steel wire loops impedes access. To receive the reward, an animal must
   engage the wires across the orofacial region. Contact with the bottle
   triggers a motor, requiring the animal to accept increasing pressure on
   the face during the test. To evaluate this approach, tolerated bottle
   distance was measured for 10 hairless Sprague Dawley rats at baseline
   and 30 min after application of capsaicin cream (0.1\%) to the face. The
   experiment was repeated to evaluate the ability of morphine to reverse
   this effect.
   Results: The application of capsaicin cream reduced tolerated bottle
   distance measures relative to baseline (p < 0.05). As long as morphine
   did not cause reduced participation due to sedation, subcutaneous
   morphine dosing reduced the effects of capsaicin (p < 0.001).
   Comparison with existing method: For behavioral tests, experimenters
   often make subjective decisions of an animal's response. Operant methods
   can reduce these effects by measuring an animal's selection in a
   reward-conflict decision. Herein, a method to measure orofacial
   sensitivity is presented using an operant system.
   Conclusions: This operant device allows for consistent measurement of
   heightened tactile sensitivity in the orofacial regions of the rat. (C)

Abstract = {{Tungsten is a candidate material for the first wall and divertor in a
   tokamak fusion reactor, in which it is required to withstand a high
   neutron irradiation. The defects created in cascade form the primary
   state of damage and their subsequent evolution gives rise to important
   changes in their microstructures and engineering properties. However,
   the evolution and aggregation of radiation- induced defects in atomic
   level can not be observed by experiments up till now. In this work,
   molecular dynamics (MD) method was used to explore the microstructural
   processes and atomic mechanism of the formation and evolution of defects
   in the initial stage of radiation in bcc-W. The range of primary
   knock-on atom (PKA) energies is 1.0 similar to 25.0 keV, and simulation
   temperature range from 100 to 900 K. The number and distribution of
   defects produced by displacement cascades have been studied; the
   influence of PICA direction and temperature on the number of steady
   Frenkel pairs has also been researched; defect clusters and the
   threshold energy have been simulated. The results showed that for
   morphology distribution of defects induced in the peak time of cascade,
   the more intensive the defects are, the less the steady Frenkel pairs
   numbers are, on the contrary, the more decentralized the defects are,
   the more the steady Frenkel pairs numbers are; the number of steady
   Frenkel pairs is insensitive to PICA direction, but has a trend to
   decline with the temperature elevating; the percentage of interstitial
   clusters is higher than that of the vacancy clusters, while vacancies
   tend to form larger clusters; the average threshold energy of W is less
   affected by temperature and has certain anisotropy. The results of this
   work can provide data for analyzing the behavior of W material under
   nuclear environment.}},

Abstract = {{The wear and friction behavior of ultralow wear polytetrafluoroethylene
   (PTFE)/alpha-alumina composites first described by Burris and Sawyer in
   2006 has been heavily studied, but the mechanisms responsible for the 4
   orders of magnitude improvement in wear over unfilled PTFE are still not
   fully understood. It has been shown that the formation of a polymeric
   transfer film is crucial to achieving ultralow wear on a metal
   countersurface. However, the detailed chemical mechanism of transfer
   film formation and its role in the exceptional wear performance has yet
   to be described. There has been much debate about the role of chemical
   interactions between the PTFE, the filler, and the metal countersurface,
   and some researchers have even concluded that chemical changes are not
   an important part of the ultralow wear mechanism in these materials.
   Here, a stripe test allowed detailed spectroscopic studies of
   PTFE/alpha-alumina transfer films in various stages of development,
   which led to a proposed mechanism which accounts for the creation of
   chemically distinct films formed on both surfaces of the wear couple.
   PTFE chains are broken during sliding and undergo a series of reactions
   to produce carboxylate chain ends, which have been shown to chelate to
   both the metal surface and to the surface of the alumina filler
   particles. These tribochemical reactions form a robust
   polymer-on-polymer system that protects the steel countersurface and is
   able to withstand hundreds of thousands of cycles of sliding with almost
   no wear of the polymer composite after the initial run-in period. The
   mechanical scission of carboncarbon bonds in the backbone of PTFE under
   conditions of sliding contact is supported mathematically using the
   Hamaker model for van der Waals interactions between polymer fibrils and
   the countersurface. The necessity for ambient moisture and oxygen is
   explained, and model experiments using small molecules confirm the
   reactions in the proposed mechanism.}},

   cooperation: Optimal algorithms and approximations}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{100-117}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{In traditional massive content distribution with multiple sessions, the
   sessions form separate overlay networks and operate independently, where
   some sessions may suffer from insufficient resources even though other
   sessions have excessive resources. To cope with this problem, we
   consider the universal swarming approach, which allows multiple sessions
   to cooperate with each other. We formulate the problem of finding the
   optimal resource allocation to maximize the sum of the session utilities
   and present a subgradient algorithm which converges to the optimal
   solution in the time-average sense. The solution involves an NP-hard
   subproblem of finding a minimum-cost Steiner tree. We cope with this
   difficulty by using a column generation method, which reduces the number
   of Steiner-tree computations. Furthermore, we allow the use of
   approximate solutions to the Steiner-tree subproblem. We show that the
   approximation ratio to the overall problem turns out to be no less than
   the reciprocal of the approximation ratio to the Steiner-tree
   subproblem. Simulation results demonstrate that universal swarming
   improves the performance of resource-poor sessions with negligible
   impact to resource-rich sessions. The proposed approach and algorithm
   are expected to be useful for infrastructure-based content distribution
   networks with long-lasting sessions and relatively stable network
   environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the problem of placing stationary monitors in a
   continuous space, with the goal of minimizing an adversary's maximum
   probability of traversing an origin-destination route without being
   detected. The problem arises, for instance, in defending against the
   transport of illicit material through some area of interest. In
   particular, we consider the deployment of monitors whose probability of
   detecting an intruder is a function of the distance between the monitor
   and the intruder. Under the assumption that the detection probabilities
   are mutually independent, a two-stage mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming formulation is constructed for the problem. An algorithm is
   provided that optimally locates monitors in a continuous space. Then,
   this problem is examined for the case where the monitor locations are
   restricted to two different discretized subsets of continuous space. The
   analysis provides optimization algorithms for each case and derives
   bounds on the worst-case optimality gap between the restrictions and the
   initial (continuous-space) problem. Empirically, it is shown that
   discretized solutions can be obtained whose worst-case and actual
   optimality gaps are well within practical limits.}},

   However, unlike vacuum-deposited OLEDs, solution-processed multilayer

Abstract = {{Engineered iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are one of the most
   promising tools in nanomedicine-based diagnostics and therapy. However,
   increasing evidence suggests that their specific delivery efficiency and
   potential long-term cytotoxicity remain a great concern. In this study,
   using 12 nm gamma-Fe2O3 MNPs, we investigated three types of uptake
   pathways for MNPs into HepG2 cells: (1) a conventional incubation
   endocytic pathway; (2) MNPs co-administrated with microbubbles under
   ultrasound exposure; and (3) ultrasound delivery of MNPs covalently
   coated on the surface of microbubbles. The delivery efficiency and
   intracellular distribution of MNPs were evaluated, and the cytotoxicity
   induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was studied in detail. The
   results show that MNPs can be delivered into the lysosomes via classical
   incubation endocytic internalization; however, microbubbles and
   ultrasound allow the MNPs to pass through the cell membrane and enter
   the cytosol via a non-internalizing uptake route much more evenly and
   efficiently. Further, these different delivery routes result in
   different ROS levels and antioxidant capacities, as well as
   intracellular glutathione peroxidase activity for HepG2 cells. Our data
   indicate that the microbubble-ultrasound treatment method can serve as
   an efficient cytosolic delivery strategy to minimize long-term
   cytotoxicity of MNPs.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: During critical incidents, teamwork failures can
   compromise patient safety. This study provides evidence that virtual
   humans can be used in simulated critical incidents to assess the
   learning needs of health professionals, and provide important
   information that can inform the development of continuing education
   programs in patient safety. We explored the effectiveness of information
   transfer during a devolving medical situation between postanesthesia
   care unit (PACU) nurses and a virtual attending physician.
   Methods: We designed a three-stage scenario: tutorial, patient transfer,
   and critical incident. We developed 2 checklists to assess information
   transfer: Critical Patient Information and Interprofessional
   Communication Skills. All participants were videotaped; 2 raters
   reviewed all videos and assessed performance using the checklists.
   Results: Participants (n = 43) who completed all 3 stages scored 62.3\%
   correct on critical patient information transfer and 61.6\% correct on
   interprofessional communication skills. Almost 87\% missed a fatal drug
   error. The checklists measured each item on a 1/0 (done/not)
   calculation. Additionally, no relationship was found between years of
   nursing experience and performance on either checklist.
   Discussion: The PACU nurses in this study did not consistently share
   critical information with an attending (virtual) physician during a
   critical incident, and mostmissed a fatal dosage error. These findings
   strongly suggest a crucial need for additional structured team training
   among practicing health care teams, and they demonstrate the utility of
   using virtual humans to simulate team members.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure and current velocity measurements were collected at a
   cross-channel transect in the James River under spring and neap tidal
   conditions in May 2010 to study cross-estuary variations in vertical
   mixing. Results showed that near-surface mixing was related to lateral
   circulation during the ebb phase of a tidal cycle, and that the linkage
   was somewhat similar from neap to spring tides. During neap tides,
   near-surface mixing was generated by the straining of lateral density
   gradients influenced by the advection of fresh, riverine water on the
   right side (looking seaward) of the transect. Spring tide results
   revealed similar findings on the right side of the cross section.
   However, on the left side, the straining by velocity shears acted in
   concert with density straining. Weak along-estuary velocities over the
   left shoal were connected to faster velocities in the channel via a
   clockwise lateral circulation (looking seaward). These results provided
   evidence that in the absence of direct wind forcing, near-surface
   vertical mixing can occur from mechanisms uncoupled from bottom
   friction.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Nuclear cardiology plays an important role in clinical
   assessment and has enormous impact on the management of a variety of
   cardiovascular diseases. Pediatric patients at different age groups are
   exposed to a spectrum of radiation dose levels and associated cancer
   risks different from those of adults in diagnostic nuclear medicine
   procedures. Therefore, comprehensive radiation dosimetry evaluations for
   commonly used myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and viability
   radiotracers in target population (children and adults) at different age
   groups are highly desired.
   Methods: Using Monte Carlo calculations and biological effects of
   ionizing radiation VII model, we calculate the S-values for a number of
   radionuclides (T1-201, Tc-99m, I-123, C-11, N-13, O-15, F-18, and Rb-82)
   and estimate the absorbed dose and effective dose for 12 MPI
   radiotracers in computational models including the newborn, 1-, 5-, 10-,
   15-yr-old, and adult male and female computational phantoms.
   Results: For most organs, Tl-201 produces the highest absorbed dose
   whereas Rb-82 and O-15-water produce the lowest absorbed dose. For the
   newborn baby and adult patient, the effective dose of Rb-82 is 48\% and
   77\% lower than that of Tc-99m-tetrofosmin (rest), respectively.
   Conclusions: Rb-82 results in lower effective dose in adults compared to
   Tc-99m-labeled tracers. However, this advantage is less apparent in
   children. The produced dosimetric databases for various radiotracers
   used in cardiovascular imaging, using new generation of computational
   models, can be used for risk-benefit assessment of a spectrum of patient
   population in clinical nuclear cardiology practice. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Path-differentiated congestion pricing is a tolling scheme that imposes
   tolls on paths instead of individual links. One way to implement this
   scheme is to deploy automated vehicle identification sensors, such as
   toll tag readers or license plate scanners, on roads in a network. These
   sensors collect vehicles' location information to identify their paths
   and charge them accordingly. In this paper, we investigate how to
   optimally locate these sensors for the purpose of implementing
   path-differentiated pricing. We consider three relevant problems. The
   first is to locate a minimum number of sensors to implement a given
   path-differentiated scheme. The second is to design an optimal
   path-differentiated pricing scheme for a given set of sensors. The last
   problem is to find a path differentiated scheme to induce a given target
   link-flow distribution while requiring a minimum number of sensors. (C)

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Smart shape-memory polymers can memorize and recover their permanent
   shape in response to an external stimulus (for example, heat). They have
   been extensively exploited for a wide spectrum of applications ranging
   from biomedical devices to aerospace morphing structures. However, most
   of the existing shape-memory polymers are thermoresponsive and their
   performance is hindered by heat-demanding programming and recovery
   steps. Although pressure is an easily adjustable process variable such
   as temperature, pressure-responsive shape-memory polymers are largely
   unexplored. Here we report a series of shape-memory polymers that enable
   unusual `cold' programming and instantaneous shape recovery triggered by
   applying a contact pressure at ambient conditions. Moreover, the
   interdisciplinary integration of scientific principles drawn from two
   disparate fields-the fast-growing photonic crystal and shape-memory
   polymer technologies-enables fabrication of reconfigurable photonic
   crystals and simultaneously provides a simple and sensitive optical
   technique for investigating the intriguing shape-memory effects at

Title = {{Monoaromatic, Diaromatic, Triaromatic, and Tetraaromatic Hopanes in
   Kukersite Shale and Their Stable Carbon Isotopic Composition}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3573-3583}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Abundant monoaromatic, diaromatic, triaromatic, and tetraaromatic
   hopanes as well as benzohopanes occurred in the Ordovician Estonia
   Kukersite shale. They were present in sufficient concentrations for
   reliable stable carbon isotopic composition measurements. There was
   almost no difference between steroids and monoaromatic steranes, but
   C-13 enrichments of 2 parts per thousand-4 parts per thousand were
   observed in aromatized hopanes, compared with hopanoids. Regular hopanes
   (C-27-C-35) generally are proposed to be sourced from the
   bacteriohopanetetraols (C-35), while aromatic hopanes were derived from
   the diplopterol and/or diploptenes (both C-30). Hopanoids were
   aromatized via a progressive pathway from the D-ring to the A-ring with
   increasing aromaticity, with successive losses of four angular methyl
   groups on the A-, B-, C-, and D-rings, as well as one of the
   gem-dimethyl groups at C-4 (i.e., C-23 and C-24). Thus, different
   hopanoid precursors with their own delta C-13 values as well as the
   successive losses of up to five carbon atoms in the aromatization
   pathway help to explain the ca. 2 parts per thousand-4 parts per
   thousand C-13 isotopic enrichment in the aromatized hopanes, relative to
   the nonaromatized hopanoids in the Kukersite shale. In contrast, the
   angular methyl group at C-18 in the steroid nucleus is not removed but
   migrated to C-17 in the formation of the C-ring monoaromatic steranes.
   Moreover, more rearrangement (75\%) and less aromatization (25\%),
   mainly for the formation of the C-ring aromatic steranes, occurred in
   steroid compounds. Thus, the delta C-13 values of the C-ring
   monoaromatic steranes exhibit no significant difference from those of
   the diasterenes in Kukersite shale. These monoaromatic, diaromatic,
   triaromatic, and tetraaromatic hopanes, as well as benzohopanes, in the
   Estonia Kukersite shale were the microbially mediated aromatization
   products of hopanoids in the early diagenetic stage. Their precursors of
   diplopterol or diploptene and abundant methylhopanes found in this study
   strongly indicate that cyanobacteria that previously had been suggested
   to have colonized with Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, was probably responsible
   for the microbially mediated aromatization.}},

Abstract = {{Although previous work has explored and reported the influence of
   biochar on the fate and transformation of soil nitrogen (N), the
   governing mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, an incubation
   experiment was first conducted to investigate the overall fate of NH4+-N
   in two soils: Gleyi-Stagnic Anthrosols (pH = 6.31) and Argi-Udic
   Ferrosols (pH = 5.05) amended with rice straw biochar. In addition,
   batch sorption experiments were designed to explore the potential
   mechanisms of NH4+-N transformation in biochar-amended soils. Results
   showed that the KCl extractable NH4+-N concentrations in the amended
   Anthrosols and Ferrosols decreased by 9-35 and 5-22 \%, respectively,
   compared to the unamended soils, but limited nitrification of NH4+-N
   into NO3--N was observed in both soils. In Anthrosols, biochar increased
   NH4+-N sorption, but it decreased N biotransformation (mineralization,
   nitrification, and assimilation) into NO3--N. It implies that the
   chemical sorption is a dominant process in the biochar-amended soil. As
   for Ferrosols, biochar seemed to have less effect on either NH4+
   sorption or biotransformation. Biochar addition promoted NH3 emission in
   both soils due to the elevated pH, but the overall amount of the N
   emission losses were negligible.}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainty of mass discharge measurements associated with
   point-scale measurement techniques was investigated by deriving
   analytical solutions for the mass discharge coefficient of variation for
   two simplified, conceptual models. In the first case, a depth-averaged
   domain was assumed, consisting of one-dimensional groundwater flow
   perpendicular to a one-dimensional control plane of uniformly spaced
   sampling points. The contaminant flux along the control plane was
   assumed to be normally distributed. The second case consisted of
   one-dimensional groundwater flow perpendicular to a two-dimensional
   control plane of uniformly spaced sampling points. The contaminant flux
   in this case was assumed to be distributed according to a bivariate
   normal distribution. The center point for the flux distributions in both
   cases was allowed to vary in the domain of the control plane as a
   uniform random variable. Simplified equations for the uncertainty were
   investigated to facilitate screening-level evaluations of uncertainty as
   a function of sampling network design. Results were used to express
   uncertainty as a function of the length of the control plane and number
   of wells, or alternatively as a function of the sample spacing.
   Uncertainty was also expressed as a function of a new dimensionless
   parameter, Omega defined as the ratio of the maximum local flux to the
   product of mass discharge and sample density. Expressing uncertainty as
   a function of Omega provided a convenient means to demonstrate the
   relationship between uncertainty, the magnitude of a local hot spot,
   magnitude of mass discharge, distribution of the contaminant across the
   control plane, and the sampling density. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Infestations by Prostephanus truncatus Horn (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae)
   and Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are
   prevalent in small-scale Zea mays L. storage facilities in Tanzania and
   other regions of sub-Saharan Africa. It is especially difficult to
   detect these species' larvae, which feed unseen inside the grain
   kernels. An electronic device that acoustically detects and reliably
   indicates the presence of such larvae could assist pest managers in
   maintaining the quality of the stored maize. A study was conducted in a
   sound-and vibration-controlled environment to estimate the amplitudes
   and spectral ranges of signals that an inexpensive electronic system
   would encounter while detecting insects in maize storage facilities.
   Larva-infested wheat kernels from a laboratory colony of Sitophilus
   oryzae (L.), a species similar in size and behavior to S. zeamais, were
   placed in a pouch and inserted near the side or the bottom of a bag of
   maize. An acoustic probe was inserted into the bag, and recordings were
   made at multiple positions, 5-35 cm from the pouch. Numerous sounds of 4
   different types were detected over a range of frequencies extending to 7
   kHz, well within the signal-processing capabilities of currently
   available low-cost microcontroller platforms. Larval sound impulses were
   detected frequently within 25 cm from the pouch, but not at 35 cm.
   However, adjustable-length probes could be used to reach within 30 cm of
   all maize kernels in the types of containers commonly used in regional
   storage facilities. Thus, there is considerable potential to develop an
   inexpensive sensor/ microcontroller system useful for managing stored
   product insect pests in sub-Saharan Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Immersion photolithography of electrospun SU-8 nanofibers followed by
   carbonization has been demonstrated for 3-D carbon nanofibrous
   microelectrodes. The process and resultant structures offer unique
   advantages: 1) precise patterning of nanofibrous microstructures via
   refractive index matching immersion photolithography; 2) good
   cell/neuron adhesion characteristic of the resultant scaffold attributed
   to nanomorphology in 100's nanometer scale; 3) high electrical
   conductivity of the carbonous microelectrodes appropriate for neural
   stimulation and signal detection; and 4) biocompatibility of the carbon
   nanofibers. Immiscible refractive index matching liquid, such as oil
   (n(oi)l = 1.47), has been applied to the nonhomogeneous nanofiber stack
   consisting of SU-8 nanofibers (nSU-8 = 1.67) and air (n(air) = 1) before
   ultraviolet light exposure, which greatly suppresses optical diffraction
   and scattering effects, resulting in high aspect ratio 3-D nanofibrous
   microstructures and enhanced patterning resolution. The aspect ratio of
   the fabricated 3-D structures is increased from 0.26 to 0.89 and the
   contrast ratio from 0.56 to 0.96, compared with ones from the
   nonimmersion process. Ray tracing simulation taking into account
   diffraction effects in nanofibrous media has been discussed.
   Microelectrode arrays consisting of integrated nanofibers and thin-film
   carbon structures are implemented for in vitro neuron culture
   experiments. Experimental results of structure's surface roughness,
   electrical conductivity, and cell viability on them are detailed.}},

   hydrothermal synthesis}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{We report on the development of a hydrothermal synthesis procedure that
   results in the growth of highly aligned arrays of high aspect ratio
   barium titanate nanowires. Using a multiple step, scalable hydrothermal
   reaction, a textured titanium dioxide film is deposited on titanium foil
   upon which highly aligned nanowires are grown via homoepitaxy and
   converted to barium titanate. Scanning electron microscope images
   clearly illustrate the effect the textured film has on the degree of
   orientation of the nanowires. The alignment of nanowires is quantified
   by calculating the Herman's Orientation Factor, which reveals a 58\%
   improvement in orientation as compared to growth in the absence of the
   textured film. The ferroelectric properties of barium titanate combined
   with the development of this scalable growth procedure provide a
   powerful route towards increasing the efficiency and performance of
   nanowire-based devices in future real-world applications such as sensing
   and power harvesting. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Critical infrastructures such as communication networks, electrical
   grids, and transportation systems are highly vulnerable to natural
   disasters and malicious attacks. Even failures of few nodes or links may
   have a profound impact on large parts of the system. Traditionally,
   network vulnerability assessment methods separate the studies of node
   vulnerability and link vulnerability, and thus ignore joint node and
   link attack schemes that may cause grave damage to the network. To this
   end, we introduce a new assessment method, called beta-disruptor, that
   unifies both link and node vulnerability assessment. The new assessment
   method is formulated as an optimization problem in which we aim to
   identify a minimum-cost set of mixed links and nodes whose removal would
   severely disrupt the network connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness
   of the problem and propose an O(root log n) bicriteria approximation
   algorithm for the beta-disruptor problem. This new theoretical guarantee
   improves the best approximation results for both link and node
   vulnerability assessment in literature. We further enhance the proposed
   algorithm by embedding it into a special combination of simulated
   annealing and variable neighborhood search method. The results of our
   extensive simulation-based experiments on synthetic and real networks
   show the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed vulnerability
   assessment methods.}},

Abstract = {{The full scale test house was equipped with the lightning protection
   system and connected to the 15 kV/400 V transformer station. The
   simulated stroke current was injected into the installation with a
   current surge generator. Distribution of current in the lightning
   protection system and connected power supply installation is presented.
   Measurements were done for several configurations of the LPS, and for
   current amplitudes ranging from 1 to 10 kA. The results indicated
   variation with both the amplitude and the shape of the waveforms. The
   resistance was measured for several groundings individually and for
   entire grounding system with respect to the surge generator location.
   Measured waveforms showed frequency-dependent behavior of the circuit.
   Therefore, in order to improve current simulation accuracy the grounding
   system impedance should be considered rather than pure resistance. The
   vertical ground rods of the test house have capacitive impedances, while
   the long underground cable connected to the grounding system of the
   transformer has inductive impedance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, lightning-induced voltages on multiconductor lines with
   surge arresters and pole transformers have been computed using the 3-D

   in which spatial discretization is fine (cell side length is 0.5 m) in
   the vicinity of overhead wires and coarse (cell side length is 5 m) in
   the rest of the computational domain. In the simulations, four-conductor
   lines with surge arresters and pole transformers are considered. The
   1-cm-radius overhead conductors are represented by placing a wire having
   an equivalent radius of about 0.12 m (approximate to 0.23 x 0.5 m) in
   the center of an artificial rectangular prism having a cross-sectional
   area of 1 m x 1 m (2 cells x 2 cells) and the modified (relative to air)
   constitutive parameters: lower electric permittivity and higher magnetic
   permeability. The computed lightning-induced voltage waveforms agree
   reasonably well with the corresponding ones measured in the small-scale

Abstract = {{The grounded guard trace ring is usually utilized to suppress the
   interference in high-speed printed circuit boards or IC packages.
   Although the guard ring can reduce crosstalk, its performance is greatly
   affected by the effectiveness of its design. This paper first
   investigates the mechanism of the crosstalk cancelation with a grounded
   guard ring. The paper then discusses and analyzes several grounding
   patterns based on a lumped circuit model. The analysis applies to the
   applications where the dimensions of PCB traces are smaller than 5\% of
   the wavelength at the highest frequency. It is found that the best
   grounding patterns for the guard trace ring is to ground its two ends
   instead of using multi-point grounding within the concerned frequency
   range from 10 to 200 MHz in this paper. The theoretical analysis and the
   developed technique are verified by electromagnetic field distribution
   plots and the four-ports scattering parameters that are simulated in
   ANSYS HFSS 3-D electromagnetic simulation software. Experiments were
   finally conducted to validate the analysis and the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{A new method to concurrently detect the vibration and distance with a
   beam-steering antenna is proposed. Unmodulated CW Doppler vibration
   radar is able to detect the distance to the target with a fast-switching
   beam-steering antenna. An adaptive beam-steering 2 x 2 phase-array
   antenna is developed for a 5.8-GHz Doppler noncontact vibration radar
   system. The antenna with -27 degrees to + 20 degrees beam-steering
   angles shows 85 degrees coverage for detection. The size of this
   adaptive beam-steering antenna is exactly the same as the original 2 x 2
   fixed-beam antenna. This adaptive beam-steering antenna with electronic
   switches provides 0.83-ms fast-switching rate for steering the beams.
   Furthermore, different dc offsets due to different propagation paths are
   measured under different beam-steering angles. The distance to the
   target can be accurately extracted with less than 8\% error by analyzing
   the dc offsets of the baseband signals at different beam-steering
   angles. This system successfully detects the architectural deformation
   caused by a seismic simulator.}},

Title = {{Hyper Jet Focused-Injection Tapered Capillary Plasma Source Concept}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2104-2109}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The concept of tapered capillary is introduced as a method of injecting
   focused plasma jet into the breach of bulk-loaded
   electrothermal-chemical (ETC) launcher. Tapered capillaries will operate
   in the confined controlled arc regime, and they can provide the
   advantage of producing focused hyper plasma jets useful for ignition of
   ETC systems at controlled plasma temperatures and pressures. The concept
   is also useful for focused implantation of plasma ions on substrates
   with desired patterns. Such tapered capillaries can inject plasmas at
   peak kinetic temperatures in the range of 14 000-21 000 K (similar to
   1.2-1.8 eV) and considerable jet pressures of 10-70 MPa for an input
   discharge current of 20-30 kA over a short pulselength of 100-150 mu s.
   A tapered geometry made of Lexan polycarbonate with 16.8-mm inlet and
   8.8-mm outlet radii produces a plasma jet with a plasma temperature of
   14 253 K (1.23 eV) at a peak bulk velocity of 4.027 km/s with a
   10.38-MPa exit pressure, and a total ablated mass of 10.56 mg. Reducing
   the tapering to 12.6-mm inlet and 6.6-mm outlet radii produces a plasma
   jet with a plasma temperature of 16 382-K (1.411 eV) at a bulk velocity
   of 4.34 km/s and a total of 23.27-mg ablated mass. Further reduction in
   the tapering to 8.4-mm inlet and 4.4-mm outlet radii produces a plasma
   jet with a plasma temperature of 20 954 K (1.8 eV) at a bulk velocity of
   4.89 km/s with a 70.78-MPa exit pressure, and a total ablated mass of
   15.09 mg. The preliminary study shows that the narrow tapering angle
   produces higher pressure, temperature, velocity, and more ablated mass.
   Radiant heat flux at the taper exit varies from 2.2 GW/m(2) for the
   wider tapers to 6.24 GW/m(2) for the narrower ones.}},

Abstract = {{Application of crop simulation models at larger spatial scales is very
   essential to develop best management practices in order to maximize
   yields and reduce environmental pollution. In the present study, spatial
   analysis of long- term simulations were carried out with DSSAT spatial
   analysis tool linked with GIS to estimate irrigation requirements and
   nitrate leaching under alternate rice establishment methods in the
   Wargal watershed, Andhra Pradesh, India. Rice yields were compared among
   three management scenarios: rainfed, aerobic and flooded systems. Grain
   yield, seasonal water balance components, nitrate leaching and water use
   efficiency were calculated, visualized and mapped with GIS. The rice
   productivity increased by 22\% and 27\% under aerobic and flooded
   management compared to rainfed rice. The adoption of new water efficient
   aerobic rice cultivation in the watershed resulted in 36\% water saving
   with a relatively small yield reduction of 4\%, thus increasing the
   water productivity to 0.77 g kg(-1) in aerobic compared to 0.56 g kg(-1)
   in flooded rice. The aerobic rice method reduced the overall water
   pumping hours to 88 h ha(-1) during rice crop season compared to 299 h
   ha(-1) with flooded rice cultivation, resulting in 71\% energy savings.}},

Abstract = {{The specific targeting of cells to sites of tissue damage in vivo is a
   major challenge precluding the success of stem cell-based therapies.
   Magnetic particle-based targeting may provide a solution. Our aim was to
   provide a model system to study the trapping and potential targeting of
   human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) during in vitro fluid flow, which
   ultimately will inform cell targeting in vivo. In this system magnet
   arrays were used to trap superparamagnetic iron oxide particle-doped
   MSCs. The in vitro experiments demonstrated successful cell trapping,
   where the volume of cells trapped increased with magnetic particle
   concentration and decreased with increasing flow rate. Analysis of gene
   expression revealed significant increases in COL1A2 and SOX9. Using
   principles established in vitro, a proof-of-concept in vivo experiment
   demonstrated that magnetic particle-doped, luciferase-expressing MSCs
   were trapped by an implanted magnet in a subcutaneous wound model in
   nude mice. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using an in
   vitro model for testing superparamagnetic iron oxide particles to
   develop successful MSC targeting strategies during fluid flow, which
   ultimately can be translated to in vivo targeted delivery of cells via
   the circulation in a variety of tissue-repair models. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{This work concerns the comparison of supercritical water reactor (SCWR)
   assembly designs using coupled reactor physics and thermal-hydraulic
   methods. In the SCWR, large density gradients in the supercritical water
   (used as coolant and moderator) will require detailed multiphysics
   analysis. The Super Light Water Reactor (SLWR) was analyzed previously
   {[}Hughes et al., Nucl. Eng. Des., Vol. 270 (2014)], where MCNP5 was
   coupled with density and temperature results from a single-channel code.
   MCNP5 then provided the single-channel code with a linear heat profile.
   In the present work, that proposed assembly design is determined to have
   a negative density coefficient of reactivity. Two alternate designs with
   different geometries and water-to-fuel ratios are presently considered
   to address this issue. It is found that adding an additional row of pins
   is more effective at producing a positive density coefficient than is
   reducing the size of the moderator boxes.}},

Abstract = {{Given a cross-layer network with logical and physical topologies, the
   survivable logical topology routing problem is to route each link in the
   logical layer with a path in the physical topology between the end nodes
   of a logical link such that the logical topology remains connected after
   a physical link fails. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
   formulation to determine such a routing has been considered in a recent
   paper. Using this formulation as a basic building block, in this paper
   we present unified MILP formulations to determine a survivable logical
   topology routing that also satisfies one of four cross-layer metrics: 1)
   minimizing the number of logical links to be added to guarantee the
   existence of survivable logical topology routing, 2) maximizing the
   capacity of the logical topology, 3) maximizing the connectivity of the
   logical topology after a physical link failure, and 4) maximizing the
   minimum cross-layer cut. We also provide heuristics for these problems
   and compare the performance of these heuristics and MILPs using
   extensive simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions influence our thoughts, opinions and actions. In
   this paper, social interactions are studied within a group of
   individuals composed of influential social leaders and followers. Each
   person is assumed to maintain a social state, which can be an emotional
   state or an opinion. Followers update their social states based on the
   states of local neighbors, while social leaders maintain a constant
   desired state. Social interactions are modeled as a general directed
   graph where each directed edge represents an influence from one person
   to another. Motivated by the non-local property of fractional-order
   systems, the social response of individuals in the network are modeled
   by fractional-order dynamics whose states depend on influences from
   local neighbors and past experiences. A decentralized influence method
   is then developed to maintain existing social influence between
   individuals (i.e., without isolating peers in the group) and to
   influence the social group to a common desired state (i.e., within a
   convex hull spanned by social leaders). Mittag-Leffler stability methods
   are used to prove the asymptotic convergence of the networked
   fractional-order system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new sol-gel synthesis route for alumina-samaria mixed aero- and
   xerogel catalysts based on the so-called epoxide addition method and the
   use of these systems as catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane
   (OCM) is reported. As precursors simple chloride or nitrate salts can be
   used. The mesoporous materials are X-ray amorphous even after
   calcination to 800 A degrees C and show an intimate mixing of Al and Sm
   on the nanoscale. In the case of the xerogels derived from chlorides,
   C-2 yields comparable to pure samaria can be achieved under OCM reaction
   conditions with 100 \% O-2 conversion. Even at lower O-2 conversions the
   activity of the xerogel is competitive with a pure samaria reference
   catalyst taking the lower samaria content of 20 \% into account.
   Accordingly, the approach is suitable to reduce the costs associated
   with the rare earth oxide. In addition to the preparation of aerogel and
   xerogel particles, the presented synthesis also allows the fabrication
   of xerogel films which can be coated on a suitable (monolithic) support.
   First results of such films are presented.

Abstract = {{We study a spectrum auction problem where each request from new spectrum
   users has spatial, temporal, and spectral features. Our goal is to
   design truthful auction mechanisms that maximize either the overall
   social efficiency of new users (a.k.a buyers) or the revenue of the
   spectrum owner (a.k.a seller). Given that the optimal conflict-free
   spectrum allocation problem is NP-hard, this paper proposes a series of
   near-optimal auction mechanisms based on the following approximation
   techniques: linear programming (LP) relaxation, randomized rounding,
   derandomized rounding, monotone derandomization, and Lavi-Swamy method.
   Comparing with the prior art, we make two significant advances: First,
   our auction mechanisms are not only truthful but also provide
   theoretically-provable performance guarantee, an important feature that
   existing work under the same auction model does not have. Second, our
   auction mechanisms support both spatial and temporal spectral reuse,
   which makes the problem more challenging than existing work that deals
   with only spatial or temporal reuse. We perform extensive simulations to
   study the performance of the proposed mechanisms, and the simulation
   results corroborate our theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Electrically conducting polymers (CPs) have been recognized as novel
   biomaterials that can electrically communicate with biological systems.
   For their tissue engineering applications, CPs have been modified to
   promote cell adhesion for improved interactions between biomaterials and
   cells/tissues. Conventional approaches to improve cell adhesion involve
   the surface modification of CPs with biomolecules, such as physical
   adsorption of cell adhesive proteins and polycationic polymers, or their
   chemical immobilization; however, these approaches require additional
   multiple modification steps with expensive biomolecules. In this study,
   as a simple and effective alternative to such additional biomolecule
   treatment, we synthesized amine-functionalized polypyrrole (APPy) that
   inherently presents cell adhesion-supporting positive charges under
   physiological conditions. The synthesized APPy provides electrical
   activity in a moderate range and a hydrophilic surface compared to
   regular polypyrrole (PPy) homopolymers. Under both serum and serum-free
   conditions, APPy exhibited superior attachment of human dermal
   fibroblasts and Schwann cells compared to PPy homopolymer controls.
   Moreover, Schwann cell adhesion onto the APPy copolymer was at least
   similar to that on poly-l-lysine treated PPy controls. Our results
   indicate that amine-functionalized CP substrates will be useful to
   achieve good cell adhesion and potentially electrically stimulate
   various cells. In addition, amine functionality present on CPs can
   further serve as a novel and flexible platform to chemically tether
   various bioactive molecules, such as growth factors, antibodies, and
   chemical drugs. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part

Abstract = {{There is an increased interest in treating arthritis of the medial and
   patellofemoral compartments without using a total knee arthroplasty. The
   purpose of this study was to measure kinematics in knees with a
   monoblock bicompartmental arthroplasty to see whether maintaining the
   cruciate ligaments and lateral compartment resulted in consistent
   kinematics more similar to healthy knees than those observed in replaced
   knees.
   The kinematics of ten knees with monoblock bicompartmental arthroplasty
   were observed using fluoroscopy during three weight-bearing activities.
   Model-image registration techniques were used to quantify the
   three-dimensional motions of the knee joints.
   During kneeling, lunging, and stair-step activities, the medial condyle
   remained relatively close to the centre of the tibial plateau, while the
   lateral condyle typically moved posteriorly with flexion. Knees
   generally exhibited motion patterns consistent with retained cruciate
   ligament function, but individual patterns varied significantly.
   Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty has the potential to retain more
   natural knee function. Improved tools for aligning the implants and
   increased implant sizing options may be required to achieve highly
   consistent results and realize the clinical benefit of a knee
   arthroplasty with intact cruciate ligaments.

Abstract = {{This article generalizes the dynamic and stochastic knapsack problem by
   allowing the decision-maker to postpone the accept/reject decision for
   an item and maintain a queue of waiting items to be considered later.
   Postponed decisions are penalized with delay costs, while idle capacity
   incurs a holding cost. This generalization addresses applications where
   requests of scarce resources can be delayed, for example, dispatching in
   logistics and allocation of funding to investments. We model the problem
   as a Markov decision process and analyze it through dynamic programming.
   We show that the optimal policy with homogeneous-sized items possesses a
   bithreshold structure, despite the high dimensionality of the decision
   space. Finally, the value (or price) of postponement is illustrated
   through numerical examples. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval

Abstract = {{Amorphous InGaZnO4 (a-IGZO) thin film transistors have been demonstrated
   on a variety of substrates, including flexible template like paper, tape
   and polyethylene terephthalate. Charge trapping at the a-IGZO/dielectric
   interface has been identified as a primary source of instability in
   these transistors. The valence and conduction band offsets are important
   parameters of these interfaces and should be sufficiently large to
   inhibit the injection of electrons and holes into the dielectric where
   they can cause threshold shifts and gate leakage. In this paper we
   report on the determination of band offsets in the HfO2/InGaZnO4
   heterostructure using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The valence band
   offset was determined to be similar to 038 eV +/- 0.03 eV, while the
   conduction band offset was determined to be 2.26 eV. The HfO2/InGaZnO4
   system has a nested or straddling gap (type I) alignment. We compare
   these bad offsets to previously reported values for HfO2 and other
   dielectrics on a-IGZO. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   multi-retailer inventory model for each warehouse, and on the
   uncapacitated facility location problem. The proposed integer
   programming model simultaneously makes decisions pertaining to location
   and inventory policies on two echelons of the supply chain, the
   warehouse and the retailers. We develop two Lagrangian-relaxation-based
   algorithms to solve this model, and compare their performance to that of
   a conventional branch-and-bound algorithm on randomly generated

Title = {{Effect of Amendment Type and Incorporation Depth on Runoff from
   Compacted Sandy Soils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Increased runoff rates and volumes from urbanizing watersheds are
   generally attributed to increased imperviousness within the watershed.
   While pervious surfaces in urban areas are often credited with having
   little runoff contribution, soil compaction can reduce infiltration
   capacity, leading to increased runoff. The objective of the research
   reported in this paper was to evaluate the hydrologic response of
   potential treatments for mitigating urban soil compaction. In the
   lysimeter study of the research reported in this paper, two Florida
   soils {[}(1)Arredondo fine sand, and (2)Orangeburg fine sandy loam] were
   compacted and potential mitigating treatments were applied to evaluate
   runoff reduction. Treatments combined two incorporation depths
   {[}(1)10cm, and (2)20cm] with three amendment cases {[}(1)no amendment,
   (2)compost, and (3)fly ash] and were applied to both soils. A set of
   compacted lysimeters for each soil were designated as controls and
   remained compacted (no treatment) throughout the research reported in
   this paper for comparison with amendment type and depth treatments.
   Runoff volumes were collected from 19 natural and simulated events over
   a 5-month period. Natural rainfall events ranged in depth from 4-59mm
   over 3-23h (average intensity, 1-7mm/h), while simulated events ranged
   from 50-114mm depths over 32-61min (average intensity, 91-124mm/h). Bulk
   densities, cone index profiles, and infiltration rates were also
   measured on each of the 42 lysimeters. Due to greater infiltration rates
   and lower bulk densities, tillage with or without compost at either
   incorporation depth produced significantly less runoff than compacted
   soils (mean runoff coefficients, p<0.005 and 0.03-0.14 compared to 0.19
   and 0.46, respectively; mean effective curve numbers, 62-71 and 40-49,
   compared to 87 and 75, respectively). Fly ash treatments did not
   significantly reduce runoff production compared to controls and
   increased runoff production on Arredondo soil. Based on a standard
   method, runoff production from control lysimeters was similar to dirt
   roads, while tillage treatments with or without compost produced runoff
   similar to vegetated open space in fair condition. These results suggest
   that 10-cm tillage alone may be an effective practice to substantially
   reduce runoff generated from shallow (20-25cm) compacted urban soils.
   Future research should focus on investigating shallower tillage depths
   and long term runoff reductions of tillage on urban soils, as well as
   potential effect of tillage and amendments, on landscape plant health
   and performance.}},

   winds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{36-43}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fragility modeling is a commonly used approach to quantify the risk of a
   structure subjected to high winds. In order to overcome a limitation of
   conventional fragility models where the performance of the roof cover is
   assumed to be fixed, we propose a new framework for obtaining the
   fragility of roof covers under high winds. The approach models the
   capacity related tel as functions rather than fixed values. Therefore,
   it can describe gradual increase of failure probability as the roof
   cover degrades over time. The parameters for the capacity functions are
   obtained from sensor measurements. In order to overcome the
   uncertainties associated with the limited measurements, a Bayesian
   approach is employed. Although the proposed framework can be applied to
   any type of roof covers, an illustrative example is given for asphalt
   shingles. Results show the importance of considering degradation of the
   roof cover in obtaining the fragility. The proposed approach provides
   much more comprehensive fragility functions than conventional approaches
   by considering the degradation of the roof cover. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Wear biomechanics in the slicing dentition of the giant horned dinosaur
   Triceratops}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Herbivorous reptiles rarely evolve occluding dentitions that allow for
   the mastication (chewing) of plant matter. Conversely, most herbivorous
   mammals have occluding teeth with complex tissue architectures that
   self-wear to complex morphologies for orally processing plants.
   Dinosaurs stand out among reptiles in that several lineages acquired the
   capacity to masticate. In particular, the horned ceratopsian dinosaurs,
   among the most successful Late Cretaceous dinosaurian lineages, evolved
   slicing dentitions for the exploitation of tough, bulky plant matter. We
   show how Triceratops, a 9-m-long ceratopsian, and its relatives evolved
   teeth that wore during feeding to create fullers (recessed central
   regions on cutting blades) on the chewing surfaces. This unique
   morphology served to reduce friction during feeding. It was achieved
   through the evolution of a complex suite of osseous dental tissues
   rivaling the complexity of mammalian dentitions. Tribological (wear)
   properties of the tissues are preserved in similar to 66million-
   year-old teeth, allowing the creation of a sophisticated
   three-dimensional biomechanical wear model that reveals how the
   complexes synergistically wore to create these implements. These
   findings, along with similar discoveries in hadrosaurids (duck-billed
   dinosaurs), suggest that tissue-mediated changes in dental morphology
   may have played a major role in the remarkable ecological
   diversification of these clades and perhaps other dinosaurian clades
   capable of mastication.}},

Title = {{FDTD simulation of direct lightning strike to a phase conductor:
   Influence of corona on transient voltages at the tower}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{128-136}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a simplified model of corona discharge for the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computations has been applied to
   analysis of transient voltages at the tower of a transmission line
   caused by direct lightning strikes to an upper phase conductor. In the
   simulations, three 40-m towers, separated by 300m, with one overhead
   ground wire and three phase conductors are employed. Corona is assumed
   to occur only on the upper phase conductor struck by lightning. The
   progression of corona streamers from the conductor is represented as the
   radial expansion of cylindrical conducting region around the conductor.
   The reduction of transient-voltage peak due to corona is not very
   significant, so that the voltage at the nearest tower exceeds the
   insulation level of 66/77 kV power line considered in this paper. For a
   10-kA peak current, the upper-phase-conductor voltage peaks are reduced
   by 26\% and 21\% for a positive stroke with 1-mu s- and 3-mu s-risetime
   currents, respectively, and those for negative-stroke case are reduced
   by 18\% and 13\%, respectively. For a 20-kA peak current, the
   corresponding upper-phase-voltage peaks are reduced by 32\% and 25\% for
   the positive-stroke case, and those for the negative-stroke case are
   reduced by 22\% and 15\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An uncertainty analysis of non-destructive assay of spent fuel using a
   delayed neutron method was conducted to explicitly define the accuracy
   with which plutonium content in an uncharacterized sample can be

   the sensitivity of this method to various nuclear data, and it was
   determined that the relative delayed neutron group abundances had the
   largest effect on the genetic algorithm. Specifically, for a sample
   containing U-235, U-238, and Pu-239, irradiations in the thermal
   spectrum were shown to be more sensitive to U-235 and U-239 data, while
   irradiations in a fast spectrum were shown to be more sensitive to the
   U-238 data. The overall uncertainties of the mass estimates were 15\%,
   5\%, and 30\% for U-235, U-238, and 239 Pu, respectively. Finally,
   reducing the first delayed neutron group abundances by a factor of three

Abstract = {{Similar to vascular plants, non-vascular plant mosses have different
   periods of seasonal growth. There has been little research on the
   spectral variations of moss soil crust (MSC) over different growth
   periods. Few studies have paid attention to the difference in spectral
   characteristics between wet MSC that is photosynthesizing and dry MSC in
   suspended metabolism. The dissimilarity of MSC spectra in wet and dry
   conditions during different seasons needs further investigation. In this
   study, the spectral reflectance of wet MSC, dry MSC and the dominant
   vascular plant (Artemisia) were characterized in situ during the summer
   (July) and autumn (September). The variations in the normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), biological soil crust index (BSCI)
   and Cl (crust index) in different seasons and under different soil
   moisture conditions were also analyzed. It was found that (1) the
   spectral characteristics of both wet and dry MSCs varied seasonally; (2)
   the spectral features of wet MSC appear similar to those of the vascular
   plant, Artemisia, whether in summer or autumn; (3) both in summer and in
   autumn, much higher NDVI values were acquired for wet than for dry MSC
   (0.6 similar to 0.7 vs. 0.3 similar to 0.4 units), which may lead to
   misinterpretation of vegetation dynamics in the presence of MSC and with
   the variations in rainfall occurring in arid and semi-arid zones; and
   (4) the BSCI and Cl values of wet MSC were close to that of Artemisia in
   both summer and autumn, indicating that BSCI and Cl could barely
   differentiate between the wet MSC and Arternisia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{486}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Intravenous injections of propofol emulsions are accompanied by
   pain likely due to the interaction of the dissolved drug with
   endothelial cells of the vasculature. It is commonly hypothesized that
   reducing the aqueous phase concentration of propofol could reduce pain.
   Methods: To minimize the propofol concentration in the aqueous phase, we
   developed stable oil-in-water emulsions with excipient oil mixtures that
   have an increased partition coefficient for propofol. We then explored
   the emulsion stability by measuring size distributions after extended
   durations of shelf storage and also after freeze-thaw cycling. The
   effects of oil type, surfactant and salt concentration on emulsion
   stability were also explored.
   Results: Small chain oils like ethyl butyrate exhibit high drug
   partitioning but poor stability, while larger molecules such as soybean
   oil exhibit lower partitioning but excellent emulsion stability.
   Emulsions with mixtures of soybean oil and ethyl butyrate are stable for
   longer than a year, resistant to freeze-thaw cycling, and reduce aqueous
   drug concentrations of propofol twofold compared to pure soybean oil
   emulsions.
   Conclusions: Oil-in-water emulsions of propofol formulated with mixtures
   of ethyl butyrate and soybean oil are kinetically stable and
   significantly reduce the aqueous phase drug concentration making them
   promising candidates for future propofol therapies. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A laser-generated plasma acoustic point source is used to directly
   measure the point spread function (PSF) of a microphone phased array. In
   beamforming analysis of microphone phased array data, the true acoustic
   field is convolved with the array's PSF. By directly measuring the PSF,
   corrections to the array analysis can be computed and applied. The
   acoustic source is measured in an open-jet aeroacoustic facility to
   evaluate the effects of sampling rate, microphone installation, source
   shift, reflections, shear layer refraction and model presence. Results
   show that measurements exhibit behavior consistent with theory with
   regard to source shift and shear layer refraction. Application of a
   measured PSF in beamforming analysis shows that the process provides an
   effective in situ method for array calibration both with and without
   flow and allows for corrections to incorporate reflections and
   scattering. The technique improves the agreement of beamforming results
   with the true spectrum of a known source, especially in the presence of
   reflections. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) polymer-modified asphalt (PMA) binder is
   widely known to provide superior performance, particularly in terms of
   cracking, as compared to unmodified asphalt binder. In recent years,
   alternative PMA binders have been developed to meet PG 76-22
   specifications and requirements from the multiple stress creep recovery
   (MSCR) test. However, existing tests/requirements may not be sufficient
   to ensure the quality of alternative PMA binders. This study evaluated
   seven types of alternative PMA binders using different tests, including
   existing Superpave PG binder tests, the MSCR test, and a newly developed
   binder fracture energy (BFE) test. Results showed that four alternative
   PMA binders can potentially have equivalent performance to SBS binder.
   Three deficient binders were identified in both the MCSR and the BFE
   tests. Superpave PG binder tests, however, distinguished only one as
   deficient. Compared to the MSCR test, which provides a qualitative
   assessment (pass/fail criterion), the BFE test brings the added
   advantage of providing a quantitative assessment of relative binder
   performance based on fracture energy density values. Findings appeared
   to indicate that the BFE test can be used as an effective tool for
   binder specification by state highway agencies.}},

Title = {{Salmonella enterica biofilm-mediated dispersal by nitric oxide donors in
   association with cellulose nanocrystal hydrogels}},
Journal = {{AMB EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Protected by extracellular polymers, microbes within biofilms are
   significantly more resistant to disinfectants. Current research has been
   instrumental in identifying nitric oxide donors and hydrogels as
   potential disinfectant additives. Nitric oxide (NO) donors are
   considered a very promising molecule as biofilm dispersal agents and
   hydrogels have recently attracted a lot of interest due to their
   biocompatible properties and ability to form stable thin films. When the
   NO donor MAHMA NONOate was dissolved in phosphate saline buffer, it was
   able to reduce the biomass of well-established biofilms up to 15\% for
   at least 24 h of contact time. Encapsulation of MAHMA NONOate and
   molsidomine within a hydrogel composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC)
   has shown a synergistic effect in dispersing well-established biofilms:
   after 2 h of exposure, moderate but significant dispersion was measured.
   After 6 h of exposure, the number of cells transitioning from the
   biofilm to the planktonic state was up to 0.6 log higher when compared
   with non-treated biofilms. To further explore the transport processes of
   NO donors within hydrogels, we measured the nitric oxide flux from gels,
   at 25 degrees C for a composite of 0.1 mu M MAHMA NONOate-CNC. Nitric
   oxide diffuses up to 500 mu m from the hydrogel surface, with flux
   decreasing according to Fick's law. 60\% of NO was released from the
   hydrogel composite during the first 23 min. These data suggest that the
   combined treatments with nitric oxide donor and hydrogels may allow for
   new sustainable cleaning strategies.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach was used to prepare engineered biochar from biofuel
   residue (stillage from bagasse ethanol production) through slow
   pyrolysis. The obtained biochar was characterized for its
   physicochemical properties as well as silver sorption ability. Sorption
   experimental data showed that engineered biochar quickly and efficiently
   removed silver ion (Ag+) from aqueous solutions with a Langmuir maximum
   capacity of 90.06 mg/g. The high sorption of Ag+ onto the biochar was
   attributed to both reduction and surface adsorption mechanisms. The
   reduction of Ag+ by the biochar was confirmed with scanning electron
   microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the postsorption biochar,
   which clearly showed the presence of metallic silver nanopartides on the
   surface of the carbon matrix. An antimicrobial ability test indicated
   that silver-laden biochar effectively inhibited the growth of
   Escherichicr coli, while the original biochar without silver
   nanopartides promoted growth. Thus, biochar, prepared from biofuel
   residue materials, could be potentially applied not only to remove Ag+
   from aqueous solutions but also to produce a new value-added
   nanocomposite with antibacterial ability.}},

Title = {{Hierarchical decomposition of dynamically evolving regulatory networks}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gene regulatory networks describe the interplay between
   genes and their products. These networks control almost every biological
   activity in the cell through interactions. The hierarchy of genes in
   these networks as defined by their interactions gives important insights
   into how these functions are governed. Accurately determining the
   hierarchy of genes is however a computationally difficult problem. This
   problem is further complicated by the fact that an intrinsic
   characteristic of regulatory networks is that the wiring of interactions
   can change over time. Determining how the hierarchy in the gene
   regulatory networks changes with dynamically evolving network topology
   remains to be an unsolved challenge.
   Results: In this study, we develop a new method, named D-HIDEN
   (Dynamic-HIerarchical DEcomposition of Networks) to find the hierarchy
   of the genes in dynamically evolving gene regulatory network topologies.
   Unlike earlier methods, which recompute the hierarchy from scratch when
   the network topology changes, our method adapts the hierarchy based on
   the wiring of the interactions only for the nodes which have the
   potential tomove in the hierarchy.
   Conclusions: We compare D-HIDEN to five currently available hierarchical
   decomposition methods on synthetic and real gene regulatory networks.
   Our experiments demonstrate that D-HIDEN significantly outperforms
   existing methods in running time, accuracy, or both. Furthermore, our
   method is robust against dynamic changes in hierarchy. Our experiments
   on human gene regulatory networks suggest that our method may be used to
   reconstruct hierarchy in gene regulatory networks.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear positioning is a crucial cell function, but how a migrating cell
   positions its nucleus is not understood. Using traction-force
   microscopy, we found that the position of the nucleus in migrating
   fibroblasts closely coincided with the center point of the
   traction-force balance, called the point of maximum tension (PMT).
   Positioning of the nucleus close to the PMT required
   nucleus-cytoskeleton connections through linker of
   nucleoskeleton-to-cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes. Although the nucleus
   briefly lagged behind the PMT following spontaneous detachment of the
   uropod during migration, the nucleus quickly repositioned to the PMT
   within a few minutes. Moreover, traction-generating spontaneous
   protrusions deformed the nearby nucleus surface to pull the nuclear
   centroid toward the new PMT, and subsequent retraction of these
   protrusions relaxed the nuclear deformation and restored the nucleus to
   its original position. We propose that the protruding or retracting cell
   boundary transmits a force to the surface of the nucleus through the
   intervening cytoskeletal network connected by the LINC complexes, and
   that these forces help to position the nucleus centrally and allow the
   nucleus to efficiently propagate traction forces across the length of
   the cell during migration.}},

Title = {{Does decadal climate variation influence wheat and maize production in

Abstract = {{Linking decadal variability with short-term variability could be
   potentially exploited for improving seasonal climate forecasting for
   assisting crop management decisions. The objective of this study was to
   explore whether there are decadal variations in wheat (winter crop) and
   maize (summer crop) production and whether these decadal variations
   correlate with any known variations of climate. Over one hundred years
   of wheat and maize yields were simulated using process-based crop models
   with dynamically downscaled daily reanalysis data over four locations in
   the southeast USA. Using wavelet and cross-wavelet analysis, we found
   that winter crop yields were dominated by 10- and 22-year decadal
   oscillations; the decadal variations of winter crop yields were driven
   by decadal variations of winter temperature and spring precipitation; no
   decadal variations were detected for summer crop yields and summer
   precipitation and temperature. Cross-wavelet analysis showed that the
   decadal variations of winter crop yields were correlated with indices of
   the annual Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), the annual Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO). Therefore, this knowledge of decadal climate variability could
   potentially be leveraged to predict winter seasonal yields of crops. (C)

Title = {{A numerical solver for high dimensional transient Fokker-Planck equation
   in modeling polymeric fluids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{149-168}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a tensor decomposition approach combined with Chebyshev
   spectral differentiation is presented to solve the high dimensional
   transient Fokker-Planck equations (FPE) arising in the simulation of
   polymeric fluids via multi-bead-spring (MBS) model. Generalizing the
   authors' previous work on the stationary FPE, the transient solution is
   obtained in a single CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) form for all
   times via the alternating least squares algorithm. This is accomplished
   by treating the temporal dimension in the same manner as all other
   spatial dimensions, thereby decoupling it from them. As a result, the
   transient solution is obtained without resorting to expensive time
   stepping schemes. A new, relaxed approach for imposing the vanishing
   boundary conditions is proposed, improving the quality of the
   approximation. The asymptotic behavior of the temporal basis functions
   is studied. The proposed solver scales very well with the dimensionality
   of the MBS model. Numerical results for systems up to 14 dimensional
   state space are successfully obtained on a regular personal computer and
   compared with the corresponding matrix Riccati differential equation
   (for linear models) or Monte Carlo simulations (for nonlinear models).

   material behaviour with high fidelity has remained an outstanding
   problem for many years. In a recent letter, Gillman \& Matous (2014

   accurately evaluated the three-point microstructural parameter that
   arises in third-order theories and predicted with high accuracy the
   effective thermal conductivity of highly packed material systems.
   Expanding this work here, we predict for the first time effective
   thermo-mechanical properties of granular Platonic solid packs using
   third-order statistical micromechanics. Systems of impenetrable and
   penetrable spheres are considered to verify adaptive methods for
   computing n-point probability functions directly from three-dimensional

   Moreover, a significant shape effect is discovered for the effective
   thermal conductivity of highly packed composites, whereas a moderate

Abstract = {{This paper reports the magnetic properties of 2 mu m thick electroplated
   isotropic L1(0) CoPt films on silicon at temperatures ranging from 300K
   to 790 K, as well as the room-temperature properties of the films after
   various thermal cycles. Electroplated equiatomic CoPt layers require a
   post-deposition annealing typically at similar to 973K to induce L1(0)
   ordering so that they exhibit hard magnetic properties at room
   temperature. However, the influence of temperature on these
   post-deposition annealed films is an important consideration for their
   utility in end applications. Here, a reversible temperature coefficient
   of remanence of 0.11\% K-1 is measured along with a maximum operating
   temperature of 400 K (recovery to 95\% of the initial remanence). The
   maximal energy density of the films is reduced by 50\% at a temperature
   of 550 K. However, the original room-temperature magnetic properties are
   shown to be fully recoverable by remagnetization after various thermal
   cycles-800 K for 15 min in Ar, 373 K for 168 h in air, and 358 K for 168
   h in air at 85\% relative humidity. These investigations indicate that
   the electroplated L1(0) CoPt layers, like bulk, exhibit good thermal
   robustness, satisfying a key requirement for their use in end
   applications, such as magnetic microsystems. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{In an organic light-emitting diode (OLED), only about 20-30\% of the
   generated light can be extracted because of the light lost to the thin
   film guided modes and surface plasmon. Using corrugated
   high-index-refractive substrates, the thin film guided modes can be
   effectively out-coupled from the device because of the high index
   substrate and the loss to the surface plamon is suppressed due to the
   corrugated structure. With an additional macro lens attached to the
   substrate to extract the substrate mode, we finally demonstrated a green
   phosphorescent OLED with an extremely high external quantum efficiency
   of 63\%.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon is one of the most studied materials, yet questions remain
   unanswered about its unusual property of growing a self-limiting native
   oxide that attains its final thickness in a matter of hours yet months
   later has not grown further. For the first time, we have explored this
   self-limiting growth in terms of repulsive van der Waals (vdW) forces
   generated by the combination of material properties inherent to the
   system. These repulsive forces represent an energy barrier preventing
   additional oxidizing chemicals, mainly oxygen and water, from adsorbing
   on the surface as well as hindering diffusion of those that do adsorb
   toward the interface. We have also proven that this native oxide can be
   increased in thickness at room temperature and without reactive species
   by changing the oxidation environment to one predicted by theory to
   result in attractive vdW forces, thus allowing oxygen/water to interact
   with the surface more freely.}},

Abstract = {{How cells maintain nuclear shape and position against various
   intracellular and extracellular forces is not well understood, although
   defects in nuclear mechanical homeostasis are associated with a variety
   of human diseases. We estimated the force required to displace and
   deform the nucleus in adherent living cells with a technique to locally
   pull the nuclear surface. A minimum pulling force of a few
   nanonewtons-far greater than typical intracellular motor forces-was
   required to significantly displace and deform the nucleus. Upon force
   removal, the original shape and position were restored quickly within a
   few seconds. This stiff, elastic response required the presence of
   vimentin, lamin A/C, and SUN (Sad1p, UNC-84)-domain protein linkages,
   but not F-actin or micro-tubules. Although F-actin and microtubules are
   known to exert mechanical forces on the nuclear surface through
   molecular motor activity, we conclude that the intermediate filament
   networks maintain nuclear mechanical homeostasis against localized
   forces.}},

Abstract = {{We examine a pore in an energetic material whose collapse following the
   passage of a strong genesis shock wave, the subsequent ignition of
   reactive gases within it produced by pyrolysis at the pore boundary, and
   the emission of shock waves as a consequence of this ignition, can lead
   to a detonation. The interest in such a problem arises from the interest
   in knowing the sensitivity and therefore the safe-handling protocol of
   energetic materials. We follow the initial pore collapse, before melting
   occurs, using rational analytical strategies, but to describe the later
   stages, with full coupling between the physics in the condensate and
   those in the pore cavity, we describe a numerical strategy. The results
   provide a description of the power deposition into the energetic
   material and lead to a power deposition model for the macro-scale, one
   that encompasses a number of pores. For suitable parameter choices,
   shock waves generated by the pores interact to form a detonation
   upstream of the genesis shock.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{837-859}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A 6-node co-rotational triangular elasto-plastic shell element is
   developed. The local coordinate system of the element is defined by the
   vectors directing from one vertex to the other two vertices and their
   cross product. Based on such a co-rotational framework, the element
   rigid-body rotations are excluded in calculating the local nodal
   variables from the global nodal variables. The two smallest components
   of each nodal orientation vector are defined as rotational variables,
   resulting in the desired additive property for all nodal variables in a
   nonlinear incremental solution procedure. Different from other existing
   co-rotational finite element formulations, both the element tangent
   stiffness matrices in the local and in the global coordinate systems are
   symmetric owing to the commutativity of the nodal variables in
   calculating the second derivatives of the strain energy with respect to
   the local nodal variables and, through chain differentiation, with
   respect to the global nodal variables. For elasto-plastic analysis, the
   Maxwell-Huber-Hencky-von Mises yield criterion is employed together with
   the backward-Euler return-mapping method for the evaluation of the
   elasto-plastic stress state, where a consistent tangent modulus matrix
   is employed. To overcome locking problems, the assumed linear membrane
   strains and shear strains are obtained by using the line integration
   method proposed by MacNeal, and the assumed higher-order membrane
   strains are obtained by enforcing the stationarity of the mixed
   displacement-strain canonical functional, these assumed strains are then
   employed to replace the corresponding conforming strains. The
   reliability and convergence of the present 6-node triangular shell
   element formulation are verified through two elastic plate patch tests
   as well as two elastic and five elasto-plastic plate/shell problems
   undergoing large displacements and large rotations.}},

Abstract = {{The Cognitive Driving Framework is a novel method for forecasting the
   future states of a multi-agent system that takes into consideration both
   the intentions of the agents as well as their beliefs about the
   environment. This is particularly useful for autonomous vehicles
   operating in an urban environment. The algorithm maintains a posterior
   probability distribution over agent intents and beliefs in order to more
   accurately forecast their future behavior. This allows an agent
   navigating the environment to recognize dangerous situations earlier and
   more accurately than competing algorithms, therefore allowing the agent
   take actions in order to prevent collisions. This paper presents the
   Cognitive Driving Framework in detail and describes its application to
   intersection navigation for autonomous vehicles. The effects of
   different parameter choices on the performance of the algorithm are
   analyzed and experiments are conducted demonstrating the ability of the
   algorithm to predict and prevent automobile collisions caused by human
   error in multiple intersection navigation scenarios. The results are
   compared to the performance of prevailing methods; namely reactionary
   planning and constant velocity forecasting.}},

Title = {{Planting Rate and Depth Effects on Tifton 85 Bermudagrass Establishment
   using Rhizomes}},
Journal = {{CROP SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1338-1345}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{As with stolons, planting rate of rhizomes is important for successful
   establishment of cultivar Tifton 85 bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.).
   Planting depth is another aspect to be considered when establishing
   rhizomes in soils with low moisture retention. Shallow planting can
   increase sprouting and emergence; but if rhizomes are placed too shallow
   they may dry out without irrigation. The overall objective was to
   evaluate the effect of rhizome planting rate and depth on establishment
   success. Treatments were the factorial combinations of three planting
   rates (Low-2.6 m(3) ha(-1), Medium-5.2 m(3) ha(-1), and High-10.4 m(3)
   ha(-1)) and two planting depths (6 and 12 cm). High planting rate
   increased Tifton 85 frequency, ground cover, and herbage dry matter
   (DM), independent of planting depth. In both years, the High rate
   resulted in 100\% grass frequency and ground cover before 120 d after
   planting. Also, this treatment produced more than 2300 kg DM ha(-1) in
   the establishment year, and this was greater than the Medium and Low
   rates (1230 and 900 kg ha(-1), respectively) when planted at 6 cm, or
   than the Low rate planted at 12 cm (1430 kg ha(-1)). When using Low or
   Medium rates, planting at a 12-cm depth, improved overall performance
   compared with 6 cm. Medium rhizome planting rate of similar to 5 m(3)
   ha(-1) at a 12-cm depth provided satisfactory ground cover and herbage
   DM at lower cost than High and thus is recommended for the sandy soils
   in the Suwanee River basin.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recently, sparse adaptive learning algorithms have been developed to
   exploit system sparsity as well as to mitigate various noise
   disturbances in many applications. In particular, in sparse channel
   estimation, the parameter vector with sparsity characteristic can be
   well estimated from noisy measurements through a sparse adaptive filter.
   In previous studies, most works use the mean square error (MSE) based
   cost to develop sparse filters, which is rational under the assumption
   of Gaussian distributions. However, Gaussian assumption does not always
   hold in real-world environments. To address this issue, we incorporate
   in this work an l(1)-norm or a reweighted l(1)-norm into the minimum
   error entropy (MEE) criterion to develop new sparse adaptive filters,
   which may perform much better than the MSE based methods, especially in
   heavy-tailed non-Gaussian situations, since the error entropy can
   capture higher-order statistics of the errors. In addition, a new
   approximator of l(0)-norm, based on the correntropy induced metric
   (CIM), is also used as a sparsity penalty term (SPT). We analyze the
   mean square convergence of the proposed new sparse adaptive filters. An
   energy conservation relation is derived and a sufficient condition is
   obtained, which ensures the mean square convergence. Simulation results
   confirm the superior performance of the new algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about what factors influence the climbing ability of bed
   bugs, Cimex lectularius L. (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), in relation to the
   various surfaces they encounter. We examined how sex, time since last
   fed, and what surfaces the bed bugs were in contact with affected their
   climbing performance. The effects of sex and time since fed were tested
   by counting the number of bed bugs able to climb a 45 degrees slope. The
   pulling force was recorded using an analytical balance technique that
   captured the sequential vertical pulling force output of bed bugs
   attached to various surfaces. Recently fed female bed bugs were found to
   have the most difficulty in climbing smooth surfaces in comparison with
   males. This difference can be explained by the larger weight gained from
   bloodmeals by female bed bugs. A variety of vertical pulling forces were
   observed on surfaces ranging from sandpaper to talc powder-covered
   glass. For surfaces not treated with talc powder, bed bugs generated the
   least amount of vertical pulling force from synthetically created 0.6-mu
   m plastron surfaces. This vast range in the ability of bed bugs to grip
   onto various surfaces may have implications on limiting bed bugs
   dispersal and hitchhiking behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its high sugar content, sugarbeets are excellent feedstock for
   biogas production. Its limited annual harvests necessitate appropriate
   yet economic storage prior to anaerobic digestion. In present study,
   biomethane potential of frozen and freshly harvested sugarbeets was
   compared with low cost airtight ambient temperature storage. For
   airtight stored sugarbeets, the maximum rate of methane production was
   12.4 L CH4 STP/kg/d, which was the highest amongst the three types of
   storage studied, and methane yield was 360.8 LCH4 STP/kg VS which was
   lower than frozen sugarbeets 423.4 L CH4 STP/kg VS but higher than fresh
   sugarbeets 220.2 L CH4 STP/kg VS. It was also observed that size
   reduction increases the rate of production of biogas but not biomethane
   yield. Duration of digestion of frozen beets was decreased by 40\% when
   the beets were coarsely shredded to 3 cm in size. Rate of methane
   production from airtight stored sugarbeets was higher than that from
   size-reduced frozen sugarbeets, consequently the duration of digestion
   of airtight-stored beets was only about 75\% of the duration required
   for digesting shredded sugarbeets. Simple airtight ambient temperature
   storage may be a viable option for uninterrupted utilization of sugar
   beets as feedstock for anaerobic digestion between annual harvests of

Abstract = {{Metal oxide films can form on late transition-metal catalysts under
   sufficiently oxygen-rich conditions, and typically cause significant
   changes in the catalytic performance of these materials. Several
   investigations using sensitive in situ surface characterization
   techniques reveal that the CO oxidation activity of Pd and other late
   transition-metal catalysts increases abruptly under conditions at which
   metal oxide structures begin to develop. Findings such as these provide
   strong motivation for developing atomic-scale descriptions of oxidation
   catalysis over oxide films of the late transition-metals. Surface oxygen
   vacancies can play a central role in mediating oxidation catalysis
   promoted by metal oxides. In general, adsorbed reactants abstract oxygen
   atoms from the lattice of the oxide surface, thereby creating oxygen
   vacancies, while gaseous O-2 replenishes the reactive surface oxygen
   atoms and eliminates oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies also represent a
   distinct type of surface site on which the binding and reactivity of
   adsorbed species can differ compared with sites on the pristine oxide
   surface. Detailed characterization of vacancy-mediated rate processes is
   thus essential for developing reliable mechanistic descriptions of
   oxidation catalysis over reducible metal oxide films. Careful
   measurements performed in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) using well-defined
   oxide surfaces in combination with molecular simulations afford the
   capability to isolate and characterize such reaction steps, and thus
   provide information that is needed for developing mechanistic models of
   oxidation catalysis over metal oxides.
   In this Account, we discuss vacancy-mediated processes that are involved
   in the oxidation of CO on the PdO(101) surface as determined from UHV
   surface science experiments and density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations. These studies show that CO binds strongly on Pd atoms that
   are located next to surface oxygen vacancies, and diffuses rapidly to
   these sites during reduction of the oxide surface by CO. The enhanced
   binding also raises the energy barriers for desorption and oxidation of
   CO, but the difference in these barriers remains nearly identical to
   that for CO adsorbed on the pristine PdO(101) surface. These recent
   studies also show that oxygen from the subsurface efficiently eliminates
   surface oxygen vacancies during CO oxidation at temperatures as low as
   400 K, and thereby reveal a facile pathway by which PdO(101) surface
   domains can be maintained during oxide reduction.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 and Mn-Na2WO4/MgO catalysts for the
   oxidative coupling of methane}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL}},

Abstract = {{In this study, one of the most active catalysts in the oxidative
   coupling of methane (OCM), Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2, was investigated in detail
   using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   to obtain more information about this complex catalyst. A poorly active
   Mn-Na2WO4/MgO and two reference catalysts, Mn/SiO2 and Na2WO4/SiO2, were
   also included. XRD reveals the presence of Na2WO4, Mn2O3 and the
   alpha-cristobalite phase of SiO2 on the active Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst,
   which all have been identified as very important in the oxidative
   coupling of methane (OCM). In addition to facilitating the
   transformation from amorphous to crystalline a-cristobalite SiO2, the
   presence of Na2WO4 also yields a higher surface concentration of
   manganese. While this is necessary, it is not sufficient, for a highly
   active catalyst, as the poorly active Mn-Na2WO4/MgO also has a high
   manganese surface concentration. However, in contrast to the very stable
   Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst, the MgO support is not able to stabilize the
   specific Na2WO4 and Mn2O3 phases and a number of NaxWOy compounds with
   varying Na:W ratios together with MnO2 and mixed manganese compounds are
   identified by XRD. The broad Na is and W 4f XPS peaks support the
   presence of more than one NaxWO(3), compound on the surface of the
   Mn-Na2WO4/MgO catalyst. The fact that Na2WO4 and Mn2O3 are not stable on
   the MgO-supported catalyst is likely one reason for its poor activity,
   as the active site is believed to involve a distorted WO4 tetrahedron
   stabilized by Na (and a-cristobalite SiO2), and accessible Mn3+ in close
   proximity to the Na2WO4 may be necessary to yield a highly active
   catalyst. The Na:W surface concentration ratio of the Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2
   catalyst is significantly higher (5.8) than the stoichiometric Na:W
   ratio of Na2WO4 (2.0) revealing a surface enriched in sodium. This is
   due to some of the sodium interacting closely with the SiO2 as evidenced
   by shifts in the Na Is and Si 2p peaks to lower binding energies than
   expected for SiO2 and Na2WO4. The Na may be important in the activation
   of oxygen species on the surface toward hydrogen abstraction. The
   importance of the specific Na2WO4 oxide is further supported by the
   H4Na2WO6 phase which is observed on the Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst after
   reaction. This phase has not been identified previously on the
   Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst, but corroborates earlier conclusions that
   Na2WO4 is important and suggests that Na2WO4 is indeed involved in the
   hydrogen abstraction from methane, the important first step in the
   oxidative coupling of methane. The strong interactions observed between
   all the species (Mn, Na, Wand Si) on this catalyst may also indicate
   that the interface between Na2WO4 and Mn2O3 is important in this
   reaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Existing heat transfer correlations poorly predict the thermal
   performance of falling film evaporators utilized in MED (multi effect
   desalination) units. At typical operating conditions of these units,
   most correlations suggest that the two-phase heat transfer coefficient
   increases with the mass flow rate and is independent of the wall
   superheat. Although these correlations are valid within their particular
   range of parameters, they are not suitable prediction tools for MED
   units as they operate at high vapor qualities under a sub-atmospheric
   condition. In addition, strong interconnected effects of the wall
   superheat and the mass flow rate on the thermal performance are often
   unavoidable in the MED units. The present study aims to elucidate the
   thermal transport processes of the falling film evaporators utilized in
   these MED units. Results show, at a constant value of Delta T/m(f) which
   is a design characteristic of these units, the average heat transfer
   coefficient first decreases and then increases as the inlet mass flow
   rate increases. Result also indicate the wall superheat for this
   transition increases at higher values of Delta T/m(f). The detailed
   thermo-hydrodynamic physics of the involved transport processes is
   elucidated using the VOF (volume of fluid) multiphase model in the
   curvilinear coordinate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of determining high-accuracy minimum-time Earth-orbit
   transfers using low-thrust propulsion is considered. The optimal orbital
   transfer problem is posed as a constrained nonlinear optimal control
   problem and is solved using a variable-order Legendre-Gauss-Radau
   quadrature orthogonal collocation method. Initial guesses for the
   optimal control problem are obtained by solving a sequence of modified
   optimal control problems where the final true longitude is constrained
   and the mean square difference between the specified terminal boundary
   conditions and the computed terminal conditions is minimized. It is
   found that solutions to the minimum-time low-thrust optimal control
   problem are only locally optimal, in that the solution has essentially
   the same number of orbital revolutions as that of the initial guess. A
   search method is then devised that enables computation of solutions with
   an even lower cost where the final true longitude is constrained to be
   different from that obtained in the original locally optimal solution. A
   numerical optimization study is then performed to determine optimal
   trajectories and control inputs for a range of initial thrust
   accelerations and constant specific impulses. The key features of the
   solutions are then determined, and relationships are obtained between
   the optimal transfer time and the optimal final true longitude as a
   function of the initial thrust acceleration and specific impulse.
   Finally, a detailed postoptimality analysis is performed to verify the
   close proximity of the numerical solutions to the true optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable management practices are needed to enhance soil organic
   carbon (SOC) in degraded soils in semi-arid West Africa. We studied the
   effects of three amounts of nitrogen (N) (0, 60 and 120 kg N ha(-1)) and
   three amounts of phosphorus (P) fertilizer (0, 26 and 39 kg P ha(-1))
   application over four seasons on maize residue production, residue C, N,
   and P concentrations, and their impacts on SOC, total soil nitrogen
   (TSN), and total soil phosphorus (TSP) in the 0-20 cm soil layer.
   Combined application of N and P fertilizers substantially increased
   maize grain yield on average by 294 \% and biomass produced and returned
   to the soil by about 60-70 \% compared with no fertilization. Annual C,
   N, and P inputs from crop residue were significantly higher with
   combined application of N and P fertilizer. The increased amount of crop
   residue and consequent increased residue C, N and P returned to the soil
   significantly increased SOC, TSN and TSP in the 0-20 cm soil layer after
   four seasons. There was a significant correlation between the amount of
   crop residues returned to the soil over four seasons and SOC (r = 0.82;
   P = 0.007), TSN (r = 0.75; P = 0.020) and TSP (r = 0.69; P = 0.039). We
   concluded from these experiments that returning crop residues,
   application of inorganic fertilizer improves SOC, TSN and TSP
   concentrations and enhances crop productivity. The farmers who
   traditionally remove crop residues for fodder and fuel will require
   demonstration of the relative benefits of residues return to soil for
   sustainable crop productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical vagus nerve stimulation is a treatment alternative for many
   epileptic and depressed patients whose symptoms are not well managed
   with pharmaceutical therapy. However, the fixed stimulus, open loop
   dosing mechanism limits its efficacy and precludes major advances in the
   quality of therapy. A real-time, responsive form of vagus nerve
   stimulation is needed to control nerve activation according to
   therapeutic need. This personalized approach to therapy will improve
   efficacy and reduce the number and severity of side effects. We present
   autonomous neural control, a responsive, biofeedback-driven approach
   that uses the degree of measured nerve activation to control stimulus
   delivery. We demonstrate autonomous neural control in rats, showing that
   it rapidly learns how to most efficiently activate any desired
   proportion of vagal A, B, and/or C fibers over time. This system will
   maximize efficacy by minimizing patient response variability and by
   minimizing therapeutic failures resulting from longitudinal decreases in
   nerve activation with increasing durations of treatment. The value of
   autonomous neural control equally applies to other applications of
   electrical nerve stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of the static and dynamic hardness and compressive
   strengths of seven different commercially available
   pressureless-sintered (PS) and reaction-bonded (RB) silicon
   carbide-based ceramics is presented. The intent is to relate these
   mechanical properties to the microstructure formed during processing.
   Fine-grained sintered SiC performed better than coarse-grained SiC under
   indentation and compression loading. The sintered specimens had greater
   hardness and strength than the RB materials that contained a weaker
   silicon phase. Composite ceramics containing diamond and boron carbide
   as secondary phases exhibited greater hardness than the other materials.
   In addition, the compressive strength and hardness improved with strain
   rate of deformation for all the materials except for the RB materials
   and SiC-B4C composite. The weakening effect observed in the SiC-B4C
   composite during dynamic indentation can be attributed to the B4C phase
   which exhibits localized amorphization; however, the deleterious effects
   of B4C amorphization were reduced due to the strain-rate hardening of
   SiC.}},

Title = {{Piezoelectric energy harvesting through shear mode operation}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Piezoelectric materials are excellent candidates for use in energy
   harvesting applications due to their high electromechanical coupling
   properties that enable them to convert input mechanical energy into
   useful electric power. The electromechanical coupling coefficient of the
   piezoelectric material is one of the most significant parameters
   affecting energy conversion and is dependent on the piezoelectric mode
   of operation. In most piezoceramics, the d(15) piezoelectric shear
   coefficient is the highest coefficient compared to the commonly used
   axial and transverse modes that utilize the d(33) and the d(31)
   piezoelectric strain coefficients. However, complicated electroding
   methods and challenges in evaluating the performance of energy
   harvesting devices operating in the shear mode have slowed research in
   this area. The shear deformation of a piezoelectric layer can be induced
   in a vibrating sandwich beam with a piezoelectric core. Here, a model
   based on Timoshenko beam theory is developed to predict the electric
   power output from a cantilever piezoelectric sandwich beam under base
   excitations. It is shown that the energy harvester operating in the
   shear mode is able to generate similar to 50\% more power compared to
   the transverse mode for a numerical case study. Reduced models of both
   shear and transverse energy harvesters are obtained to determine the
   optimal load resistance in the system and perform an efficiency
   comparison between two models with fixed and adaptive resistances.}},

Title = {{Hazardous waste status of discarded electronic cigarettes}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{57-62}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The potential for disposable electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) to be
   classified as hazardous waste was investigated. The Toxicity
   Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) was performed on 23 disposable
   e-cigarettes in a preliminary survey of metal leaching. Based on these
   results, four e-cigarette products were selected for replicate analysis
   by TCLP and the California Waste Extraction Test (WET). Lead was
   measured in leachate as high as 50 mg/L by WET and 40 mg/L by TCLP.
   Regulatory thresholds were exceeded by two of 15 products tested in
   total. Therefore, some e-cigarettes would be toxicity characteristic
   (TC) hazardous waste but a majority would not. When disposed in the
   unused form, e-cigarettes containing nicotine juice would be commercial
   chemical products (CCP) and would, in the United States (US), be
   considered a listed hazardous waste (P075). While household waste is
   exempt from hazardous waste regulation, there are many instances in
   which such waste would be subject to regulation. Manufactures and
   retailers with unused or expired e-cigarettes or nicotine juice solution
   would be required to manage these as hazardous waste upon disposal.
   Current regulations and policies regarding the availability of
   nicotine-containing e-cigarettes worldwide were reviewed. Despite their
   small size, disposable e-cigarettes are consumed and discarded much more
   quickly than typical electronics, which may become a growing concern for
   waste managers. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Knee forces are highly relevant to performance after total knee

Abstract = {{Online social networks (OSNs) have revolutionarily changed the way
   people connect with each other. One of the main factors that help
   achieve this success is reputation systems that enable OSN users to
   mutually establish trust relationships based on their past experience.
   Current approaches for the reputation management cannot achieve the fine
   granularity and verifiability for each individual user, in the sense
   that the reputation values on such OSNs are coarse and lack of
   credibility. In this paper, we propose a fine granularity
   attribute-based reputation system which enables users to rate each
   other's attributes instead of identities. Our scheme first verifies each
   OSN user's attributes, and further allows OSN users to vote on the
   posted attribute-associated messages to derive the reputation value. The
   attribute verification process provides the authenticity of the
   reputation value without revealing the actual value to entities who do
   not have the vote privilege. To predict a stranger's behavior, we
   propose a reputation retrieval protocol for querying the reputation
   value on a specific attribute. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
   first to define a fine-grained reputation value based on users' verified
   attributes in OSNs with privacy preservation. We provide the security
   analysis along with the simulation results to verify the privacy
   preservation and feasibility. The implementation of the proposed scheme
   on current OSNs is also discussed.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive review of methods to assess building
   vulnerability for hurricane catastrophe models. The review identified
   five main types of assessment approaches judging by the underlying
   methodology: past-loss data, enhanced damage data, heuristic, physics,
   and simulation. The applicability of past-loss data-only vulnerability
   methods proved insufficient for the diversity of situations insurance
   companies faced. Therefore, modelers complemented this method with
   engineering and meteorology expert knowledge; these are the
   enhanced-data models. Expert opinion and subjective probabilities drive
   the heuristic models; these were short lived in the United States, but
   are still used when data are scarce. Component-based methods were
   developed as a more realistic alternative to enhanced-data models by
   assessing vulnerability within an engineering framework complemented
   with expert opinion. Simulation models enhanced the physical models with
   a probabilistic simulation of the wind-structure interaction and more
   realistic assessment of the hazard. This paper also reviews some
   influential postdisaster studies utilized for validation. In addition,
   this paper presents a temporal and spatial map showing linkages between
   models. The development of interior damage models, as well as the future
   of vulnerability models and possible applications, is discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Minimizing the peak power consumption of electrical appliances under
   delay requirements is shown to be NP-hard. To address this, we propose a
   ``family plan{''} approach that partitions users into groups and
   schedules users' appliances to minimize the peak power consumption of
   each group. Our scheme leverages the social network topology and
   statistical energy usage patterns of users. To partition users into
   groups with the potential of reducing peak power consumption, our
   distributed clustering scheme seeks such a partition of users into
   groups that the total power consumption in each group of users achieves
   minimum variance. Then, given a set of jobs of users' appliances to be
   scheduled in the next scheduling period, we use a distributed scheduling
   algorithm to minimize the peak power consumption of each group of users.
   Our simulation results demonstrate that our scheme achieves a
   significant reduction in user payments, peak power consumption, and fuel
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric density is the most important factor for accurate estimation
   of the drag force exerted on spacecraft at Low Earth orbits. Empirical
   models provide the most accurate estimation of the density currently
   available, although they still suffer from estimation errors. This work
   presents a novel approach based on Neural Networks for reducing the
   error in the density estimated by empirical models, along the orbit of a
   spacecraft. The Neural Networks take as inputs the density estimated by
   DTM-2013, NRLMSISE-00 and JB2008, three of the latest empirical
   atmospheric models available. Density estimated from the accelerometers
   of the CHAMP and GRACE missions are used as targets for the training,
   validation and testing of the Neural Networks. In addition, this work
   studies the use of the spacecraft's average speed as an input to the
   Neural Networks. The test results indicate that the Neural Networks
   produce density estimates with less error than the density from the
   three empirical models,studied. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Parameter and uncertainty estimation for maize, peanut and cotton using
   the SALUS crop model}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{31-47}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The generic and simple version of SALUS (System Approach to Land Use
   Sustainability) crop model was recently integrated in the DSSAT
   (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) cropping system
   model to provide an alternative approach to more complex crop models
   without the need for a detailed parameterization.
   A previous uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the model
   (SALUS-Simple) established that accurate estimation of 15 of the 20 crop
   parameters required for predicting crop performance under water
   limitation was necessary to achieve reliable simulations. The present
   study used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian stepwise approach
   for estimating crop parameters in SALUS-Simple using limited,
   end-of-season data (limited data case) and detailed in-season data
   (detailed data case). Independent testing were performed using data
   distributed with DSSAT version 4.5.
   Results of the detailed data case indicated that the estimated
   parameters resulted in smaller deviations between simulated and measured
   variables and in posterior parameter distributions with smaller
   variances. Independent testing showed that maize growth simulations
   (based on both data cases) were in good agreement with observations
   while peanut and cotton growth was simulated with mixed success.
   SALUS-Simple predictions using parameters estimated in the limited data
   case were concordant with observations for end-of-season biomass and
   yield, but simulations of in-season growth were degraded relative to the
   use of parameters estimated in the detailed data case.
   We conclude that the use of a sequential approach reduced compensation
   errors and, the use of a range of data types combined with a higher
   ratio between the number of data points and the number of estimated
   parameters significantly reduced uncertainties associated with the
   estimated parameters. Furthermore, model predictions based on mean
   parameter values can be regarded as reliable estimators of the expected
   values of the distributions of model predictions when an average
   prediction rather than a distribution is needed. Results from this study
   highlighted the principle that parameters estimated based on
   end-of-season data do not guarantee accurate prediction of in-season
   growth even if a Bayesian approach is used. The ability of the
   SALUS-Simple model to be parameterized or adapted for simulating
   canopy-level potential production of annual plants based on limited data
   is promising. Further testing of the model will help establish its
   response to different soils, climates and crops. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Smoothed least mean p-power error criterion for adaptive filtering}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{154-163}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel error criterion for adaptive
   filtering, namely the smoothed least mean p-power (SLMP) error
   criterion, which aims to minimize the mean p-power of the error plus an
   independent and scaled smoothing variable. Some important properties of
   the SLMP criterion are presented. In particular, we show that if the
   smoothing variable is symmetric and zero-mean, and p is an even number,
   then the SLMP error criterion will become a weighted sum of the
   even-order moments of the error, and as the smoothing factor (i.e. the
   scale factor) is large enough, this new criterion will be approximately
   equivalent to the well-known mean square error (MSE) criterion. Based on
   the proposed error criterion, we develop a new adaptive filtering
   algorithm and its kernelized version, and derive a theoretical value of
   the steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE). Simulation results
   suggest that the new algorithms with proper choice of the smoothing
   factor may perform quite well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{FIELD CROPS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{71-86}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major constraint to crop production in
   many agricultural systems globally. Application of phosphorus fertilizer
   is essential for optimal crop yields when soils are P limiting. Crop
   simulation models can provide an alternative, less time consuming and
   inexpensive means of determining the optimum crop P requirements under
   varied soil and climatic conditions. The CROPGRO-peanut model is capable
   of simulating the growth and yield of peanut in response to weather,
   soil, water, nitrogen and management practices but its capability in
   predicting crop responses to soil and fertilizer P needs to be
   established. Our objective was to adapt and evaluate the CROPGRO-peanut
   model within the DSSAT system to simulate the growth and yield of peanut
   (Arachis hypogaea) in response to soil and fertilizer P. Data from four
   P fertilizer treatments (0, 13, 26 and 39 kg P ha(-1)) and two cropping
   seasons (2002 and 2003) experiments on an Alfisol were used to calibrate
   the model. The model was tested using two data sets from a P fertilizer
   x cultivar trial conducted on-station in 1997 and 1998 and P fertilizer
   x fungicide trials on-farm in 2002. The limited testing showed that the
   P module accurately simulated the seasonal patterns of aboveground
   biomass and pod yield in the on-farm trials. Averaged across sampling
   dates RMSEs in the on-farm trials ranged from 100 to 398 kg ha(-1) (d >=
   0.99) for total biomass and from 97 to 263 kg ha(-1) (d values >= 0.98)
   for pod yield. At final harvest, the variability of simulated biomass
   and pod yield was about 5.4 and 10.0\% of the observed biomass and pod
   yield respectively. In the P fertilizer x cultivar trial, the
   variability of simulated biomass and pod yield were 22 and 13\% for cv.
   F-Mix and 19 and 5\% for cv. Chinese respectively. The model simulated
   the seasonal patterns of vegetative P content in the four farmers'
   fields fairly well with RMSEs ranging from 0.28 to 1.29 kg ha(-1) when
   averaged across measurements dates. The model outputs were sensitive to
   soil P test values, the method of P fertilizer application and to plant
   P uptake factors, such as root P extraction radius and root length
   density. There were differences in the sensitivity of the simulations to
   changes in target tissue P concentrations. Increasing or decreasing the
   optimum P concentration of seed and minimum P concentrations of leaf and
   stem had the greatest effects on pod yield compared to other plant
   parts. We conclude that the generic soil and plant P model in DSSAT 4.5
   is capable of simulating peanut growth and yield in response to soil P
   levels or fertilizer application on an Alfisol. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the semiactive case of a variable stiffness
   suspension system. The central concept is based on a recently designed
   variable stiffness mechanism that consists of a horizontal strut and a
   vertical strut, both of which are semiactively controlled by
   magnetorheological (MR) dampers. The vertical MR damper force is
   designed to track a skyhook damper force, while the horizontal strut is
   used is to vary the load transfer ratio by semiactively controlling the
   location of the point of attachment of the vertical strut to the car
   body. The control algorithm, effected by the horizontal MR damper, uses
   the concept of a nonlinear energy sink (NES) to effectively transfer the
   vibrational energy in the sprung mass to a control mass, thereby
   reducing the transfer of energy from road disturbance to the car body.
   The analyses and simulation results show that a better performance can
   be achieved by subjecting the point of attachment of a suspension
   system, to the chassis, to the influence of a horizontal NES system.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Effective monitoring of ecosystems is crucial for assessing and possibly
   anticipating shifts, quantifying ecosystem services, and optimal
   decision making based on shifts and services. The selection of
   monitoring sites is typically suboptimal following local stakeholder or
   research interests that do not allow to capture ecosystem patterns and
   dynamics as a whole. The design of optimal monitoring network is crucial
   for the accurate determination of biodiversity patterns of ecosystems. A
   novel model for the design of optimal monitoring networks for
   biodiversity based on the concept of the value of information (VoI) is
   proposed. The VoI is assigned to species richness that is the
   economically and ecologically valuable metric. As a case study the
   trinational frontier ecosystem among Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia is
   considered for the model. A multiresolution texture-based model
   estimates species richness and turnover on satellite imagery calibrated
   on different sets of information coming from forest plot data organized
   in network topologies. The optimal monitoring network is the network
   that minimizes the integrated VoI defined as the variation of the VoI in
   the 28 years considered. This is equivalent to minimize the sum of the
   species turnover of the ecosystem. The small world network is identified
   as the optimal and most resilient monitoring network whose nodes are the
   hotspots of species richness. The hotspots are identified as the sites
   whose VoI is the highest for the whole period considered. Hence, the
   hotspots are the most valuable communities for inferring biodiversity
   patterns and the most ecologically/economically valuable according to
   the richness-resilience hypothesis. Most hotspots are honored by the
   small world network that can be thought as the ``backbone{''} ecological
   network of the ecosystem. The small world monitoring network has an
   accuracy similar to 50 \% higher than other network topologies in
   predicting biodiversity patterns. This network has the highest VoI at
   any time step and scale considered; thus, it guarantees to track changes
   of ecosystems in space and time. The network that results from the
   optimal trade-off between data value with their uncertainty and
   relevance, has deep implications for understanding ecosystem function
   and for management decisions. The model allows to include preferences
   for ecosystem communities by using differential weights on the VoI of
   these communities, and economic constraints that limit the extension of
   the network. Because of the optimal integration of environmental,
   social, and economical factors the model allows a sustainable monitoring
   and planning of biodiversity for the future.}},

   characteristics of graphene oxide laminates}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{245-255}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of oxidation conditions during the synthesis
   process of graphene oxide (GO) flakes on transport characteristics of GO
   laminates is investigated. Transport properties of the GO laminates
   synthesized by different oxidation methods are characterized by
   measuring their ionic conductivity (via proton conductivity) and mass
   diffusion of species (via methanol permeability). These properties are
   observed to be significantly different for each sample owing to the
   difference in their physicochemical properties. It is determined that
   the two key parameters that dictate the transport characteristics of a
   GO laminate are the GO oxidation level and flake size. Through a
   parametric study, it is determined that at a constant oxidation level
   methanol permeability decreases linearly with increasing the GO mean
   flake size while changes in proton conductivity remain insignificant.
   This behavior is attributed to difference in adopted conduction pathways
   of protons and methanol molecules. With increasing the oxidation level,
   proliferation of surface defects is deductively reasoned to be the
   dominant factor responsible for a large increase in the measured
   methanol permeability. The proton conductivity is also significantly
   increased with increasing the oxidation level because of greater number
   of ion exchange sites, shortened transport pathway and increased GO
   flakes inter-layer spacing. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys in a tutorial fashion the recent history of universal

   filter. We call this class of learning machines convex universal
   learning machines or CULMs. The purpose of the paper is to compare the
   methods behind these CULMs, highlighting their features using concepts
   of vector spaces (i.e. basis functions and projections), which are easy
   to understand by the computational intelligence community. We illustrate
   how two of the CULMs behave in a simple example, and we conclude that
   indeed it is practical to create universal mappers with convex
   adaptation, which is an improvement over backpropagation.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates theoretical issues in applying the universal
   swarming technique to efficient content distribution. In a swarming
   session, a file is distributed to all the receivers by having all the
   nodes in the session exchange file chunks. By universal swarming, not
   only all the nodes in the session, but also some nodes outside the
   session may participate in the chunk exchange to improve the
   distribution performance. We present a universal swarming model where
   the chunks are distributed along different Steiner trees rooted at the
   source and covering all the receivers. We assume chunks arrive
   dynamically at the sources and focus on finding stable universal
   swarming algorithms. To achieve the throughput region, universal
   swarming usually involves a tree-selection subproblem of finding a
   min-cost Steiner tree, which is NP-hard. We propose a universal swarming
   scheme that employs an approximate tree-selection algorithm. We show
   that it achieves network stability for a reduced throughput region,
   where the reduction ratio is no more than the approximation ratio of the
   tree-selection algorithm. We propose a second universal swarming scheme
   that employs a randomized tree-selection algorithm. It achieves the
   throughput region, but with a weaker stability result. Comprehensive
   simulation results support the stability analysis of the algorithms. The
   proposed schemes and their variants are expected to be useful for
   infrastructure-based content distribution networks with massive content
   and relatively stable network environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an information guided framework for stochastic
   optimization with simulated annealing. Information gathered during
   randomized exploration of the search domain is used as feedback with
   progressively increasing gain to drive the optimization procedure,
   potentially causing the annealing temperature to rise during the
   algorithm's execution. The benefits of reheating during the annealing
   process are shown in terms of significant improvement in the algorithm's
   performance, while also staying within bounds for its convergence. A
   guided-annealing temperature is defined that incorporates information
   into the annealing schedule. The resulting algorithm has two phases:
   phase I performs nearly unrestricted exploration as a reconnaissance of
   the optimization domain and phase II ``re-heats{''} the annealing
   procedure and exploits information gathered during phase I. Phase I
   flows seamlessly into phase II via an information effectiveness
   parameter without need for user input. Conditions are derived to prevent
   excessive reheating that may jeopardize convergence characteristics.
   Several examples are presented to test the new algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Network coding is a technique which can be used to improve the
   performance of multicast communications by performing encoding
   operations at intermediate nodes. In real-time multimedia communication
   applications, there are usually several weights associated with links,
   such as cost, delay, jitter, loss ratio, security, and so on. In this
   paper, we consider the problem of finding an optimal multicast sub-graph
   over coded packet networks, where the longest end-to-end weight from the
   source to each destination does not exceed an upper bound. First, a
   mixed integer programming model is proposed to formulate the problem
   which is NP-hard. Then, a column-generation approach is described for
   this problem, in which the problem is decomposed into a master linear
   programming problem and several integer programming sub-problems.
   Moreover, two methods based on linear and Lagrangian relaxation are
   proposed to compute a tight lower bound of the optimal solution value.
   Computational results show that the proposed algorithm provides an
   efficient way for solving the problem, even for relatively large
   networks.}},

   an Eulerian Cartesian fixed-grid with a cut-cell scheme and marker
   points to track the moving interface. The unsteady, axisymmetric
   Navier-Stokes equations in both liquid and vapor phases are solved
   separately and used to compute the velocity, pressure, and temperature
   fields and the deformation of the liquid core very accurately. Three
   most common cryogenic fluids, viz. nitrogen, oxygen, and argon were

Abstract = {{The inability to vascularize engineered organs and revascularize areas
   of infarction has been a major roadblock to delivering successful
   regenerative medicine therapies to the clinic. These investigations
   detail an isolated human extracellular matrix derived from the placenta
   (hPM) that induces vasculogenesis in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo
   within bioengineered tissues, with significant immune reductive
   properties. Compositional analysis showed ECM components (fibrinogen,
   laminin), angiogenic cytokines (angiogenin, FGF), and immune-related
   cytokines (annexins, DEFA1) in near physiological ratios. Gene
   expression profiles of endothelial cells seeded onto the matrix
   displayed upregulation of angiogenic genes (TGFB1, VEGFA), remodeling
   genes (MMP9, LAMA5) and vascular development genes (HAND2, LECT1).
   Angiogenic networks displayed a time dependent stability in comparison
   to current in vitro approaches that degrade rapidly. In vivo,
   matrix-dosed bioscaffolds showed enhanced angiogenesis and significantly
   reduced fibrosis in comparison to current angiogenic biomaterials.
   Implementation of this human placenta derived extracellular matrix
   provides an alternative to Matrigel and, due to its human derivation,
   its development may have significant clinical applications leading to
   advances in therapeutic angiogenesis techniques and tissue engineering.

Abstract = {{Organ printing offers a great potential for the freeform layer-by-layer
   fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) living organs using cellular
   spheroids or bioinks as building blocks. Vascularization is often
   identified as a main technological barrier for building 3D organs. As
   such, the fabrication of 3D biological vascular trees is of great
   importance for the overall feasibility of the envisioned organ printing
   approach. In this study, vascular-like cellular structures are
   fabricated using a liquid support-based inkjet printing approach, which
   utilizes a calcium chloride solution as both a cross-linking agent and
   support material. This solution enables the freeform printing of
   spanning and overhang features by providing a buoyant force. A heuristic
   approach is implemented to compensate for the axially-varying
   deformation of horizontal tubular structures to achieve a uniform
   diameter along their axial directions. Vascular-like structures with
   both horizontal and vertical bifurcations have been successfully printed
   from sodium alginate only as well as mouse fibroblast-based alginate
   bioinks. The post-printing fibroblast cell viability of printed cellular
   tubes was found to be above 90\% even after a 24h incubation,
   considering the control effect. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112: 1047-1055.

Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The vegetation portion of the Florida Wetland Condition Index (FWCI), an
   index of biological integrity, provided consistent and repeatable
   measures of condition at eighteen wetlands sampled in two consecutive
   growing seasons. The sample wetlands reflected a gradient of adjacent
   land use from non-impacted reference areas to wetlands imbedded within
   silviculture, cattle pasture and residential areas. Wetlands were
   described as herbaceous depression (n=6), forested depression (n =5) and
   forested strand or floodplain wetlands (n = 7), and represented
   different states of succession. Even though the wetlands were unique
   from one another and occurred across a large geographic area in Florida,
   the FWCI results calculated for all the wetlands were representative of
   adjacent land use impacts and not sensitive to natural variation. During
   the duration of this study, changes in weather from drought to tropical
   storm conditions, as well as management activities such as fire and
   herbivoiy, impacted wetlands. These effects were apparent in the change
   of species composition between sampling periods; 23-56\% of species were
   different when resampled. Even though composition changed, the
   proportion of indicators remained consistent. The resulting condition
   scores suggested a one-to-one relationship between sampling periods. (C)

Abstract = {{Hydrothermally carbonized biomass (hydrochar) has received increased
   attention recently as a potential agent for contaminant remediation and
   soil improvement. There is a need to understand how the properties of
   hydrochar vary with production conditions. In this work, sugarcane
   bagasse, hickory, and peanut hull were converted into hydrochars at
   three different temperatures (200 degrees C, 250 degrees C, and 300
   degrees C). Basic physicochemical properties of the nine hydrochars were
   determined and batch aqueous sorption experiments were conducted to
   measure ability of the hydrochars to sorb methylene blue, lead, and
   phosphate. The yield, surface area, and pore volume of the hydrochars
   decreased with increasing conversion temperatures. Among all the
   hydrochars, the ones made at the lowest temperature (200 degrees C) were
   the best for sorption of methylene blue and lead. However, none of the
   hydrochars were able to remove significant amounts of phosphate from
   solution. In addition, the hydrochars did not significantly affect seed
   germination rate, though some did have a significant effect on root
   development of seedlings. Findings from this work suggest that lower
   temperature hydrochars may be optimal for contaminant remediation
   because of their higher sorption ability and absence of negative effect
   on plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the multi-depot vehicle routing problem with simultaneous
   deliveries and pickups (MDVRPSDP) is often encountered in real-life
   scenarios of transportation logistics, it has received little attention
   so far. Particularly, no papers have ever used metaheuristics to solve
   it. In this paper a metaheuristic based on iterated local search is
   developed for MDVRPSDP. In order to strengthen the search, an adaptive
   neighborhood selection mechanism is embedded into the improvement steps
   and the perturbation steps of iterated local search, respectively. To
   diversify the search, new perturbation operators are proposed.
   Computational results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms
   the previous methods for MDVRPSDP. Moreover, when applied to VRPSDP
   benchmarks, the results are better than those obtained by large
   neighborhood search, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony
   optimization approach, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dryness and discomfort are the main reasons for dropouts in contact lens
   wearers. Incorporating surfactants in lens formulations could improve
   wettability and lubricity, which can improve comfort. We have focused on
   incorporating polymerizable surfactants in hydroxyethyl methacrylate
   lenses to improve comfort, while minimizing the potential for surfactant
   release into the tears. The surfactants were added to the polymerization
   mixture, followed by UV curing and extraction of leachables in hot
   water. Wettability and lubricity were characterized by measuring the
   contact angle and coefficient of friction. Lenses were also
   characterized by measuring transmittance, loss and storage moduli and
   ion permeability. Incorporation of surfactants significantly reduced
   contact angle from 900 for p-HEMA gels to about 100 for 2.43\% (w/w)
   surfactant loading in hydrated gel. The coefficient of friction also
   decreased from about 0.16 for HEMA gels to 0.05 for the gels with 2.43\%
   surfactant loading. There was a good correlation between the contact
   angle and coefficient of friction suggesting that both effects can be
   related to the stretching of the surfactant tails near the surface into
   the aqueous phase. The water content was also correlated with the
   surfactant loading but the contact angle was more sensitive suggesting
   that the observed improvements in wettability and lubricity arise from
   the protrusion of the surfactant tails in into the liquid, and not
   purely from the increase in the water content. The gels were clear and
   certain compositions also have the capability to block UVC and UVB
   radiation. The results suggest that incorporation of polymerizable
   surfactants could be useful in improving surface properties without
   significantly impacting any bulk property. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dilatational response of porous solids with
   pressure-insensitive matrix displaying strength differential (SD)
   effects is investigated. To this end, micromechanical finite-element
   analyses of three-dimensional unit cells are carried out. The matrix
   behavior is governed by the isotropic form of Cazacu et al. (2006)
   criterion that accounts for SD effects through a parameter k. Simulation
   results are presented for axisymmetric tensile loadings corresponding to
   fixed values of the stress triaxiality for the two possible values of
   the Lode parameter, mu(Sigma). For moderate and high stress
   triaxialities, it is shown that for materials for which the matrix
   tensile strength is larger than its compressive strength (k > 0), under
   tensile loadings corresponding at mu(Sigma) = 1 the void growth rate is
   much faster than in the case of tensile loadings at mu(Sigma) = -1. The
   opposite holds true for materials with matrix tensile strength lower
   than its compressive strength (k < 0). This drastic difference in
   porosity evolution is explained by the distribution of the local plastic
   strain and stresses, which are markedly different than in a von Mises
   material (i.e. no SD effects of the matrix). (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson

Title = {{Stimulation of Peanut Seedling Development and Growth by Zero-Valent
   Iron Nanoparticles at Low Concentrations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Because of its strong pollutant degradation ability, nanoscale
   zerovalent iron (NZVI) has been introduced to soils and groundwater for
   remediation purposes, but its impacts on plants are still not very
   clear. In this work, the effects of low concentration (10-320 mu mol/L)
   NZVI particles on seed germination and growth of peanut plants were
   evaluated. The exposure of peanut seeds to NZVI at all the tested
   concentrations altered the seed germination activity, especially the
   development of seedlings. In comparison with the deionized water treated
   controls (CK), all of the NZVI treatments had significantly larger
   average lengths. Further investigations with transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested that
   NZVI particles may penetrate the peanut seed coats to increase the water
   uptake to stimulate seed germination. The growth experiments showed that
   although NZVI at a relatively high concentration (320 mu mol/L) showed
   phytotoxicity to the peanut plants, the lower concentrations of NZVI
   particles stimulated the growth and root development of the plants. At
   certain concentrations (e.g., 40 and 80 mu mol/L), the NZVI treated
   samples were even better than the ethylenediaminetetraacetate-iron
   (EDTA-Fe) solution, a commonly used iron nutrient solution, in
   stimulating the plant growth. This positive effect was probably due to
   the uptake of NZVI by the plants, as indicated in the TEM analyses.
   Because low concentrations of NZVI particles stimulated both the
   seedling development and growth of peanut, they might be used to benefit
   the growth of peanuts in large-scale agricultural settings.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fillers, such as carbon nanotubes, have been used to address
   drawbacks of existing electroactive polymers (EAPs) with varying
   success. More recently, there has been interest in investigating
   potential of 2D graphene in improving the actuation response of EAPs,
   owing to its unique geometry and electrical properties. In our study,
   the effect of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on electromechanical
   response of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based nanocomposites is
   studied. We show that incorporating GO produces considerable strain
   under an applied electric field when processed using a co-solvent
   approach involving water and N, N dimethylformamide. Starting with GO
   enables good dispersion and interaction with PVDF and then thermally
   reducing it in-situ yields EAP with some controllability over the
   desired properties. A key result is that the extensional strain S-11 is
   quadratic with the electric field, which suggests electric field-induced
   electrostrictive response. Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy results
   indicate that the mechanism for the electrostrictive response is due to
   induced polarization resulting from the enhanced dipolar mobility from
   polar c-phase PVDF and reduced GO. Finally, we show that the coefficient
   of electrostriction depends on the GO content and on the amount of
   conversion from GO to reduced GO. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled dissolution-precipitation reactions, where two minerals share a
   common ion, occur frequently in geological replacement; the reactions
   are driven by an inflow of precipitating secondary ions and an outflow
   of dissolved primary ions. Although crystallization pressure is
   frequently invoked to explain volume-preserving replacement, it cannot
   be operative if the chemical reactions lead to a loss of mineral volume;
   here the host rock that should confine the precipitating mineral is
   dissolving faster than the grains are growing. In this paper we propose
   two chemical mechanisms by which a rapid dissolution front and a slower
   precipitation front can be synchronized, and volume-for-volume
   replacement preserved. We analyze these mechanisms within the framework
   of reactive transport theory and show that morphological features
   observed in calcite replacement can be correlated with predictions of
   the models.}},

Abstract = {{The waveforms of lightning return-stroke electromagnetic fields on
   ground are studied using the transmission line model. Approximate
   expressions to calculate lightning electromagnetic fields at near and
   far ranges are presented. It is found that the waveforms of lightning
   electric and magnetic fields in the time domain at both near and far
   ranges can be expressed approximately as the channel-base current
   waveform multiplied by a factor which is a function of the return-stroke
   speed v and the horizontal distance r between the return-stroke channel
   and the observation point on ground. The ranges at which the approximate
   expressions are valid are determined. The ranges of validity increase
   with increasing the return-stroke speed, and the near and far field
   approximate expressions converge to the exact formula as the
   return-stroke speed approaches the speed of light.

Abstract = {{The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has funded
   innovative scientific research and technology developments in the field
   of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) since the 1970s. This review
   highlights some of DARPA's major advances in the field of BCI,
   particularly those made in recent years. Two broad categories of DARPA
   programs are presented with respect to the ultimate goals of supporting
   the nation's warfighters: (1) BCI efforts aimed at restoring neural
   and/or behavioral function, and (2) BCI efforts aimed at improving human
   training and performance. The programs discussed are synergistic and
   complementary to one another, and, moreover, promote interdisciplinary
   collaborations among researchers, engineers, and clinicians. Finally,
   this review includes a summary of some of the remaining challenges for
   the field of BCI, as well as the goals of new DARPA efforts in this

Title = {{Comparison of polynomial approximations to speed up planewave-based
   quantum Monte Carlo calculations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{287}},
Pages = {{77-87}},

Abstract = {{The computational cost of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of
   realistic periodic systems depends strongly on the method of storing and
   evaluating the many-particle wave function. Previous work by Williamson
   et al. (2001) {[}35] and Alfe and Gillan, (2004) {[}36] has demonstrated
   the reduction of the 0(N-3) cost of evaluating the Slater determinant
   with planewaves to 0(N-2) using localized basis functions. We compare
   four polynomial approximations as basis functions - interpolating
   Lagrange polynomials, interpolating piecewise-polynomial-form (pp-)
   splines, and basis-form (B-) splines (interpolating and smoothing). All
   these basis functions provide a similar speedup relative to the
   planewave basis. The pp-splines have eight times the memory requirement
   of the other methods. To test the accuracy of the basis functions, we
   apply them to the ground state structures of Si, Al, and MgO. The
   polynomial approximations differ in accuracy most strongly for MgO, and
   smoothing B-splines most closely reproduce the planewave value for of
   the variational Monte Carlo energy. Using separate approximations for
   the Laplacian of the orbitals increases the accuracy sufficiently to
   justify the increased memory requirement, making smoothing B-splines,
   with separate approximation for the Laplacian, the preferred choice for
   approximating planewave-represented orbitals in QMC calculations. (C)

Abstract = {{First principles density functional theory calculations were performed

   concentrations of 3.03, 5.88 and 8.57 at.\%. The defect formation
   energies, doping site preferences, and elastic properties of pure and
   doped Ni3Al were determined and compared to published theoretical and
   experimental results. The magnetic properties of Ni3Al and, where
   appropriate, the dopants, were always taken into account, as the elastic
   constants predicted from spin-polarized and non-spin-polarized
   calculations were significantly different. The results were successfully
   correlated to the electronic structure through the electronic density
   using Miedema's established model (Miedema et al., 1973). The
   calculations revealed that Cr doping increases the bulk modulus of Ni3Al
   and that all the other dopants considered decrease it. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cross-linked polymers constructed with dynamic-covalent boronic esters

   Because the reversibility of the boronic ester cross-links was readily

   exchange to covalently mend after failure. The reversible bonds of the
   boronic esters were shown to shift their exchange equilibrium at room
   temperature when exposed to water. Nevertheless, the materials were
   observed to be stable and hydrophobic and absorbed only minor amounts of
   water over extended periods of time when submerged in water or exposed
   to humid environments. The facile reversibility of the networks allowed
   intrinsic self-healing under ambient conditions. Highly efficient
   self-healing of these bulk materials was confirmed by mechanical
   testing, even after subjecting a single site to multiple cut-repair
   cycles. Several variables were considered for their effect on materials
   properties and healing, including cross-link density, humidity, and

Abstract = {{Water splitting using an iron-based looping processes is a promising
   method to produce high purity hydrogen. The cyclical, heterogeneous
   oxidation and reduction reactions are carried out within high surface
   area stable porous structures as the solid reactant. The random walk
   method is used to simulate chemical reaction and species transport, as
   it is capable of handling stiff reaction kinetics and varying
   hydrodynamic dispersion tensors caused by pore-level velocity
   fluctuations. The original random walk formulation is extended to
   account for bulk density variations and source terms due to the chemical
   reaction. The species transport equation is recast in the form of the
   Fokker-Planck equation, and the trajectories of fluid particles are
   obtained by solving an appropriate Langevin equation that has additional
   drift terms as a result of spatial variations in bulk density and
   dispersion tensor. The source term is accounted for by changing the
   composition of fluid particles based on the reaction kinetics. The
   extended approach for each new term is validated against exact solutions
   or highly resolved finite difference solutions. Finally, a new coupled
   model for bulk fluid flow, species transport, and chemical reaction in
   porous media is developed and applied to simulate a bench-scale water
   splitting reactor with a porous iron-silica fixed bed structure.
   Excellent agreement with the measured hydrogen production rate at
   different operating conditions is obtained. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen

Title = {{Force dysmetria in spinocerebellar ataxia 6 correlates with functional
   capacity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a genetic disease that causes
   pure cerebellar degeneration affecting walking, balance, and
   coordination. One of the main symptoms of SCA6 is dysmetria. The
   magnitude of dysmetria and its relation to functional capacity in SCA6
   has not been studied. Our purpose was to quantify dysmetria and
   determine the relation between dysmetria and functional capacity in
   SCA6. Ten individuals diagnosed and genetically confirmed with SCA6
   (63.7 +/- 7.02 years) and nine age-matched healthy controls (65.9 +/-
   8.5 years) performed goal-directed isometric contractions with the ankle
   joint. Dysmetria was quantified as the force and time error during
   goal-directed contractions. SCA6 functional capacity was determined by
   ICARS and SARA clinical assessments. We found that SCA6 participants
   exhibited greater force dysmetria than healthy controls (P<0.05), and
   reduced time dysmetria than healthy controls (P<0.05). Only force
   dysmetria was significantly related to SCA6 functional capacity, as
   measured with ICARS kinetic score (R-2 = 0.63), ICARS total score (R-2 =
   0.43), and SARA total score (R-2 = 0.46). Our findings demonstrate that
   SCA6 exhibit force dysmetria and that force dysmetria is associated to
   SCA6 functional capacity. Quantifying force and time dysmetria in
   individuals with SCA6 could provide a more objective evaluation of the
   functional capacity and disease state in SCA6.}},

Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric HfO2-based thin films, which can exhibit ferroelectric
   properties down to sub-10 nm thicknesses, are a promising candidate for
   emerging high density memory technologies. As the ferroelectric
   thickness continues to shrink, the electrode-ferroelectric interface
   properties play an increasingly important role. We investigate the TaN
   interface properties on 10 nm thick Si-doped HfO2 thin films fabricated
   in a TaN metal-ferroelectric-metal stack which exhibit highly asymmetric
   ferroelectric characteristics. To understand the asymmetric behavior of
   the ferroelectric characteristics of the Si-doped HfO2 thin films, the
   chemical interface properties of sputtered TaN bottom and top electrodes
   are probed with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Ta-O bonds at the
   bottom electrode interface and a significant presence of Hf-N bonds at
   both electrode interfaces are identified. It is shown that the chemical
   heterogeneity of the bottom and top electrode interfaces gives rise to
   an internal electric field, which causes the as-grown ferroelectric
   domains to preferentially polarize to screen positively charged oxygen
   vacancies aggregated at the oxidized bottom electrode interface.
   Electric field cycling is shown to reduce the internal electric field
   with a concomitant increase in remanent polarization and decrease in
   relative permittivity. Through an analysis of pulsed transient switching
   currents, back-switching is observed in Si-doped HfO2 thin films with
   pinched hysteresis loops and is shown to be influenced by the internal
   electric field. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroeconomics employs neuroscience techniques to explain
   decision-making behaviours. Prospect theory, a prominent model of
   decision-making, features a value function with parameters for risk and
   loss aversion. Recent work with normal participants identified
   activation related to loss aversion in brain regions including the
   amygdala, ventral striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. However,
   the brain network for loss aversion in pathologies such as depression
   has yet to be identified. The aim of the current study is to employ the
   value function from prospect theory to examine behavioural and neural
   manifestations of loss aversion in depressed and healthy individuals to
   identify the neurobiological markers of loss aversion in economic
   behaviour. We acquired behavioural data and fMRI scans while healthy
   controls and patients with depression performed an economic
   decision-making task. Behavioural loss aversion was higher in patients
   with depression than in healthy controls. fMRI results revealed that the
   two groups shared a brain network for value function including right
   ventral striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and right amygdala.
   However, the neural loss aversion results revealed greater activations
   in the right dorsal striatum and the right anterior insula for controls
   compared with patients with depression, and higher activations in the
   midbrain region ventral tegmental area for patients with depression
   compared with controls. These results suggest that while the brain
   network for loss aversion is shared between depressed and healthy
   individuals, some differences exist with respect to differential
   activation of additional areas. Our findings are relevant to identifying
   neurobiological markers for altered decision-making in the depressed.}},

Abstract = {{Flapping wing micro air vehicles are capable of hover and forward flight
   with high maneuverability. However, flapping wing flight is difficult to
   simulate accurately because it is a more complex phenomenon than fixed
   wing or rotorcraft flight. Consequently, the optimization of flapping
   wing behavior based on simulation is limited and, therefore, we have
   elected to optimize a wing experimentally. Specifically, we use
   experimental data to optimize the flapping wing structure for maximum
   thrust production in hover mode. We point out the similarities or
   otherwise between experimental optimization and the more common
   simulation-based optimization. Experimental optimization is hampered by
   noisy data, which is due to manufacturing variability and
   testing/measurement uncertainty in this study. These uncertainties must
   be reduced to an acceptable level and this requires their
   quantification. Therefore, improvements in manufacturing and testing
   procedures were implemented to reduce the noise. Another challenge is to
   limit the number of experiments for reducing time and cost. This is
   realized by using surrogates, or meta-models, to approximate the
   response (in this case, thrust) of the wing. In order to take into
   account the uncertainty, or noise, in the response, we use a Gaussian
   Process surrogate with noise and a 2nd order polynomial response
   surface. We apply a surrogate-based optimization algorithm called
   Efficient Global Optimization with different sampling criteria and
   multiple surrogates. This enables us to select multiple points per
   optimization cycle, which is especially useful in this case as it is
   more time efficient to manufacture multiple wings at once and this also
   serves as insurance against failed designs.}},

Abstract = {{Differential-laser induced perturbation spectroscopy (DLIPS) is a new
   spectral analysis technique for classification and identification, with
   key potential applications for analysis of complex biomolecular systems.
   DLIPS takes advantage of the complex ultraviolet (UV) laser-material
   interactions based on difference spectroscopy by coupling low intensity
   UV laser perturbation with a traditional spectroscopy probe. Here, we
   quantify the DLIPS performance using a Raman scattering probe in
   classification of basic constituents of collagenous tissues, namely, the
   amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-alanine, and the dipeptides
   glycine-glycine, glycine-alanine and glycine-proline and compare the
   performance to a traditional Raman spectroscopy probe via several
   multivariate analyses. We find that the DLIPS approach yields an similar
   to 40\% improvement in discrimination among these tissue building
   blocks. The effects of the 193-nm perturbation laser are further
   examined by assessing the photodestruction of targeted material
   molecular bonds. The DLIPS method with a Raman probe holds promise for

Abstract = {{Sensorimotor impairments are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
   but they are not well understood. Here we examined force control during
   initial pulses and the subsequent rise, sustained, and relaxation phases
   of precision gripping in 34 individuals with ASD and 25 healthy control
   subjects. Participants pressed on opposing load cells with their thumb
   and index finger while receiving visual feedback regarding their
   performance. They completed 2- and 8-s trials during which they pressed
   at 15\%, 45\%, or 85\% of their maximum force. Initial pulses guided by
   feedforward control mechanisms, sustained force output controlled by
   visual feedback processes, and force relaxation rates all were examined.
   Control subjects favored an initial pulse strategy characterized by a
   rapid increase in and then relaxation of force when the target force was
   low (Type 1). When the target force level or duration of trials was
   increased, control subjects transitioned to a strategy in which they
   more gradually increased their force, paused, and then increased their
   force again. Individuals with ASD showed a more persistent bias toward
   the Type 1 strategy at higher force levels and during longer trials, and
   their initial force output was less accurate than that of control
   subjects. Patients showed increased force variability compared with
   control subjects when attempting to sustain a constant force level.
   During the relaxation phase, they showed reduced rates of force
   decrease. These findings suggest that both feedforward and feedback
   motor control mechanisms are compromised in ASD and these deficits may
   contribute to the dyspraxia and sensorimotor abnormalities often seen in
   this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in discharge and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) were studied
   at a point-source submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), within a
   fringing reef lagoon, from quadrature (neap) to syzygy (spring) tides.
   The principal factors affecting discharge and TKE variations were tides
   and waves. Field data indicated discharge, and TKE varied with high and
   low tides, and with quadrature and syzygy. Maximum discharge and TKE
   values were observed during low tides when the hydrostatic pressure over
   the jet was minimal, while the lowest discharge and TKE values were
   found at high tides. Syzygy tides produced consistent saltwater
   intrusion during high tides, while quadrature tides produced the
   greatest TKE values. In general, as the discharge intensified during low
   tides, jet temperatures decreased suggesting that waters originated
   further within the aquifer. At the same time jet salinities increased,
   suggesting a mixing of aquifer and seawater. To reconcile these two
   seemingly opposing views, it is proposed that the jet conduit is
   connected to a stratified chamber with seawater below brackish water.
   The greatest subtidal discharge occurred during quadrature tides. Syzygy
   produced low subtidal discharge driven by flow reversals (flow into the
   aquifer) observed throughout syzygy high tides in conjunction with the
   peak wave setup (>5 cm) observed during a storm. While tides were the
   primary driving force of the discharge, waves played a nonnegligible
   role. Wave effects on the discharge were most evident during syzygy high
   tides combined with a storm, when the subtidal spring discharge was
   weakest and salt intrusion developed.}},

Abstract = {{CrSiTe3 has attracted recent interest as a candidate single-layer
   ferromagnetic semiconductor, but relatively little is known about the
   bulk properties of this material. Here, we report single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction, magnetic properties, thermal conductivity, vibrational, and
   optical spectroscopies and compare our findings with complementary
   electronic structure and lattice dynamics principles calculations. The
   high temperature paramagnetic phase is characterized by strong
   spin-lattice interactions that give rise to glassy behavior, negative
   thermal expansion, and an optical response that reveals that CrSiTe3 is
   an indirect gap semiconductor with indirect and direct band gaps at 0.4
   and 1.2 eV, respectively. Measurements of the phonons across the 33 K
   ferromagnetic transition provide additional evidence for strong coupling
   between the magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom. The Si-Te
   stretching and Te displacement modes are sensitive to the magnetic
   ordering transition, a finding that we discuss in terms of the
   superexchange mechanism. Spin-lattice coupling constants are also
   extracted. (C) 2015 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Nonweighing drainage lysimeters were used to measure seasonal water use
   of mature `Emerald' southern highbush blueberry (SHB; Vaccinium
   corymbosum interspecific hybrid) plants grown in pine bark beds and in
   pine bark amended soil in north central Florida. In the absence of rain,
   irrigation was applied daily with microsprinklers at approximate to
   120\% to 175\% of reference evapotranspiration as either single or split
   applications. Leachate was collected and its volume determined from each
   lysimeter at 6- to 10-day intervals throughout the study. Water use,
   expressed as L/plant, was calculated as the difference between the
   amount of irrigation/rain added to lysirneters and the amount of
   leachate collected from lysimeters during each measurement period.
   Average daily water use was calculated for monthly intervals beginning
   in Apr. 2010 and ending in Sept. 2012. Water use increased rapidly
   during spring through the final stages of fruit ripening and harvest
   (May) with peak water use occurring during mid to late summer (July,
   August, and September). Plants grown in pine bark beds used more water
   than plants in pine bark amended soil during Apr., May, and Dec. 2010,
   Feb. 2011, and Mar. 2012, but there were no differences during the
   periods of highest water use. No differences in water use were observed
   between single or split-application irrigation treatments. Monthly
   averages for daily water use during the 30-month period ranged from
   approximate to 1.75 L/plant in January to approximate to 8.0 L/plant in
   mid to late summer. Mean monthly crop coefficient values during the
   30-month period ranged from 0.44 in February to 0.86 in September.
   Canopy volume, yield, and mean berry weight were unaffected by soil or
   irrigation treatments.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recently, the graphics processing unit (GPU) has made significant
   progress as a general-purpose parallel processor. The CPU and GPU
   cooperate together to solve data-parallel and control-intensive
   real-world applications in an optimized fashion. For example, emerging
   heterogeneous computing architectures such as Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD
   Fusion integrate the functionality of the CPU and GPU in a single die.
   However, the single-die CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing architecture
   faces the challenge of tight budget of die area. The conventional
   homogenous interconnect fails to provide satisfactory performance by
   fully exploiting the given area budget in the heterogeneous processing
   era.
   In this article, we aim to implement an interconnect network within an
   area budget for a CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing architecture. We
   propose iConn, a 2D mesh-style on-chip heterogeneous communication
   infrastructure. In iConn, a set of GPU logical units such as the stream
   processors, the texture units, and the rendering output units form a
   computing unit (CU). Differing from conventional homogenous router
   design, iConn adopts nonuniform on-chip routers in order to meet the
   unique communication demands from each single CPU and CU. The routers
   can also dynamically allocate their buffers across all virtual channels
   (VCs) to meet the latency requirements of CPUs and CUs. Moreover, the
   memory controller scheduling algorithm is modified from traditional
   load-over-store scheduling in order to prioritize the traffic. Our
   simulation results show that iConn improves the performance of CPUs by
   23.0\% and CUs by 9.4\%.}},

   condensation of L-aspartic acid and subsequently functionalized with
   primary amines to form random amphiphilic copolymers. The copolymers
   formed stable nanoparticles in aqueous medium via nanoprecipitation and
   were subsequently loaded with a model hydrophobic molecule to
   demonstrate their potential as controlled-release delivery vehicles. It
   was found that above pH 7, the hydrophobic succinimidyl units of the PSI
   nanoparticles hydrolyzed to release encapsulated materials. The release
   rate significantly increased at elevated pH and decreased with an
   increasing degree of functionalization. Finally, plant toxicity studies
   showed that the polymer materials exhibit little to no toxic effects at
   biologically relevant concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating citrus disease worldwide, without
   known cure. Since this disease shows visible symptoms on newly developed
   canopies, remote sensing methods based on spectral principles are
   considered as an effective tool. To explore a fast way to monitor HLB in
   large citrus groves, a satellite multispectral (MS) image with a 2-m
   resolution acquired by WorldView-2 was studied to evaluate its
   capability on HLB detection. Ground truth was conducted and two spectral
   libraries were constructed. Library 1 was based on RTK GPS locations,
   and Library 2 was combined with prior knowledge from the ground spectral
   features. To compare with the classification accuracy of previous work
   using airborne spectral images, the same classification methods were
   carried out. In the satellite MS image, Library 2 had higher average
   overall accuracy, higher Kappa coefficient, and higher producer's and
   user's accuracies than Library 1, indicating Library 2 which combined
   with prior knowledge was more effective. Mahalanobis distance had the
   highest overall accuracy of 81\% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.464 with
   Library 2. The accuracy comparison between the satellite MS image and
   the airborne spectral images showed that the satellite MS image had the
   highest average producer's accuracy with Library 2, followed by the
   airborne MS image and the satellite MS image with Library 1, indicating
   that construction of an effective library was the most important step,
   and that the satellite MS image with a proper spatial resolution showed
   good potential to be a better choice than the airborne spectral image.

Abstract = {{Advanced composites enhanced with nanoparticles demonstrate a plethora
   of potential uses in aerospace, automotive, and medical industries.
   However, there are difficulties in tailoring the properties of these
   materials during manufacturing. In order to fully utilize such
   materials, there is a need for a more fundamental understanding of
   composite structures after nanoparticle integration so that
   manufacturing these materials can be more efficient. In order to achieve
   this, the use of modeling and predictive methods has been frequently
   employed. This review seeks to summarize the recent advances in the
   analytical micromechanical analysis of nano-enhanced composites. First,
   we introduce the basic concepts involved in micromechanics. Next, we
   review existing micromechanics models. Then, we discuss the applications
   of these models in the prediction of nano-enhanced two-phased composite
   properties. Finally, we will extend our discussion to the recent
   incorporation of these models to three-phased composites or multiscale

Abstract = {{This paper reviews methodologies for analyzing neural potentials via

   representations with adaptive signal models is presented. This approach
   describes a continuous signal as a linear combination of reoccurring

Abstract = {{To address the problem of segmenting an image into sizeable homogeneous
   regions, this paper proposes an efficient agglomerative algorithm on the
   basis of modularity optimization. Given an oversegmented image that
   consists of many small regions, our algorithm automatically merges those
   neighboring regions that produce the largest increase in modularity
   index. When the modularity of the segmented image is maximized, the
   algorithm stops merging and produces the final segmented image. To
   preserve the repetitive patterns in a homogeneous region, we propose a
   feature on the basis of the histogram of states of image gradients and
   use it together with the color feature to characterize the similarity of
   two regions. By constructing the similarity matrix in an adaptive
   manner, the oversegmentation problem can be effectively avoided. Our
   algorithm is tested on the publicly available Berkeley Segmentation Data
   Set as well as the semantic segmentation data set and compared with
   other popular algorithms. Experimental results have demonstrated that
   our algorithm produces sizable segmentation, preserves repetitive
   patterns with appealing time complexity, and achieves object-level
   segmentation to some extent.}},

Abstract = {{Neural network (NN) is a representative data-driven method, which is one
   of prognostics approaches that is to predict future damage/ degradation
   and the remaining useful life of in-service systems based on the damage
   data measured at previous usage conditions. Even though NN has a wide

   on prognostics compared to the usage in other fields such as diagnostics
   and pattern recognition. Especially, it is difficult to find studies on
   statistical aspects of NN for the purpose of prognostics. Therefore,
   this paper presents the aspects of statistical characteristics of NN
   that are presumable in practical usages, which arise from measurement
   data, weight parameters related to the neural network model, and loading
   conditions. The Bayesian framework and Johnson distribution are employed
   to handle uncertainties, and crack growth problem is addressed as an
   example.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress and the resulting radical by-products cause significant
   toxicity and graft loss in cellular transplantation. Here, the
   engineering of an auto-catalytic, antioxidant, self-renewing cerium
   oxide nanoparticle (CONP)-composite hydrogel is reported. This
   enzyme-mimetic material ubiquitously scavenges ambient free radicals,
   with the potential to provide indefinite antioxidant protection. The
   potential of this system to enhance the protection of encapsulated beta
   cells was evaluated. Co-incubation of CONPs free in solution with beta
   cells demonstrated potent cytoprotection from superoxide exposure;
   however, phagocytosis of the CONPs by the beta cells resulted in
   cytotoxicity at concentrations as low as 1 mM. When CONPs were embedded
   within alginate hydrogels, the composite hydrogel provided
   cytoprotection to encapsulated beta cells from free radical attack
   without cytotoxicity, even up to 10 mM. This nanocomposite hydrogel has
   wide applicability in cellular transplantation, with the unique
   advantage of localization of these potent antioxidant CONPs and their
   capacity for sustained, long-term scavenging. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Tourette syndrome is a childhood-onset disorder characterized by a
   combination of motor and vocal tics, often associated with psychiatric
   comorbidities including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and
   obsessive-compulsive disorder. Despite an onset early in life, half of
   patients may present symptoms in adulthood, with variable degrees of
   severity In select cases, the syndrome may lead to significant physical
   and social impairment, and a worrisome risk for self injury. Evolving
   research has provided evidence supporting the idea that the
   pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome is directly related to a disrupted
   circuit involving the cortex and subcortical structures, including the
   basal ganglia, nucleus accumbens, and the amygdala. There has also been
   a notion that a dysfunctional group of neurons in the putamen
   contributes to an abnormal facilitation of competing motor responses in
   basal ganglia structures ultimately underpinning the generation of tics.
   Surgical therapies for Tourette syndrome have been reserved for a small
   group of patients not responding to behavioral and pharmacological
   therapies, and these therapies have been directed at modulating the
   underlying pathophysiology. Lesion therapy as well as deep brain
   stimulation has been observed to suppress tics in at least some of these
   cases. In this article, we will review the clinical aspects of Tourette
   syndrome, as well as the evolution of surgical approaches and we will
   discuss the evidence and clinical responses to deep brain stimulation in
   various brain targets. We will also discuss ongoing research and future
   directions as well as approaches for open, scheduled and closed loop
   feedback-driven electrical stimulation for the treatment of Tourette
   syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of a self-packaged partial semicircular nanoporous

   of nanofibers in a microchannel by self-packaged reflow, and easy
   formation of 3-D nanoporous channels. A fabricated nanoporous
   microchannel with a channel length of 7 mm, a channel width of 73.85 mu
   m, and a channel height of 34.65 mu m shows slow fluidic flow through
   the channel, functioning as an effective nanochannel with an equivalent
   channel height of 800 nm and a radius of 857 nm, and therefore, its
   reduction ratios of the channel height and radius are similar to 97.7\%

Abstract = {{We report a full series of blue, green and red quantum-dot-based

   efficiencies over 10\%. We show that the fine nanostructure of quantum

   thickness of the outer shell-plays a very important role in determining
   QD-LED device performance due to its effects on charge injection,
   transport and recombination. These simple devices have maximum current
   and external quantum efficiencies of 63 cd A(-1) and 14.5\% for green
   QD-LEDs, 15 cd A(-1) and 12.0\% for red devices, and 4.4 cd A(-1) and
   10.7\% for blue devices, all of which are well maintained over a wide
   range of luminances from 102 to 104 cd m(-2). All the QD-LEDs are
   solution-processed for ease of mass production, and have low turn-on
   voltages and saturated pure colours. The green and red devices exhibit

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Growing populations and food demand in the tropics are leading to
   increased environmental pressures on wetland ecosystems, including a
   greater reliance on natural wetlands for water quality improvement.
   Effective assessment of wetland treatment potential requires an improved
   understanding of the hydraulic and biogeochemical factors that govern
   contaminant behavior, however detailed studies of flow through natural,
   tropical wetlands are scarce. We performed a tracer study using a
   conservative salt (potassium bromide) to examine the hydraulic behavior
   of a small, natural wetland in the Costa Rican humid tropics and modeled
   observed breakthrough curves using the 1-D advection-dispersion
   equation. Velocities in the wetland were extremely slow, from less than
   4 m day(-1) to a maximum of similar to 30 m day(-1), and were
   distributed across several flowpaths, illustrating a spatial
   heterogeneity of flow and velocities. Modeled dispersion coefficients
   were also low (33 +/- A 33 m(2) day(-1)). Estimated residence times
   suggested high potential pollutant removal capacity over a range of
   influent concentrations, reinforcing the environmental services provided
   by this and other small tropical wetlands. The study also highlighted
   how small variations in wetland topography and vegetation yield strong
   differences in transport patterns that affect transport and mixing in
   densely vegetated, heterogeneous wetland systems. Empirical data on the
   hydraulics, and resulting ecosystem functions, of small, distributed
   wetlands may provide support for improved conservation and management of
   these important ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a study exploring whether the physical presence
   of another human changes how people perceive and behave with virtual
   teammates. We conducted a study (n = 69) in which nurses worked with a
   simulated health care team to prepare a patient for surgery. The agency
   of participants' teammates was varied between conditions; participants
   either worked with a virtual surgeon and a virtual anesthesiologist, a
   human confederate playing a surgeon and a virtual anesthesiologist, or a
   virtual surgeon and a human confederate playing an anesthesiologist.
   While participants perceived the human confederates to have more social
   presence (p < 0.01), participants did not preferentially agree with
   their human team members. We also observed an interaction effect between
   agency and behavioral realism. Participants experienced less social
   presence from the virtual anesthesiologist, whose behavior was less in
   line with participants' expectations, when a human surgeon was present.}},

Title = {{Pressure and work analysis of unsteady, deformable, axisymmetric, jet
   producing cavity bodies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{769}},
Pages = {{337-368}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This work lays out a methodology for calculating the pressure
   distribution internal to a generic, deformable, axisymmetric body with
   an internal cavity region whose deformation expels/ingests finite jets
   of water. This work is partially motivated by a desire to model
   instantaneous jetting forces and total work required for jellyfish and
   cephalopod locomotion, both of which can be calculated from the internal
   pressure distribution. But the derivation is non-specific and can be
   applied to any axisymmetric, deformable body (organic or synthetic)
   driving fluid in or out of an internal cavity. The pressure distribution
   over the inner surface is derived by integrating the momentum equation
   along a strategic path, equating local surface pressure to known
   quantities such as stagnation pressure, and correlating unknown terms to
   the total circulation of characteristic regions. The integration path is
   laid out to take advantage of symmetry conditions, inherent
   irrotationality, and prescribed boundary conditions. The
   usefulness/novelty of this approach lies in the fact that circulation is
   an invariant of motion for inviscid flows, allowing it to be modelled by
   a series of vorticity flux and source terms. In this study we also
   categorize the various sources of circulation in the general cavity jet
   system, providing modelling for each of these terms with respect to
   known cavity deformation parameters. Through this approach we are able
   to isolate the effect of different deformation behaviours on each of
   these circulation components, and hence on the internal pressure
   distribution. A highly adaptable, transparent, prototype jet actuator
   was designed and tested to measure the circulation in the cavity and the
   surrounding fluid as well as the dynamic forces acting on the device
   during operation. The circulation in both the jet and cavity regions
   shows good agreement with the inviscid modelling, except at the end of
   the refill phase where circulation is lost to viscous dissipation. The
   total instantaneous forces produced during actuation are accurately
   modelled by the pressure analysis during both expulsion and refilling
   phases of the jetting cycle for multiple deformation programs.
   Independent of the end goal, such as propulsion, mixing, feeding etc.,
   the efficiency of the process will always be inversely proportional to
   the total energy required to drive the system. Therefore, given a
   consistent output, efficiency is maximized by the minimum required
   energy. Here it is observed (some what counter-intuitively) that, for
   both jetting and refilling, total work required to drive the fluid is
   lower for impulsive velocity programs with fast accelerations at the
   start and end of motion than sinusoidal velocity programs with smoother
   gradual accelerations. The underlying cause is that sinusoidal programs
   result in a peak in pressure (force) simultaneously with maximum
   deflection velocity of the deformable boundary driving fluid motion; for
   the impulsive programs these peaks are out of phase and overall energy
   consumption is reduced.}},

Abstract = {{PC-TRIO is an indexed TCAM architecture for packet classification. In
   addition to index TCAMs, PC-TRIO uses wide SRAM words. On our packet
   classifier data sets, PC-TRIO reduced TCAM power by 96 percent and
   lookup time by 98 percent on an average, compared to PC-DUOS+ {[}28]
   that does not use indexing or wide SRAMs. PC-DUOS+ was shown to be
   better than STCAM, which is a single TCAM architecture conventionally
   used for packet classification {[}28]. In this paper, we also extend
   PC-DUOS+ by augmenting it with wide SRAMs and index TCAMs using the same
   methodology as used in PC-TRIO, to obtain PC-DUOS+W. On ACL data sets,
   PCDUOS+W reduced TCAM power by 86 percent and lookup time by 98 percent,
   compared to PC-DUOS+, which demonstrates the effectiveness of indexing
   and usage of wide SRAMs in reducing power and lookup time for packet
   classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{PUBSUB is a versatile, efficient, and scalable content-based
   publish/subscribe system. This paper describes the architecture of
   PUBSUB together with some of its current capabilities. A version of
   PUBSUB optimized for event processing was benchmarked against the
   publish/subscribe systems BE-Tree and Siena, which also are optimized
   for event processing. Although the run time performance of both BE-Tree
   and PUBSUB is orders of magnitude better than that of Siena, BE-Tree is
   able to handle only a restricted class of predicates while PUBSUB can
   handle most predicate types handled by Siena. On our tests, the speedup
   of the fastest version of PUBSUB relative to Siena ranged from a low of
   18 to a high of 1,703 and averaged 185. The speedup range relative to
   BE-Tree was up to 9.81 and averaged 2.37. Siena's memory requirements
   are about a fourth of those of BE-Tree and PUBSUB. The memory required
   by the most memory efficient of PUBSUB's data structures was between 4
   and 16 percent less that required by BE-Tree. With respect to data
   structure initialization, the three systems took a comparable amount of
   time on some data sets while on some PUBSUB could be initialized in
   1/7th time required to initialize Siena and 1/14th that to initialize
   BE-Tree. PUBSUB achieves its high performance from the use of very
   efficient data structures and event matching algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In-home Smart Grid (SG), the integration of Renewable Power Systems

   multiple types of household appliances in to consideration, we have
   developed analytical models to characterize the electricity cost in the
   in-home smart grid. Based on these models, we formulate the electricity
   cost minimization problem as a finite-horizon continuous-time Markov
   decision process (CTMDP), from which we obtain a threshold policy to
   minimize the cost. Numerical results show that the threshold policy can
   manage the electricity usage very effectively.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{We examined simultaneous measurements of currents and close electric
   field changes, as well as highspeed video images, associated with pulses
   superimposed on the initial continuous current (ICC pulses) and
   M-components following return strokes in upward flashes initiated from
   the Gaisberg Tower in Austria. For tower-initiated lightning, upward
   leaders often create multiple branches below the cloud base that can
   facilitate initiation of transients at relatively low heights along the
   grounded channel carrying ICC of some tens to hundreds of amperes. In
   this situation, a conducting channel is present, which is necessary for
   the M-component mode of charge transfer to ground, but the excitation
   wave (leader), after entering the channel, cannot form a long-front
   downward M-wave, because of the relatively short distance between the
   entry (junction) point and the strike-object top. Clearly, two parallel
   channels, one previously existing and the other newly formed (or
   rejuvenated) are involved in the charge transfer, and there is a common
   channel section between the junction point and the strike object. We use
   the term ``mixed mode of charge transfer to ground{''}, to indicate that
   in the case of low junction point the ``classical{''} M-component mode
   is not possible, even though a conducting channel to ground (an
   attribute of the M-component mode) is present. The mixed mode scenario
   is also applicable to impulsive processes during continuing currents
   following return strokes in upward lightning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of finding the most and the least
   ``influential{''} or ``influenceable{''} cliques in graphs based on
   three classical centrality measures: degree, closeness and betweenness.
   In addition to standard clique betweenness, which is defined as the
   proportion of shortest paths between any two graph nodes that pass
   through the clique, we also consider its optimistic and pessimistic
   versions, where outside nodes may favor or try to avoid shortest paths
   passing through the clique, respectively. We discuss the computational
   complexity issues for these problems and develop linear 0-1 programming
   formulations for each centrality metric. Finally, we demonstrate the
   performance of the developed formulations on real-life and synthetic
   networks, and provide some interesting insights based on the obtained
   results. In particular, our findings indicate that there are
   considerable variations between the centrality values of large cliques
   within the same networks. Moreover, the most central cliques in graphs
   are not necessarily the largest ones.}},

Abstract = {{Using wind-speed records from mobile weather stations deployed in
   tropical cyclones making landfall along the United States coastline over
   the period 1998-2008, an analysis was made of the gust factors observed
   in near-neutral conditions by station site and wind direction. The
   dataset used contained a total of 56 individual station
   site/wind-direction combinations representative of a wide variety of
   terrain conditions, ranging from open water to urban exposures.
   Consideration of the peak gust measured along a given axis, together
   with the associated components measured simultaneously along the other
   two axes, showed that peak along-wind gusts are primarily associated
   with vertical velocities in air moving towards the surface, while peak
   downwards and upwards vertical gusts are associated with along-wind
   velocity components that are respectively larger and smaller than the
   mean along-wind velocity. This behaviour is directly related to the
   value of the primary component of the surface shear stress in the
   coordinate system used for the analysis, which involves the product of
   the along-wind and vertical velocity components and which must be
   negative in the surface layer. Grouping the mean gust-factor curves for
   each velocity component into bins based on the turbulence intensity
   showed that the individual curves in a given bin could not all be
   considered to be drawn from the same underlying parent distribution, an
   observation that was confirmed by statistical testing. A quantitative
   exploration of the effects of upstream terrain variations on the
   observed gust factors for a selected number of sites suggested that the
   gust factors and other flow parameters, such as the turbulence
   intensity, are heavily influenced by the upstream terrain at many of the
   station sites considered.}},

Abstract = {{A combinatorial assessment method (CAM) model is presented to better
   assess and solve sequencing problems with respect to safety issues in
   waterway traffic environments. The CAM model proposed involves four
   parts: the attributive matching model (AMM) and its algorithm, the
   multi-method calculation, the information filtering model (IFM), and the
   information fusion algorithm (IFA). Among them, the AMM and its
   algorithm for the matching level can initially select suitable methods.
   The multi-method calculation can apply the chosen methods and unify the
   dimensions of all solutions. The IFM, based on the iterative cluster
   analysis, can remove errors and interferences through several iterations
   to improve the solution. The IFA, based on the mean value method, the
   Borda count rule, and the Copeland method, can examine the convergence
   of the solutions and provide a high quality one. Another noticeable
   function is that a customized model for a particular object might be
   obtainable based on the proposed CAM model. In the second part of the
   paper, the CAM model is used to solve a channel sequencing problem with
   respect to the safety levels of a navigable environment of the Yangtze
   River. A customized CAM-CSP model is formed, whose generality is tested
   subsequently through a similar but more complicated channel sequencing
   problem. The solution indicates that the proposed CAM model can enhance
   the assessment's quality and help to provide a customized model to solve
   similar problems conveniently.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper it is demonstrated that only by accounting for the
   combined effects of anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry at
   polycrystal level, it is possible to explain and accurately predict the
   room-temperature torsional response of a strongly textured AZ31 Mg
   material. This is shown by using two modeling frameworks, namely: a
   viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystal model, and a macroscopic
   plasticity model based on an yield criterion, developed by Cazacu et al.
   (2006), that accounts for both orthotropy and tension-compression
   asymmetry in plastic flow. It is shown that unlike Hill's (1948)
   criterion, the latter macroscopic criterion quantitatively predicts the
   experimental results, namely: that the sample with axial direction along
   the rolling direction contracts, while the sample with axial direction
   along the normal direction elongates. Moreover, it is demonstrated that
   these experimentally observed axial strain effects can be quantitatively
   predicted with the VPSC polycrystal model, only if both slip and
   twinning are considered operational at single crystal level. On the
   other hand, if it is assumed that the plastic deformation is fully
   accommodated by crystallographic slip, the axial strains predicted by
   VPSC are very close with that predicted with Hill (1948) criterion,
   which largely underestimates the measured axial strain in the rolling
   direction, and predicts zero axial strain in the normal direction. (C)

   uranium dioxide with UV laser-assisted atom probe tomography}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{459}},
Pages = {{37-43}},

Abstract = {{Atom probe tomography (APT) provides the ability to detect subnanometer
   chemical variations spatially, with high accuracy. However, it is known
   that compositional accuracy can be affected by experimental conditions.
   A study of the effect of laser energy, specimen base temperature, and
   detection rate is performed on the evaporation behavior of uranium
   dioxide (UO2). In laser-assisted mode, tip geometry and standing voltage
   also contribute to the evaporation behavior. In this investigation, it
   was determined that modifying the detection rate and temperature did not
   affect the evaporation behavior as significantly as laser energy. It was
   also determined that three laser evaporation regimes are present in UO2.
   Very low laser energy produces a behavior similar to DC-field
   evaporation, moderate laser energy produces the desired laser-assisted
   field evaporation characteristic and high laser energy induces thermal
   effects, negatively altering the evaporation behavior. The need for UO2
   to be analyzed under moderate laser energies to produce accurate
   stoichiometry distinguishes it from other oxides. The following
   experimental conditions providing the best combination of mass resolving
   power, accurate stoichiometry, and uniform evaporation behavior: 50 K,
   10 pJ laser energy, a detection rate of 0.003 atoms per pulse, and a 100
   kHz repetition rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Iodine-131-m-iodobenzylguanidine ({[}I-131]mIBG)-targeted radionuclide
   therapy (TRT) is a standard treatment for recurrent or refractory
   neuroblastoma with response rates of 30-40 \%. The aim of this study is
   to demonstrate patient-specific dosimetry using quantitative
   {[}I-124]mIBG positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography
   (PET/CT) imaging with a GEometry ANd Tracking 4 (Geant4)-based Monte
   Carlo method for better treatment planning.
   A Monte Carlo dosimetry method was developed using the Geant4 toolkit
   with voxelized anatomical geometry and source distribution as input. The
   presegmented hybrid computational human phantoms developed by the
   University of Florida and the National Cancer Institute (UF/NCI) were
   used as a surrogate to characterize the anatomy of a given patient. S
   values for I-131 were estimated by the phantoms coupled with Geant4 and
   compared with those estimated by OLINDA|EXM and MCNPX for the newborn
   model. To obtain patient-specific biodistribution of {[}I-131]mIBG, a
   10-year-old girl with relapsed neuroblastoma was imaged with
   {[}I-124]mIBG PET/CT at four time points prior to the planned
   {[}I-131]mIBG TRT. The organ- and tumor-absorbed doses of the clinical
   case were estimated with the Geant4 method using the modified UF/NCI
   10-year-old phantom with tumors and the patient-specific residence time.
   For the newborn model, the Geant4 S values were consistent with the
   MCNPX S values. The S value ratio of the Geant4 method to OLINDA|EXM
   ranged from 0.08 to 6.5 of all major organs. The {[}I-131]mIBG residence
   time quantified from the pretherapy {[}I-124]mIBG PET/CT imaging of the
   10-year-old patient was mostly comparable to those previously reported.
   Organ-absorbed dose for the salivary glands was 98.0 Gy, heart wall 36.5
   Gy, and liver 34.3 Gy, while tumor-absorbed dose ranged from 143.9 to
   1,641.3 Gy in different sites.
   Patient-specific dosimetry for {[}I-131]mIBG TRT was accomplished using
   pretherapy {[}I-124]mIBG PET/CT imaging and a Geant4-based Monte Carlo
   dosimetry method. The Geant4 method with quantitative pretherapy imaging
   can provide dose estimates to normal organs and tumors with more
   realistic simulation geometry, and thus may improve treatment planning
   for {[}I-131]mIBG TRT.}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported that a branched quaterthiophene donor chromophore
   functionalized with a phthalhydrazide hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) unit
   (MeBQPH) gives twofold more efficient bulk heterojunction organic solar
   cells (with C-60 acceptors) compared to a nearly identical donor
   incapable of H-bonding (MeBQPME). Here, scanning tunneling microscopy
   (STM) studies confirm the formation of MeBQPH trimer rosettes on Au(111)
   through phthalhydrazide H-bonding interactions that are sufficiently
   strong to compete with adsorbate/substrate interactions. The MeBQPME
   comparator molecule void of hydrogen bonding functionality does not
   similarly assemble on the metal surface. Complementary density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations facilitate a structural
   understanding of the MeBQPH donor assemblies and their strong
   stabilization through formation of six hydrogen bonds. STM studies also
   reveal the templated growth of C-60 on ordered MeBQPH monolayers with
   C-60 molecules preferentially occupying the threefold interstitial sites
   of the MeBQPH monolayer. This work supports the idea that H-bonding
   interactions can be used to control the morphology of organic
   donor-acceptor blends to potentially create efficient and stable bulk
   heterojunction photovoltaic devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of the solidification reactions and
   microstructures of alloys in the Mg-rich corner of the Mg-Al-Ba ternary
   system has been conducted. Four distinct exothermic reactions involving
   the formation of alpha-Mg, Mg17Ba2, Mg17Al12, and a fourth phase
   designated as tau were observed and their onset temperatures were
   recorded as functions of composition. Using compositional and
   microstructural analysis, the Mg17Ba2 intermetallic was found to have
   significant solubility of Al, up to 20 at. pct. The solidification
   pathways of the investigated alloys involved both a Class I and Class II
   equilibrium reaction. A flow block diagram that outlines the observed
   solidification reactions is presented and discussed in reference to cast
   microstructures. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{Proton and carbon-13 pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR was applied to
   study diffusion of the mixture of carbon dioxide and the ionic liquid
   1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide under
   condition of confinement in the mesopores of KIT-6 silica. The results
   of these diffusion studies were compared with the results obtained for
   the corresponding bulk mixture and pure ionic liquid (IL) as well as for
   the confined pure IL It was observed that the confinement in mesopores,
   which were fully loaded with the IL, reduces the cation diffusivity by
   around a factor of two in comparison to that in the corresponding bulk
   CO2/IL, mixture or the pure IL This result was obtained for short
   diffusion times when possible transport resistances at the external
   surface of KIT-6 particles are not expected to change the intraparticle
   diffusivity of the cations. The large experimental uncertainty of the
   measurements of carbon dioxide diffusivity in the confined CO2/IL
   mixture at the smallest diffusion time prevented making a definitive
   conclusion about the influence of the confinement on CO2 diffusivity.
   The reported experimental data suggest that the CO2 diffusivity under
   the conditions of confinement can be comparable to or even larger than
   that in the bulk CO2/IL mixture. For larger diffusion times, both the
   carbon dioxide and cation diffusivities in the confined mixture were
   found to decrease with increasing diffusion time. This diffusion time
   dependence was attributed to the influence of transport resistances at
   the external surface of KIT-6 particles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{42-65}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The contribution of this paper to a general theory of software
   engineering is twofold: it presents the model system concept, and it
   integrates the software engineering design process into a decision
   making theory and a value-based decision-under-risk process. The model
   system concept is defined as a collection of interconnected and
   consistent components that work together for defining, developing, and
   delivering a software system. This model system concept is used to
   represent the multiple facets of a software engineering project such as
   stakeholders and models related to domain/environment, success,
   decision, product, process, and property. The model system concept is
   derived from software development practices in the industry and
   academia.
   The theoretical decision framework acts as a central governance
   component for a given software engineering project. Applying this
   decision framework allows for effectively managing risks and
   uncertainties related to success in the project building stage.
   Especially, this puts the design process in an economic perspective,
   where concepts such as value-of-waiting, value-of-information and
   possible outcomes can be coped with explicitly. In practice, the
   decision framework allows for the optimal control of modern adaptive
   software development. In particular, one can use dynamic programming to
   find the optimal sequence of decisions to be made considering a defined
   time horizon. In this way we can relate our contribution to a theory of
   software engineering to the well-studied areas of automatic control,
   optimization, decision theory and Bayesian analysis.
   Computational case studies exemplify the conceptual innovations proposed
   in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a chain of distributed systems governed by a degenerate
   parabolic equation, which satisfies a weak Hormander type condition,
   with a control distributed over an open subdomain. In particular, we
   consider two objectives that we would like to accomplish. The first one
   being of a controllability type that consists of guaranteeing the
   terminal state to reach a target set starting from an initial condition;
   while the second one is keeping the state trajectory of the overall
   system close to a given reference trajectory over a finite time
   interval. We introduce the following framework. First, we partition the
   control subdomain into two disjoint open subdomains that are compatible
   with the strategy subspaces of the leader and that of the follower,
   respectively. Then, using the notion of Stackelberg's optimization
   (which is a hierarchical optimization framework), we provide a new
   result on the existence of optimal control strategies for such an
   optimization problem, where the follower (which corresponds to the
   second criterion) is required to respond optimally, in the sense of
   best-response correspondence to the strategy of the leader (which is
   associated to the controllability-type problem) so as to achieve the
   overall objectives. Finally, we remark on the implication of our result
   in assessing the influence of the target set on the strategy of the
   follower with respect to the direction of leader-follower (and
   vice-versa) information flow.}},

Abstract = {{This work explored two modification methods to improve biochar's ability

   pyrolyzed in the presence of MnCl2 center dot 4H(2)O (MPB) and in the

   pyrolysis (BPB). The resulting biochars were characterized using
   thermogravimetry, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses. The
   dominant crystalline forms of Mn oxides in the MPB and BPB were
   manganosite and birnessite, respectively. Batch sorption studies were
   carried out to determine the kinetics and magnitude of As(V) and Pb(II)
   onto the biochars. As(V) and Pb(II) sorption capacities of MPB (0.59 and
   4.91 g/kg) and BPB (0.91 and 47.05 g/kg) were significantly higher than
   that of the unmodified biochar (0.20 and 2.35 g/kg). BPB showed the

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a three-stage supply chain scheduling problem in
   the application area of aluminium production. Particularly, the first
   and the third stages involve two factories, i.e., the extrusion factory
   of the supplier and the aging factory of the manufacturer, where serial
   batching machine and parallel batching machine respectively process jobs
   in different ways. In the second stage, a single vehicle transports jobs
   between the two factories. In our research, both setup time and capacity
   constraints are explicitly considered. For the problem of minimizing the
   makespan, we formalize it as a mixed integer programming model and prove
   it to be strongly NP-hard. Considering the computational complexity, we
   develop two heuristic algorithms applied in two different cases of this
   problem. Accordingly, two lower bounds are derived, based on which the
   worst case performance is analyzed. Finally, different scales of random
   instances are generated to test the performance of the proposed
   algorithms. The computational results show the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithms, especially for large-scale instances.}},

   presumably most relevant for absorption.
   Methods: In the study reported here, snapshots of agglomeration behavior
   of gold nanospheres were evaluated in vivo throughout the
   gastrointestinal tract using transmission electron microscopy.
   Agglomeration state within the gastrointestinal tract was then used to
   help explain differences in gastrointestinal particle absorption, as
   indicated by tissue levels of gold detected using inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry. Mice were dosed (10 mg/kg) with either 23 nm
   PEG-coated or uncoated gold nanospheres.
   Results: Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that PEG-coated
   gold nanoparticles can be observed as primary, un-agglomerated particles
   throughout the gastrointestinal tract and feces of dosed animals. In
   contrast, uncoated gold nanoparticles were observed to form agglomerates
   of several hundred nanometers in all tissues and feces. Inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry shows significantly higher levels of
   gold in tissues from animals dosed with PEG-coated versus uncoated 23 nm
   gold nanoparticles. Retention of particles after a single oral gavage
   was also very high, with all tissues of animals dosed with PEG-coated
   particles having detectable levels of gold at 30 days following
   exposure.
   Conclusions: Qualitative observation of these particles in vivo shows
   that dispersed PEG-coated particles are able to reach the absorptive
   tissues of the intestine while agglomerated uncoated particles are
   sequestered in the lumen of these tissues. However, the large
   differences observed for in vivo agglomeration behavior were not
   reflected in oral absorption, as indicated by gold tissue levels.
   Additional factors, such as surface chemistry, may have played a more
   important role than in vivo particle size and should be investigated
   further.}},

Abstract = {{Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) has been widely used as a popular phase change material.
   In this study, we show that it exhibits high Seebeck coefficients

   p-type doping levels of similar to 1 x 10(19)-6 x 10(19) cm(-3) at room
   temperature. More importantly, at low temperature (T = 200K), the
   Seebeck coefficient was found to exceed 200 lV/K for a doping range of 1
   x 10(19)-3.5 x 10(19) cm(-3). Given that the lattice thermal

Abstract = {{Monolayer black phosphorus (BP) has high band anisotropy which can be
   modulated with strain. We show that the plasmonic dispersions in
   monolayer BPs not only strongly depend on the crystalline direction but
   also strain. Application of strain can alter the optimum direction for
   plasmon transport and engineer the anisotropic plasmonic dispersion
   relations. Furthermore, we evaluate the plasmon losses and wave
   localization via the random-phase approximation framework. It is found
   that although the BP monolayer is inferior to graphene in terms of loss
   at the same wave localization, it outperforms monolayer MoS2. The
   dependence of plasmon properties on the applied strain in BP makes it an
   interesting nanophotonic material, as well as a potential medium for
   piezo-optic applications. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A tidal-cycle study at Destin Inlet, Northwest Florida, investigated
   intratidal and residual flow structures for the first time across the
   inlet. Underway current velocity profiles were combined with
   hydrographic station profiles at neap tides to document the appearance
   of tidal fronts, the distribution of tidal currents across two
   cross-sections, and the residual, or non-tidal, flow structure at the
   same cross-sections. Intratidal variations of water density and velocity
   showed the presence of fronts both in 1) late ebb-early flood and 2)
   late flood-early ebb tidal stages. Late ebb-early flood tidal intrusion
   fronts brought about depth-independent changes in water density >10
   kg/m(3) in <2 h. Their counterparts, late flood-early ebb plume-like
   fronts, produced similar magnitude of variations in density but were
   depth-dependent. Diurnal tidal current distributions across the inlet
   followed a general behavior of a damped wave with strongest currents
   appearing near the surface and near the deepest part of the
   cross-sections (thalweg). However, curvature effects seemed to modify
   this behavior locally by shifting the maximum tidal current away from
   the thalweg. Frictional and curvature effects on the diurnal flows were
   confirmed by an analytical solution for tidal currents. The observed
   density gradients drove residual flows that were vertically sheared,
   with outflow at the surface and inflow near the bottom. Such residual
   flow distributions were reproduced by an analytical solution that
   diagnosed the flow structure as inherent of a dynamically narrow inlet
   with relatively weak frictional effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   enable the exploration of possible routes to enhance the photocatalytic

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, extensive research has been completed on the
   potential threats of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to living
   organisms upon release to aquatic systems. However, these studies have
   focused primarily on the link between adverse biological effects in
   exposed test organisms on the length, diameter, and metallic impurity
   content of SWCNTs. In contrast, few studies have focused on the
   bioeffects of the different SWCNTs in the as-produced mixture, which
   contain both metallic (m-SWCNT) and semiconducting (s-SWCNT) species.
   Using selective adsorption onto hydrogels, high purity m-SWCNT and
   s-SWCNT fractions were produced and their biological impacts determined
   in dose response studies with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata as test
   organism. The results show significant differences in the biological
   responses of P. subcapitata exposed to high purity m- and s-SWCNT
   fractions. Contrary to the biological response observed using SWCNTs
   separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation, it is found that the
   high-pressure CO conversion (HiPco) s-SWCNT fraction separated by
   selective adsorption causes increased biological impact. These findings
   suggest that s-SWCNTs are the primary factor driving the adverse
   biological responses observed from P. subcapitata cells exposed to our
   as-produced suspensions. Finally, the toxicity of the s-SWCNT fraction
   is mitigated by increasing the concentration of biocompatible surfactant
   in the suspensions, likely altering the nature of surfactant coverage
   along SWCNT sidewalls, thereby reducing potential physical interaction
   with algal cells. These findings highlight the need to couple sample
   processing and toxicity response studies.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model that describes a trailer scale biomass steam
   gasification system coupled with a solar collector heat source and a
   micro gas turbine is reported in this paper. This combined heat and
   power system is set to a prescribed output of 20 kW(e) and several
   system conditions have been optimized in a parametric study to minimize
   resource consumption rates. Biomass feeding rates under optimal
   conditions were found to range between 23 and 63 kg/h depending on the
   types of feedstock and other parameters. Water consumption is reduced
   through a condensation and recirculation process that is part of a heat
   recovery unit. Also, solar energy requirements have been reduced by
   means of a recuperator that extracts heat out of the combustion
   products. The overall system performance has been evaluated by a
   utilization factor which was found to range between 30\% and 43\%. The
   system has been compared to a baseline case of an air breathing
   gasification system of a similar scale. It was found that steam
   gasification produces the syngas with heating values over twice as high
   as those obtained by air gasification. Steam gasification also led to a
   25\% and 50\% reduction in emission rates of contaminants like CO2 and
   nitrogen oxides respectively relative to the baseline case. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Purpose: Pain accompanying intravenous injections of propofol is a major
   problem in anesthesia. Pain is ascribed to the interaction of propofol
   with the local vasculature and could be impacted by rapid dissolution of
   the emulsion formulation to release the drug. In this paper, we measure
   the dissolution of propofol emulsions including the commercial
   formulation Diprivan (R).
   Methods: We image the turbidity of blood protein sink solutions after
   emulsions are injected. The images are digitized, and the drug release
   times are estimated from the pixel intensity data for a range of
   starting emulsion droplet size. Drug release times are compared to a
   mechanistic model.
   Results: After injection, pixel intensity or turbidity decreases due to
   reductions in emulsion droplet size. Drug release times can still be
   measured even if the emulsion does not completely dissolve such as with
   Diprivan (R). Both pure propofol emulsions and Diprivan (R) release drug
   very rapidly (under five seconds). Reducing emulsion droplet size
   significantly increases the drug release rate. Drug release times
   observed are slightly longer than the model prediction likely due to
   imperfect mixing.
   Conclusions: Drug release from emulsions occurs very rapidly after
   injection. This could be a contributing factor to pain on injection of
   propofol emulsions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Theory and experimental demonstration of a cylindrical radial
   superlattice (CRS) conductor composed of alternating nanoscopic
   non-ferromagnetic/ferromagnetic metal layers are presented with focus on
   low conductor loss in a K-band microwave spectrum. The dynamic frequency
   response of the ferromagnetic thin films has been extracted using the
   Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation which shows a negative magnetic
   permeability value in the frequencies above its ferromagnetic resonance.
   The reduction of the conductor loss results from the eddy current
   canceling (ECC) effect in the CRS conductors, where the
   negative-permeability ferromagnetic and positive-permeability
   non-ferromagnetic metal layers produce a zero effective permeability,
   resulting in virtually infinite skin depth at the targeted frequency.
   The closed and uniform boundary conditions inherent in the radial shape
   conductors preclude discontinuity effects occurring at the edges of the
   planar superlattice conductor and end up with a more effective ECC
   effect in practice. The design aspects with regards to the CRS materials
   and structural configuration are discussed. Simulations using a
   full-wave finite element method high frequency structure simulator are
   performed to show the ECC effect inside the CRS conductors. An
   air-lifted inductor made of the CRS conductor has been implemented to
   prove the effectiveness of the conductor loss reduction with the CRS
   conductor. The inductor shows an inductance value of 1-2 nH and a
   Q-factor of 45 at 18 GHz, which is the highest value reported at the
   frequency by now. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the development of a concurrent
   atomistic-continuum (CAC) methodology for simulation of the grain
   boundary (GB) structures and their interaction with other defects in
   ionic materials. Simulation results show that the CAC simulation allows
   a smooth passage of cracks through the atomistic-continuum interface
   without the need for additional constitutive rules or special numerical
   treatment; both the atomic-scale structures and the energies of the four
   different {[}001] tilt GBs in bi-crystal strontium titanate obtained by
   CAC compare well with those obtained by existing experiments and density
   function theory calculations. Although 98.4\% of the degrees of freedom
   of the simulated atomistic system have been eliminated in a coarsely
   meshed finite-element region, the CAC results, including the
   stress-strain responses, the GB-crack interaction mechanisms and the
   effect of the interaction on the fracture strength, are comparable with
   that of all-atom molecular dynamics simulation results. In addition, CAC
   simulation results show that the GB-crack interaction has a significant
   effect on the fracture behaviour of bi-crystal strontium titanate; not
   only the misorientation angle but also the atomic-level details of the
   GB structure influence the effect of the GB on impeding crack
   propagation.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria in the natural environment exist as interface- associated
   colonies known as biofilms. Complex mechanisms are often involved in
   biofilm formation and development. Despite the understanding of the
   molecular mechanisms involved in biofilm formation, it remains unclear
   how physical effects in standing cultures influence biofilm development.
   The topology of the solid interface has been suggested as one of the
   physical cues influencing bacteria- surface interactions and biofilm
   development. Using the model organism Bacillus subtilis, we study the
   transformation of swimming bacteria in liquid culture into robust
   biofilms in a range of confinement geometries (planar, spherical and
   toroidal) and interfaces (air/water, silicone/water, and silicone
   elastomer/ water). We find that B. subtilis form submerged biofilms at
   both solid and liquid interfaces in addition to air- water pellicles.
   When confined, bacteria grow on curved surfaces of both positive and
   negative Gaussian curvature. However, the confinement geometry does
   affect the resulting biofilm roughness and relative coverage. We also
   find that the biofilm location is governed by oxygen availability as
   well as by gravitational effects; these compete with each other in some
   situations. Overall, our results demonstrate that confinement geometry
   is an effective way to control oxygen availability and subsequently
   biofilm growth.}},

Abstract = {{Pushing the critical heat flux (CHF) limit in boiling has been a
   century-old challenge. Overcoming this challenge can greatly benefit
   advancements of myriad devices in which a large quantity of heat must be
   removed from a small surface. The occurrence of CHF is accompanied by
   the formation of significant vapor adjacent to the heated surface, such
   that liquid cannot rewet the surface. Here, a new concept is implemented
   to ensure that liquid always displaces the vapor near the heated
   surface. In the new approach, flow is constrained within a hydrophilic
   microstructure by a hydrophobic vapor-permeable nanostructure. A bubble
   bounded between the two structures is pulled away from the hydrophilic
   heated structure and discharged from the flow, thus leading to a
   fundamental change in CHF dynamics. The performance of a device based on
   this principle exceeded that of prior studies, with some metrics
   exhibiting an order of magnitude improvement. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Impact of homogeneous strain on uranium vacancy diffusion in uranium
   dioxide}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{We present a detailed mechanism of, and the effect of homogeneous
   strains on, the migration of uranium vacancies in UO2. Vacancy migration
   pathways and barriers are identified using density functional theory and
   the effect of uniform strain fields are accounted for using the dipole
   tensor approach. We report complex migration pathways and noncubic
   symmetry associated with the uranium vacancy in UO2 and show that these
   complexities need to be carefully accounted for to predict the correct
   diffusion behavior of uranium vacancies. We show that under homogeneous
   strain fields, only the dipole tensor of the saddle with respect to the
   minimum is required to correctly predict the change in the energy
   barrier between the strained and the unstrained case. Diffusivities are
   computed using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for both neutral and
   fully charged state of uranium single and divacancies. We calculate the
   effect of strain on migration barriers in the temperature range 800-1800
   K for both vacancy types. Homogeneous strains as small as 2\% have a
   considerable effect on diffusivity of both single and divacancies of
   uranium, with the effect of strain being more pronounced for single
   vacancies than divacancies. In contrast, the response of a given defect
   to strain is less sensitive to changes in the charge state of the
   defect. Further, strain leads to anisotropies in the mobility of the
   vacancy and the degree of anisotropy is very sensitive to the nature of
   the applied strain field for strain of equal magnitude. Our results
   suggest that the influence of strain on vacancy diffusivity will be
   significantly greater when single vacancies dominate the defect
   structure, such as sintering, while the effects will be much less
   substantial under irradiation conditions where divacancies dominate.}},

Abstract = {{To minimize environmental pharmaceutical micropollutants, treatment of
   human urine could be an efficient approach due to the high
   pharmaceutical concentration and toxic potential excreted in urine. This
   study investigated the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of
   sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and
   N-4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (acetyl-SMX) in synthetic fresh and
   hydrolyzed human urines by low-pressure UV, and UV combined with H2O2
   and peroxydisulfate (PDS). The objective was to compare the two advanced
   oxidation processes (AOPs) and assess the impact of urine matrices. All
   three compounds reacted quickly in the AOPs, exhibiting rate constants
   of (6.09-8.53) x 10(9) M-1.s(-1) with hydroxyl radical, and (2.35-16.1)
   x 10(9) M-1.s(-1) with sulfate radical. In fresh urine matrix, the
   pharmaceuticals' indirect photolysis was significantly suppressed by the
   scavenging effect of urine citrate and urea. In hydrolyzed urine matrix,
   the indirect photolysis was strongly affected by inorganic urine
   constituents. Chloride had no apparent impact on UV/H2O2, but
   significantly raised the hydroxyl radical concentration in UV/PDS.
   Carbonate species reacted with hydroxyl or sulfate radical to generate
   carbonate radical, which degraded SMX and TMP, primarily due to the
   presence of aromatic amino group(s) (k = 2.68 x 10(8) and 3.45 x 10(7)
   M-1.s(-1)) but reacted slowly with acetyl-SMX. Ammonia reacted with
   hydroxyl or sulfate radical to generate reactive nitrogen species that
   could react appreciably only with SMX. Kinetic simulation of radical
   concentrations, along with products analysis, helped elucidate the major
   reactive species in the pharmaceuticals' degradation. Overall, the AOPs'
   performance was higher in the hydrolyzed urine than fresh urine matrix
   with UV/PDS better than UV/H2O2, and varied significantly depending on
   pharmaceutical's structure.}},

Abstract = {{Various applications require networked agents to cooperatively achieve
   specified formations. In this paper, formation reconfiguration for a
   group of identical agents with limited communication capabilities is
   considered. Since the considered agents are identical, their roles are
   interchangeable, and each position in the desired formation can be taken
   by any agent. To reduce the total amount of node movement required for
   formation reconfiguration, a weighted graph-matching-based node-mapping
   strategy is developed to specify the node correspondence between an
   arbitrary initial graph and the desired graph. After the node mapping is
   determined, agents are required to move physically to form the desired
   formation. Since agents are only able to communicate within a certain
   range, formation reconfiguration must be accomplished with network
   connectivity constraints (i.e., specified nodes remain within specified
   sensing and communication ranges). A decentralized control scheme is
   developed to guarantee network connectivity by maintaining a desired
   neighborhood determined by the node-mapping algorithm, and to ensure
   convergence of all agents to the desired configuration with collision
   avoidance among agents. The developed strategy is demonstrated through
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Previous field observations revealed that the wave boundary layer is one
   of the main conduits delivering fine sediments from the nearshore to
   continental shelves. Recently, a series of turbulence-resolving
   simulations further demonstrated the existence of a range of flow
   regimes due to different degrees of sediment-induced density
   stratification controlled by the sediment availability. In this study,
   we investigate the scenario in which sediment availability is governed
   by the resuspension/deposition from/to the bed. Specifically, we focus
   on how the critical shear stress of erosion and the settling velocity
   can determine the modes of transport. Simulations reveal that at a given
   wave intensity, which is associated with more energetic muddy shelves
   and a settling velocity of about 0.5 mm/s, three transport modes,
   ranging from the well-mixed transport (mode I), two-layer like transport
   with the formation of lutocline (mode II), and laminarized transport
   (mode III) are obtained as the critical shear stress of erosion reduces.
   Moreover, reductions in the settling velocity also yield similar
   transitions of transport modes. We also demonstrate that the onset of
   laminarization can be well explained by the reduction of wave-averaged
   bottom stress to about 0.39 Pa due to attenuated turbulence by
   sediments. A 2-D parametric map is proposed to characterize the
   transition from one transport mode to another as a function of the
   critical shear stress and the settling velocity at a fixed wave
   intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Through aeroelastic effects, the various structural parameters of a wing
   can have significant effects on the flight dynamics of any size of
   aerial vehicle. If these parameters could be manipulated in flight, the
   aeroelastic interactions could, in turn, be leveraged for control
   purposes. If done properly, this approach has the potential to yield a
   significant improvement over conventional control surfaces for highly
   aeroelastic vehicles in terms of maneuverability. In this paper, the
   preliminary analysis of a proposed structural system with this
   capability is presented. The proposed system is a combination of a
   highly flexible conventionally configured wing structure, piezoelectric
   actuation, and a feedback loop. This system embeds a haptic system into
   the rear spar of the wing, the effects of which are adjustable by means
   of a gain parameter. The analysis presented in this paper shows the
   feasibility of the design and effectiveness of an unoptimized
   configuration, relocating the flexural axis by approximately 22\%. This
   preliminary analysis establishes that the presented
   structural-parameter-actuation design, termed flexural-axis control, is
   practical and realizable.}},

Title = {{OR Forum-A Glimpse at an Operation Analyst's World War II: ``Report on
   the Combat Performance of the Remote Control Turrets of B-29

Abstract = {{Alex Green was a pioneering operations analyst/researcher for the U.S.
   Army Air Force during World War II. His February 1945 operations
   analysis ``Report on the Combat Performance of the Remote Control
   Turrets of B-29 Aircraft{''} was classified and buried for 70 years.
   Stationed in the China-Burma-India theatre and addressing a problem of
   combat losses posed by General Curtis LeMay, Green used written reports
   and interviews to draw conclusions regarding direction of enemy attack
   on the B-29s, opposite those of a large stateside simulation study.
   Resulting in LeMay's changes in B-29 flight formations and frontal
   armaments, his report also addressed B-29 gun dispersion adjustments and
   modifications to the analog computer in the plane's nose. This paper
   examines how Green drew his conclusions under wartime conditions before
   digital computers. Apart from the extraordinary advances in computer
   technology, much of his methodology is still relevant today and a part
   of operations research (OR). This paper offers a window into the origins
   of OR and remarkable efforts of its pioneers.}},
