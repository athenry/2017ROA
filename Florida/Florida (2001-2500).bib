Abstract = {{An empirical investigation of the scintillation mechanism in a
   pressurized He-4 gas fast neutron detector was conducted using pulse
   shape fitting. Scintillation signals from neutron interactions were
   measured and averaged to produce a single generic neutron pulse shape
   from both a Cf-252 spontaneous fission source and a (d,d) neutron
   generator. An expression for light output over time was then developed
   by treating the decay of helium excited states in the same manner as the
   decay of radioactive isotopes. This pulse shape expression was fitted to
   the measured neutron pulse shape using a least-squares optimization
   algorithm, allowing an empirical analysis of the mechanism of
   scintillation inside the He-4 detector. A further understanding of this
   mechanism in the He-4 detector will advance the use of this system as a
   neutron spectrometer. For Cf-252 neutrons, the triplet and singlet time
   constants were found to be 970 ns and 686 ns, respectively. For neutrons
   from the (d, d) generator, the time constants were found to be 884 ns
   and 636 ns. Differences were noted in the magnitude of these parameters
   compared to previously published data, however the general relationships
   were noted to be the same and checked with expected trends from theory.
   Of the excited helium states produced from a Cf-252 neutron interaction,
   76\% were found to be born as triplet states, similar to the result from
   the neutron generator of 71\%. The two sources yielded similar pulse
   shapes despite having very different neutron energy spectra, validating
   the robustness of the fits across various neutron energies. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The effect of thermal annealing on the net donor concentration and
   diffusion of Si in In0.53Ga0.47As is compared for electrically active
   layers formed by ion implantation versus molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
   Upon thermal treatment at temperatures of 700 degrees C or higher for 10
   min, both ion implanted and growth-doped substrates converge to a common
   net donor solubility. These results indicate that while MBE doped
   substrates typically exhibit higher active concentrations relative to
   implanted substrates, the higher active Si concentrations from MBE
   growth are metastable and susceptible to deactivation upon subsequent
   thermal treatments after growth. Active Si doping concentrations in MBE
   doped material and ion-implanted materials are shown to converge toward
   a fixed net donor solubility limit of 1.4 x 10(19) cm(-3). Secondary ion
   mass spectroscopy of annealed samples indicates that the diffusivity of
   Si in MBE doped substrates is higher than those of ion implanted
   substrates presumably due to concentration-dependent diffusion effects.

Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers a parking competition game where a finite number of
   vehicles from different origins compete for the same number of parking
   spaces located at various places in a downtown area to minimize their
   own parking costs. If one vehicle reaches a desired vacant parking space
   before another vehicle, it will occupy the space and the other vehicle
   would have to search elsewhere. We first present a system of nonlinear
   equations to describe the equilibrium assignment of parking spaces to
   vehicles, and then discuss optimal pricing schemes that steer such
   parking competition to a system optimum assignment of parking spaces.
   These schemes are characterized by a union of polyhedrons. Given that
   the equilibrium state of parking competition is not unique, we further
   introduce a valid price vector to ensure that the parking competition
   outcome will always be system optimum. A sufficient condition is
   provided for the existence of such a valid price vector. Lastly, we seek
   for a robust price vector that yields the best worst-case outcome of the
   parking competition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: The use of sunlight to make chemical fuels (i.e., solar
   fuels) is an attractive approach in the quest to develop sustainable
   energy sources. Using nature as a guide, assemblies for artificial
   photosynthesis will need to perform multiple functions. They will need
   to be able to harvest light across a broad region of the solar spectrum,
   transport excited-state energy to charge-separation sites, and then
   transport and store redox equivalents for use in the catalytic reactions
   that produce chemical fuels. This multifunctional behavior will require
   the assimilation of multiple components into a single macromolecular
   system.
   A wide variety of different architectures including porphyrin arrays,
   peptides, dendrimers, and polymers have been explored, with each design
   posing unique challenges. Polymer assemblies are attractive due to their
   relative ease of production and facile synthetic modification. However,
   their disordered nature gives rise to stochastic dynamics not present in
   more ordered assemblies. The rational design of assemblies requires a
   detailed understanding of the energy and electron transfer events that
   follow light absorption, which can occur on time scales ranging from
   femtoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, necessitating the use of
   sophisticated techniques. We have used a combination absorption and
   emission spectroscopies with observation times that span 9 orders of
   magnitude to follow evolution within polymer-based molecular assemblies.
   We complement experimental observations with molecular dynamics
   simulations to develop a microscopic view of these dynamics.
   This Account provides an overview of our work on polymers decorated with
   pendant Ru(II) chromophores, both in solution and on surfaces. We have
   examined site-to-site energy transport among the Ru(II) complexes, and
   in systems incorporating, pi-conjugated polymers, we have observed
   ultrafast formation of a long-lived charge-separated state. When
   attached to TiO2, these assemblies exhibit multifunctional behavior in
   which photon absorption is followed by energy transport to the surface
   and electron injection to produce an oxidized metal complex. The
   oxidizing equivalent is then transferred to the conjugated polymer,
   giving rise to a long-lived charge-separated state.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a contact lens system that will control the release
   of an osmoprotectant and a moisturizing agent with the aim to reduce
   symptoms of ocular dryness.
   Materials and methods: Profiles of the release of osmoprotectant betaine
   and moisturizing agent dexpanthenol from senofilcon A and narafilcon B
   contact lenses were determined in vitro under sink conditions. Both
   types of lenses were also infused with vitamin E to increase the
   duration of drug release due to the formation of the vitamin E diffusion
   barriers in the lenses. The release profiles from vitamin E-infused
   lenses were compared with those from the control lenses.
   Results: Both dexpanthenol and betaine are released from commercial
   silicone hydrogel lenses for only about 10 min. Vitamin E loadings into
   contact lenses at about 20-23\% can increase the release times to about
   10 h, which is about 60 times larger compared to the control unmodified
   lenses.
   Conclusions: Vitamin E-loaded silicone hydrogel contact lenses released
   betaine and dexpanthenol in a controlled fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Overhead video from a small number of laboratory tests conducted by
   Kaihatu et al. at the Tsunami Wave Basin at Oregon State University
   shows that the breaking point of a shoaling solitary wave shifts to
   deeper water if random waves are present. The analysis of the laboratory
   data collected confirms that solitary waves indeed tend to break earlier
   in the presence of random wave field, and suggests that the effect is
   the result of the radiation stresses gradient induced by the random wave
   fields. Atheoretical approach based on the forced KdV equation is shown
   to successfully predict the shoaling process of the solitary wave. An
   ensemble of tests simulated using a state-of-the-art nonhydrostatic
   model is used to test the statistical significance of the process. The
   results of this study point to a potentially significant oceanographic
   process that has so far been ignored and suggest that systematic
   research into the interaction between tsunami waves and the swell
   background could increase the accuracy of tsunami forecasting.}},

Journal = {{MICROVASCULAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{29-39}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Abnormal or compromised microvascular function is a key component of
   various diseases. In vivo microscopy of microvessel function in
   preclinical models can be useful for the study of a disease state and
   effects of new treatments. Wide-field imaging of microvascular
   oxygenation via hemoglobin (Hb) saturation measurements has been applied
   in various applications alone and in combination with other measures of
   microvessel function, such as blood flow. However, most current combined
   imaging methods of microvessel function do not provide direct
   information on microvessel network connectivity or changes in
   connections and blood flow pathways. First-pass fluorescence (FPF)
   imaging of a systemically administered fluorescent contrast agent can be
   used to directly image blood flow pathways and connections relative to a
   local supplying arteriole in a quantitative manner through measurement
   of blood supply time (BST). Here, we demonstrate the utility of
   information produced by the combination of Hb saturation measurements
   via spectral imaging with BST measurements via FPF imaging for
   correlation of microvessel oxygenation with blood flow pathways and
   connections throughout a local network. Specifically, we show network
   pathway effects on oxygen transport in normal microvessels, dynamic
   changes associated with wound healing, and pathological effects of
   abnormal angiogenesis in tumor growth and development. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel uranium dioxide (UO2)-carbon nanotube (CNT) ceramic matrix
   composite fuel concept has been proposed for a nuclear fuel with
   increased thermal conductivity. Investigations were performed to analyze
   the dispersion of CNTs in a UO2 matrix utilizing homogenization and
   sonication techniques. Ethanol and ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) were
   utilized as solvents during the mixing process. Distributions of both
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
   were analyzed. It has been determined that CNTs can be homogeneously
   distributed into a UO2 matrix using mechanical processes, sonication,
   and homogenization in the organic solvent ODCB. The powder mixture of
   UO2 and CNTs was sintered at 1300 degrees C with a hold time of 5 min
   and 40-MP a pressure in a spark plasma sintering furnace, and the
   resulting grain size distribution was analyzed. It was observed that
   where the distribution of CNTs was not well controlled, significant
   grain growth of UO2 occurred. However, where the CNT distribution is
   well controlled, the grain growth is limited by the pinning effect of
   the CNTs along the grain boundaries. The resulting pellet thermal
   conductivity was improved by 29.7\% with the addition of 5 vol \% SWNT,
   relative to pure UO2 values. Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with
   scanning electron microscopy shows that most CNTs survive both the
   mixing and sintering processes.}},

Title = {{Ocean current estimation using a Multi-Model Ensemble Kalman Filter
   during the Grand Lagrangian Deployment experiment (GLAD)}},
Journal = {{OCEAN MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{In the summer and fall of 2012, during the GLAD experiment in the Gulf
   of Mexico, the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of
   Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) used several ocean models to
   assist the deployment of more than 300 surface drifters. The Navy
   Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) at 1 km and 3 km resolutions, the US Navy
   operational NCOM at 3 km resolution (AMSEAS), and two versions of the
   Hybrid Coordinates Ocean Model (HYCOM) set at 4 km were running daily
   and delivering 72-h range forecasts. They all assimilated remote sensing
   and local profile data but they were not assimilating the drifter's
   observations. This work presents a non-intrusive methodology named
   Multi-Model Ensemble Kalman Filter that allows assimilating the local
   drifter data into such a set of models, to produce improved ocean
   currents forecasts. The filter is to be used when several modeling
   systems or ensembles are available and/or observations are not entirely
   handled by the operational data assimilation process. It allows using
   generic in situ measurements over short time windows to improve the
   predictability of local ocean dynamics and associated high-resolution
   parameters of interest for which a forward model exists (e.g. oil spill
   plumes). Results can be used for operational applications or to derive
   enhanced background fields for other data assimilation systems, thus
   providing an expedite method to non-intrusively assimilate local
   observations of variables with complex operators. Results for the GLAD
   experiment show the method can improve water velocity predictions along
   the observed drifter trajectories, hence enhancing the skills of the
   models to predict individual trajectories. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{47-52}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Bismuth tri-iodide (BiI3) is an attractive material for high energy
   resolution radiation detectors. For the purpose of this research,
   detectors were fabricated using single crystals grown from ultra-pure
   BiI3 powder; synthesized by the Physical Vapor Transport (PVT)
   technique. This technique yielded powder with total impurity level of
   7.9 ppm. Efforts were also made to purify commercial BiI3 powder using a
   custom-built Traveling Zone Refining (TZR) system. Initial trial runs
   were successful in reducing the total impurity level of the commercial
   powder from 200 ppm to less than 50 ppm. Using the modified vertical
   Bridgman technique and a customized sharp tip ampoule, a large BiI3
   single crystal was grown. The crystal had a surface area of 2.2 cm(2)
   and a thickness of 0.8 cm, which corresponds to a volume of 1.78 cm(3).
   Radiation detectors were fabricated and then tested by measuring their
   electrical characteristics and radiation response. An alpha particle
   spectrum (using a Am-241 alpha-source) was recorded at room temperature
   with a BiI3 detector 0.09 cm thick and with a surface area of 0.16
   cm(2). The electron mobility was estimated to be 433 +/- 79 cm(2)/V. (C)

Abstract = {{A database of atomic mobility parameters for single phase Mg-X (X=Ag,
   Al, Be, Cd, Ce, In, Fe, Ga, La, Mn, Ni, Sb, Sn, U, and Zn) systems was
   developed through the critical assessment of available Mg diffusion
   literature. Optimization of the binary diffusion activation energy terms
   for Ag, Al, Sn, and Zn solutes, as well as the Al-Zn interaction
   parameter were completed through the coupling of an existing
   thermodynamic database with the DICTRA software program. In general,
   agreement between simulated and experimental diffusion profiles was
   observed, although limitations for extrapolation to higher order systems
   were seen due to the limited multicomponent diffusion studies in Mg.
   This work, however, ultimately provides the foundation for the
   integration of diffusion simulations and predictions in future Mg alloy
   design. Further research to expand the current database, through either
   the experimental measurement or. simulation of multicomponent diffusion
   and diffusivity in other phases (e.g. inter-metallics, liquid), is
   expected to increase the database utility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{By mimicking natural lignin degradation systems, the Fenton catalyst
   (Fe3+, H2O2) can effectively facilitate lignin depolymerization in
   supercritical ethanol (7MPa, 250 degrees C) to give organic oils that
   consist of mono- and oligomeric aromatics, phenols, dicarboxylic acids,
   and their derivatives in yields up to (66.0 +/- 8.5)\%. The thermal
   properties, functional groups, and surface chemistry of lignin before
   and after Fenton treatment were examined by thermogravimetric analysis,
   pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, (PNMR)-P-31
   spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results suggest
   that the Fenton catalyst facilitates lignin depolymerization through
   cleavage of -ether bonds between lignin residues. The formation of a
   lignin-iron chelating complex effectively depresses lignin
   recondensation; thus minimizing charcoal formation and enhancing the
   yield of liquid products.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife management to reduce the impact of wildlife on their habitat
   can be done in several ways, among which removing animals (by either
   culling or translocation) is most often used. There are, however,
   alternative ways to control wildlife densities, such as opening or
   closing water points. The effects of these alternatives are poorly
   studied. In this paper, we focus on manipulating large herbivores
   through the closure of water points (WPs). Removal of artificial WPs has
   been suggested in order to change the distribution of African elephants,
   which occur in high densities in national parks in Southern Africa and
   are thought to have a destructive effect on the vegetation. Here, we
   modeled the long-term effects of different scenarios of WP closure on
   the spatial distribution of elephants, and consequential effects on the
   vegetation and other herbivores in Kruger National Park, South Africa.
   Using a dynamic ecosystem model, SAVANNA, scenarios were evaluated that
   varied in availability of artificial WPs; levels of natural water; and
   elephant densities. Our modeling results showed that elephants can
   indirectly negatively affect the distributions of meso-mixed feeders,
   meso-browsers, and some meso-grazers under wet conditions. The closure
   of artificial WPs hardly had any effect during these natural wet
   conditions. Under dry conditions, the spatial distribution of both
   elephant bulls and cows changed when the availability of artificial
   water was severely reduced in the model. These changes in spatial
   distribution triggered changes in the spatial availability of woody
   biomass over the simulation period of 80 years, and this led to changes
   in the rest of the herbivore community, resulting in increased densities
   of all herbivores, except for giraffe and steenbok, in areas close to
   rivers. The spatial distributions of elephant bulls and cows showed to
   be less affected by the closure of WPs than most of the other herbivore
   species. Our study contributes to ecologically informed decisions in
   wildlife management. The results from this modeling exercise imply that
   long-term effects of this intervention strategy should always be
   investigated at an ecosystem scale.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a single degree of freedom suspension system to
   assist small six degree of freedom robots manipulating heavy payload.
   The goal of the system is to reduce the load applied to the last link of
   a robot manipulating a payload that is heavier than the robot's
   specified allowable load capacity. An assistive suspension system was
   implemented to realize vertical-only motion of the robot. A mathematical
   model was derived, and a proportional-integral-derivative controller
   with an inner velocity loop was designed Variable parameters in the
   model such as friction coefficients were identified in an experiment on
   the voltage input and velocity output. To determine how much the
   assistive system reduces the load on the robot, the system was connected
   to the robot using an interface attached with magnets and a force sensor
   was fixed to the last link of the robot. In the experiment, the cable
   tension was measured and controlled to satisfy the design preference for
   the assistive system to be stand-alone, rather than relying on force
   sensor on the robot. The experiment was performed using various control
   gains under different conditions, such as the periods of input motion
   and payload weight. The results showed that the system could reduce 3.8
   and 6.0 kg payloads on the robot to 50\% and 40\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{After an incident of radiological dispersal devices (RDD), health care
   providers will be exposed to the contaminated patients in the extended
   medical treatments. Assessment of potential radiation dose to the health
   care providers will be crucial to minimize their health risk. In this
   study, we compiled a set of conversion coefficients (mSv MBq(-1) s(-1))
   to readily estimate the effective dose from the time-integrated activity
   for the health care providers while they deal with internally
   contaminated patients at different ages. We selected Co-60, Ir-192,
   Am-241, Cs-137, and I-131 as the major radionuclides that may be used
   for RDD. We obtained the age-specific organ burdens after the inhalation
   of those radionuclides from the Dose and Risk Calculation Software
   (DCAL) program. A series of hybrid computational phantoms (1-, 5-, 10-,
   and 15 year-old, and adult males) were implemented in a general purpose
   Monte Carlo (MC) transport code, MCNPX v 2.7, to simulate an adult male
   health care provider exposed to contaminated patients at different ages.
   Two exposure scenarios were taken into account: a health care provider
   (a) standing at the side of patients lying in bed and (b) sitting face
   to face with patients. The conversion coefficients overall depended on
   radionuclides, the age of the patients, and the orientation of the
   patients. The conversion coefficient was greatest for Co-60 and smallest
   for Am-241. The dose from the 1 year-old patient phantom was up to three
   times greater than that from the adult patient phantom. The conversion
   coefficients were less dependent on the age of the patients in the
   scenario of a health care provider sitting face to face with patients.
   The dose conversion coefficients established in this study will be
   useful to readily estimate the effective dose to the health care
   providers in RDD events.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the concepts of ``gravitational{''} and ``elastic{''}
   potential energy in the context of networks and investigate their
   implications on interpreting certain well-known graph-theoretic
   parameters and optimization problems. In the case of gravitational
   potential energy, we treat the nodes of a graph as ``particles{''} with
   masses and consider the potential energy of gravitational interactions
   between them. We prove that the maximum clique in a graph represents the
   minimum gravitational potential energy structure. This result yields a
   natural physics-based interpretation of the well-known Motzkin-Strauss
   formulation for the maximum clique problem. In the case of elastic
   potential energy, we assume that graph nodes are located on an elastic
   surface, the graph edges represent ``springs{''} connecting the nodes on
   the surface, and consider the potential energy corresponding to elastic
   deformations of springs. We show that under certain reasonable
   assumptions on surface deformation, the second-smallest and the largest
   eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix correspond to the minimum and
   the maximum elastic potential energies of a graph, respectively.
   Moreover, the associated eigenvectors correspond to the node heights in
   the minimum and maximum energy configurations. Note that the
   second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is widely known as
   algebraic connectivity, and it turns out that this concept also has a
   simple and intuitive physics-based interpretation.}},

Title = {{Experimental studies on the desorption of adsorbed sodium poly(acrylic
   acid) from crude kaolin particles}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{41-47}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The controlled stability and fluidity of highly concentrated
   kaolin dispersion is a crucial problem when kaolin is used in industry
   due to the charge heterogeneity of its surface. To solve the common
   industrial problems of dispersions prepared at high solid loadings in
   terms of their rheological behavior, some organic and inorganic
   dispersing agents have to be added into the system to modify the
   particle surfaces.
   Objective: Adsorption and desorption behaviors of sodium poly(acrylic
   acid) (NaPAA) on the surface of kaolin particles were investigated to
   elucidate the adsorption mechanism of the PAA-kaolin dispersion system
   within the scope of the rheology and the colloidal stability. We also
   investigated the structural changes in the kaolin particles due to the
   extraction of Si4+ and Al3+ ions when a dispersing agent was used.
   Method: Kaolin dispersions were prepared using NaPAA, and investigated
   in terms of the adsorption and desorption behaviors, the rheological and
   the electrokinetic properties and the extracted Al3+ and Si4+ ions from
   the particles.
   Results: As expected, PAA was strongly adsorbed on the positively
   charged alumina sites of the particles. According to the results
   obtained in the experiments of adsorption density,
   viscosity,zeta-potential and the dissolution of metal ion measurements
   for the adsorption/desorption, a strong and irreversible adsorption was
   observed between PAA and the surface of the kaolin surface, indicating
   the existence of unbreakable chemical bonds. This is due to the
   adsorption of negatively charged carboxylic acid groups (-COO-) from the
   PAA onto the positive alumina sites on the edges of the kaolin surface
   by electrostatic attraction. Due to the negative charge, no adsorption
   was observed on the silica surface of the particles within the working
   pH range of 5.3 to 8.4.
   Conclusion: The adsorption mechanism of PAA-kaolin interaction is
   attributed to chemical adsorption with the formation of chemical bonds
   between the charged carboxylic acid groups (-COO-) of the polymer and
   the alumina sites on the edges of the kaolin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   in 2050s relative to the baseline (1980-2009) due to climate change. A
   negative impact on yield is very likely, while the extent of impact is
   more uncertain. The share in uncertainties of impact projections was
   higher for the three GCMs than it was for the two RCPs and two crop
   models used in this study. Increasing nitrogen fertilization and use of
   irrigation were assessed as potentially effective adaptation options,
   which would offset negative impacts. However, the response of yields to
   increased fertilizer and irrigation will be less for climate change
   scenarios than under the baseline. Changes in planting dates also
   reduced negative impacts, while changing the maturity type of maize
   cultivars was not effective in most scenarios. The multi-model based
   analysis allowed estimating climate change impact and adaptation
   uncertainties, which can provide valuable insights and guidance for
   adaptation planning.}},

   (e.g., pseudomonotone). We present non-Euclidean extragradient (N-EG)
   methods for computing approximate strong solutions of these problems,
   and demonstrate how their iteration complexities depend on the global
   Lipschitz or Holder continuity properties for their operators and the
   smoothness properties for the distance generating function used in the
   N-EG algorithms. We also introduce a variant of this algorithm by
   incorporating a simple line-search procedure to deal with problems with
   more general continuous operators. Numerical studies are conducted to
   illustrate the significant advantages of the developed algorithms over
   the existing ones for solving large-scale GMVI problems.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of body thickness on the electrical
   performance of GaSb double-gate ultrathin-body (DG-UTB) MOSFET by
   examining the band structure of the 12- (similar to 2 nm), 24- (similar
   to 4 nm), 36- (similar to 6 nm), and 48- (similar to 8 nm) atomic-layer
   (AL) thick GaSb. Two different surface orientations, namely, (100) and
   (111), were studied. sp(3)d(5)s{*} tight-binding model is used to
   calculate the band structures of GaSb MOSFET. Ballistic transport was
   studied using the semiclassical top-of-barrier model with applied
   self-consistent real-space potential across the body. First, we found
   that for (100) surface orientation, GaSb DG-UTB FET with body thickness
   of 24 ALs offered relatively larger ON-state current for various gate
   dielectric materials studied. However, for (111) surface orientation, 12
   ALs GaSb DG-UTB FET showed the best performance due to its reasonably
   higher injection velocity and larger electron density. Furthermore, for
   the FET with a body thickness of 48 ALs and HfO2 dielectric, it was
   observed that the charge occupations shift toward the surface, unlike
   the cases of FETs with thinner body, leading to the formation of
   inversion charge on the surface. Finally, we compared the ON-state
   current of GaSb DG-UTB FET with different channel surface orientations
   and found that (100) surface generally outperforms (111) surface in
   terms of ON-state current.}},

Abstract = {{Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a bulk flow driven process. Its

   Development of surrogate imaging tracers that are co-infused during drug
   delivery now permit accurate, noninvasive real-time tracking of
   convective infusate flow in nervous system tissues. The potential
   advantages of CED in the CNS over other currently available drug

Abstract = {{The European Union's SOLO (Epidemiological Studies of Exposed Southern

   associated with chronic in utero radiation exposure. A comprehensive
   series of hybrid computational fetal phantoms was previously developed
   at the University of Florida in order to provide the SOLO project with
   the capability of computationally simulating and quantifying radiation
   exposures to individual fetal bones and soft tissue organs. To improve
   harmonization between the SOLO fetal biokinetic models and the
   computational phantoms, a subset of those phantoms was systematically
   modified to create a novel series of phantoms matching anatomical data
   representing Russian fetal biometry in the Southern Urals. Using
   previously established modeling techniques, eight computational
   Urals-based phantoms aged 8, 12, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, and 38 weeks
   post-conception were constructed to match appropriate age-dependent
   femur lengths, biparietal diameters, individual bone masses and
   whole-body masses. Bone and soft tissue organ mass differences between
   the common ages of the subset of UF phantom series and the Urals-based
   phantom series illustrated the need for improved understanding of fetal
   bone densities as a critical parameter of computational phantom
   development. In anticipation for SOLO radiation dosimetry studies
   involving the developing fetus and pregnant female, the completed
   phantom series was successfully converted to a cuboidal voxel format
   easily interpreted by radiation transport software.}},

Abstract = {{One of the many objectives of the European Union's SOLO (Epidemiological
   Studies of Exposed Southern Urals Populations) project is to quantify
   the radiation dose-response following chronic in utero exposures to
   ionizing radiation. The project is presently conducting a pooled
   analysis of two cohorts of individuals born to exposed mothers-the Techa
   River Offspring Cohort (TROC) and the Ozyorsk Offspring Cohort (OOC).
   The TROC includes the offspring of mothers with external exposures to
   contaminated riverbanks and internal ingestions of Sr-89, Sr-90/Y-90,
   and Cs-137/Ba-137m, while the OOC includes the offspring of mothers with
   external exposures seen within the Mayak plutonium production facilities
   and internal inhalation of Pu-239 and possibly I-131. In the present
   study, a newly created Urals-based series of fetal and maternal models
   is employed to assess S values for all seven radionuclides. Among all
   fetal ages, S values ranged in magnitude from 10(-14) to 10(-10) Gy per
   Bq-s for fetal source organs and from 10(-18) to 10(-14) Gy per Bq-s
   from maternal source organs, depending upon particle type, particle
   energy, and fetal age. For a given radionuclide and fetal age, S values
   for fetal source organs were approximately two orders of magnitude
   higher than for maternal source organs. Little variation in S values was
   observed among fetal source organs, while variations of over 100 \% with
   respect to the mean were observed for maternal source organs near the
   fetus. S value variations from maternal cross-fire were highly dependent
   on fetal position and separation distance from the maternal source
   organ. These radionuclide S values have been coupled with biokinetic
   models for use in cohort dose assessment within the SOLO project.}},

Abstract = {{The first-principles hybrid density functional theory is applied to the
   contrastive investigation on the structural and electronic properties of
   wurtzite ZnO under hydrostatic strain and uniaxial strain along c axial,
   and the effect of strain on electron effective mass. It is observed that
   the structural transformation of the wurtzite ZnO occurs under tensile
   hydrostatic strain and compressive uniaxial strain. The transformation
   of ZnO from wurtzite phase to graphitelike phase is accompanied by the
   transition from a direct to indirect band gap. The deformation
   potentials that quantify the changes of band gap with strain are also
   reported. When the hydrostatic strain changes from compression to
   tension, the electron effective masses at Gamma point in Sigma, T and
   Delta directions, and average electron effective mass decrease linearly.
   For the uniaxial strain, the changes of electron effective mass are
   dissimilar to the hydrostatic results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This article presents the findings of an investigation that used
   finite-element analysis to determine the influence of a concrete
   footing's dimensions on its temperature development and cracking at
   early age. A three-dimensional finite-element model was used to predict
   temperatures in the footing and to assess cracking potential of the
   concrete. A parametric study consisting of 63 finite-element analyses
   was conducted on three different footing shapes: (1) a cubic shape, (2)
   a length: width: depth ratio of 4: 4: 1, and (3) a length: width: depth
   ratio of 4:2:1. Volume-to-surface area ratios (v/a) ranged from 0.33 to
   4.0 m. The results showed that cracking potential does not depend on a
   footing's dimensions when its v/a is 1.3mor greater. Rectangular
   footings that have the same v/a but different shapes (dimensional
   proportions) developed a similar maximum temperature, a similar maximum
   temperature differential, and a similar minimum crack index under the
   same insulation condition. Smaller footings allowed slightly higher
   maximum temperature differential before thermal cracking occurred. (C)

Abstract = {{The cone penetration test (CPT) was evaluated as a tool for
   characterizing landfilled municipal solid waste (MSW). Cone penetration
   test soundings were performed at 16 locations in a closed MSW landfill
   in Florida, United States, where tip resistance (qt), sleeve friction
   resistance (fs), and friction ratio (fr) data were collected up to a
   depth of 10m, and compared to waste properties from borings in the same
   location as five of the CPTs. The delineation of cover soil, waste, and
   subgrade soil was readily identifiable from the CPT data, but
   intermediate cover layers could not be discerned. At greater depths in
   the landfill, waste generally exhibited greater degradation with an
   average biochemical methane potential of 0.044LCH4/g volatile solids
   versus shallower waste that was less degraded with an average BMP of
   0.200LCH4/g volatile solids. More degraded waste tended to have lower
   tip resistances of 3.6-3.7MPa than less degraded waste that exhibited
   5.0-5.4MPa. The friction ratio tended to be greater for more degraded
   waste (2.8-3.2\%) than less degraded waste (2.3-2.4\%). The CPT data
   collected from the MSW landfill were also compared to conventional
   correlations to soil classification systems. The CPT data for more
   degraded waste generally correlated with finer soil classifications
   while CPT readings of less degraded waste corresponded to more coarse
   soils. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity region of wireless networks with per-destination (PD)
   queueing model has been studied extensively in the literature. However,
   the PD queueing structure is not scalable because the number of queues
   in a node can be as large as the number of all possible
   source-destination pairs. In this work, we study the capacity region of
   wireless networks with per-link (PL) queueing model. The advantage of
   the PL queueing structure is that the number of queues in a node can be
   reduced significantly to the number of its neighboring nodes. In this
   paper, the capacity region of a wireless network with PL queueing
   structure is characterized, and a dynamic routing and power control
   policy, namely, DRPC-PL, is proposed to stabilize the network whenever
   the input rate is within the capacity region. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Abstract = {{The development of advanced scaffolds that recapitulate the anisotropic
   mechanical behavior and biological functions of the extracellular matrix
   in leaflets would be transformative for heart valve tissue engineering.
   In this study, anisotropic mechanical properties were established in
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels by crosslinking stripes of 3.4 kDa
   PEG diacrylate (PEGDA) within 20 kDa PEGDA base hydrogels using a
   photolithographic patterning method. Varying the stripe width and
   spacing resulted in a tensile elastic modulus parallel to the stripes
   that was 4.1-6.8 times greater than that in the perpendicular direction,
   comparable to the degree of anisotropy between the circumferential and
   radial orientations in native valve leaflets. Biomimetic PEG-peptide
   hydrogels were prepared by tethering the cell-adhesive peptide RGDS and
   incorporating the collagenase-degradable peptide PQ (GGGPQG down arrow
   IWGQGK) into the polymer network. The specific amounts of RGDS and
   PEG-PQ within the resulting hydrogels influenced the elongation, de novo
   extracellular matrix deposition and hydrogel degradation behavior of
   encapsulated valvular interstitial cells (VICs). In addition, the
   morphology and activation of VICs grown atop PEG hydrogels could be
   modulated by controlling the concentration or micro-patterning profile
   of PEG-RGDS. These results are promising for the fabrication of
   PEG-based hydrogels using anatomically and biologically inspired
   scaffold design features for heart valve tissue engineering. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Finding a scenic route between two locations is a common trip planning
   task, in particular for tourists and recreational travelers. For the
   automated computation of a scenic route in a trip planning system it is
   necessary to identify which attributes of a route and its surroundings
   are associated with attractive scenery. This study uses a route choice
   model, more specifically a Path Size Logit (PSL) model, to identify the
   relevant attributes and their relative importance. Three hypotheses are
   formulated and tested with three PSL models to understand the effects of
   different attributes on scenic route selection. The set of chosen scenic
   routes are based on various VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information)
   data that have been extracted for California as a study region. The
   results identify several variables of the surrounding environment as
   significant contributors to route scenery after controlling for road

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) and the parkinsonian variant of multiple system
   atrophy (MSAp) are neurodegenerative disorders that can be difficult to
   differentiate clinically. This study provides the first characterization
   of the patterns of task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) changes across the whole brain in MSAp. We used fMRI during a
   precision grip force task and also performed voxel-based morphometry
   (VBM) on T-1-weighted images in MSAp patients, PD patients, and healthy
   controls. All groups were matched on age, and the patient groups had
   comparable motor symptom durations and severities. There were three main
   findings. First, MSAp and PD had reduced fMRI activation in motor
   control areas, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, primary
   sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices, and cerebellum compared with
   controls. Second, there were no activation differences among the disease
   groups in the basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, or primary sensorimotor
   cortices, but PD had more extensive activation deficits throughout the
   cerebrum compared with MSAp and controls. Third, VBM revealed reduced
   volume in the basal ganglia, middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles,
   pons, and throughout the cerebrum in MSAp compared with controls and PD,
   and additionally throughout the cerebellar cortex and vermis in MSAp
   compared with controls. Collectively, these results provide the first
   evidence that fMRI activation is abnormal in the basal ganglia,
   cerebellum, and cerebrum in MSAp, and that a key distinguishing feature
   between MSAp and PD is the extensive and widespread volume loss
   throughout the brain in MSAp. Hum Brain Mapp 36:1165-1179, 2015.(c) 2014

Abstract = {{Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR is applied to resolve different modes of
   ethene self diffusion inside a mixed-matrix membrane (MMM) consisting of
   ZIF-8 particles embedded in 6FDA-DAM polymer: (i) diffusion inside the
   ZIF-8 particles, (ii) diffusion inside the surrounding polymer matrix,
   and (iii) diffusion under conditions of an exchange between the
   particles and the polymer over length scales smaller than and comparable
   with the membrane thickness. This resolution is achieved using C-13 PFG
   NMR studies at a high magnetic field of 17.6 T and large magnetic held
   gradients up to 30 T/m. C-13 PFG NMR was also applied to measure ethene
   diffusion in the constituent components used in the MMM formation: a bed
   of ZIP-8 particles and a pure 6FDA-DAM polymer. It is shown that the
   comparison of all the measured diffusion data elucidates details of
   sorbate diffusion and diffusion mediated exchange dynamics between the
   ZIP-8 particles and the polymer in the MMM. An exchange model is applied
   to connect the long-range diffusivity measured for displacements larger
   than the size of ZIP-8 particles in the MMM with the diffusivities
   measured inside the ZIP-8 particles and the polymer. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fuel cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) has been a long-standing issue
   for the metallic fuel with a steel cladding in a sodium-cooled fast
   reactor, particularly for a high burnup fuel. Although the FCCI has been
   largely improved by alloying the fuels with Zr or Pd elements, applying
   a physical diffusion barrier between fuel and cladding, and employing
   advanced ferritic/martensitic (F/M) claddings, there is a scientific
   knowledge gap in understanding the behavior of chromium and its effects
   on the interdiffusion between lanthanides and advanced F/M steels that
   contain 9-12 wt.\% Cr. In this paper, we systematically studied the
   interdiffusion between cerium and Fe-Cr model alloys with Cr contents of
   6, 9 and 12 wt.\%. Following the thermal annealing at 560 degrees C for
   up to 100 h, detailed microstructural characterizations were performed
   to determine the interdiffusion microstructures, compositional
   distributions, diffusion kinetics, and phase structures in the
   interdiffusion zone. This study unambiguously disclosed that, as the Ce
   diffuses into Fe-Cr model alloys, Cr segregates and precipitates into
   Cr-rich sigma phase consisted of Fe and Cr instead of forming a ternary
   phase together with Fe and Ce. The precipitation of those nano-sized
   sigma phase particles at the Ce diffusion front would effectively slow
   down the interdiffusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tissues in the body are hierarchically structured composite materials
   with tissue-specific chemical and topographical properties. Here we
   report the preparation of tissue scaffolds with macroscopic pores
   generated via the dissolution of a sacrificial supramolecular
   polymer-based crystal template (urea) from a biodegradable polymer-based
   scaffold (polycaprolactone, PCL). Furthermore, we report a method of
   aligning the supramolecular polymer-based crystals within the PCL, and
   that the dissolution of the sacrificial urea yields scaffolds with
   macroscopic pores that are aligned over long, clinically-relevant
   distances (i.e., centimeter scale). The pores act as topographical cues
   to which rat Schwann cells respond by aligning with the long axis of the
   pores. Generation of an interpenetrating network of polypyrrole (PPy)
   and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) in the scaffolds yields electroactive
   tissue scaffolds that allow the electrical stimulation of Schwann cells
   cultured on the scaffolds which increases the production of nerve growth
   factor (NGF).}},

   Switching During Vascular Remodeling}},
Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-70}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In vitro perfusion systems have exposed vascular constructs to
   mechanical conditions that emulate physiological pulse pressure and
   found significant improvements in graft development. However, current
   models maintain constant, or set pulse/shear mechanics that do not
   account for the natural temporal variation in frequency. With an aim to
   develop clinically relevant small diameter vascular grafts, these
   investigations detail a perfusion culture model that incorporates
   temporal pulse pressure variation. Our objective was to test the
   hypothesis that short-term variation in heart rate, such as changes in
   respiratory activity, plays a significant role in vascular remodeling
   and graft development. The pulse rate of a healthy volunteer was logged
   to model the effect of daily activities on heart rate. Vascular
   bioreactors were used to deliver perfusion conditions based on modeled
   frequencies of temporal pulse variability, termed Physiologically
   Modeled Pulse Dynamics (PMPD). Acellular scaffolds derived from the
   human umbilical vein were seeded with human vascular smooth muscle cells
   and perfused under defined pulsatile conditions. vSMC exposed to
   constant pulse frequencies expressed a contractile phenotype, while
   exposure to PMPD drove cells to a synthetic state with continued cell
   proliferation, increased tensile strength and stiffness as well as
   diminished vasoactivity. Results show the temporal variation associated
   with normal heart physiology to have a profound effect on vascular
   remodeling and vasoactive function. While these models are
   representative of vascular regeneration further investigation is
   required to understanding these and other key regulators in vSMC
   phenotype switching in non-pathological or wound healing states. This
   under standing has important clinical implications that may lead to
   improved treatments that enhance vessel regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this project was to determine if biochar can be used to
   sequester antibiotic residues in the environment. Slurries of different
   biochars (n = 27) and water were evaluated for their capacity to adsorb
   two relatively hydrophilic veterinary antibiotics, florfenicol and
   ceftiofur. Freely available antibiotic was quantified using HPLC-UV and
   a bioassay. Biochars prepared at higher pyrolysis temperatures (>500
   degrees C) adsorbed the antibiotics with greater efficiency compared
   with lower preparation temperatures (P<0.005). Florfenicol was adsorbed
   (<99.9\%) by six different biochars while ceftiofur was adsorbed by
   these and nine additional biochars (>99.98\% and > 99.9\%,
   respectively). Florfenicol was sorbed by four biochars (>99.94\%) in the
   presence of soil; however, the sorption performance decreased for two
   biochars when calf urine and feces were added with the soil. The effect
   of the biochar proportions on florfenicol sorption in soil-urine-feces
   slurries were tested with two distinct pinewood biochars, yielding
   Freundlich sorption coefficients of 2160 and 312 L kg(-1). Pinewood
   biochar and potentially other types of biochar are excellent candidates
   for sequestering antibiotic residues in soil-urine-feces environments.

Abstract = {{Laser direct writing, a noncontact modified laser-induced forward
   transfer (LIFT) technique, has emerged as a promising technology for
   various applications from microelectronics printing to biofabrication.
   For it to be a viable technology, the bubble formation process during
   laser direct writing should be carefully examined. In this study, the
   bubble formation process during the laser direct writing of
   glycerol-water solutions has been studied using a nucleation-based phase
   explosion modeling approach. The effects of laser fluence and material
   properties of glycerol solution on the resulting bubble geometry have
   been examined both analytically and experimentally. Overall, a
   satisfactory modeling accuracy has been achieved, while the proposed
   modeling approach slightly underestimates the bubble diameter. Both the
   measured and predicted bubble diameters increase when the laser fluence
   increases. Interestingly, the measured and predicted diameters first
   decrease, then increase, and decrease again with the increase of
   glycerol concentration. Furthermore, it is noted that the bubble
   diameter is more sensitive to the laser fluence than the glycerol
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the ability of Sharklet (SK) micropatterns to
   inhibit lens epithelial cell (LEC) migration. Sharklet Technologies,
   Inc. (STI) and InSight Innovations, LLC have proposed to develop a
   Sharklet-patterned protective membrane (PM) to be implanted in
   combination with a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) to inhibit
   cellular migration across the posterior capsule, and thereby reduce
   rates of posterior capsular opacification (PCO).
   Methods: A variety of STI micropatterns were evaluated versus smooth
   (SM) controls in a modified scratch wound assay for the ability to
   reduce or inhibit LEC migration. The best performing topography was
   selected, translated to a radial design, and applied to PM prototypes.
   The PM prototypes were tested in an in vitro PCO model for reduction of
   cell migration behind an IOL versus unpatterned prototypes and IOLs with
   no PM. In both assays, cell migration was analyzed with fluorescent
   microscopy.
   Results: All SK micropatterns significantly reduced LEC migration
   compared with SM controls. Micropatterns that protruded from the surface
   reduced migration more than recessed features. The best performing
   micropattern reduced LEC coverage by 80\%, P = 0.0001 (ANOVA, Tukey
   Test). Micropatterned PMs reduced LEC migration in a PCO model by 50\%,
   P = 0.0005 (ANOVA, Tukey Test) compared with both IOLs with no PM and
   IOLs with SM PMs.
   Conclusions: Collectively, in vitro results indicate the implantation of
   micropatterned PMs in combination with posterior chamber IOLs could
   significantly reduce rates of clinically relevant PCO. This innovative
   technology is a globally accessible solution to high PCO rates.
   Translational Relevance: A novel IOL incorporating the SK micropattern
   in a membrane design surrounding the optic may help increase the success
   of cataract surgery by reducing secondary cataract, or PCO.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their high optical transparency and high electrical
   conductivity, ITO nanowires have been used in solar cells, diodes, and
   sensors. Synthesizing ITO nanowires reliably with controllable and
   reproducible structures and morphologies is desirable for many
   applications. However, the dependence of ITO nanowire structure and
   morphology on growth conditions has yet to be investigated
   systematically. In this work, experimental conditions including catalyst
   diameter, growth time, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure are
   varied to determine their impact on the diameter, length, and
   microstructure of synthesized nanowires. The diameters of the nanowires
   depend on the diameter of Au catalysts, however, not as directly as
   other studies have observed. Nanowire diameters of 99 nm were obtained
   when using 14 nm Au nanoclusters compared to 366 nm when using 321 nm Au
   nanoclusters. Nanowire length and diameters are independent of O-2
   partial pressure. However, the O-2 partial pressure had to remain below
   3.23 mTorr for successful nanowire growth. The optimal temperature for
   nanowire growth was 750 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights

Abstract = {{One popular technique for multimodal imaging is generalized assorted
   pixels (GAP), where an assorted pixel array on the image sensor allows
   for multimodal capture. Unfortunately, GAP is limited in its
   applicability because of the need for multimodal filters that are
   amenable with semiconductor fabrication processes and results in a fixed
   multimodal imaging configuration. In this paper, we advocate for
   generalized assorted camera (GAC) arrays for multimodal imaging-i.e., a
   camera array with filters of different characteristics placed in front
   of each camera aperture. The GAC provides us with three distinct
   advantages over GAP: ease of implementation, flexible
   application-dependent imaging since filters are external and can be
   changed and depth information that can be used for enabling novel
   applications (e.g., postcapture refocusing). The primary challenge in
   GAC arrays is that since the different modalities are obtained from
   different viewpoints, there is a need for accurate and efficient
   cross-channel registration. Traditional approaches such as
   sum-of-squared differences, sum-of-absolute differences, and mutual
   information all result in multimodal registration errors. Here, we
   propose a robust cross-channel matching cost function, based on aligning
   normalized gradients, which allows us to compute cross-channel subpixel
   correspondences for scenes exhibiting nontrivial geometry. We highlight
   the promise of GAC arrays with our cross-channel normalized gradient
   cost for several applications such as low-light imaging, postcapture
   refocusing, skin perfusion imaging using color + near infrared, and
   hyperspectral imaging.}},

Abstract = {{In shallow water table-controlled environments, surface water management
   impacts groundwater table levels and soil water dynamics. The study goal
   was to simulate soil water dynamics in response to canal stage raises
   considering uncertainty in measured soil water content. Water and
   Agrochemicals in the soil, crop and Vadose Environment (WAVE) was
   applied to simulate unsaturated flow above a shallow aquifer. Global
   sensitivity analysis was performed to identify model input factors with
   the greatest influence on predicted soil water content. Nash-Sutcliffe
   increased and Root Mean Square Error reduced when uncertainties in
   measured data were considered in goodness-of-fit calculations using
   measurement probability distributions and probable asymmetric error
   boundaries, implying that appropriate model performance evaluation
   should be carried out using uncertainty ranges instead of single values.
   Although uncertainty in the experimental measured data limited
   evaluation of the absolute predictions by the model, WAVE was found a
   useful exploratory tool for estimating temporal variation in soil water
   content. Visual analysis of soil water content time series under
   proposed changes in canal stage management indicated that sites with
   land surface elevation of less than 2.0-m NGVD29 were predicted to
   periodically experience saturated conditions in the root zone and
   shortening of the growing season if canal stage is raised more than 9 cm
   and maintained at this level. The models developed could be combined
   with high-resolution digital elevation models in future studies to
   identify areas with the greatest risk of experiencing saturated root
   zone. The study also highlighted the need to incorporate measurement
   uncertainty when evaluating performance of unsaturated flow models.

Abstract = {{The modified transmission line model is used to derive the vertically
   propagating leader-step currents necessary to radiate measured
   dart-stepped-leader dE/dt pulses from triggered lightning at close range
   (<400 m) and low altitude (<70 m). The model-predicted dE/dt pulses were
   compared with measured dE/dt pulses at nine locations ranging from 27 to
   391 m from the channel base for four dE/dt pulses radiated from two
   triggered dart-stepped leaders. The dE/dt pulses at the closest station,
   27 m, were unipolar, dominated by electrostatic and induction components
   of the radiated dE/dt, and of opposite polarity to the more distant
   initial dE/dt peaks. The other, more distant, eight stations exhibited
   bipolar dE/dt pulses, being more or less dominated by the dE/dt
   radiation component. The derived leader-step current has a slow front
   that precedes a fast transition to peak amplitude followed by a slow
   decay to zero after several microseconds. For the four modeled dE/dt
   pulses, the estimated causative leader-step current peak amplitudes
   varied from 0.9 to 1.8 kA, the half-peak widths ranged from 370 to 560
   ns, the charge transfers were about 1 mC, and the peak current
   derivatives were about 10 kA/mu s. The upward propagation speeds of the
   leader-step current were from 1.1 to 1.5 x 10(8) m/s with exponential
   spatial current decay constants from 13 to 27 m. One dE/dt pulse is
   analyzed in more detail by studying changes in model-predicted waveforms
   versus current initiation altitude and by examining the effect of
   varying model input parameters.}},

Title = {{Multi-scale undulations in human aortic endothelial cell fibers}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Blood vessels often have an undulatory morphology, with excessive
   bending, kinking, and coiling occuring in diseased vasculature. The
   underlying physical causes of these morphologies are generally
   attributed, in combination, to changes in blood pressure, blood flow
   rate, and cell proliferation or apoptosis. However, pathological
   vascular morphologies often start during developmental vasculogenesis.
   At early stages of vasculogenesis, angioblasts (vascular endothelial
   cells that have not formed a lumen) assemble into primitive vessel-like
   fibers before blood flow occurs. If loose, fibrous aggregates of
   endothelial cells can generate multi-cellular undulations through
   mechanical instabilities, driven by the cytoskeleton, new insight into
   vasculature morphology may be achieved with simple in vitro models of
   endothelial cell fibers. Here we study mechanical instabilities in
   vessel-like structures made from endothelial cells embedded in a
   collagen matrix. We find that endothelial cell fibers contract radially
   over time, and undulate at two dominant wavelengths: approximately 1 cm
   and 1 mm. Simple mechanical models suggest that the longwavelength
   undulation is Euler buckling in rigid confinement, while the
   short-wavelength buckle may arise from a mismatch between fiber bending
   energy and matrix deformation. These results suggest a combination of
   fiber-like geometry, cystoskeletal contractions, and extracellular
   matrix elasticity may contribute to undulatory blood vessel morphology
   in the absence of a lumen or blood pressure.}},

   dots infrared (IR) PIN photodetectors with IR sensitivity up to 1500 nm

   photodiodes is due to the enhancement of electron tunneling injection
   through the 1,1-bis{[}(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC)
   electron blocker under IR illumination resulting from a distorted
   electron blocking barrier in the presence of photo-generated holes
   trapped in the TAPC electron blocker. It is further found that the trap
   states in the TAPC layer are generated by the Ag atoms penetrated in the
   TAPC layer during the thermal evaporation process. The resulting
   photodetectors have a high detectivity value of 7 x 10(13) Jones, which

Title = {{Electrocorticographic representations of segmental features in
   continuous speech}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Acoustic speech output results from coordinated articulation of dozens
   of muscles, bones and cartilages of the vocal mechanism. While we
   commonly take the fluency and speed of our speech productions for
   granted, the neural mechanisms facilitating the requisite muscular
   control are not completely understood. Previous neuroimaging and
   electrophysiology studies of speech sensorimotor control has typically
   concentrated on speech sounds (i.e., phonemes, syllables and words) in
   isolation; sentence-length investigations have largely been used to
   inform coincident linguistic processing. In this study, we examined the
   neural representations of segmental features (place and manner of
   articulation, and voicing status) in the context of fluent, continuous
   speech production. We used recordings from the cortical surface
   {[}electrocorticography (ECoG)] to simultaneously evaluate the spatial
   topography and temporal dynamics of the neural correlates of speech
   articulation that may mediate the generation of hypothesized gestural or
   articulatory scores. We found that the representation of place of
   articulation involved broad networks of brain regions during all phases
   of speech production: preparation, execution and monitoring. In
   contrast, manner of articulation and voicing status were dominated by
   auditory cortical responses after speech had been initiated. These
   results provide a new insight into the articulatory and auditory
   processes underlying speech production in terms of their motor
   requirements and acoustic correlates.}},

Title = {{Shock interaction with one-dimensional array of particles in air}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present axisymmetric numerical simulations of shock
   propagation in air over an aluminum particle for Mach numbers up to 10.
   The numerical method is a finite-volume based solver on a Cartesian grid
   that allows for multi-material interfaces and shocks. Validation of the
   solver is demonstrated by comparing to existing experimental data. We
   compute the unsteady inviscid drag coefficient as a function of time,
   and show that when normalized by post-shock conditions, the maximum drag
   coefficient decreases with Mach number. Furthermore, for supercritical
   Mach numbers, we show that the inviscid steady-state drag asymptotes to
   a non-zero value due to the presence of a bow shock formed just upstream
   of the particle. Using this information, we also present a simplified
   point-particle force model that can be used for mesoscale simulations.
   Finally, we investigate the dynamics of a shock propagating over a 1-D
   array of particles aligned in the flow direction. We show that the
   maximum drag coefficient increases as the shock travels deep into the
   array and then asymptotes to a final value, which can be as high as 50\%
   more than that of the first particle, depending on Mach number and
   particle spacing. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Experimental study of occupancy-based control of HVAC zones}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{75-84}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{We present experimental evaluation of two occupancy-based control
   strategies for HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) systems
   in commercial buildings that were proposed in our earlier simulation
   work. We implement these strategies in a test-zone of Pugh Hall at the
   University of Florida campus. By comparing their performance against a
   conventional baseline controller (that does not use real-time occupancy
   measurements) on days when exogenous inputs-such as weather-are similar,
   we establish the energy savings potential for each of these strategies.
   The two control strategies are of vastly different complexity: one is a
   rule-based feedback controller while the other is based on MPC (model
   predictive control) that requires real-time optimization based on
   dynamic models. The results of the evaluation are consistent with those
   of our prior simulation work, that (i) both occupancy based controllers
   yield substantial energy savings over the baseline controller without
   sacrificing thermal comfort and indoor air quality, and (ii) the much
   higher complexity MPC controller yields negligible benefit over the
   simple rule-based feedback controller. The experimental evaluation
   provides further confidence that high degree of energy savings is
   possible with simple control algorithms that use real-time occupancy
   measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of surfactant type and concentration on graphene retention and
   transport in saturated porous media}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{262}},
Pages = {{1187-1191}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of the fate and transport of graphene (GR) nanosheets in
   porous media is essential to understand their environmental impacts. In
   this work, sand column experiments were conducted to investigate the
   retention and transport of surfactant-dispersed GR nanoparticles under
   various conditions. An anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzene
   sulfonate (SDBS) and a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium
   bromide (CTAB) were used to disperse and stabilize GR in aqueous
   solutions. Both surfactants were effective in stabilizing the GR
   particles, even at low concentration (0.004\% w:v) because the
   surfactant coating introduced negative (SDBS) or positive (CTAB) charges
   on the GR surfaces. As a result, the SDBS- and CTAB-GR showed different
   retention and transport behaviors in the saturated porous media. At low
   surfactant concentration, the transport of SDBS-GR was much higher than
   that of the CTAB-GR, which was almost immobile in the sand columns with
   mass recovery rate only about 4\%. When the surfactant concentration
   increased from 0.004\% to 0.4\%, it reduced the transport of SDBS-GR and
   dramatically enhanced the mobility of the CTAB-GR (with mass recovery
   rate of 91\%). It is suggested that the presence of `free' SDBS ions may
   reduce the electrosteric repulsions between SDBS-GR and sand surfaces by
   compressing the electrical double layer. The `free' CTAB ions, however,
   may compete with the CTAB-GR for adsorption sites on the sand surfaces.
   Findings from this study indicated that the dispersion method plays an
   important role in affecting the environmental fate and transport of GR
   particles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   vertically aligned nanowires lead to similar to 23 times higher energy
   absorption and similar to 11 times higher peak load compared to neat

   the original aramid fabrics. The interfacial mechanism of increasing

Abstract = {{Pairwise and random addition processes are ordinarily indistinguishable
   in hydrogenation reactions. The distinction becomes important only when
   the fate of spin correlation matters, such as in parahydrogen-induced
   polarization (PHIP). Supported metal catalysts were not expected to
   yield PHIP signals given the rapid diffusion of H atoms on the catalyst
   surface and in view of the sequential stepwise nature of the H atom
   addition in the HoriutiPolanyi mechanism. Thus, it seems surprising that
   supported metal hydrogenation catalysts can yield detectable PHIP NMR
   signals. Even more remarkably, supported Pt and Ir nanoparticles are
   shown herein to catalyze pairwise replacement on propene and
   3,3,3-trifluoropropene. By simply flowing a mixture of parahydrogen and
   alkene over the catalyst, the scalar symmetrization order of the former
   is incorporated into the latter without a change in molecular structure,
   producing intense PHIP NMR signals on the alkene. An important indicator
   of the mechanism of the pairwise replacement is its stereoselectivity,
   which is revealed with the aid of density matrix spectral simulations.
   PHIP by pairwise replacement has the potential to significantly
   diversify the substrates that can be hyperpolarized by PHIP for
   biomedical utilization.}},

Title = {{Effect of ferrous metal presence on lead leaching in municipal waste
   incineration bottom ashes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{283}},
Pages = {{500-506}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of ferrous and non-ferrous metals from waste to energy
   (WTE) ash continues to advance as the sale of removed metals improves
   the economics of waste combustion. Published literature suggests that Fe
   and Fe oxides play a role in suppressing Pb leaching in the Toxicity
   Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP); further removal of ferrous
   metals from WTE ashes may facilitate higher Pb leaching under the TCLP.
   Eight WTE bottom ash size-fractions, from three facilities, were
   evaluated to assess the effect of metallic Fe addition and ferrous metal
   removal on TCLP leaching. Metallic Fe addition was demonstrated to
   reduce Pb leaching; the removal of ferrous metals by magnet resulted in
   a decrease in total available Pb (mg/kg) in most ash samples, yet Pb
   leachability increased in 5 of 6 ash samples. The research points to two
   chemical mechanisms to explain these results: redox interactions between
   Pb and Fe and the sorption of soluble Pb onto Fe oxide surfaces, as well
   as the effect of the leachate pH before and after metals recovery. The
   findings presented here indicate that generators, processors, and
   regulators of ash should be aware of the impact ferrous metal removal
   may have on Pb leaching, as a substantial increase in leaching may have
   significant implications regarding the management of WTE ashes. (C) 2014

   derivatives displaying aldehydes were non-toxic towards primary Schwann

   mechanical and swelling properties that were tunable based on the
   composition of the hydrogels to values analogous to soft tissues such as
   those found in the central or peripheral nervous system. Gels

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{The environmental impact of graphene has recently attracted great
   attention. In this work, we show that graphene at a low concentration
   affected tomato seed germination and seedling growth. Graphene-treated
   seeds germinated much faster than control seeds. Analytical results
   indicated that graphene penetrated seed husks. The penetration might
   break the husks to facilitate water uptake, resulting in faster
   germination and higher germination rates. At the stage of seedling
   growth, graphene was also able to penetrate root tip cells. Seedlings
   germinated from graphene-treated seeds had slightly lower biomass
   accumulation than the control, but exhibited significantly longer stems
   and roots than the control, which suggests that graphene, in contrast
   with other nanoparticles, had different effects on seedling growth.
   Taken together, our results imply that graphene played complicated roles
   in affecting the initial stage of seed germination and subsequent
   seedling growth.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report a scalable colloidal templating approach for fabricating
   periodic arrays of metallic and silicon nanorings with complex
   nanostructures. Non-close-packed monolayer silica colloidal crystal
   prepared by a simple spin-coating technology is first used as template
   for making periodic arrays of mushroom-like composite nanostructures
   consisting of silica spherical caps and polymer stems. Subsequent metal
   sputtering and reactive ion etching lead to the formation of ordered
   asymmetric nickel nanorings which can be further utilized as etching
   masks for patterning periodic arrays of symmetric silicon nanorings.
   Moreover, periodic arrays of metallic and silicon concentric double
   nanorings can be fabricated by using the asymmetric nickel nanorings as
   templates. We have also demonstrated that gold concentric double
   nanorings show strong surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with a
   SERS enhancement factor of similar to 9.5 x 10(7) from adsorbed
   benzenethiol molecules. The SERS enhancement and the electric field
   amplitude distribution surrounding gold concentric double nanorings have
   been calculated by using finite element electromagnetic modeling. This
   new colloidal templating technique is compatible with standard
   microfabrication and enables wafer-scale production of a variety of
   periodic nanorings with hierarchical structures that could find
   important technological applications in plasmonic and magnetic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Measures from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reflect changes in
   the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease. It is the case, however,
   that partial volume effects from free water can bias diffusion
   measurements. The bi-tensor diffusion model was introduced to quantify
   the contribution of free water and eliminates its bias on estimations of
   tissue microstructure. Here, we test the hypothesis that free water is
   elevated in the substantia nigra for Parkinson's disease compared with
   control subjects. This hypothesis was tested between large cohorts of
   Parkinson's disease and control participants in a single-site study and
   validated against a multisite study using multiple scanners. The
   fractional volume of free water was increased in the posterior region of
   the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease compared with control
   subjects in both the single-site and multi-site studies. We did not
   observe changes in either cohort for free-water-corrected fractional
   anisotropy or free-water-corrected mean diffusivity. Our findings
   provide new evidence that the free-water index reflects alteration of
   the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, and this was evidenced
   across both single-site and multi-site cohorts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{A combination of observations and analytical solutions was used to
   determine the modifications caused by wind forcing on the residual or
   nontidal circulation in an ebb-tidal delta. Observations were obtained
   in the lower Arcachon Lagoon, southwestern France. The basic nontidal
   circulation was established with acoustic Doppler current profilers
   (ADCPs) that were (i) moored in the delta's two deepest channels, and
   (ii) towed along a cross-lagoon transect. The bathymetry of the lower
   lagoon, or ebb-tidal delta, featured two channels: North Pass (>9 m) and
   South Pass (>20 m). The basic nontidal circulation consisted of mostly
   inflow with weak surface outflow in the South Pass, and laterally
   sheared bidirectional flow, dominated by outflow, in the North Pass.
   Analytical solutions and comparison of observed dynamical terms
   suggested that, in addition to the conventionally accepted influence of
   tidal nonlinearities, density gradients contributed to the basic
   nontidal circulation in the lagoon. Observations also indicated that
   wind forcing altered the basic circulation by driving simultaneous
   upwind flows in both passes. This response was supported by an
   analytical solution to wind-driven flows over the bathymetry of the
   transect sampled. The response to seaward winds was to enhance inflow in
   South Pass and reduce outflow in North Pass. Landward winds caused
   diminished inflow in South Pass and increased outflow in North Pass.}},

Abstract = {{Titanate nanotube powders with high specific surface area for hydrogen

   titanate nanotube powders showed an increase in the specific surface
   area with the decreases in Na+ content by the ion-exchanging process and
   in H2O content by drying processes, but in reverse an decrease in that
   with severe ion-exchanging or over-drying at high temperature. Their
   hydrogen uptake increased with decreasing H2O contents in the powders
   with appropriate Na+ content only under no changing in the particle
   shape. Therefore, the powders with controlled H2O and Na+ contents had
   high hydrogen uptake of 2.21 wt\% at 90 atm due to proper support of Na+

Abstract = {{A new method, hydrothermal method, to synthesize Ni doped rutile TiO2
   nanotube (TNT) powders is introduced. This method is more scalable than
   ones used before. Interestingly, our Ni doped TNTs' structures show
   different characteristics and properties than ones fabricated by other
   methods. We report these resulting structural and magnetic properties
   here. Ni doped nanotubes contained H2Ti2O5H2O doped with trivalent Ni.
   The layered structures had six nm inner and ten nm outer diameters,
   aspect ratios of seven, and exhibited ferromagnetism at room temperature
   (undoped nanotubes were diamagnetic). Contrary to earlier versions of Ni
   doped TNTs, we found that trivalent Ni atoms substituted H+ in the
   nanotubes and thus interacted with titanate's 3d electrons to produce
   ferromagnetic activity. This opens the possibility to achieve
   ferromagnetic activity in TNTs in a new way.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing usage of hardware accelerators such as Field-Programmable
   Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has
   significantly increased application design complexity. Such complexity
   results from a larger design space created by numerous combinations of
   accelerators, algorithms, and hw/sw partitions. Exploration of this
   increased design space is critical due to widely varying performance and
   energy consumption for each accelerator when used for different
   application domains and different use cases. To address this problem,
   numerous studies have evaluated specific applications across different
   architectures. In this article, we analyze an important domain of
   applications, referred to as sliding-window applications, implemented on
   FPGAs, GPUs, and multicore CPUs. For each device, we present
   optimization strategies and analyze use cases where each device is most
   effective. The results show that, for large input sizes, FPGAs can
   achieve speedups of up to 5.6x and 58x compared to GPUs and multicore
   CPUs, respectively, while also using up to an order of magnitude less
   energy. For small input sizes and applications with frequency-domain
   algorithms, GPUs generally provide the best performance and energy.}},

Abstract = {{Current implementations of narrowband Global System for Mobile
   Communications for railway systems are facing significant challenges in
   meeting the emerging massive capacity demands of passenger services. To
   extend the capacity, this article presents a control and data signaling
   decoupled architecture, namely, C/U-plane decoupled architecture for
   railway wireless networks, in which the relatively important C-plane of
   passenger services is kept on high-quality lower frequency bands to
   handle mobility, while the corresponding U-plane is moved to higher
   frequency bands to gain broader spectra. In this railway wireless
   network with C/U-plane decoupled architecture, the U-plane and C-plane
   handovers are also physically decoupled. To achieve the seamless and
   soft U-plane handover, we introduce a handover scheme based on
   coordinated multi-point transmission and reception and bi-casting. In
   addition, channel mappings and physical layer frames are redesigned to
   facilitate the design. Our study has demonstrated that by decoupling the
   C/U planes, the network performance is greatly enhanced, leading to a
   more effective way to provide high speed communications for railway
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials are known to cause interference with several standard
   toxicological assays. As part of an in vivo study of PEG-coated gold
   nanorods in mice, nanorods were added to reference serum, and results
   for standard clinical chemistry parameters were compared with serum
   analyzed without nanorods. PEG-coated gold nanorods produced several
   concentration-dependent interferences. Comparisons were then made with
   PEG-coated gold and silica nanospheres. Interferences were observed for
   both materials that differed from gold nanorods. Removal of the
   particles from serum by centrifugation prior to analysis resolved most,
   but not all of the interferences. Additional clinical chemistry
   analyzers were used to further investigate trends in assay interference.
   We conclude that PEG-coated gold and silica nanoparticles can interfere
   with standard clinical chemistry tests in ways that vary depending upon
   material, shape, and specific assay methodology employed. Assay
   interferences by nanomaterials cannot always be predicted, underscoring
   the need to verify that nanomaterials under study do not interfere with
   methods used to evaluate potential biological effects.}},

Abstract = {{Crop models are essential tools for assessing the threat of climate
   change to local and global food production(1). Present models used to
   predict wheat grain yield are highly uncertain when simulating how crops
   respond to temperature(2). Here we systematically tested 30 different
   wheat crop models of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and
   Improvement Project against field experiments in which growing season
   mean temperatures ranged from 15 degrees C to 32 degrees C, including
   experiments with artificial heating. Many models simulated yields well,
   but were less accurate at higher temperatures. The model ensemble median
   was consistently more accurate in simulating the crop temperature
   response than any single model, regardless of the input information
   used. Extrapolating the model ensemble temperature response indicates
   that warming is already slowing yield gains at a majority of
   wheat-growing locations. Global wheat production is estimated to fall by
   6\% for each degrees C of further temperature increase and become more
   variable over space and time.}},

Abstract = {{The study of neuro-hemodynamic changes in freely moving animals provides
   for a better understanding of brain dynamics in normal and disease
   states. While it has been shown that hemodynamic changes are closely
   related to seizures, methods for detection in freely moving animals are
   limited. In this work, we integrate photoacoustic sensor technology and
   electroencephalography into a small portable device that can be attached
   on the head of wake freely moving animals. We demonstrate chronic
   simultaneous monitoring of photoacoustic and electroencephalographic
   signals in an acute seizure model of epilepsy. Our results demonstrate
   that both the neural and vascular responses during seizures in freely
   moving rats have characteristics which are observed to be different and
   more diverse from that of anesthetized rats. This implies that the
   neurovascular coupling in seizure in free moving animals are more
   complicated, which calls for more detailed study in future. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first time for hemodynamic monitoring of
   seizure in free moving animals. This technology also promises for other
   hemodynamic related research study in freely moving small animals. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, new 3-D plastic potentials for a porous solid with a von

   derived, the noteworthy result being its centro-symmetry. Moreover, it
   is revealed that the couplings between invariants are very specific, the
   most important influence of the third invariant being for axisymmetric
   states. It is demonstrated that the exact stress-based potential of the
   porous material should have the same key properties. Furthermore, it is
   deduced a new analytic 3-D stress-based potential that satisfies these
   properties. Compared to the existing criteria for porous solids with a
   von Mises matrix, this model is the only one that captures the specific
   couplings between all stress invariants and is exact for axisymmetric

Title = {{Correlation between strength differential effects in the plastic flow of
   the matrix and the rate of damage growth in porous polycrystals}},

Volume = {{343}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we show that there is a strong correlation between the
   strength differential (SD) effects in the plastic flow of the matrix,
   which arise from its dependence on the third stress invariant, void
   evolution, and ultimately the ductility of porous metallic polycrystals.
   For this purpose, detailed micromechanical finite-element analyses of
   three-dimensional unit cells are carried out. The plastic flow of the
   matrix is described by a criterion that accounts for
   strength-differential effects induced by shear deformation mechanisms of
   the constituent grains through a macroscopic parameter, k; only if there
   is no SD, k is zero, and the von Mises criterion is recovered. Numerical
   analyses are conducted for macroscopic proportional tensile loadings
   corresponding to fixed values of the stress triaxiality (ratio of the
   mean stress to the second stress invariant). It is shown that for the
   same macroscopic loading, the local plastic strains and the local stress
   distribution are strongly dependent on the sign of the parameter k. This
   in turn has a huge impact on damage accumulation, and ultimately affects
   the ductility of the porous polycrystals. Specifically, for axisymmetric
   loadings at third stress invariant positive, the rate of void growth is
   the slowest in the material with k negative, while the reverse holds
   true for equibiaxial tension (third stress invariant negative).
   Consequently, the ductility in axisymmetric tension at third-stress
   invariant positive is also markedly different from that in equibiaxial
   tension (third-stress invariant negative). (C) 2014 Academie des

Abstract = {{This work has assessed factors affecting crystallization of copper
   sulfide (CuS) under batch conditions and in fed-batch fluidized bed
   reactor (FBR) using calcium-coated sands as a seed material. Compared
   with using sodium sulfide nonahydrate as a sulfidation reagent, larger
   CuS crystals were produced from sodium sulfide pentahydrate, most likely
   because of the lower surface charge. Due to the partial oxidation of
   sulfide in the pentahydrate form, the optimum molar ratio of Cu2+ to S2-
   was found to be 1:2, higher than the theoretical ratio. Crystal growth
   and aggregation were further increased by using calcium ion as a
   cross-linker among the CuS fines (<100 nm), resulting in an additional
   30\% decrease in Cu2+ concentrations from the effluent of fed-batch FBR.
   The efficacy of CuS crystallization was also remarkably dependent on the
   operating factors, i.e., the resting height of the seed material and
   re-circulation rate. Under optimal conditions, >95\% of the initial Cu2+
   (100 mg Cu2+/L) was successfully transformed to CuS crystals within 120
   min. The size and crystallinity of the star-shaped CuS crystals were
   confirmed by FEG-SEM and XRD analyses, respectively. Principal component
   analysis indicated that the resting height and the seed type were the
   primary parameters affecting CuS crystallization in the fed-batch FBR.

Abstract = {{Inflammation is a hallmark of many diseases like diabetes, cancers,
   atherosclerosis and arthritis. Thus, lots of concerns have been raised
   toward developing novel anti-inflammatory agents. Many alternative
   herbal medicines possess excellent anti-inflammatory properties, yet
   their precise mechanisms of action are yet to be elucidated. Here, a
   novel systems pharmacology approach based on a large number of chemical,
   biological and pharmacological data was developed and exemplified by a
   probe herb Folium Eriobotryae, a widely used clinical anti-inflammatory
   botanic drug. The results show that 11 ingredients of this herb with
   favorable pharmacokinetic properties are predicted as active compounds
   for anti-inflammatory treatment. In addition, via systematic network
   analyses, their targets are identified to be 43 inflammation-associated
   proteins including especially COX2, ALOX5, PPARG, TNF and RELA that are
   mainly involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
   pathway, the rheumatoid arthritis pathway and NF-kappa B signaling
   pathway. All these demonstrate that the integrated systems pharmacology
   method provides not only an effective tool to illustrate the
   anti-inflammatory mechanisms of herbs, but also a new systems-based
   approach for drug discovery from, but not limited to, herbs, especially
   when combined with further experimental validations.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of particle shape on permeability is investigated by means of
   numerical methods of fluid flow through two-dimensional, periodic,
   random packs of ellipses. We solve the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations
   on a Cartesian grid and use the immersed boundary method to treat
   internal flow boundaries. The effect of porosity, aspect ratio, and
   Reynolds number on the macroscopic permeability and tortuosity is
   studied. For small Reynolds numbers, it is shown that an area-preserving
   deformation of a pack of disks, generating a pack of ellipses, can lead
   to significant variations in the permeability. However, if the ellipses
   are randomly packed, so that the alignment of their axes is random, the
   shape effect is small. Irrespective of orientation, the aspect ratio has
   a strong effect on the tortuosity at all values of the porosity. We also
   show that the parameters in the Carman-Kozeny equation are not constant
   but are functions of porosity and aspect ratio. For larger Reynolds
   numbers, we show results for random packs of bidisperse and polydisperse
   cylinders, as well as for ellipses. We find that a modified Forchheimer
   equation can well characterize the flow. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes the synthesis and characterization of boronate
   ester-cross-linked hydrogels capable of self-healing behavior at neutral
   and acidic pH. This atypically wide pH range over which healing behavior
   is observed was achieved through the use of an intramolecular
   coordinating boronic acid monomer, 2-acrylamidophenylboronic acid
   (2APBA), where the internal coordination helped to stabilize cross-links
   formed at acidic and neutral pH. Two different hydrogels were formed
   from a 2APBA copolymer cross-linked with either poly(vinyl alcohol) or a
   catechol-functionalized copolymer. The self-healing ability of these
   hydrogels was characterized through physical testing and rheological
   studies. Furthermore, the catechol cross-linked hydrogel was shown to be
   oxygen sensitive, demonstrating reduced self-healing and stress
   relaxation after partial oxidation. The synthesis of these hydrogels
   demonstrates a new strategy to produce boronic acid materials capable of
   self-healing at physiological pH.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional layered semiconductors present a promising material
   platform for band-to-band-tunneling devices given their homogeneous band
   edge steepness due to their atomically flat thickness. Here, we
   experimentally demonstrate interlayer band-to-band tunneling in vertical
   MoS2/WSe2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures using a dual-gate device
   architecture. The electric potential and carrier concentration of MoS2
   and WSe2 layers are independently controlled by the two symmetric gates.
   The same device can be gate modulated to behave as either an Esaki diode
   with negative differential resistance, a backward diode with large
   reverse bias tunneling current, or a forward rectifying diode with low
   reverse bias current. Notably, a high gate coupling efficiency of
   similar to 80\% is obtained for tuning the interlayer band alignments,
   arising from weak electrostatic screening by the atomically thin layers.
   This work presents an advance in the fundamental understanding of the
   interlayer coupling and electron tunneling in semiconductor vdW
   heterostructures with important implications toward the design of
   atomically thin tunnel transistors.}},

Abstract = {{Huanglongbing (HLB) disease is a critical infection which has
   dangerously affected the citrus production in Florida and has also been
   observed in California and Texas. No active treatment for this infection
   has been reported yet and the HLB infected tree will eventually die.
   However, early identification and removal of the HLB affected trees will
   secure the healthy trees in the grove. Accumulation of starch on
   infected leaves is an early symptom of HLB. Starch can rotate the
   polarisation plane of light in a certain waveband. A customised vision
   sensor was developed based on this characteristic to identify the HLB
   symptom. The vision sensor images were compared with the images captured
   by a colour camera to demonstrate the improvement achieved in this
   method. Also, the starch accumulation identification was studied for
   citrus leaves before and after being ground. The results showed an
   enhanced HLB identification performance using the developed vision
   sensor. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the increase in emerging bandwidth-intensive applications,
   millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications in 60-GHz band have become a hot
   topic. There are two unique features that sharply distinguish mmWave
   wireless personal area networks (WPANs) from other networks using lower
   carrier frequencies. First, mmWave links use high-gain directional
   antennas to overcome the high propagation loss. Second, mmWave links are
   easily blocked by the human body and furniture. In this paper, we
   develop a blockage robust and efficient directional medium access
   control (MAC) protocol (BRDMAC), which overcomes the blockage problem by
   relaying. Relay selection and spatial reuse are jointly optimized to
   improve network performance. In BRDMAC, relay selection and transmission
   scheduling algorithms are proposed to compute near-optimal relay
   selection to maximize spatial reuse and compute near-optimal schedules
   with respect to the total transmission time, respectively. Finally,
   extensive simulation results show that BRDMAC performs better in terms
   of delay and throughput, compared with other existing protocols while
   attaining a good fairness performance.}},

Title = {{SNR Decomposition for Full-Duplex Gaussian Relay Channel}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{841-853}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A relay channel (RC), consisting of a source, a relay, and a
   destination, is a basic transmission unit of cooperative communication
   networks. The capacity of an RC is not known in general. In this paper,
   an SNR decomposition (SD) strategy is presented to implement time
   sharing, which provides a new tractable and achievable rate for a
   full-duplex Gaussian RC. More specifically, we first expand the SNR of a
   relay destination channel (SNR-RD) into two terms under the relay power
   constraint and divide the system into two subbands. Then, we assign the
   obtained SNR-RD for each subband and employ decode-forward (DF) or
   compress-forward (CF) according to the assigned SNR-RD. It is shown that
   the achievable rate of the SD strategy is competitive with that of
   superposing CF on DF. As the superposition structure requires a
   sophisticated codeword design, the SD strategy provides another
   practical combination structure of DF and CF strategies. Approximations
   for the SNR-RD and bandwidth allocation for subbands are also given.
   Based on the obtained results, two application scenarios, i.e., mobile
   relay and quasi-static fading RCs, are also considered. Finally, various
   numerical results are shown to support our developed theoretical
   results.}},

Abstract = {{We report high-efficiency blue-violet quantum-dot-based light-emitting
   diodes (QD-LEDs) by using high quantum yield ZnCdS/ZnS graded coreshell
   QDs with proper surface ligands. Replacing the oleic acid ligands on the
   as-synthesized QDs with shorter 1-octanethiol ligands is found to cause
   a 2-fold increase in the electron mobility within the QD film. Such a
   ligand exchange also results in an even greater increase in hole
   injection into the QD layer, thus improving the overall charge balance
   in the LEDs and yielding a 70\% increase in quantum efficiency. Using
   1-octanethiol capped QDs, we have obtained a maximum luminance (L) of
   7600 cd/m2 and a maximum external quantum efficiency (eta(EQE)) of (10.3
   +/- 0.9)\% (with the highest at 12.2\%) for QD-LEDs devices with an

   also obtained for other blue/violet QD-LEDs with peak emission at 455
   and 433 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
   blue QD-LEDs with eta(EQE) > 10\%. Combined with the low turn-on voltage
   of similar to 2.6 V, these blue-violet ZnCdS/ZnS QD-LEDs show great
   promise for use in next-generation full-color displays.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of feature selection for unsupervised learning
   and develop a new algorithm capable of identifying informative features
   supporting complex structures embedded in a high-dimensional space. The
   development of the algorithm is inspired by human learning in detecting
   complex data structures. We formulate it as an optimization problem with
   a well-defined objective function, and solve the problem by using an
   iterative approach. The algorithm can be easily implemented and is
   computationally very efficient. We use gap statistics to estimate the
   parameters so that the proposed method is completely parameter-free. We
   also develop a scheme based on permutation tests to estimate the
   statistical significance of the presence of a data structure. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the algorithm by
   comparing it with seven existing methods on a set of synthetic datasets
   with a wide variety of structures and cancer microarray gene expression
   datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   on two acupoints. PAT images were obtained before and after acupuncture.
   We report that stimulation of certain acupoints resulted in changes in
   hemodynamics/blood flow at these points. The results demonstrate that
   PAT can non-invasively detect blood flow changes in mouse brain under
   acupuncture. This pilot study shows the potential of PAT as a

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{230-239}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Environmental models are inherently complex and often characterized by
   high dimensionality. The method of elementary effects (EE) is one of the
   most widely used parameter screening technique implemented to reduce
   burden on computational resources required for thorough model
   evaluation. Due to issues like inefficient screening and excessive
   sampling time, the development of more effective EE sampling strategies
   has been a recent research focus. This paper presents a new sampling
   strategy - Sampling for Uniformity (SU) - based on the principles of
   meeting close-to-theoretical parameter distributions and maximizing
   trajectory spread. The performance of the SU relative to existing
   strategies was evaluated using a number of criteria including generated
   parameter distributions' uniformity, time efficiency, trajectory spread,
   and screening efficiency. The SU performed better than some
   trajectory-based benchmark strategies across the evaluation criteria,
   underlining the effectiveness of multi-criteria based sampling and the
   need to focus future efforts on exploring other combinations of sampling
   criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{173}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) is immobile in the subsurface but it has
   been frequently detected in the aquatic system. Therefore it is
   important to investigate the factors impacting CIP's mobilization in
   aquifer. Laboratory columns packed with sand were used to test
   colloid-facilitated UP transport by 1) using kaolinite or
   montmorillonite to mobilize presorbed-CIP in a column or 2)
   co-transporting with CIP by pre-mixing them before transport The
   Langmuir model showed that UP sorption by montmorillonite (23 g kg(-1))
   was 100 times more effective than sand or kaolinite. Even with strong
   CIP complexation ability to Fe/AI coating on sand surface,
   montrnorillonite promoted UP transport, but not kaolinite. All
   presorbed-CIP by sand was mobilized by montmorillonite after 3 pore
   volumes through co-transporting of CIP with montmorillonite. The
   majority of CIP was fixed onto the montmorillonite interlayer but still
   showed inhibition of bacteria growth. Our results suggested that
   montmorillonite with high UP sorption ability can act as a carrier to
   enhance CIP's mobility in aquifer. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Residual antibiotics in land-applied manure and biosolids present a
   potential threat to public and ecological health. It remains important
   to determine antibiotic degradation efficiencies for manure and
   biosolids waste management practices and to identify conditions that
   enhance antibiotic degradation. The fates of the antibiotics
   florfenicol, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, and tylosin were studied
   during pilot-scale static pile thermophilic composting, and the effects
   of temperature and feedstock particles on antibiotic degradation rates
   were tested. The antibiotics were spiked into dairy manure solids and
   wastewater biosolids, and treatments included aerated and non-aerated
   manure and biosolids/wood-product (1:3 v/v) composting. Results showed
   no significant differences between aerated and non-aerated treatments;
   on average, >= 85, >= 93, and >= 95\% antibiotic degradation was
   observed after 7, 14, and 21 days of composting. Greater antibiotic
   degradation was observed in manure compost compared to biosolids compost
   for florfenicol (7, 14, 21, 28 days) and tylosin (14, 28 days); however,
   there was no significant difference for sulfadimethoxine and
   sulfamethazine. Peak temperatures were 66-73, and >= 55 degrees C was
   maintained for 67 days in the biosolids compost and 17-20 days in the
   manure compost. Bench-scale experiments conducted at 25, 55, and 60
   degrees C showed that lower temperature decreased degradation of the
   sulfonamides and tylosin in both feedstocks and florfenicol in the
   biosolids. The presence of compost particles increased antibiotic
   degradation, with time to 50 \% degradation <= 2 days in the presence of
   solids (60 degrees C) compared to no degradation in their absence. These
   results indicate that thermophilic composting effectively degrades
   parent antibiotic compounds in manure and biosolids.}},

   sequence which can produce similar yields with water savings relative to
   that of traditional flooded rice-maize system. The results showed that
   application of 180 kg N ha(-1) in four splits and automatic irrigation
   with 40 mm, when soil available water (ASW) in top 30 cm fell below to
   60\% was the best management combination for aerobic rice, saving 41\%
   of water while producing 96\% of the yield attainable under flooded
   conditions. Similarly for maize, application of 120 kg N ha(-1) and
   irrigation with 30 mm of water at 40\% ASW in the top 30 cm soil was the
   most dominant management option. Further, application of 180 kg N ha(-1)
   with rice followed by 120 kg N ha(-1) in maize provided stable yield for
   both aerobic and flooded rice systems over time as simulated by the
   model. The results illustrate that DSSAT model is a useful tool for
   evaluating alternative management options aimed at maintaining yields
   and saving water in rice-maize systems in semi-arid regions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{New, sustainable, and low-cost materials that can simultaneously remove
   a range of wastewater contaminants, such as heavy metals and
   pharmaceutical residues, are needed. In this work, modified biochars
   were produced by dip-coating hickory or bagasse biomass in carbon
   nanotube (CNT) suspensions with or without sodium
   dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS)-aided dispersion prior to slow pyrolysis
   in a N-2 environment at 600 A degrees C. The sulfapyridine (SPY) and
   lead (Pb) sorption ability of pristine hickory (HC) and bagasse (BC)
   biochars and the modified biochars with (HC-SDBS-CNT and BC-SDBS-CNT,
   respectively) and without (HC-CNT and BC-CNT) SDBS was assessed in
   laboratory aqueous batch single- and binary-solute system. The greatest
   removal of SPY and Pb was observed for HC-SDBS-CNT (86 \% SPY and 71 \%
   Pb) and BC-SDBS-CNT (56 \% SPY and 53 \% Pb), whereas HC-CNT, BC-CNT,
   and the pristine biochars removed far less. This can be attributed to
   the fact that surfactant could prevent the aggregation of CNTs and thus
   promote the distribution and stabilization of individual CNT
   nanoparticle on the biochar surface to adsorb the contaminants. The
   observation of no significant change in Pb sorption capacities of the
   surfactant-dispersed CNT-modified biochars in the presence of SPY, or
   vice versa, was indicative of site-specific sorption interactions and a
   lack of significant competition for functional groups by the two
   sorbates. These results suggest that products of hybrid technologies,
   such as biochars modified with CNTs, can yield multi-sorbents and may
   hold excellent promise as a sustainable wastewater treatment
   alternative.}},

Title = {{Multimodel ensembles of wheat growth: many models are better than one}},

Abstract = {{Crop models of crop growth are increasingly used to quantify the impact
   of global changes due to climate or crop management. Therefore, accuracy
   of simulation results is a major concern. Studies with ensembles of crop
   models can give valuable information about model accuracy and
   uncertainty, but such studies are difficult to organize and have only
   recently begun. We report on the largest ensemble study to date, of 27
   wheat models tested in four contrasting locations for their accuracy in
   simulating multiple crop growth and yield variables. The relative error
   averaged over models was 24-38\% for the different end-of-season
   variables including grain yield (GY) and grain protein concentration
   (GPC). There was little relation between error of a model for GY or GPC
   and error for in-season variables. Thus, most models did not arrive at
   accurate simulations of GY and GPC by accurately simulating preceding
   growth dynamics. Ensemble simulations, taking either the mean (e-mean)
   or median (e-median) of simulated values, gave better estimates than any
   individual model when all variables were considered. Compared to
   individual models, e-median ranked first in simulating measured GY and
   third in GPC. The error of e-mean and e-median declined with an
   increasing number of ensemble members, with little decrease beyond 10
   models. We conclude that multimodel ensembles can be used to create new
   estimators with improved accuracy and consistency in simulating growth
   dynamics. We argue that these results are applicable to other crop
   species, and hypothesize that they apply more generally to ecological
   system models.}},

Abstract = {{Dislocation interactions with distributed condensed vacancy clusters in

   Due to void strengthening, the dislocation lines are found to bow as a
   result of pinning on the original glide plane and undergo depinning
   through drawing out screw dipoles and forming prismatic loops on the
   secondary slip plane. We discovered an inertia-induced transition
   between Hirsch looping and void shearing mechanisms as the void spacing
   ranges from the scale of nm to hundreds of nm. Contrary to prior
   understanding, simulations suggest that large voids nm in diameter) can

   modification of biomacromolecules by attaching a polymer that changes
   its properties in response to environmental variations, thus affecting
   the properties of the biomacromolecule, has led to the emergence of a
   new family of polymeric biomaterials. Here, we summarize techniques for
   conjugating responsive polymers to biomacromolecules and highlight
   applications of these bioconjugates reported so far. In doing so, we aim
   to show how advances in synthetic tools could lead to rapid expansion in
   the variety and uses of responsive bioconjugates.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles have been synthesized via facile
   hydrolytic hydrothermal technique without incorporation any template.
   The precious metallic nanoparticles; Ag, Pt and Pd have been embedded
   between the anatase particles using in situ reduction step. The
   structural properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by
   X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopic and N-2
   adsorption-desorption isotherm (S (BET)). The electrochemical studies
   for the as-prepared anode materials including, cyclic voltammetry and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated a significant
   improvement in the electronic conductivity of the lithium-TiO2 cells.
   Therefore, the charge-discharge rates were noticeably promoted as a
   result of the enhancement of Li-ion diffusion and charge transfer. The
   cycling results of Pd-TiO2 revealed a marvelous improvement in both
   charge and discharge capacities by 89.4 and 88 \% after 10 cycles at C/5
   rate. Generally, all the as-prepared TiO2 nanocomposites showed enhanced
   specific capacity, cycling stability and rate capability compared to the
   pure TiO2, providing a promising behavior for use as anodes in lithium
   ion batteries (LIBs).}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate scaling limit and device physics of aggressively scaled
   phosphorene MOSFETs are examined by self-consistent multiscale quantum
   transport simulations. The MOSFET structure can effectively suppress the
   ambipolar conduction and decrease the leakage current, and thereby, is
   more scalable than the Schottky barrier FET structure. The interplay of
   quantum mechanical effects and highly anisotropic band structure plays a
   critical role for phosphorene transistors with a sub 10-nm channel
   length, in which the optimum choice of the transport crystalline
   direction is completely different from phosphorene FETs with a longer
   channel length. Even at a sub-10-nm channel length with considerable
   quantum tunneling effects, the anisotropic band structure still provides
   a better device performance in terms of ON-current over other 2-D
   semiconductors with nearly isotropic band structures, such as MoS2. With
   the optimum choice of the transport direction, both n- and p-type
   phosphorene FETs meet the International Technology Roadmap for
   Semiconductor (ITRS) target at the 5-nm technology node.}},

Abstract = {{Terminal sterilization induces physical and chemical changes in the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) of ex vivo-derived biomaterials due to their
   aggressive mechanism of action. Prior studies have focused on how
   sterilization affects the mechanical integrity of tissue-based
   biomaterials but have rarely characterized effects on early cellular
   interaction, which is indicative of the biological response. Using a
   model fibrocartilage disc scaffold, these investigations compare the
   effect of three common sterilization methods {[}peracetic acid (PAA),
   gamma irradiation (GI), and ethylene oxide (EtO)] on a range of material
   properties and characterized early cellular interactions. GI and EtO
   produced unfavorable structural damage that contributed to inferior cell
   adhesion. Conversely, exposure to PAA resulted in limited structural
   alterations while inducing chemical modifications that favored cell
   attachment. Results suggest that the sterilization approach can be
   selected to modulate biomaterial properties to favor cellular adhesion
   and has relevance in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
   applications. Furthermore, the study of cellular interactions with
   modified biomaterials in vitro provides information of how materials may
   react in subsequent clinical applications. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{764}},
Pages = {{538-571}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to investigate, for the first time,
   excitation of Faraday waves in small containers using two commensurate
   frequencies. This spatial restriction, which is encountered at low
   frequencies, leads to a wave composed primarily of one spatial eigenmode
   of the container. When two frequencies are used, the mode resonates
   primarily with one frequency, while the role of the second is to alter
   the instability threshold and the resulting nonlinear dynamics. As the
   parameter space expands greatly as a result of the introduction of three
   new degrees of freedom, viz. the frequency, amplitude and phase of the
   new component, the linear theory is first used as a guide to highlight
   basic two-frequency phenomena. These predictions and nonlinear phenomena
   are then studied experimentally with the system of Batson, Zoueshtiagh
   \& Narayanan (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 729, 2013, pp. 496-523), who studied
   single-frequency excitation of different modes in a cylindrical cell.
   The two-frequency experiments of this work focus on excitation of the
   fundamental axisymmetric mode, and are quantitatively compared to the
   model via a posteriori Fourier decomposition of the parametric input. In
   doing so, experimental dependence of the instability on the new degrees
   of freedom is demonstrated, in accordance with the model predictions.
   This is done for a variety of frequency ratios, and overall agreement
   between the observed and predicted onset conditions is identical to that
   already reported for the single-frequency experiment. For each frequency
   ratio, the nonlinear behaviour is experimentally characterized by
   bifurcation and time series data, which is shown to differ significantly
   from comparable single-frequency excitations. Finally, we present and
   discuss a wave in which both temporal frequencies are used to
   simultaneously excite different spatial modes.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The application of disaggregate models for predictions and policy
   evaluations requires as inputs detailed information on the socioeconomic
   characteristics of the population. The early procedure developed for
   population synthesis involved the generation of a joint multiway
   distribution of all attributes of interest using iterative proportional
   fitting (IPF). Recognizing its limitations, including the inability to
   deal with multilevel controls, several alternate methods have been
   proposed in the last few years. This article presents a methodology
   called the fitness-based synthesis (FBS) that directly generates a list
   of households to match several multilevel controls without the need for
   determining a joint multiway distribution. The application and
   validation results demonstrate both the feasibility of the approach and
   its improved performance relative to the IPF and methods using fewer
   control tables. This article also presents a comprehensive validation of
   the synthetic populations against the true populations and thereby
   demonstrates the ability of the FBS method to generate the
   multidimensional correlations among the attributes. The number of
   iterations to terminations is found to be between one and three times
   the number of households to be synthesized. In sum, the FBS is an
   efficient and scalable methodology that is easy to implement and as such
   is a valuable tool for generating the detailed socioeconomic
   characteristics need for applying disaggregate travel-demand forecasting
   models.}},

Volume = {{149}},

Pages = {{1-45}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this paper is to develop uniformly optimal first-order
   methods for convex programming (CP). By uniform optimality we mean that
   the first-order methods themselves do not require the input of any
   problem parameters, but can still achieve the best possible iteration
   complexity bounds. By incorporating a multi-step acceleration scheme
   into the well-known bundle-level method, we develop an accelerated
   bundle-level method, and show that it can achieve the optimal complexity
   for solving a general class of black-box CP problems without requiring
   the input of any smoothness information, such as, whether the problem is
   smooth, nonsmooth or weakly smooth, as well as the specific values of
   Lipschitz constant and smoothness level. We then develop a more
   practical, restricted memory version of this method, namely the
   accelerated prox-level (APL) method. We investigate the generalization
   of the APL method for solving certain composite CP problems and an
   important class of saddle-point problems recently studied by Nesterov
   (Math Program 103:127-152, 2005). We present promising numerical results
   for these new bundle-level methods applied to solve certain classes of
   semidefinite programming and stochastic programming problems.}},

Title = {{Which components of plant diversity are most correlated with ecosystem

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{228-236}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem services is a
   controversial topic in ecology that may be due, at least in part, to the
   variety of methods used to define and quantify diversity. This study
   examined the relationship between plant diversity and 11 ecosystem
   properties of a restored wetland in northern China by considering four
   primary components of diversity (dominance, richness, evenness, and
   divergence). Each diversity component was expressed by eight taxonomic
   and functional diversity indices respectively. Results showed that
   trait-based functional diversity had a stronger correlation with
   ecosystem processes than non-trait taxonomic diversity did. Among the
   four components of diversity, dominance (in terms of mean trait value
   index) was the best in explaining the variation in ecosystem processing.
   Richness and divergence also had significant correlations with ecosystem
   properties in some instances. By contrast, evenness had no significant
   correlation with most of the studied ecosystem properties. Our results
   indicated that wetland ecosystem properties are significantly related to
   certain traits of the dominant species. Thus, the dominant species and
   functional traits should be considered before the number of species in
   managing diversity and enhancing certain ecosystem functions of
   wetlands, especially in the case of conservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Cellular networks are faced with serious congestions nowadays due to the
   recent booming growth and popularity of wireless devices and
   applications. Opportunistically accessing the unused licensed spectrum,
   cognitive radio can potentially harvest more spectrum resources and
   enhance the capacity of cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a
   new multihop cognitive cellular network ((MCN)-N-2) architecture to
   facilitate the ever exploding data transmissions in cellular networks.
   Under the proposed architecture, we then investigate the minimum energy
   consumption problem by exploring joint frequency allocation, link
   scheduling, routing, and transmission power control. Specifically, we
   first formulate a maximum independent set (MIS) based energy consumption
   optimization problem, which is a non-linear programming problem.
   Different from most previous work assuming all the MISs are known,
   finding which is in fact NP-complete, we employ a column generation
   based approach to circumvent this problem. We develop an is an element
   of-bounded algorithm, which can obtain a feasible solution that are less
   than (1 + is an element of) and larger than (1 - is an element of) of
   the optimal result of MP, and analyzed its computational complexity. We
   also revisit the minimum energy consumption problem by taking uncertain
   channel bandwidth into consideration. Simulation results show that we
   can efficiently find is an element of-bounded approximate results and
   the optimal result as well.}},

Abstract = {{Based on data from geographical information system (GIS) and daily
   commuting origin destination (OD) matrices, we estimated the
   distribution of traffic flow in the San Francisco road network and
   studied Braess's paradox in a large-scale transportation network with
   realistic travel demand. We measured the variation of total travel time
   triangle T when a road segment is closed, and found that vertical bar
   triangle T vertical bar follows a power-law distribution if triangle T <
   0 or triangle T > 0. This implies that most roads have a negligible
   effect on the efficiency of the road network, while the failure of a few
   crucial links would result in severe travel delays, and closure of a few
   inefficient links would counter-intuitively reduce travel costs
   considerably. Generating three theoretical networks, we discovered that
   the heterogeneously distributed travel demand may be the origin of the
   observed power-law distributions of vertical bar triangle T vertical
   bar. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used to pinpoint inefficient link
   clusters in the road network. We found that closing specific road
   clusters would further improve the transportation efficiency. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Conventional distances used in clustering basically grow with the square
   of the distance in means, and are therefore insensitive when the
   clusters are tightly separated. This paper proposes a new separation
   measure between two Gaussians by blending the concept of non-Gaussianity
   and information theoretic distances with the goal of improving the
   separation of tightly coupled clusters. The measure called Quadratic
   Renyi's Negentropy Separation (QRNS) relies on the estimation of
   negentropy between the Gaussian fitted clusters and the Gaussian mixture
   constructed by individual clusters. An analytical form to estimate
   separation is derived using the quadratic Renyi entropy instead of the
   common Shannon entropy. QRNS is not a distance, and its properties are
   analyzed and discussed. Finally, QRNS is used to develop a simple
   clustering algorithm, which is preliminary validated in several
   classical problems with separable clusters. Although the proposed
   clustering algorithm is not among the state of the art in clustering, it
   shows very good results when using the new measure.}},

Abstract = {{The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc is susceptible to numerous
   pathologies that may lead to structural degradation and jaw dysfunction.
   The limited treatment options and debilitating nature of severe
   temporomandibular disorders has been the primary driving force for the
   introduction and development of TMJ disc tissue engineering as an
   approach to alleviate this important clinical issue. This study aimed to
   evaluate the efficacy of laser micropatterning (LMP) ex vivo-derived TMJ
   disc scaffolds to enhance cellular integration, a major limitation to
   the development of whole tissue implant technology. LMP was incorporated
   into the decellularized extracellular matrix scaffold structure using a
   40 W CO2 laser ablation system to drill an 8x16 pattern with a bore
   diameter of 120 mu m through the scaffold thickness. Disc scaffolds were
   seeded with human neonatal-derived umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
   differentiated into chondrocytes at a density of 900 cells per mm(2) and
   then assessed on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 of culture. Results derived from
   histology, PicoGreen DNA quantification, and cellular metabolism assays
   indicate that the LMP scaffolds improve cellular remodeling compared to
   the unworked scaffold over the 21-day culture period. Mechanical
   analysis further supports the use of the LMP showing the compressive
   properties of the LMP constructs closely represent native disc
   mechanics. The addition of an artificial path of infiltration by LMP
   culminated in improved chondrocyte adhesion, dispersion, and migration
   after extended culture aiding in recapitulating the native TMJ disc
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The sweep gas now effect on hydrogen production via water-gas shift
   reaction (WGSR) using a membrane reactor (MR) was studied numerically in
   this work. The sweep gas now rate was used as the primary parameter
   while the effects of flow pattern, inlet temperature, size, and gas type
   in the permeation side on MR performance were examined in detail. Using
   CO conversion and H-2 recovery to characterize the MR performance, it
   was found that the sweep gas flow with inlet/outlet ports arranged on
   the same side (parallel flow mode) is the optimal design providing
   higher CO conversion, H-2 recovery and lower reaction temperature
   compared with the other examined now pattern designs. By varying the
   sweep gas flow inlet temperature the sweep gas flow can serve as cooling
   or heating fluid in the reactor. For both cooling and heating cases
   reactor performance could be degraded due to lower catalyst activity and
   reversed WGSR, respectively. For the H-2-selective MR, the sweep gas
   type does not affect the MR performance under the same operating
   conditions. By changing the size of the permeation side it was found
   that H-2 recovery could be improved by permeation side reduction without
   significantly affecting the CO conversion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide-based supercritical fluid extraction (CO2 SFE) has been
   an excellent alternative to solvent extraction in many industries. In
   this study, a heavy crude oil was adsorbed to kieselguhr and performed
   for comparison of different extraction processes. The oil extract by
   dichloromethane Soxhlet extraction was used as a benchmark. Another
   batch of the sample was subjected to sequential short-time and
   longer-time CO2 SFE, and subsequent dichloromethane Soxhlet extraction,
   yielding three distinct extracts. All of these four extracts were then
   fractionated by a standard saturates/aromatics/resin/asphaltene (SARA)
   method. Each SARA fraction was then analyzed by high temperature gas
   chromatography simulated distillation (SIMDIS), gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
   spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). It was found that CO2 SFE selectively extracts
   relatively low molecular weight compounds with low degrees of molecular
   condensation. The remaining un-extracted components are mainly in polar
   resin and asphaltene fractions, containing the chemical species with
   large carbon numbers and high degrees of molecular condensation. Most of
   these components are in low volatility with boiling points higher than
   500 degrees C, beyond the upper temperature limit of common GC columns.
   CO2 SFE can serve as an environmental-friendly alternative to Soxhlet
   solvent extraction if the goal of the analysis is to determine petroleum
   biomarker or compositional analysis by GC-MS. In addition, CO2 SFE for
   extracts only volatile compounds of small molecular weight has an
   advantage of leaving most non-volatile components that would be
   detrimental to the GC systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Solar driven production of fuels by means of an intermediate reactive
   metal for species splitting has provided a practical and potentially
   efficient pathway for disassociating molecules at significantly lower
   thermal energies. The fuels of interest are of or derive from the
   separation of oxygen from H2O and CO2 to form hydrogen and carbon
   monoxide, respectively. The following study focuses on iron oxidation
   through water and CO2 splitting to explore the fundamental reaction
   kinetics and kinetic rates that are relevant to these processes. In
   order to properly characterize the reactive metal potential and to
   optimize a scaled-up solar reactor system, a monolith-based laboratory
   reactor was implemented to investigate reaction temperatures over a
   range from 990 to 1400 K. The presence of a single, solid monolith as a
   reacting surface allowed for a limitation in mass transport effects in
   order to monitor kinetically driven reaction steps. The formation of
   oxide layers on the iron monoliths followed Cabrera-Mott models for
   oxidation of metals with kinetic rates being measured using real-time
   mass spectrometry to calculate kinetic constants and estimate oxide
   layer thicknesses. Activation energies of 47.3 kJ/mol and 32.8 kJ/mol
   were found for water-splitting and CO2 splitting, respectively, and the
   conclusions of the independent oxidation reactions where applied to
   experimental results for syngas (H-2-CO) production to explore ideal
   process characteristics. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Background: Advancement in clinically relevant studies like seizure
   interruption using functional neuro imaging tools has shown that
   specific changes in hemodynamics precede and accompany seizure onset and
   propagation. However, preclinical seizure experiments need to be
   conducted in awake animals with images reconstructed and displayed in
   real-time.
   Methods: This article describes an approach that can be utilized to
   tackle these challenges. A subject specific head interface and
   restraining method was designed to allow for DOT to imaging of
   hemodynamic changes in unanesthetized rats during evoked acute seizures.
   Using CUDA programming model, the finite-element based nonlinear
   iterative algorithm for image reconstruction was parallelized.
   Results: Early hemodynamic changes were monitored in real time and
   observed tens of seconds prior to seizure onset. Utilizing the massive
   parallelization offered by graphic processing units (GPU), DOT was
   extended to online image reconstruction within 1 s.
   Comparison with existing methods: Pre-seizure state related hemodynamic
   changes were detected in awake rats. 3D monitoring of hemodynamic
   changes was performed in real time with our parallelized image
   reconstruction procedure.
   Conclusion: Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a promising neuroimaging
   tool for the investigation of seizures in awake animals. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the microstructure of

   gradation in the silicon-doped boron carbide phase (rim), which develops
   around the parent boron carbide region (core) due to the reaction

   peak position and intensity. Peak shifting and intensity variation from
   the core to the rim region was attributed to changes in the boron
   carbide crystal structure based on experimental Raman observations and
   ab initio calculations reported in literature. The results were
   consistent with compositional analysis determined by energy dispersive
   spectroscopy. The Raman analysis revealed the substitution of silicon
   atoms first into the linear 3-atom chain, and then into icosahedral
   units of the boron carbide structure. Thus, micro-Raman spectroscopy
   provided a non-destructive means of identifying the preferential
   positions of Si atoms in the boron carbide lattice. (C) 2015 AIP

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Wind-energy production may be expanded beyond regions with high-average
   wind speeds (such as the Midwest U.S.A.) to sites with lower-average
   speeds (such as the Southeast U.S.A.) by locating favorable regional
   matches between natural wind-speed and energy-demand patterns. A
   critical component of wind-power evaluation is to incorporate wind-speed
   dynamics reflecting documented diurnal and seasonal behavioral patterns.
   Conventional probabilistic approaches remove patterns from wind-speed
   data. These patterns must be restored synthetically before they can be
   matched with energy-demand patterns. How to accurately restore
   wind-speed patterns is a vexing problem spurring an expanding line of
   papers. We propose a paradigm shift in wind power evaluation that
   employs signal-detection and nonlinear-dynamics techniques to
   empirically diagnose whether synthetic pattern restoration can be
   avoided altogether. If the complex behavior of observed wind-speed
   records is due to nonlinear, low-dimensional, and deterministic system
   dynamics, then nonlinear dynamics techniques can reconstruct wind-speed
   dynamics from observed wind-speed data without recourse to conventional
   probabilistic approaches. In the first study of its kind, we test a
   nonlinear dynamics approach in an application to Sugarland Wind-the
   first utility-scale wind project proposed in Florida, USA. We find
   empirical evidence of a low-dimensional and nonlinear wind-speed
   attractor characterized by strong temporal patterns that match up well
   with regular daily and seasonal electricity demand patterns.}},

Abstract = {{As a promising nanomaterial, graphene-oxide (GO) has shown great
   sorption potential for environmental contaminants. This study evaluated
   the ability and mechanism of GO to remove sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and

   results showed that GO effectively sorbed both CIP and SMX with maximum

   sorption was mainly though pi-pi EDA attraction on the basal planes of
   the GO. Solution pH showed strong effect on the sorption ability of GO
   to the two antibiotics: at pH of 2, GO sorption ability decreased for
   both CIP and SMX; at pH of 9, GO completely lost SMX sorption ability
   but still showed strong sorption to CIP. Both NaCI and CaCl2 decreased
   CIP sorption onto GO and CaCl2 showed high efficiency even at low ionic
   strength. The effect of NaCl and CaCl2 on SMX sorption was weaker, but
   higher ionic strength also reduced the sorption of SMX onto GO. At
   solution pH of 2, sorption of CIP destabilized GO suspension to form
   aggregates. Results obtained from this work demonstrated that GO can be
   used as an effective adsorbents to removal antibiotics from water. (C)

Abstract = {{Nuclear energy provides more than 10\% of electrical power
   internationally, and the increasing engagement of nuclear energy is
   essential to meet the rapid worldwide increase in energy demand. A
   paramount challenge in the development of advanced nuclear reactors is
   the discovery of advanced structural materials that can endure extreme
   environments, such as severe neutron irradiation damage at high
   temperatures. It has been known for decades that high dose radiation can
   introduce significant void swelling accompanied by precipitation in
   austenitic stainless steel (SS). Here we report, however, that through
   nanoengineering, ultra-fine grained (UFG) 304L SS with an average grain
   size of similar to 100 nm, can withstand Fe ion irradiation at 500
   degrees C to 80 displacements-per-atom (dpa) with moderate grain
   coarsening. Compared to coarse grained (CG) counterparts, swelling
   resistance of UFG SS is improved by nearly an order of magnitude and
   swelling rate is reduced by a factor of 5. M23C6 precipitates, abundant
   in irradiated CG SS, are largely absent in UFG SS. This study provides a

Abstract = {{Crop yields are influenced by growing season length, which are
   determined by temperature and agronomic management, such as sowing date
   and changes in cultivars. It is essential to quantify the interaction
   between climate change and crop management on crop phenology to
   understand the adaptation of farming systems to climate change.
   Historical changes in winter wheat phenology have been observed across
   the Loess Plateau of China during 1981-2009. The observed dates of
   sowing, emergence, and beginning of winter dormancy were delayed by an
   average of 1.2, 1.3, and 1.2 days decade(-1), respectively. Conversely,
   the dates of green-up (regrowth after winter dormancy), anthesis, and
   maturity advanced by an average of 2.0, 3.7, and 3.1 days decade(-1),
   respectively. Additionally, the growth duration (sowing to maturity),
   overwintering period, and vegetative phase (sowing to anthesis)
   shortened by an average of 4.3, 3.1, and 5.0 days decade(-1),
   respectively. The changes in phenological stages and phases were
   significantly negatively correlated with a temperature increase during
   this time. Differently to most other phase changes, the reproductive
   phase (anthesis to maturity) prolonged by an average of 0.7 day
   decade(-1), but this was spatially variable. The prolonged reproductive
   phase was due to advanced anthesis dates and consequently caused the
   reproductive phase to occur during a cooler part of the season, which
   led to an extended reproductive phase. Applying a crop simulation model
   using a field-tested standard cultivar across locations and years
   indicated that the simulated phenological stages have accelerated with
   the warming trend more than the observed phenological stages. This
   indicated that, over the last decades, later sowing dates and the
   introduction of new cultivars with longer thermal time requirement have
   compensated for some of the increased temperature-induced changes in
   wheat phenology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Existing models and methods report crop coefficient (K-c) as a function
   of time but do not consider the variations due to surface conditions,
   wetting methods, meteorological conditions, and other biophysical
   factors. These limitations result in erroneous crop evapotranspiration
   (ETc) estimates, especially for nonstandard conditions (e.g. plastic
   mulch). We present Support Vector Machine (SVM), a data-driven model
   based on statistical learning theory, for predicting generic K-c and ETc
   using a uniquely large dataset (10 seasons) from lysimeters for multiple
   crop-seasons combination under the plastic mulch conditions. The data
   used in this study were obtained from six years of lysimeter-based
   measurements (Shukla et al., 2006, 2012, 2014a, 2014b; Shukla and
   Knowles, 2011) for two distinctly different crop types (vine and erect)
   under two contrasting irrigation methods, drip and sub-irrigation. The
   SVM-based models predicted bell pepper (erect crop; r(2) =0.71) and
   watermelon (vine crop; r(2) =0.82) K-c as a function of time, water
   table depth, and number of rainfall events. The time since transplant
   represents the plant growth and, therefore, transpiration. The water
   table depth and rainfall events capture the effect of surface soil
   moisture on evaporation. The crop type-specific model is robust since it
   works for two different irrigation methods and growing seasons (spring
   and fall). The SVM model was superior to the Artificial Neural Network
   and Relevance Vector Machine models, two data-driven models used in
   hydrology. The errors in predicting ETc from the SVM model were only
   2.6\% and 11.2\% for watermelon and bell pepper, respectively,
   highlighting the model accuracy. For both crops, the SVM predicted K-c
   values were not statistically different from the actual K-c values. In
   contrast, the FAO-56 values were significantly lower than the actual K-c
   values for both bell pepper (p = 0.016) and watermelon (p = 0.025). When
   evaluated in the context of watershed-scale budgets, the SVM model
   improved the accuracy in ETc estimates by 49.3 mm over the FAO-56
   method, and this improvement represents 70\% (70.7 mm) of the observed
   surface flow. Improved accuracy of the SVM model makes it useful in
   deriving local K-c using readily available hydro-climatic data for
   applications ranging from field-scale water management to
   watershed-scale modeling. The proposed model can be used to develop
   region-specific K-c to improve ETc estimates. Future efforts should be
   made to explore the development of similar models for open-field crops.

Abstract = {{TiO2 is one of the most exciting anode candidates for safe application
   in lithium ion batteries. However, its low intrinsic electronic
   conductivity limits application. In this paper, a simple sal gel based
   route is presented to produce nanosize TiO2 fibers with 119 +/- 27 nm
   diameters via electrospinning. Subsequent calcination in various
   atmospheres was applied to achieve anatase and anatase-rutile mixed
   phase crystallites with and without carbon coating. The crystallite size
   was 5 nm for argon calcined fibers and 13-20 nm for air calcined fibers.
   Argon calcined TiO2 nanofibers exhibited electronic conductivity orders
   of magnitude higher than those of air-calcined samples. Lithium
   diffusivity was increased by one time and specific capacity by 26.9\%
   due to the enhanced conductivity. It also had a different intercalation
   mechanism of lithium. Hydrogen post heat-treatment was found to benefit
   electronic conductivity (by 3-4.5 times), lithium diffusivity (1.5-2

Abstract = {{This paper studies large-scale dynamical networks where the current
   state of the system is a linear transformation of the previous state,
   contaminated by a multivariate Gaussian noise. Examples include stock
   markets, human brains, and gene regulatory networks. We introduce a
   transition matrix to describe the evolution, which can be translated to
   a directed Granger transition graph, and use the concentration matrix of
   the Gaussian noise to capture the second-order relations between nodes,
   which can be translated to an undirected conditional dependence graph.
   We propose regularizing the two graphs jointly in topology
   identification and dynamics estimation. Based on the notion of joint
   association graph (JAG), we develop a joint graphical screening and
   estimation (JGSE) framework for efficient network learning in big data.
   In particular, our method can predetermine and remove unnecessary edges
   based on the joint graphical structure, referred to as JAG screening,
   and can decompose a large network into smaller subnetworks in a robust
   manner, referred to as JAG decomposition. JAG screening and
   decomposition can reduce the problem size and search space for fine
   estimation at a later stage. Experiments on both synthetic data and
   real-world applications show the effectiveness of the proposed framework
   in large-scale network topology identification and dynamics estimation.}},

Abstract = {{An interatomic potential for Al is developed within the third generation
   of the charge optimized many-body (COMB3) formalism. The database used
   for the parameterization of the potential consists of experimental data
   and the results of first-principles and quantum chemical calculations.
   The potential exhibits reasonable agreement with cohesive energy,
   lattice parameters, elastic constants, bulk and shear modulus, surface
   energies, stacking fault energies, point defect formation energies, and
   the phase order of metallic Al from experiments and density functional
   theory. In addition, the predicted phonon dispersion is in good
   agreement with the experimental data and first-principles calculations.
   Importantly for the prediction of the mechanical behavior, the unstable
   stacking fault energetics along the < 12 (1) over bar > direction on the
   (1 1 1) plane are similar to those obtained from first-principles
   calculations. The polycrsytal when strained shows responses that are
   physical and the overall behavior is consistent with experimental

Abstract = {{Aquitards can serve as long-term contaminant sources to aquifers when
   contaminant mass diffuses from the aquitard following aquifer source
   mass depletion. This study describes analytical and experimental
   approaches to understand reactive and nonreactive solute transport in a
   thin aquitard bounded by an adjacent aquifer. A series of
   well-controlled laboratory experiments were conducted in a
   two-dimensional flow chamber to quantify solute diffusion from a
   high-permeability sand into and subsequently out of kaolinite clay
   layers of vertical thickness 15 mm, 20 mm, and 60 mm. One-dimensional
   analytical solutions were developed for diffusion in a finite aquitard
   with mass exchange with an adjacent aquifer using the method of images.
   The analytical solutions showed very good agreement with measured
   breakthrough curves and aquitard concentration distributions measured in
   situ by light reflection visualization. Solutes with low retardation
   accumulated more stored mass with greater penetration distance in the
   aquitard compared to high-retardation solutes. However, because the
   duration of aquitard mass release was much longer, high-retardation
   solutes have a greater long-term back diffusion risk. The error
   associated with applying a semi-infinite domain analytical solution to a
   finite diffusion domain increases as a function of the system relative
   diffusion length scale, suggesting that the solutions using image
   sources should be applied in cases with rapid solute diffusion and/or
   thin clay layers. The solutions presented here can be extended to
   multilayer aquifer/low-permeability systems to assess the significance
   of back diffusion from thin layers.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we apply revolving scanning transmission electron microscopy to
   measure lattice strain across a sample using a single reference area. To
   do so, we remove image distortion introduced by sample drift, which
   usually restricts strain analysis to a single image. Overcoming this
   challenge, we show that it is possible to use strain reference areas
   elsewhere in the sample, thereby enabling reliable strain mapping across
   large areas. As a prototypical example, we determine the strain present
   within the microstructure of a Ni-based superalloy directly from atom
   column positions as well as geometric phase analysis. While maintaining
   atomic resolution, we quantify strain within nanoscale regions and
   demonstrate that large, unit-cell level strain fluctuations are present
   within the intermetallic phase. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave-induced thermoacoustic imaging is a noninvasive, high
   contrast, high resolution, and cost effective method for cancer
   detection. It has the potential to serve as a routine breast tumor
   screening. In the present study, simulation and experiment have been
   used for pulsed microwave energy spatial distribution investigation. The
   target to be imaged is a 9 x 9 square array composed of tubes 3 mm in
   diameter and 8 mm in separation. The simulation and experimental results
   both indicat that far away from the antenna, more tubes could be
   thermoacoustically recovered, which means a larger radiation area
   obtained. The thermoacooustically recovered tubes are 3.1 mm in diameter
   and 7.7 mm in separation. Obtained results suggest that it is feasible
   to detect microwave energy spatial distribution with the thermoacoustic
   imaging, which has paved the way to solve the inhomogeneous microwave
   energy problem in traditional quantitative thermoacoustic tomography.}},

Journal = {{INTERNET MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{181-200}},
Abstract = {{Many networks, including the Internet, social networks, and biological
   relations, are found to be naturally divided into communities of densely
   connected nodes, known as community structure. Since Newman's suggestion
   of using modularity as a measure to qualify the goodness of community
   structures, many efficient methods to maximize modularity have been
   proposed but without optimality guarantees. In this work we study exact
   and theoretically near-optimal algorithms for maximizing modularity. In
   the first part, we investigate the complexity and approximability of the
   problem on tree graphs. Somewhat surprisingly, the problem is still
   NP-complete on trees. We then provide a polynomial time algorithm for
   uniform-weighted trees and a pseudopolynomial time algorithm and a PTAS
   for trees with arbitrary weights. In the second part, we present a
   family of compact linear programming formulations for the problem in
   general graphs. These formulations exploit the graph connectivity
   structure and reduce substantially the number of constraints, thus, they
   vastly improve the running time for solving linear programming and
   integer programming. As a result, networks of thousands of vertices can
   be solved in minutes, whereas the current largest instance solved with
   mathematical programming has fewer than 250 vertices.}},

Abstract = {{The next wave of micro and nano devices will create a world with
   trillions of small networked cameras. This will lead to increased
   concerns about privacy and security. Most privacy preserving algorithms
   for computer vision are applied after image/video data has been
   captured. We propose to use privacy preserving optics that filter or
   block sensitive information directly from the incident lightfield before
   sensor measurements are made, adding a new layer of privacy. In addition
   to balancing the privacy and utility of the captured data, we address
   trade-offs unique to miniature vision sensors, such as achieving
   high-quality field-of-view and resolution within the constraints of mass
   and volume. Our privacy preserving optics enable applications such as
   depth sensing, full-body motion tracking, people counting, blob
   detection and privacy preserving face recognition. While we demonstrate
   applications on macroscale devices (smartphones, webcams, etc.) our
   theory has impact for smaller devices.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater robot swarming is of great importance to the development of
   novel strategies for oceanographic research, oceanic meteorology, and
   surveillance. Nevertheless, it has not drawn as much attention as its
   aerial or ground counterparts. In this paper, we investigate the
   mobility of a robot swarm in dominant and dynamically changing ocean
   currents. An active Lagrangian particle swarm (ALPS) consists of mobile
   agents with local sensing and communication capabilities. Motion of
   these agents is mostly dictated by background flows. Limited
   self-propulsion is applied intermittently in order to maintain swarm
   connectivity and avoid inter-agent collisions. To preserve the
   predictability of the swarm motion through ocean general circulation
   models, a physicomimetic swarm control law is proposed such that
   pair-wise self-propulsion is applied analogously to internal forces
   among atoms or molecules. Interactions among neighboring agents are
   weighted by local agent densities, which are calculated through a
   compact smoothing kernel function. The ALPS' movement is simulated in a
   meandering jet. Results show that swarm connectivity can be effectively
   maintained by controlling a small portion of the agents with the
   proposed swarm control method even when large background flow variations
   present.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns state estimation problems in a mean field control
   setting. In a finite population model, the goal is to estimate the joint
   distribution of the population state and the state of a typical
   individual. The observation equations are a noisy measurement of the
   population.
   The general results are applied to demand dispatch for regulation of the
   power grid, based on randomized local control algorithms. In prior work
   by the authors it has been shown that local control can be carefully
   designed so that the aggregate of loads behaves as a controllable
   resource with accuracy matching or exceeding traditional sources of
   frequency regulation. The operational cost is nearly zero in many cases.
   The information exchange between grid and load is minimal, but it is
   assumed in the overall control architecture that the aggregate power
   consumption of loads is available to the grid operator. It is shown that
   the Kalman filter can be constructed to reduce these communication
   requirements, and to provide the grid operator with accurate estimates
   of the mean and variance of quality of service (QoS) for an individual
   load.}},

   an autonomous system to move along a desired trajectory. Adaptive
   control methods have been previously developed by compensating for an
   unknown parameter (i.e., the depth of a feature) in the dynamics, where
   persistence of excitation assumptions are used for parameter
   identification. Rather than assume persistent excitation, an augmented
   adaptive update law that uses recorded data is utilized in this paper to
   guarantee exponential tracking and parameter identification with only
   finite excitation. By identifying the depth parameter, the structure of
   the scene can be reconstructed, enabling simultaneous mapping and

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel method for allowing an autonomous ground
   vehicle to predict the intent of other agents in an urban environment.
   This method, termed the cognitive driving framework, models both the
   intent and the potentially false beliefs of an obstacle vehicle. By
   modeling the relationships between these variables as a dynamic Bayesian
   network, filtering can be performed to calculate the intent of the
   obstacle vehicle as well as its belief about the environment. This joint
   knowledge can be exploited to plan safer and more efficient trajectories
   when navigating in an urban environment. Simulation results are
   presented that demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to
   calculate the intent of obstacle vehicles as an autonomous vehicle
   navigates a road intersection such that preventative maneuvers can be
   taken to avoid imminent collisions. The method is compared to a reactive
   planner in two intersection navigation scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Designing FPGA-based space systems that meet mission goals of high
   performance, low power, and high dependability is challenging. Our
   previous work established a framework to help designers of FPGA-based
   space systems to consider a wide range of designs, evaluate the power
   and dependability of those designs, and narrow the large design search
   space down to a significantly reduced Pareto-optimal set. To further
   improve and extend our framework's ability to evaluate and optimize
   increasingly complex aerospace systems, this paper details our
   framework's memory extension, which enables memory-aware analysis by
   refinements to our framework's original analysis. The memory-aware
   analysis more accurately predicts a system's power and dependability by
   modeling three memory resources: internal-memory capacity,
   internal-memory bandwidth, and external-memory bandwidth. We demonstrate
   the importance of our framework's memory extension by investigating a
   case study based on an enhanced version of a hyperspectral-imaging
   satellite mission. After analyzing 22 unique Virtex FPGA devices and
   optimizing each for power and then dependability, the framework selects
   four Pareto-optimal designs, ranging from very-low power to high
   dependability. Results of the framework's memory extension show that
   memory resources may limit the performance of an FPGA-based space-system
   design and contribute significantly towards power and dependability
   results.}},

Abstract = {{When equipped with multiple antennas, secondary users in cognitive radio
   networks are able to communicate even when neighboring primary users are
   active by transmitting in the null space of the communication channel
   occupied by primary users. In this case, the throughput of a secondary
   link is limited by the transmission power and the dimension of the null
   space, i. e., the number of active primary users nearby. Since the
   number of active primary users is time-varying, the required
   transmission power to support certain data rate changes from time to
   time. Thus, secondary users could adapt their transmission to the
   variation of the primary traffic to improve energy efficiency. In view
   of that, we develop an energy-efficient traffic scheduling scheme for
   secondary users equipped with multiple antennas. By formulating the
   traffic scheduling problem as a Markov decision problem, an
   energy-efficient transmission scheme is derived from linear programming.
   The analytical results are verified by simulations and the impacts of
   various parameters are discussed. The superiority of the derived scheme
   is also shown by comparing with a randomized scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Voice capacity over wireless local area networks (WLANs) can be
   increased by the statistical multiplexing among on/ off voice calls.
   However, in previously proposed schemes, the admitted voice calls that
   transit from silence state to talkspurt state are mixed up with the new
   voice calls to contend for the channel. The increase in the traffic load
   of new voice users could degrade the performance of ongoing voice calls.
   In this paper, we propose a novel MAC scheme for VoIP over WLANs,
   referred to as PAMA (Prioritized Adaptive Multiple Access). The key
   features of the proposed scheme are that 1) the admitted voice calls
   have higher priority access to the channel than the new voice calls,
   based on the fact that maintaining the required QoS of ongoing calls is
   more important than admitting new calls; 2) the dedicated contention
   window for admitted voice calls is dynamically adjusted according to the
   current estimation of the number of active ongoing voice calls to
   guarantee the QoS requirements; 3) a two-state Markov model is
   established to evaluate the system performance. Analytical and
   simulation results demonstrate that PAMA can increase the voice capacity
   while still satisfying the QoS of admitted voice calls.}},

Abstract = {{Health monitoring is an important category of mobile Health (mHealth)
   applications. Users generate a large volume of data during health
   monitoring, which can then be used by the mHealth server for
   constructing diagnosis or prognosis prediction models. However, these
   training samples contain private information of data owners, who may be
   reluctant to share them with the mHealth server. This paper proposes and
   experimentally studies a scheme that keeps the training samples private
   while enabling accurate construction of diagnosis and prognosis models.
   We specifically consider logistic regression models which are widely
   used in mHealth, and decompose the logistic regression model
   construction problem into small subproblems that can be executed by each
   user using their own private data. In this manner, users can keep their
   raw data locally and only upload encrypted parameters to the mHealth
   server for model construction. We show that our scheme suits well in
   mHealth applications by conducting experimental evaluations based on a
   real-world dataset and analyzing its computation overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum trading benefits primary users (PUs) by monetary gains and

   radio networks (CRNs). Unfortunately, most existing spectrum trading
   designs only focus on the guarantee of economic properties, but forget
   the wireless transmission nature, especially for multi-hop cognitive
   radio (CR) communications. In this paper, we propose an economic-robust
   session based spectrum trading, which has a joint consideration of
   economic properties such as incentive compatibility, individual
   rationality, and budget balance, and the end-to-end performance for
   multi-hop communications. Considering two bidding manners, i.e., bidding
   for the whole session and unit rate bidding, we formulate the spectrum
   trading optimization problems under multiple economic and multihop CR
   transmission constraints, design two pricing mechanisms to charge the
   winning spectrum bidders, and further mathematically prove the
   economic-robustness of the proposed spectrum trading schemes. Through
   extensive simulations, we show the proposed schemes are economic-robust
   and effective in improving spectrum utilization.}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio networks, primary users (PUs) can leverage secondary
   users (SUs) as cooperative relays to increase their transmission rates,
   and SUs will in turn obtain more spectrum access opportunities. While
   most existing works assume that SUs are passively selected by PUs
   regardless of SUs' willingness, in this paper, we propose a cooperative
   strategy for SUs to actively decide whether to cooperate or not.
   Basically, due to PUs' time-varying traffic demands, it is essential for
   SUs to firstly observe the channels and then select a specific PU to
   cooperate with in order to save the energy. In our paper, this decision
   related problem is formulated based on optimal stopping theory where SUs
   observe PUs in time sequence and then make decisions whether to stop
   observation and cooperate right away or wait till next time slot to
   repeat the same process. We address this problem by using backward
   induction and derive the energy-efficient strategy for SUs. To validate
   the feasibility of our proposed scheme, extensive simulations are
   conducted to show the impact of PUs' traffic demands on SUs' decisions.
   The results also reveal that the proposed optimal rule outperforms the
   greedy selection strategy and is thus more energy-efficient to be
   applied to the cooperative cognitive radio networks.}},

Abstract = {{Advancements in big data analysis offer cost-effective opportunities to
   improve decision-making in numerous areas such as health care, economic

   scenario where multiple data holders intend to find predictive models

   Data locality property is used as an alternative to multi-party
   computation (SMC) techniques. Specifically, we distribute the
   centralized learning task to each data holder as local learning tasks in
   a way that local learning is only related to local data. Along with
   that, we propose an efficient and secure protocol to reassemble local

Abstract = {{The prevalence of smartphones with geo-positioning functionalities gives
   rise to a variety of location-based services (LBSs). Proximity test, an
   important branch of location-based services, enables the LBS users to
   determine whether they are in a close proximity with their friends,
   which can be extended to numerous applications in location-based mobile
   social networks. Unfortunately, serious security and privacy issues may
   occur in the current solutions to proximity test. On the one hand,
   users' private location information is usually revealed to the LBS
   server and other users, which may lead to physical attacks to users. On
   the other hand, the correctness of proximity test computation results
   from LBS server cannot be verified in the existing schemes and thus the
   creditability of LBS is greatly reduced. Besides, privacy should be
   defined by user him/herself, not the LBS server. In this paper, we
   propose a privacy-preserving verifiable proximity test for
   location-based services. Our scheme enables LBS users to verify the
   correctness of proximity test results from LBS server without revealing
   their location information. We show the security, efficiency, and
   feasibility of our proposed scheme through detailed performance

Abstract = {{The interactive structure of software applications involves multiple
   facets of graphic design and information architecture. A user's
   affective reaction can be influenced while interacting with these
   applications. From a user's experience (UX) point of view, the affective
   reaction generated from users in some cases can be considered of an
   equal or even higher importance than the design and architecture of a
   software application. When describing affective reaction within the
   context of user experience, a change in the users' attitude could also
   influence a change in their behavior while interacting with certain
   applications. More importantly, this behavior change could impact the
   users' quality of decision-making during interaction. Affective
   reactions can be invoked and influenced through the incorporation of
   visual emotional stimuli. Example visual emotional stimuli include
   colors, facial expressions, movie scenes, and shapes of objects. Amongst
   these particular stimuli, colors and shapes can be considered of a lower
   level design than facial expressions and movie scenes. Previous studies
   have provided mixed findings regarding an individual's affective
   reaction when exposed to colors and shapes. However, this article
   investigates the potential of employing such elements as viable
   alternatives to higher level stimuli such as facial expression and movie
   scenes. A study was conducted to explore affective reaction using
   colors, shapes, and their combinations to serve as visual emotional
   stimuli. The objective was to understand the possibility of using lower
   level design alternatives for manipulating users' affective reactions by
   comparing colors and shapes in the form of textual properties, abstract
   polygonal shapes, and the combination of both respectively. The study
   consisted of thirteen participants who were exposed to these design
   elements in their variety while interacting with a simple computer
   application. For measurement and analysis, one-way repeated measure
   ANOVAs were employed to determine the effectiveness of these design
   elements and their mood induction capabilities during user interaction.
   The results from this study indicated that the presence of colors,
   shapes, and their combinations were able to invoke certain affective
   reactions without the participants even noticing their presence. More
   specifically, this study revealed that certain colors and shapes
   generated a more positive affective reaction while others induced either
   a more neutral or less positive emotion from the participants. This
   study also demonstrated that these particular design elements have high
   visceral effects that could be used as potential alternatives to more
   traditional and higher level visual emotional stimuli in order to
   influence a user's affective reaction. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

   mimic a voter voting in a precinct. The goal of the experiment was to
   establish a threshold for when distortion occurs and speech recognition
   accuracy declines. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) between the volumes
   were recorded and the system's accuracy was tested. The result was a
   suggested threshold of a SNR equal to 1.44 to attain 90\% system
   accuracy. The next phase of this project is to test the level of system

Abstract = {{Reusable hardware intellectual property (IP) based System-on-Chip (SoC)
   design has emerged as a pervasive design practice in the industry to
   dramatically reduce design/verification cost while meeting aggressive
   time-to-market constraints. However, growing reliance on reusable
   pre-verified hardware IPs and wide array of CAD tools during SoC design
   - often gathered from untrusted 3rd party vendors - severely affects the
   security and trustworthiness of SoC computing platforms. Major security
   issues in the hardware IPs at different stages of SoC life cycle include
   piracy during IP evaluation, reverse engineering, cloning,
   counterfeiting, as well as malicious hardware modifications. The global
   electronic piracy market is growing rapidly and is now estimated to be
   \$ 1B/day, of which a significant part is related to hardware IPs.
   Furthermore, use of untrusted foundry in a fabless business model
   greatly aggravates the SoC security threats by introducing vulnerability
   of malicious modifications or piracy during SoC fabrication. Due to
   ever-growing computing demands, modern SoCs tend to include many
   heterogeneous processing cores, scalable communication network, together
   with reconfigurable cores e.g. embedded FPGA in order to incorporate
   logic that is likely to change as standards and requirements evolve.
   Such design practices greatly increase the number of untrusted
   components in the SoC design flow and make the overall system security a
   pressing concern. There is a critical need to analyze the SoC security
   issues and attack models due to involvement of multiple untrusted
   entities in SoC design cycle - IP vendors, CAD tool developers, and
   foundries - and develop low-cost effective countermeasures. These
   countermeasures would encompass encryption, obfuscation, watermarking
   and fingerprinting, and certain analytic methods derived from the
   behavioral aspects of SoC to enable trusted operation with untrusted
   components.
   In this tutorial, we plan to provide a comprehensive coverage of both
   fundamental concepts and recent advances in validation of security and
   trust of hardware IPs. The tutorial also covers the security and debug
   trade-offs in modern SoCs e.g., more observability is beneficial for
   debug whereas limited observability is better for security. It examines
   the state-of-the-art in research in this challenging area as well as
   industrial practice, and points to important gaps that need to be filled
   in order to develop a validation and debug flow for secure SoC systems.
   The tutorial presenters (one industry expert and two faculty members)
   will be able to provide unique perspectives on both academic research
   and industrial practices. The selection of topics covers a broad
   spectrum and will be of interest to a wide audience including design,
   validation, security, and debug engineers. The proposed tutorial
   consists of five parts. The first part introduces security
   vulnerabilities and various challenges associated with trust validation
   for hardware IPs. Part II covers various security attacks and
   countermeasures. Part III covers both formal methods and
   simulation-based approaches for security and trust validation. Part IV
   presents the conflicting requirements between security and debug during
   SoC development and ways to address them. Part V covers real- life
   examples of security failures and successful countermeasures in
   industry. Finally, Part VI concludes this tutorial with discussion on
   emerging issues and future directions.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of peak power consumption is an essential task in order to
   design reliable systems. Optimistic design choices can make the circuit
   unreliable and vulnerable to power attacks, whereas pessimistic design
   can lead to unacceptable design overhead. The power virus problem is
   defined as finding input patterns that can maximize switching activity
   (dynamic power dissipation) in digital circuits. In this paper, we
   present a fast and simple to implement power virus generation technique
   utilizing a probabilistic cost-benefit analysis. To maximize switching
   activity, our proposed algorithm iteratively enables transitions in high
   fan-out gates while considering the trade-off between switching of new
   gates (benefit) and blocking of gate transitions in the future
   iterations (cost) due to switching of the currently selected one.
   Extensive experiments using both combinational and sequential benchmarks
   demonstrate that our approach can achieve up to 64\% more toggles
   (30.7\% on average) for zero-delay model and improvements of up to 319\%
   (109\% on average) for unit-delay model compared to the state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{Today, an increasing number of applications and services are being
   hosted by large-scale data centers. The massive and irregular load
   surges challenge data center power infrastructures. As a result, power
   mismatching between supply and demand has emerged as a crucial issue in
   modern data centers which are either under-provisioned or powered by
   intermittent power sources. Recent proposals have employed energy
   storage devices such as the uninter-ruptible power supply (UPS) systems
   to address this issue. However, current approaches lack the capacity of
   efficiently handling the irregular and unpredictable power mismatches.
   In this paper, we propose Hybrid Energy Buffering (HEB), the first
   heterogeneous and adaptive strategy that incorporates super-capacitors
   (SCs) into existing data centers to dynamically deal with power
   mismatches. Our techniques exploit diverse energy absorbing
   characteristics and intelligent load assignment policies to provide
   efficiency and scenario- aware power mismatch management. More
   attractively, our management schemes make the costly energy storage
   devices more affordable and economical for datacenter-scale usage. We
   evaluate the HEB design with a real system prototype. Compared with a
   homogenous battery energy buffering system, HEB could improve energy
   efficiency by 39.7\%, extend UPS lifetime by 4.7X, reduce system
   downtime by 41\% and improve renewable energy utilization by 81.2\%. Our
   TCO analysis shows that HEB manifests high ROI and is able to gain more
   than 1.9X peak shaving benefit during an 8-years period. It allows
   datacenters to adapt to various power supply anomalies, thereby
   improving operational efficiency, resiliency and economy.}},

Abstract = {{FPGA-based reconfigurable computing is finding its way into a wide range
   of application areas in which high performance and low power consumption
   are paramount. However, FPGA-application development using
   hardware-description languages (HDLs) faces many productivity challenges
   that limit its wide adoption, including a steep learning curve and
   lengthy compilation. High-level synthesis (HLS) languages and tools aim
   to overcome these challenges by providing familiar high-level languages
   and tools for FPGA-application development. In using HLS, however, an
   important consideration is the cost-benefit tradeoff for performance and
   productivity. Hybrid-threading (HT) is a new open-source HLS toolset
   from Convey Computer, Corp. that features a programming language based
   on C/C++ and a set of tools for efficient compilation, verification, and
   implementation. In this paper, we present a performance and productivity
   tradeoff study of HT HLS versus HDLs using three RC-amenable kernels,
   each chosen for their distinctive computational requirements. Our
   results show that for all three kernels, HT achieved over 80\%
   performance for a fraction of development time, in comparison to
   corresponding optimized HDL-based designs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a pack-centric approach to datacenter
   resource management by abstracting a system as a pack of resources and
   considering the mapping of these packs onto physical datacenter resource
   groups, called swads. The assignment of packs/VMs to swads/PMs is
   formulated as an integer optimization problem that can capture
   constraints related to the available resources, datacenter efficiency
   and customers' complex requirements. Scalability is achieved through a
   hierarchical decomposition method. We illustrate aspects of the proposed
   approach by describing and experimenting with a concrete and challenging

   constraints using switched control. The first result is that, for a
   given control Lyapunov function (CLF), a stabilizable set of initial
   conditions can be found. The paper then considers switching between
   multiple CLFs to increase the space of stabilizing inputs which also
   increases the set of stabilizable initial conditions. An algorithm is
   presented that identifies a subset of the known CLFs that may be used at
   the current time to produce stabilizing control inputs. While there are
   existing results for switched system stabilization using CLFs,
   stabilization for systems with input constraints is an original
   contribution. Sum of squares (SOS) methods are discussed for generating
   multiple CLFs, and examples are provided.}},

   nonlinear networked control systems (NCS) operating over a
   bandwidth-limited shared-channel is proposed to reduce network traffic.
   The NCS under consideration includes feedback and feedforward
   communication channels, and is assumed to be perturbed by an unmodeled,
   nonlinear disturbance. Informational value of the output states can be
   analyzed in the context of system stability using model-based
   approaches. When fused with event-based triggering, these context-aware
   communication policies result in aperiodic feedback and feedforward
   signals that guarantee uniformly ultimately bounded tracking of output
   states of an uncertain perturbed system along the desired time-varying
   trajectory. The proposed NCS is validated using extensive simulation
   results for nonlinear coupled MIMO systems.}},

Abstract = {{Non-contact face-video based human heart rate (HR) estimation has
   attracted a lot of attentions in recent years. Almost all the
   state-of-the-art webcam or smartphone based HR estimation methods
   comprise three main steps: firstly, a region of interest (ROI) on the
   human face is detected in each video frame; then, the target signal is
   obtained by fusing multiple raw traces, which are extracted from the RGB
   channels across all the video frames; finally, HR is estimated by
   applying frequency analysis approach to the target signal. However,
   three major drawbacks impede the applicability of the current methods:
   (1) the performance of ROI detection is susceptible to head motion and
   facial expression; (2) there is still a lack of well-accepted method for
   fusing raw traces to form the target signal; and (3) the adopted
   frequency analysis approaches always provide estimation results with low
   resolution and high sidelobes. To address these issues, we propose a
   novel HR estimation method which is applicable to ordinary cameras
   subject to natural head movement or facial expression. The proposed
   method features ROI detection via facial feature detection and tracking,
   target signal extraction via Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the
   RGB channels, and HR estimation via real-valued iterative adaptive
   approach (RIAA). Experimental results validate the superiority of our
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of synthesizing continuous and
   infinitely varying stream of texture videos by doing operations on
   finite texture videos. Given an input texture video, such as flame,
   water, smoke, etc, we can synthesize a longer texture video holding the
   same texture appearance. Dynamic textures have been modeled as linear
   dynamic systems(LDS) by unfolding the video frames into column vectors
   and modeling their dynamic trajectory as time evolves. After the vectors
   are projected onto a lower dimensional space by Singular Value
   Decomposition(SVD), dynamic texture synthesis is achieved by driving the
   system with random noise. However, because of its over-simplified
   appearance model and under-constrained dynamic model. It is usually hard
   to synthesize long and visual pleasing texture video sequences. In this
   paper, we propose a new dynamic texture synthesis framework via
   creatively fitting the basic LDS with a newly developed patch
   reconstruction technique to efficiently enhance high quality texture
   details while maintaining the temporal coherence of the reconstructed
   texture patches. The patch reconstruction technique is inspired by
   locally linear embedding(LLE) and based on the assumption that small
   patches in the low-and high-quality images form manifolds with similar
   local geometry. The newly synthesized patches are finally stitched
   together by graph cuts to make up the output texture videos. Experiments
   on standard dynamic texture databases demonstrate that our method
   exhibits superior performance on synthesizing dynamic textures.}},

   developed that enables interaction with the automated RRT planner in

   attributes such as wayareas, space constrains, and waypoints. In
   addition, the human can draw desired trajectories using the touch

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and evaluates MALMOS, a novel framework for mobile
   offloading scheduling based on online machine learning techniques. In
   contrast to previous works, which rely on application-dependent
   parameters or pre-defined static scheduling policies, MALMOS provides an
   online training mechanism for the machine learning-based runtime
   scheduler such that it supports a flexible policy that dynamically
   adapts scheduling decisions based on the observation of previous
   offloading decisions and their correctness. To demonstrate its practical
   applicability, we integrated MALMOS with an existing Java-based,
   offloading-capable code refactoring framework, DPartner. Using this
   integration, we performed quantitative experiments to evaluate the
   performance and cost for three machine learning algorithms:
   instance-based learning, perceptron, and naive Bayes, with respect to
   classifier training time, classification time, and scheduling accuracy.
   Particularly, we examined the adaptability of MALMOS to various network
   conditions and computing capabilities of remote resources by comparing
   the scheduling accuracy with two static scheduling cases:
   threshold-based and linear equation-based scheduling policies. Our
   evaluation uses an Android-based prototype for experiments, and
   considers benchmarks with different computation/ communication
   characteristics, and different computing capabilities of remote
   resources. The evaluation shows that MALMOS achieves 10.9\%similar to
   40.5\% higher scheduling accuracy than two static scheduling policies.}},

Abstract = {{In fading channels, power allocation over channel state may bring a rate
   increment compared to the fixed constant power mode. Such a rate
   increment is referred to power allocation gain. It is expected that the
   power allocation gain varies for different relay protocols. In this
   paper, Decode-and-Forward (DF) and Compress-and-Forward (CF) protocols
   are considered. We first establish a general framework for relay power
   allocation of DF and CF over channel state in half-duplex relay channels
   and present the optimal solution for relay power allocation with
   auxiliary parameters, respectively. Then, we reconsider the power
   allocation problem for one hybrid scheme which always selects the better
   one between DF and CF and obtain a near optimal solution for the hybrid
   scheme by introducing an auxiliary rate function as well as avoiding the
   non-concave rate optimization problem. Simulation results show that the
   developed power allocation solutions bring significant rate gains in
   various fading relay channels compared to constant power allocation
   mode.}},

   delay of communication. Second, we develop an airborne network simulator
   that captures more realistic features than the existing ones.
   Experiments in our simulator show that our proposed routing scheme can

Abstract = {{Dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT) and FFF beams are commonly adopted
   for efficient conformal dose delivery in SBRT. Off-axis geometry (OAG)
   may be necessary to obtain full gantry rotation without collision, which
   has been shown to be beneficial for peripheral targets using flattened
   beams. We investigated dose distributions in OAG using FFF, and the
   effect of mechanical rotation induced uncertainty.
   Sphere targets (2, 4, and 6 cm diameter) were placed at three locations
   (central axis, 3 cm, and 6 cm off-axis) in a representative patient CT
   set. DCAT plans were obtained for 6X, 6FFF, 10X, and 10FFF. Homogeneity
   index (HI), conformality indices (CI), and beam on time (BOT) were
   calculated. Mechanical rotation induced uncertainty was evaluated using
   five SBRT patient plans with laterally located tumors. For each, a plan
   was generated using FFF beams for OAG and CAG. Each was replanned to
   account for one degree collimator/couch rotation errors during delivery.
   Prescription isodose coverage, CI, and lung dose were evaluated.
   HI and CI values were similar for flattened and unflattened beams;
   however, 6FFF provided slightly better values than 10FFF in OAG. For all
   plans HI and CI were acceptable with the maximum difference between
   flattened and FFF beams being 0.1. FFF beams showed better conformality
   for low doses and small targets. Variation due to rotational error for
   isodose coverage, CI, and lung dose was generally smaller for CAG
   compared to OAG, with some of these comparisons reaching statistical
   significance. However, variations in dose distributions for either
   technique were small and not clinically significant.
   FFF beams showed acceptable dose distributions in OAG. 10FFF provides
   more dramatic BOT reduction, but generally provides less favorable
   dosimetric indices compared to 6FFF in OAG. Mechanical rotation induced
   uncertainty had an increased effect for OAG compared to CAG; however,
   variations for either treatment technique were minimal.}},

   on-chip differential amplifier is designed in a 130-nm RFCMOS process,

   signals stimulate a DUT in true differential mode, true
   differential/common mode measurements may reduce the measurement errors
   caused by the non-linear effects. Differential/common mixed-mode

Abstract = {{Autotuning is an empirical optimization approach in which the
   configuration space of an algorithmic code is explored in a systematic
   manner for a variety of software and hardware parameters. The objective
   of such autotuning is to reduce the computational time and/or energy
   requirements of the generated code. We develop a genetic algorithm based
   autotuning strategy that can be used for optimizing performance or
   energy or a combination thereof. The main advantage of our approach is
   that the number of possible compilations and executions that are
   explored in the configuration space is substantially smaller than
   exhaustive search. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to the
   underlying small matrix multiplication routines in spectral element
   solvers. The latter are an important class of higher order methods that
   are expected to be computationally intensive portion of next generation

Abstract = {{Partial reconfiguration (PR) on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)
   enables multiple PR modules (PRMs) to time multiplex partially
   reconfigurable regions (PRRs), which affords reduced reconfiguration
   time, area overhead, etc., as compared to non-PR systems. However, to
   effectively leverage PR, system designers must determine appropriate PRR
   sizes/organizations during early stages of PR system design, since
   inappropriate PRRs, given PRM requirements, can negate PR benefits,
   potentially resulting in system performance worse than a
   functionally-equivalent non-PR design. To aid in PR system design, we
   present two portable, high-level cost models, which are based on the
   synthesis report results generated by Xilinx tools. These cost models
   estimate PRR size/organization given the PRR's associated PRMs to
   maximize the PRRs' resource utilizations and estimate the PRM's
   associated partial bitstream sizes based on the PRR sizes/organizations.
   Experiments evaluate our cost models' accuracies for different PRMs and
   required resources, which enable our models to afford enhanced designer
   productivity since these models preclude the lengthy PR design flow,
   which is typically required to attain such analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Modern field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) allow runtime partial
   reconfiguration (PR) of the FPGA, enabling PR benefits such as runtime
   adaptability and extensibility, and reduces the application's area
   requirement. However, PR application development requires
   non-traditional expertise and lengthy design time effort. Since
   high-level synthesis (HLS) languages afford fast application development
   time, these languages are becoming increasingly popular for FPGA
   application development. However, widely used HLS languages, such as C
   variants, do not contain PR-specific constructs, thus exploiting PR
   benefits using an HLS language is a challenging task. To alleviate this
   challenge, we present an automated high-level design framework-PaRAT
   (partial reconfiguration amenability test). PaRAT parses, analyzes, and
   partitions an application's HLS code to generate the application's PR
   architectures, which contain the application's runtime modifiable
   modules and thus, allows the application's runtime reconfiguration. Case
   study analysis demonstrates PaRAT's ability to quickly and automatically
   generate PR architectures from an application's HLS code.}},

Abstract = {{Crop simulation models are often used to estimate the impact of climate
   change on agricultural production. But, simulated climate change impacts
   vary across agricultural impact models due to differences in model
   structures and parameter values. When comparing crop models with
   standardised inputs, uncertainties in simulated impacts increased with
   higher temperatures(1) and CO2 concentrations(2,3). These uncertainties
   in impact simulations are larger due to crop models, than due to
   downscaled general circulation models(2). Impact uncertainties can be
   reduced by improving model routines and parameters with detailed field
   experimentations. However, multi-model ensemble medians also supply an
   improved prediction above individual models(4). Less uncertainty in
   describing how climate change may affect agricultural productivity is
   needed to assist in the development of adaptation strategies and
   policies. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The inadequate resource allocation, lack of I/O performance prediction
   and insufficient isolation are affecting the storage performance in the
   multi-tenant cloud storage environment. In order to guarantee the
   Quality of Service (QoS), Software defined Storage (SDS) is an effective
   approach in data centers. However, the lack of intelligence, robustness
   and self adjustment are blocking the applications and promotions of SDS
   heavily. This paper focuses on the QoS-Aware I/O resource scheduling
   problem to build data centers with high availability, scalability and
   QoS. We will study workload characteristics, requirement analysis, the
   theory of QoS in SDS and I/O scheduling strategies. We obtain such goals
   by proposing a mathematics model of workload burstness, QoS semantic
   description with rule execution mechanisms and dynamic robust I/O
   scheduling algorithms for multi-type resources allocation. In the
   current progress, A QoS-Aware I/O Scheduling Framework towards SDS, qSDS
   has been proposed for the SSD/HDD hybrid storage. The preliminary
   evaluation in some benchmarks shows that qSDS can gain better
   performance compared with other strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Digital imagery and video have been widely used in many undersea
   applications. Online automated labeling of marine animals in such video
   clips comprises of three major steps: detection and tracking, feature
   extraction and classification. The latter two aspects are the focus of
   this paper. Feature extracted from convolutional neural network (CNN) is
   tested on two real-world marine animal datasets (Taiwan sea fish and
   Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) benthic animal), and
   yields better classification results than existing approaches.
   Appropriate combination of CNN and hand-designed features can achieve
   even higher accuracy than applying CNN alone. The group feature
   selection scheme, which is a modified version of the
   minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) algorithm, serves as the
   criterion for selecting an optimal set of hand-designed features.
   Performance of CNN and hand-designed features are further examined for
   images with lowered quality that emulates bad lighting condition in

Abstract = {{Use-after-free conditions occur when an execution path of a process
   accesses an incorrectly deallocated object. Such access is problematic
   because it may potentially allow for the execution of arbitrary code by
   an adversary. However, while increasingly common, such flaws are rarely
   detected by compilers in even the most obvious instances. In this paper,
   we design and implement a static analysis method for the detection of
   use-after-free conditions in binary code. Our new analysis is similar to
   available expression analysis and traverses all code paths to ensure
   that every object is defined before each use. Failure to achieve this
   property indicates that an object is improperly freed and potentially
   vulnerable to compromise. After discussing the details of our algorithm,
   we implement a tool and run it against a set of enterprise-grade,
   publicly available binaries. We show that our tool can not only catch
   textbook and recently released in-situ examples of this flaw, but that
   it has also identified 127 additional use-after-free conditions in a
   search of 652 compiled binaries in the Windows system32 directory. In so
   doing, we demonstrate not only the power of this approach in combating
   this increasingly common vulnerability, but also the ability to identify
   such problems in software for which the source code is not necessarily
   publicly available.}},

Abstract = {{Many social networks and complex systems are found to be naturally
   divided into clusters of densely connected nodes, known as community
   structure (CS). Finding CS is one of fundamental yet challenging topics
   in network science. One of the most popular classes of methods for this
   problem is to maximize Newman's modularity. However, there is a little
   understood on how well we can approximate the maximum modularity as well
   as the implications of finding community structure with provable
   guarantees. In this paper, we settle definitely the approximability of
   modularity clustering, proving that approximating the problem within any
   (multiplicative) positive factor is intractable, unless P = NP. Yet we
   propose the first additive approximation algorithm for modularity
   clustering with a constant factor. Moreover, we provide a rigorous proof
   that a CS with modularity arbitrary close to maximum modularity Q(OPT)
   might bear no similarity to the optimal CS of maximum modularity. Thus
   even when CS with near-optimal modularity are found, other verification
   methods are needed to confirm the significance of the structure.}},

Abstract = {{Computer aided diagnosis of breast cancers often relies on automatic
   image analysis of histopathology images. The automatic region
   segmentation in breast cancer is challenging due to: i) large regional
   variations, and ii) high computational costs of pixel-wise segmentation.
   Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proven to be an effective
   method for image recognition and classification. However, it is often
   computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose to apply a fast
   scanning deep convolutional neural network (fCNN) to pixel-wise region
   segmentation. The fCNN removes the redundant computations in the
   original CNN without sacrificing its performance. In our experiment it
   takes only 2.3 seconds to segment an image with size 1000 x 1000. The
   comparison experiments show that the proposed system outperforms both
   the LBP feature-based and texton-based pixel-wise methods.}},

Abstract = {{Diseased skeletal muscle expresses mononuclear cell infiltration in the
   regions of perimysium. Accurate annotation or segmentation of perimysium
   can help biologists and clinicians to determine individualized patient
   treatment and allow for reasonable prognostication. However, manual
   perimysium annotation is time consuming and prone to interobserver
   variations. Meanwhile, the presence of ambiguous patterns in muscle
   images significantly challenge many traditional automatic annotation
   algorithms. In this paper, we propose an automatic perimysium annotation
   algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We formulate
   the automatic annotation of perimysium in muscle images as a pixel-wise
   classification problem, and the CNN is trained to label each image pixel
   with raw RGB values of the patch centered at the pixel. The algorithm is
   applied to 82 diseased skeletal muscle images. We have achieved an
   average precision of 94\% on the test dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Several algorithms in adaptive filtering are based on the minimization
   of the mean squared error ( MSE) cost function. However, MSE is just a
   second order statistics and hence does not capture the entire
   information about the probability distribution of the error in the
   system. An information theoretic alternative is using the minimum error
   entropy ( MEE) cost function. Adaptive algorithms based on this
   criterion have been developed and shown to be superior as compared to
   MSE counterparts. In this work, kernel versions of some of these methods
   are designed and tested on predicting the annual sunspot number. The
   sunspot number is the number of visibly darker regions on the solar
   surface and has been shown to be instrumental in modeling space weather,
   state of the ionosphere, climatic anomalies and even global warming. A
   comparative performance study of the various linear and kernel
   algorithms, trained with both MEE and MSE criteria, in predicting such a
   chaotic non-linear time series is presented in this paper. Experimental
   results clearly show the advantage of the MEE based kernel design which
   is as per expectation given that it has the advantage of being nonlinear
   along with being able to derive maximum information from the error
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Pass-through techniques enable virtual machines to directly access
   hardware GPU resources in an exclusive mode, delivering extraordinary
   graphics performance for client users in GaaS clouds. However, the
   virtualization overheads of pass-through GPUs may decrease the frame
   rate of graphics workloads by reducing the occupancy rate of the GPU
   working queue. In this work, we make the first attempt to characterize
   pass-through GPUs running in different consolidation scenarios and
   uncover the root causes of these overheads.
   Towards this end, we set up state-of-the-art empirical platforms
   equipped with NVIDIA GRID GPUs and execute graphics intensive workloads
   running in GaaS clouds. We first demonstrate the existence of
   virtualization overheads, which can slow down the GPU command generation
   rate. Compared with a bare-metal system, the performance of pass-through
   GPUs degrades 9.0\% and 21.5\% under a single VM and 8-VMs respectively.
   We analyze the workflow of Windows display driver model and VMEXIT
   events distribution and identify four factors (i.e. HLT instruction and
   idle domain, external interrupt delivery, IOMMU, and memory subsystem)
   that contribute to the performance degradation. Our evaluation results
   show that: (1) the VM-VMM context switch caused by a HLT instruction and
   wakeup interrupt injection of an idle domain result in 66.7\% idle time
   for a single pass-through GPU; (2) the external interrupt delivery and
   tasklet processing cause additional overheads. When 8 VMs are
   consolidated, the interrupt delivery processing time and interrupt
   frequency rise 30.7\% and 127.3\%, respectively; (3) the existing IOMMU
   design scales well with pass-through GPUs; and (4) interactions of
   domain guest's software stacks impact the hardware prefetching mechanism
   so that it fails to compensate the rapidly growing LLC miss rate when
   more pass-through GPU VMs are added. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first work that characterizes pass-through GPU virtualization
   overheads and underlying reasons. This study highlights valuable
   insights for improving the performance of future virtualized GPU
   systems.}},

   architectures significantly improve functional density due to an average
   2x clock speedup compared to bit-parallel alternatives, which provides
   attractive tradeoffs for different usage scenarios. We also show that
   serial arithmetic can surprisingly provide better performance than
   bit-parallel alternatives when replication is solely limited by an area
   constraint and not application parallelism or input bandwidth. We
   evaluate this performance improvement on several highly parallel

Abstract = {{Machine learning has played an increasing important role in big data
   systems due to its capability of efficiently discovering valuable
   knowledge and hidden information. Often times big data such as
   healthcare systems or financial systems may involve with multiple
   organizations who may have different privacy policy, and may not
   explicitly share their data publicly while joint data processing may be
   a must. Thus, how to share big data among distributed data processing
   entities while mitigating privacy concerns becomes a challenging
   problem. Traditional methods rely on cryptographic tools and/ or
   randomization to preserve privacy. Unfortunately, this alone may be
   inadequate for the emerging big data systems because they are mainly
   designed for traditional small-scale data sets. In this paper, we
   propose a novel framework to achieve privacy-preserving machine learning
   where the training data are distributed and each shared data portion is
   of large volume. Specifically, we utilize the data locality property of
   Apache Hadoop architecture and only a limited number of cryptographic
   operations at the Reduce() procedures to achieve privacy-preservation.
   We show that the proposed scheme is secure in the semi-honest model and
   use extensive simulations to demonstrate its scalability and

   This paper studies the problem of anonymous authentication. Due to
   resource constraints of low-cost tags, we develop a new technique to
   generate dynamic tokens for anonymous authentication by following an
   asymmetric design principle that pushes most complexity to more powerful
   RFID readers. Instead of implementing complicated cryptographic hash
   functions, our authentication protocol only requires tags to perform
   several simple hardware-efficient operations such as bitwise XOR,
   one-bit left circular shift and bit flip. Moreover, our protocol reduces
   the communication overhead and online computation overhead to O(1) per
   authentication for both tags and readers, which compares favorably with
   the prior art.}},

   decompose input image into high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF)
   parts with bilateral filtering. Followed that, we introduced our newly
   proposed structured dictionary learning to decompose HF part into ``rain
   texture{''} details and ``non-rain geometric{''} details, where patches
   for training rain and non-rain sub-dictionaries are automatically
   selected from ``rain streaks{''} and ``non-rain geometric{''} regions.
   Finally, we combine LF part with non-rain geometric details to get
   rain-streaks-removal image. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of
   our proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{With the effort done by many researchers on 2D image quality assessment,
   the correlation between subjectivity scores in the databases and the
   objective scores obtained by current image quality metrics reaches to a
   high level. However, stereoscopic image quality metrics do not achieve a
   good performance on 3D image databases. It's important to take advantage
   of the high efficient 21) image quality metrics as well as the
   properties or stereoscopic images to form a new metric. In this paper,
   we develop a novel full -reference quality metric for stereoscopic
   images using disparity -gradient -phase -congruency similarity
   (DGP-SINI). Firstly, cyclopean images are generated using the stereo
   pairs by considering the binocular perception and combination properties
   of human visual system (HVS). Secondly, phase congruency (PC) and
   gradient magnitude (GNI) arc extracted from the original and distorted
   cyclopean images, and then two similarity indexes are computed. We also
   compute the disparity similarity which can influence stereoscopic image
   quality. Finally, three feature similarity indexes are mixed together to
   derive a single quality score. Experimental results show that the
   proposed metric can achieve a good consistency with subjective
   assessment of stereoscopic images.}},

Abstract = {{HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP), designed to address the needs of Smart Grids,
   uses the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance
   (CSMA/CA) scheme to define its multiple access control (MAC). Similar to
   the IEEE 802.11, the MAC efficiency of HPGP protocol degrades when the
   number of users increases. This paper examines a comprehensive high-load
   simulation of the IEEE 802.11 DCF backoff mechanism, compares the
   performance of this mechanism with the performance of P1901/HomePlug
   MAC, and introduces a constant contention window MAC-a novel MAC
   protocol that maximizes efficiency in a heavily-loaded smart grid
   environment. In the proposed MAC protocol, every node generates a
   run-time channel traffic estimation and an adaptive contention window
   size adjustment. We demonstrate that, whereas the HPGP's MAC efficiency
   drops down to about 15\%, the proposed adaptive MAC protocol retains its
   efficiency at about 81\% with up to 100 users.}},

Abstract = {{Crime analysis is one of the most important activities of the majority
   of the intelligent and law enforcement organizations all over the world.
   Generally they collect domestic and foreign crime related data
   (intelligence) to prevent future attacks and utilize a limited number of
   law enforcement resources in an optimum manner. A major challenge faced
   by most of the law enforcement and intelligence organizations is
   efficiently and accurately analyzing the growing volumes of crime
   related data. The vast geographical diversity and the complexity of
   crime patterns have made the analyzing and recording of crime data more
   difficult. Data mining is a powerful tool that can be used effectively
   for analyzing large databases and deriving important analytical results.
   This paper presents an intelligent crime analysis system which is
   designed to overcome the above mentioned problems. The proposed system
   is a web-based system which comprises of crime analysis techniques such
   as hotspot detection, crime comparison and crime pattern visualization.
   The proposed system consists of a rich and simplified environment that
   can be used effectively for processes of crime analysis.}},

   delay generators. In addition, the maximum measured delay range of the
   proposed design can be improved without degrading the achievabl5ve

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the majority of humans live in a world of interconnected
   cities. A contemporary city attempts to improve the quality of citizens'
   life and its economy by integrating digital infrastructures with the
   physical city (smart city). Moreover, citizens in smart cities are
   playing the central role in the majority of eBusiness models that are
   based on Collective Intelligent decision making applications. However,
   citizens avoid the participation in such applications by providing data
   because they feel that there is a risk of correlating their activities
   and data with their identities. Thus, there is a need to protect
   citizens' privacy in the territory of a smart city while encouraging
   them to participate in the establishment of new markets. In this paper,
   the encapsulation of an ABCs based authentication system in a generic
   eBusiness model that provides Collective Intelligent eServices in Smart
   Cities is presented. In the emerging eBusiness Model, the user
   privacy/anonymity has a central role which increases user incentives to

Abstract = {{The problem of estimating the complex amplitude of a signal which is
   known only to an unknown scaling factor with noise present is a well
   studied problem. Maximum likelihood (ML) and Capon estimates of the
   complex amplitude in the case where the noise vectors are circularly
   symmetric complex Gaussian with an unknown arbitrary covariance matrix
   have been proposed in previous literatures in closed form. In this
   paper, we consider the special case of the covariance matrix being
   diagonal (whose entries are still unknown). We reduce the ML estimation
   problem in this case to a non-linear optimization problem, and the
   optimal solution to the amplitude which maximizes the likelihood
   function can be obtained. We compare the performance of this method
   against the previously proposed method, which does not assume any
   structure of the covariance matrix. We show that the performance in the
   case wherein we use the fact that the covariance matrix is diagonal is
   only better in situations where the number of data samples is small.
   Both of the methods have the same Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), and both of
   them are asymptotically optimal. For large number of measurements, the
   mean squared errors (MSE) of both methods approach the CRB. Lastly, we
   provide an approximate ML solution to the problem, which has performance
   almost the same as the optimal solution, but computationally much more
   efficient.}},

Abstract = {{With the growth of cloud computing, many businesses, both small and
   large, are opting to use cloud services compelled by a great cost
   savings potential. This is especially true of public cloud computing
   which allows for quick, dynamic scalability without many overhead or
   long-term commitments. However, one of the largest dissuasions from
   using cloud services comes from the inherent and unknown danger of a
   shared platform such as the hypervisor. An attacker can attack a virtual
   machine (VM) and then go on to compromise the hypervisor. If successful,
   then all virtual machines on that hypervisor can become compromised.
   This is the problem of negative externalities, where the security of one
   player affects the security of another. This work shows that there are
   multiple Nash equilibria for the public cloud security game. It also
   demonstrates that we can allow the players' Nash equilibrium profile to
   not be dependent on the probability that the hypervisor is compromised,
   reducing the factor externality plays in calculating the equilibrium.
   Finally, by using our allocation method, the negative externality
   imposed onto other players can be brought to a minimum compared to other
   common VM allocation methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of achieving information integrity in the
   classical Wyner-Ziv lossy source coding model is considered. A discrete
   memoryless source encodes its source sequence using the standard
   Wyner-Ziv coding technique and forwards the bin index to another source
   that employs the bin index and its own correlated sequence to decode the
   first source's sequence. There is an adversary who may arbitrarily
   modify the bin index sent to the decoder. It is assumed the adversary
   may base the attack on the true bin index, its own sequence (which may
   be correlated to both the encoder and decoder sequences) as well as the
   known codebook used by the sources. It is shown that a
   non-simulatability condition on the joint source distribution is
   necessary and sufficient to achieve information integrity. However, the
   additional requirement of information integrity may incur a penalty on
   the rate-distortion performance.}},

   the cross-coupled latches can improve supply noise immunity and
   frequency stability compared to a simple inverter design. A Five-stage
   RO is designed and implemented as a test vehicle which shows > 40\%
   improvement in reducing supply noise sensitivity with a maximum

Abstract = {{Increasing minority representation in the field of Computer Science has
   been a focal point of concern. Outreach activities, after-school
   programs, and summer camps are common efforts that have been employed in
   an attempt to reverse this trend of underrepresentation in the field.
   There have also been instances in which these efforts were found to be
   successful {[}1, 2, 3, 4].
   However, these efforts appear to occur more often in urban areas of the
   United States. Meanwhile, there are rural areas that contain a
   substantial representation of minorities, in particular
   African-Americans. In states like Alabama and Mississippi, for instance,
   51.4\% and 72.4\% of its residents respectively live in rural areas
   {[}5]. Yet, both states also possess a denser population of
   African-Americans as residents than the national average {[}6].
   Employing efforts of a similar prevalence seen within urban areas
   towards rural areas could further assist the cause of alleviating
   minority underrepresentation in computer science.
   This poster details an outreach effort that was conducted on a group of
   African-American juniors at a rural high school ( named Aliceville High
   School) in Pickens County, Alabama. According to the U.S. Census Bureau,
   Pickens County is composed of similar to 20,000 residents in which
   similar to 41\% are African-American {[}6]. Furthermore, the student
   representation at Aliceville High School is predominantly
   African-American. Using an interactive robotic environment called PREOP
   ( Providing Robotic Experiences through Object-based Programming), the
   objective was to expose these students to robotic programming with the
   intent of encouraging and engaging them to the idea of viewing computer
   science as a possible career choice. Upon the completion of this
   outreach, it was found that nearly half of the students exhibited some
   level of interest for pursuing computer science as a potential career
   choice.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike enrollment in undergraduate computer science degree programs,
   there are no gender or ethnic imbalances in K-12 enrollment. While such
   disparities are seen at particular schools, such disparities do not
   exist in disciplinary courses such as history, math, or science where
   all students are required to take these courses. This paper discusses an
   approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the
   integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster
   proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical
   thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS
   integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a
   project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that
   leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the
   creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on
   a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist
   learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and
   technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that
   students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the
   creation of their mobile app.}},

   density has a strong influence over the plating rate, surface roughness,
   grain size, and order parameter. However, current density does not
   strongly affect the atomic composition of the plated film and only
   modestly influences the magnetic properties, namely coercivity. The
   films exhibit quasi-isotropic magnetic properties with the best results
   for a sample plated at 100 mA/cm(2), yielding H-ci = 900 kA/m, and

   frequency reached up to 30 Hz. The wide angle was achieved because of
   the angular increase of the ``Snell's Window{''} effect and the large
   mechanical tilt angle (+/-18 degrees) of the MEMS mirror as well. The
   power consumption is 9.9 mW/degrees when working in air and 11.7

Abstract = {{This paper reports a fast, robust electrothermal bimorph micromirror
   with a symmetric inverse-series-connected bimorph actuator. The actuator
   is made up of symmetric Cu-W bimorphs with high sensitivity and fast
   thermal response. A unique backside DRIE release process is developed to
   keep the mirror surface intact during release. The micromirror is able
   to perform both piston and tip-tilt motion. A maximum piston
   displacement of 169 mu m is achieved with lateral shift less than 1.5 mu
   m at the driving voltage of only 2.3 V. The maximum optical angle
   achieved is +/- 13 degrees at 2.3 V. This mirror gives fast thermal
   response of less than 7.5 ms. The resonances of the piston and tip-tilt
   modes are 1.58 kHz and 2.74 kHz, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computer-controlled multidirectional UV-LED
   (ultraviolet light-emitting diode) lithography system for
   three-dimensional (3-D) microfabrication, introducing the concept of
   CNC-lithography. The system comprises a switchable, movable UV-LED array
   as a light source and a motorized tilt-rotational sample holder, in
   which each system element is computer-controlled. This approach enables
   a relatively small size and overall portability of the system. The
   proposed system has two unique features; (1) the movable LED array
   improves the uniform UV light distribution over the substrate area; and
   (2) the switchable function of the LEDs is synchronized with the
   movement of the tilt-rotational sample holder, enabling the creation of
   3-D patterns of substantial complexity. Unlike layer-by-layer additive
   approaches such as stereolithography, the CNC-lithography system can
   form fine shapes with no layering artifacts in a batch-compatible
   manner, at the expense of true arbitrariness of formable shape. When
   compared to conventional inclined lithography, CNC-lithography greatly
   increases ease of fabrication by eliminating multiple manual exposure
   steps and also enables the fabrication of new 3-D structures that would
   have been challenging to implement previously. Demonstration
   lithographic shapes, including a micro-'pipe,' a micro-'hi,' a
   micro-'Calla lily,' and a micro-'cyborg', are fabricated to illustrate
   the range of the process.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMP) utilized in reconfigurable structures have
   the potential to be used in a variety of settings. This paper is
   primarily concerned with the use of Veriflex-S shape memory polymer and
   bi-directional carbon fiber in a unimorph actuator configuration. One of
   the major deficiencies of SMP unimorphs is the permanent set
   (unrecovered shape) after a single or multiple temperature cycle(s). The
   novel concept of incorporating transverse curvature in the composite
   substrate, similar to that of an extendable tape measurer, was proposed
   to improve the shape recovery. A set of experiments was designed to
   investigate the influence of transverse curvature, the relative widths
   of SMP and composite substrates, and shape memory polymer thickness on
   actuator recoverability after multiple thermomechanical cycles. Flat
   carbon fiber and shape memory polymer unimorph actuators were evaluated
   for performance versus actuators of increasing transverse curvature.
   Digital image correlation was implemented to quantify the out-of-plane
   deflection of the unimorph composite actuators (UCAs) during the
   actuation cycle. Experimental results indicate that an actuator with
   transverse curvature significantly reduces the residual deformation
   while increasing the shape memory recoverability which could be further
   tailored to enhance the performance of shape memory polymers in
   reconfigurable arrangements.}},

   Temperature-independent de-trapping was observed in GaN HEMT dynamic
   on-resistance measurement. Similar results were also observed by Dr.
   Jesus del Alamo's group at MIT. The origin of the temperature
   independent de-trapping is still unclear. It is speculated by Jesus del
   Alamo's group that this temperature-independent de trapping happens
   through electrons tunneling from the interface layer to the channel
   instead of through thermal activation. Our experimental results indicate
   that electrons tunnel from the interface layer into gate may also be
   possible, especially for those traps located near the gate. A quantum
   mechanical model based on Fermi's Golden rule is developed. The modeling
   result agrees with the experiment and helps to support our theory of the
   fast temperature- independent de-trapping process}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a low-power wireless climate monitoring system
   with an RFID security access feature for mosquito and pathogen research.
   Mosquito-borne diseases, which are critical threats to human health,
   include malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, and West Nile Virus. The
   wireless monitoring system provides environmental data such as
   temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. The measured data
   can be used to predict the habitat of mosquitoes and be used to
   recommend the amount and location of pesticide application. This paper
   describes the design and implementation of the low-power wireless
   climate monitoring system with various environmental sensors, 2.4-GHz
   wireless module, RFID reader for the security access control, audio
   system, and a solar charger system. The measured data was received and
   processed by a custom Windows application. The measured data was
   available through both desktop and mobile internet browsers and a mobile
   android application. Five wireless climate monitoring systems were used
   for multiple field tests. The analysis example of the pseudo climate
   data for the reduced use of pesticides is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Energy storage devices (batteries) have shown great promise in
   eliminating supply/demand power mismatch and reducing energy/power cost
   in green datacenters. These important components progressively age due
   to irregular usage patterns, which result in less effective capacity and
   even pose serious threat to server availability. Nevertheless, prior
   proposals largely ignore the aging issue of batteries or simply use
   ad-hoc discharge capping to extend their lifetime. To fill this critical
   void, we thoroughly investigate battery aging on a heavily instrumented
   prototype over an observation period of six months. We propose battery
   anti-aging treatment (BAAT), a novel framework for hiding, reducing, and
   planning the battery aging effects. We show that BAAT can extend battery
   lifetime by 69\%. It enables datacenters to maximally utilize energy
   storage resources to enhance availability and boost performance.
   Moreover, it reduces 26\% battery cost and allows datacenters to
   economically scale in the big data era.}},

   Information-theoretic estimators of uncertainty allow our method to

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of data aggregation using two aggregators. We
   assume that the source racks can split the data they need to send to the
   aggregators across multiple paths. We show that obtaining a topology
   that minimizes aggregation time is NP-hard for k = 2, 3, 4, where k the
   degree of ToR (top-of-rack) switches. We also show that an optimal
   topology can be computed in polynomial time for k = 5 and 6 and
   conjecture this to be the case when k > 6 as well. Experimental results
   show that, when k = 6, our topology optimization algorithm reduces the
   aggregation time by as much as 83.3\% and reduces total network traffic
   by as much as 99.5\% relative to the torus heuristic, proposed by {[}1].}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimal multi-step toll design problem for the
   bottleneck model with general user heterogeneity. The design model is
   formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints
   (MPEC), which is NP-hard due to non-convexity in both the objective
   function and the feasible set. An analytical method is proposed to solve
   the MPEC by decomposing it into smaller and easier quadratic programs,
   each corresponding to a unique departure order of different user
   classes. The quadratic programs are defined on a polyhedral set, which
   makes it easier to identify a local optimum. Importantly, each quadratic
   program is constrained by a set of linear feasibility cuts that define
   the presence of each user class in the arrival window. We prove that the
   proposed method ensures global optimality provided that each quadratic
   program can be solved globally. To obviate enumerating all departure
   orders, a heuristic method is developed to navigate through the solution
   space by using the multipliers associated with the feasibility cuts.
   Numerical experiments are conducted on several small examples to
   validate the proposed methodology. These experiments show that the
   proposed heuristic method is effective in finding near-optimal solution
   within a relatively small number of iterations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This chapter aims at developing a taxonomic framework to classify the
   studies on the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). The FJSP is
   a generalization of the classical job shop scheduling problem (JSP),
   which is one of the oldest NP-hard problems. Although various solution
   methodologies have been developed to obtain good solutions in reasonable
   time for FSJPs with different objective functions and constraints, no
   study which systematically reviews the FJSP literature has been
   encountered. In the proposed taxonomy, the type of study, type of
   problem, objective, methodology, data characteristics, and benchmarking
   are the main categories. In order to verify the proposed taxonomy, a
   variety of papers from the literature are classified. Using this
   classification, several inferences are drawn and gaps in the FJSP
   literature are specified. With the proposed taxonomy, the aim is to
   develop a framework for a broad view of the FJSP literature and
   construct a basis for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter investigates a novel multi-objective model of a batch

   objective is to minimize both the total completion time of the jobs and

   proposed algorithm a novel Pareto frontier adjustment strategy is
   designed and proven to improve the convergence of solutions and increase

Abstract = {{To effectively optimize applications for emerging heterogeneous
   architectures, compilers and synthesis tools must perform the
   challenging task of estimating the performance of different
   implementations and optimizations for different numbers and types of
   computational resources. Many performance-prediction techniques exist,
   but those approaches are specific to particular resources or
   applications, and are often not capable of prediction for all
   combinations of inputs. In this paper, we introduce an approach to
   multi-parameter performance modeling based on sampling and
   interpolation. This approach can be used in conjunction with execution
   time data, simulated or observed, to quickly perform performance
   estimation for any function, on any resource, with any combination of
   inputs. By evaluating a Kriging-based interpolator on a variety of
   functions and computational resources, we determine bounds on the
   accuracy of this approach, and show that an interpolation-based approach
   utilizing Kriging can effectively model execution time for most
   applications. We also show that Kriging is a highly effective
   interpolation technique for execution time, and can be up to four orders
   of magnitude more accurate than nearest-neighbor interpolation or radial
   basis function interpolation.}},

Abstract = {{Space computing systems commonly use field-programmable gate arrays to
   provide fault tolerance by applying triple modular redundancy (TMR) to
   existing register-transfer-level (RTL) code. Although effective, this
   approach has a 3x area overhead that can be prohibitive for many designs
   that often allocate resources before considering effects of redundancy.
   Although a designer could modify existing RTL code to reduce resource
   usage, such a process is time consuming and error prone. Integrating
   redundancy into high-level synthesis is a more attractive approach that
   enables synthesis to rapidly explore different tradeoffs at no cost to
   the designer. In this paper, we introduce a scheduling and binding
   heuristic for high-level synthesis that explores tradeoffs between
   resource usage, latency, and the amount of redundancy. In many cases, an
   application will not require 100\% error correction, which enables
   significant flexibility for scheduling and binding to reduce resources.
   Even for applications that require 100\% error correction, our heuristic
   is able to explore solutions that sacrifice latency for reduced
   resources, and typically save up to 47\% when relaxing the latency up to
   2x. When the error constraint is reduced to 70\%, our heuristic achieves
   typical resource savings ranging from 18\% to 49\% when relaxing the
   latency up to 2x, with a maximum of 77\%. Even when comparing with
   optimized RTL designs, our heuristic uses up to 61\% fewer resources
   than TMR.}},

   single gene knockdown RNAi experiments have been proposed in recent
   years. All of these studies assume that the RNAi data is complete.
   However, RNAi experiments are usually noisy and more importantly have a
   considerable amount of missing data (i.e., a subset of the gene
   knockdowns is missing). In this paper, we address the signaling network
   construction problem with incomplete RNAi data. We develop two new
   methods for constructing a network topology which is closest to the
   reference network and consistent with the given incomplete RNAi data.
   Our experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that these
   methods produce accurate results and they are efficient. For real Wnt

Abstract = {{Performance and energy efficiency are major concerns in cloud computing
   data centers. More often, they carry conflicting requirements making
   optimization a challenge. Further complications arise when heterogeneous
   hardware and data center management technologies are combined. For
   example, heterogeneous hardware such as General Purpose Graphics
   Processing Units (GPGPUs) improve performance at the cost of greater
   power consumption while virtualization technologies improve resource
   management and utilization at the cost of degraded performance.
   In this paper, we focus on exploiting heterogeneity introduced by GPUs
   to reduce power budget requirements for servers while maintaining
   performance. To maintain or improve overall server performance at
   reduced power budget, we propose two enhancements: (a) We borrow power
   from co-located multi-threaded virtual machines (VMs) and reallocate it
   to GPU VMs. (b) To compensate multi-threaded VMs and re-boost their
   performance, we propose to borrow virtual computing resources from GPU
   VMs and reallocate them to CPU VMs.
   Combining the two techniques minimizes server power budget while
   maintaining overall server performance. Our results show that server
   power budget can be reduced by almost 18\% at the average cost of 13\%
   performance degradation per virtual machine. In addition, reallocating
   virtual resources improves the performance of multi-threaded
   applications by 30\% without affecting GPU applications. Combining both
   techniques reduces server energy consumption by 47 \% with minimum
   performance degradation.}},

   timing errors. To improve the accuracy of lax synchronized simulations,
   we propose an error compensation technique, which leverages prediction
   methods to compensate for simulated time deviations due to timing
   errors. The rationale of our approach is that, in the simulated
   multi-core processor systems the errors typically propagate via the
   delays of some pivotal events that connect subsystem models across
   different hierarchies. By predicting delays based on the simulation
   results of the preceding pivotal events, our techniques can eliminate
   errors from the predicted delays before they propagate to the models at
   higher hierarchies, thereby effectively improving the simulation
   accuracy. Since the predictions don't have any constraint on
   synchronizations, our approach largely maintains the scalability of lax
   synchronization schemes. Furthermore, our proposed mechanism is
   orthogonal to other parallel simulation techniques and can be used in
   conjunction with them. Experimental results show error compensation
   improves the accuracy of lax synchronized simulations by 60.2\% and
   achieves 98.2\% accuracy when combined with an enhanced lax
   synchronization.}},

Abstract = {{Per-flow traffic measurement, which is to count the number of packets
   for each active flow during a certain measurement period, has many
   applications in usage accounting, traffic engineering, service provision
   and anomaly detection. In order to maintain the high throughput of
   routers or switchers, the per-flow traffic measurement module should use
   high-bandwidth SRAM that allows fast memory accesses. Due to the limited
   SRAM space, exact counting, which requires to keep a counter for each
   flow, does not scale to large networks consisting of numerous flows.
   Some recent work takes a different path to accurately estimate the flow
   sizes using counter architectures that can fit into tight SRAM. However,
   existing counter architectures have some limitations, either still
   requiring considerable SRAM space, or having a very small estimation
   range. In this paper, we design a scalable counter architecture Counter
   Tree which leverages a two-dimensional counter sharing scheme to achieve
   far better memory efficiency and significantly extend estimation range.
   The extensive experiments with real network trace demonstrate that our
   counter architecture can produce accurate estimates for flows of all
   sizes even under a very tight memory space, e.g., 2 bits per flow.}},

Abstract = {{Searching for widespread events in large networks is a fundamental
   function that underlies many important applications of distributed
   anomaly detection, traffic measurement, online data mining, etc. This
   function can be performed by a cooperative monitoring system consisting
   of a central coordinator and a number of monitors that are deployed at a
   set of vantage points. We formulate a network primitive function, called
   multi-monitor joint detection, which is to find the common events
   observed by all or a given subset of monitors during each measurement
   period. It is a challenging problem because large-scale cooperative
   monitoring can generate tremendous communication overhead. Therefore, it
   is critical to design a solution for multi-monitor joint detection which
   controls communication overhead to a low level. We thoroughly examine
   existing techniques that may be applied, and identify their performance
   limitations. We then propose two new techniques, called combinable
   filters and progressive filtering, which address the performance
   limitations from different angles. We formally prove the correctness of
   our new solutions based on a probabilistic joint detection model.
   Numerical evaluation shows that our best solution achieves an overhead
   reduction in the range of 63\% to 91\% over the Bloom filter solution
   under various simulation settings when the number of monitors is 10 or
   more.}},

Abstract = {{Radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies are making their way
   into retail products, library books, debit cards, passports, driver
   licenses, car plates, medical devices, etc. The widespread use of tags
   in traditional ways of deployment raises a privacy concern: They make
   their carriers trackable. To protect the privacy of the tag carriers, we
   need to invent new mechanisms that keep the usefulness of tags while
   doing so anonymously. Many tag applications such as toll payment require
   authentication. This paper studies the problem of anonymous
   authentication. Since low-cost tags have extremely limited hardware
   resource, we propose an asymmetric design principle that pushes most
   complexity to more powerful RFID readers. Thus, we develop a lightweight
   technique that generates dynamic tokens for anonymous authentication.
   Instead of implementing complicated and hardware-intensive cryptographic
   hash functions, our authentication protocol only requires tags to
   perform several simple and hardware-efficient operations such as bitwise
   XOR, one-bit left circular shift, and bit flip. The theoretic analysis
   and randomness tests demonstrate that our protocol can ensure the
   privacy of the tags. Moreover, our protocol reduces the communication
   overhead and online computation overhead to O(1) per authentication for
   both tags and readers, which compares favorably with the prior art.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies allow
   tags to communicate with a reader but not among themselves. By enabling
   peer communications between nearby tags, the emerging networked tags
   represent a fundamental enhancement to today's RFID systems. They
   support applications in previously infeasible scenarios where the
   readers cannot cover all tags due to cost or physical limitations. This
   paper is the first study on identifying state-free networked tags, which
   is a basic, fundamental function for most tagged systems. To prolong the
   lifetime of networked tags and make identification protocols scalable to
   large systems, energy efficiency and time efficiency are most critical.
   Our investigation reveals that the traditional contention-based protocol
   design will incur too much energy overhead in multihop tag systems.
   Surprisingly, a reader-coordinated design that significantly serializes
   tag transmissions performs much better. In addition, we show that load
   balancing is important in reducing the worst-case energy cost to the
   tags, and we present a solution based on serial numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Designed with the goal of mimicking key features of real HPC workloads,
   mini-apps have become an important tool for co-design. An investigation
   of mini-app behavior can provide system designers with insight into the
   impact of architectures, programming models, and tools on application
   performance. Mini-apps can also serve as a platform for fast algorithm
   design space exploration, allowing the application developers to
   evaluate their design choices before significantly redesigning the
   application codes. Consequently, it is prudent to develop a mini-app
   alongside the full blown application it is intended to represent. In
   this paper, we present CMT-bone a mini-app for the compressible
   multiphase turbulence (CMT) application, CMT-nek, being developed to
   extend the physics of the CESAR Nek5000 application code. CMT-bone
   consists of the most computationally intensive kernels of CMT-nek and
   the communication operations involved in nearest-neighbor updates and
   vector reductions. The mini-app represents CMT-nek in its most mature
   state and going forward it will be developed in parallel with the
   CMT-nek application to keep pace with key new performance impacting
   changes. We describe these kernels and discuss the role that CMT-bone
   has played in enabling interdisciplinary collaboration by allowing
   application developers to work with computer scientists on performance
   optimization on current architectures and performance analysis on
   notional future systems.}},

Abstract = {{Sparsely-activated time series are found in many physical systems. In
   these cases, the signals can be approximated by convolution of sparse
   sources with a set of shift-invariant filters. When there is access to
   only one sensor, such that there is a single observation signal,
   identifying the source signals appears to be an ill-posed problem, but
   for very sparse sources it is still possible to learn the system. We
   discuss analysis techniques for sparsely activated signals, which
   retrieve sparse sources given the filters, and identify conditions when
   algorithms based on independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse
   coding can blindly estimate filters from a single noisy time-series.
   Many qualitative results have been made for learning shift-invariant
   bases on natural signals, but for a thorough understanding of the effect
   of sparsity, we quantitatively analyze results on synthetic examples,
   comparing how ICA and shift-invariant sparse coding approaches perform
   for multiple-source blind system identification.}},

Abstract = {{The use of distances based on optimal transportation has recently shown
   promise for discrimination of power spectra. In particular, spectral
   estimation methods based on l(1) regularization as well as covariance
   based methods can be shown to be robust with respect to such distances.
   These transportation distances provide a geometric framework where
   geodesics corresponds to smooth transition of spectral mass, and have
   been useful for tracking.
   In this paper we investigate the use of these distances for automatic
   target recognition. We study the use of the Monge-Kantorovich distance
   compared to the standard l(2) distance for classifying civilian vehicles
   based on SAR images. We use a version of the Monge-Kantorovich distance
   that applies also for the case where the spectra may have different
   total mass, and we formulate the optimization problem as a minimum flow
   problem that can be computed using efficient algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) approach to
   repairing lesions via microstimulation in a biomimetic spiking neural
   network of sensorimotor cortex. The fundamental challenge of designing
   neuroprosthetics and brain machine interfaces (BMIs) is the decoding of
   electrical activity of neurons and behavior. For injured or damaged
   brain, intracranial stimulation has the potential to modulate neural
   activity to match meaningful and natural response or behavior. In order
   to optimize the microstimulation sequences, we construct an inverse
   model of the target system. However, to obtain sufficient learning data,
   the neural system must be stimulated or probed extensively. For real
   brains, this is especially challenging and often unfeasible. Here, we
   demonstrate that by applying KAF to a biomimetic brain and realistic
   virtual musculoskeletal model, we can repair simulated lesion and drive
   a virtual arm to perform the correct motor task.}},

   serious drawbacks for the health as childhood leukemia and; cancer.
   In this context, in order to guarantee people health, it is crucial that
   utilities and other stakeholders can attend in a suitable way to these
   worries, being important for such, levels of existing electromagnetic
   fields in their infrastructure analysis. The main goal of this study is
   to determine and analyze the EMF exposure levels of four real-life

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Optimum-Path
   Forest (OPF) based approach for Nontechnical Losses (NTL) detection. NTL
   decrease the economic efficiency of distribution utilities, which harms
   the entire society since energy prices increase as a consequence.
   Pattern Recognition based approaches have been applied to identify these
   losses so that the problems related to NTL may be corrected through
   on-site inspections. One of the main characteristics of NTL is the
   decrease in the customer's measured monthly-consumed energy, caused by
   frauds or failure of the energy meter, which is called ``consumption
   step{''}. This record of kWh consumption can be treated as a time-series
   and then benefit from the knowledge available in this area. In this
   paper DCT and OPF were used as a means of implementing automatic feature
   extraction. The proposed method was compared with an OPF based approach
   previously proposed by the authors. Test results show that feature
   extraction using DCT can provide a more compact and efficient way of
   representing data, improving the performance of previously developed
   methods by the authors.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray tomography is a promising technique that can provide micron level,
   internal structure, and three dimensional (3D) information of an
   integrated circuit (IC) component without the need for serial sectioning
   or decapsulation. This is especially useful for counterfeit IC detection
   as demonstrated by recent work. Although the components remain
   physically intact during tomography, the effect of radiation on the
   electrical functionality is not yet fully investigated. In this paper we
   analyze the impact of X-ray tomography on the reliability of ICs with
   different fabrication technologies. We perform a 3D imaging using an
   advanced X-ray machine on Intel flash memories, Macronix flash memories,
   Xilinx Spartan 3 and Spartan 6 FPGAs. Electrical functionalities are
   then tested in a systematic procedure after each round of tomography to
   estimate the impact of X-ray on Flash erase time, read margin, and
   program operation, and the frequencies of ring oscillators in the FPGAs.
   A major fmding is that erase times for flash memories of older
   technology are significantly degraded when exposed to tomography,
   eventually resulting in failure. However, the flash and Xilinx FPGAs of
   newer technologies seem less sensitive to tomography, as only minor
   degradations are observed. Further, we did not identify permanent
   failures for any chips in the time needed to perform tomography for
   counterfeit detection (approximately 2 hours).}},

Abstract = {{Reverse engineering of electronics systems is performed for various
   reasons ranging from honest ones such as failure analysis, fault
   isolation, trustworthiness verification, obsolescence management, etc.
   to dishonest ones such as cloning, counterfeiting, identification of
   vulnerabilities, development of attacks, etc. Regardless of the goal, it
   is imperative that the research community understands the requirements,
   complexities, and limitations of reverse engineering. Until recently,
   the reverse ``engineering was considered as destructive, time consuming,
   and prohibitively expensive, thereby restricting its application to a
   few remote cases. However, the advents of advanced characterization and
   imaging tools and software have counteracted this point of view. In this
   paper, we show how X-ray micro-tomography imaging can be combined with
   advanced 3D image processing and analysis to facilitate the automation
   of reverse engineering, and thereby lowering the associated time and
   cost. In this paper, we demonstrate our proposed process on two
   different printed circuit boards (PCBs). The first PCB is a four-layer
   custom designed board while the latter is a more complex commercial
   system. Lessons learned from this effort can be used to both develop
   advanced countermeasures and establish a more efficient workflow for
   instances where reverse engineering is deemed necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Usage of mobile wireless Internet has grown very fast in recent years.
   This radical change in availability of Internet has led to communication
   of big amount of data over mobile networks raising new challenges and
   opportunities for modeling of mobile Internet characteristics. While the
   traditional approach toward network modeling suggests finding a generic
   traffic model for the whole network, in this paper, we show that this
   approach does not provide enough accuracy for big mobile networks. We
   show that user interest acquired based on accessed domains and visited
   locations has a significant effect on traffic characteristics of big
   mobile networks. Our case study based on a big dataset including
   billions of netflow record collected from a campus-wide wireless mobile
   network reveals the fact that domains and locations showing similar
   point of interests (e.g. domains of news agencies or locations of
   fraternities) mostly follow similar types of traffic distributions. For
   this purpose, we utilize a novel graph-based approach based on KS-test.
   We also show that interest-based modeling of big mobile networks based
   on visited domains and locations can significantly improve the accuracy
   and reduce the KS distances by factor of 5 comparing to the generic
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{In the online job recruitment domain, accurate classification of jobs
   and resumes to occupation categories is important for matching job
   seekers with relevant jobs. An example of such a job title
   classification system is an automatic text document classification
   system that utilizes machine learning. Machine learning-based document
   classification techniques for images, text and related entities have
   been well researched in academia and have also been successfully applied
   in many industrial settings. In this paper we present Carotene, a
   machine learning-based semi-supervised job title classification system
   that is currently in production at CareerBuilder. Carotene leverages a
   varied collection of classification and clustering tools and techniques
   to tackle the challenges of designing a scalable classification system
   for a large taxonomy of job categories. It encompasses these techniques
   in a cascade classifier architecture. We first present the architecture
   of Carotene, which consists of a two-stage coarse and fine level
   classifier cascade. We compare Carotene to an early version that was
   based on a flat classifier architecture and also compare and contrast
   Carotene with a third party occupation classification system. The paper
   concludes by presenting experimental results on real world industrial
   data using both machine learning metrics and actual user experience
   surveys.}},

Abstract = {{A novel design of a composite circular tube possessing bend-twist
   coupling at the structural level is presented. When subjected to a
   bending moment the tube undergoes twisting in addition to bending.
   Conversely a torque results in bending in addition to rotation. This
   coupling causes the shear center of the cross section to be away from
   the center of the tube. An analytical model is proposed and closed-form
   equations for shear center distance are derived for both straight and
   tapered composite tubes. The results are verified by performing finite
   element analysis. Special tubes were fabricated and tested to measure
   the shear center distance. The agreement in results is excellent. It is
   found that the location of the shear center is independent of the shaft
   radius but proportional to the length of the tube.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for low-cost immunoassays that measure the presence and
   concentration of multiple harmful agents in one device. Currently,
   comparable immunoassays employ a one-analyte-per-test format that is
   time consuming and not cost effective for the requirement of detecting
   multiple analytes in a single sample. For instance, if a spectrum of
   harmful agents, including E. coli 0157, cholera toxin, and Salmonella
   typhimurium, should be simultaneously monitored in foods and drinking
   water, then a one-analyte-per-test would be inefficient. This work
   demonstrates a platform capable of simultaneous detection of multiple
   analytes in a single, low-cost, microvalve array-enabled multiplexed
   immunoassay. This multiplexed immunoassay platform is demonstrated in a
   prototype COC (cyclic olefin copolymer) device with a 2x3 array in which
   6 analytes can be detected simultaneously. In order to contain and
   regulate the flow of reagents in the multichannel device, an array of
   microfluidic valves actuated by a thermally expandable material and
   microfabricated resistors have been developed to direct the flow to the
   necessary assay sites. The microvalve-based immunoassay is shown to be
   reliable, easy to operate, and compatible with large-scale integration.
   The all-plastic microvalves use paraffin wax as the thermally sensitive
   material which drastically reduces power consumption by latching upon
   closing so that pulsed power is required only to close and latch the
   microvalve until it is necessary to re-open the valve. The multiplexed
   detection scheme has been demonstrated by using three proteins, C
   reactive protein (CRP) and transferrin, both of which are biomarkers
   associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) as the negative control. Since there are no external bulky
   pneumatic accessories required to operate/latch the microvalves in the
   device, this compact, thermally actuated and latching microvalve-enabled
   multiplexed immunoassay has the potential to realize a portable, low
   power, battery operated microfluidic device for biological assays.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an alternative absorber design suitable for the
   plate-and-frame absorber configuration is introduced. The design
   utilizes a fin structure installed on a vertical flat plate to produce a
   uniform solution film and minimize its thickness and to continuously
   interrupt the boundary layer. Using numerical models supported by
   experiments employing dye visualization, the suitable fin spacing and
   size and wettability are determined. The solution flow thickness is
   measured using the laser confocal displacement measurement technique.
   The new surface structure is tested in an experimental absorption
   system. An absorption rate as high as 6x10(-3) kg/m(2)s at a driving
   pressure potential of 700 Pa is achieved, which is considerably high in
   comparison with conventional absorption systems. The effect of water
   vapor pressure, solution flow rate, solution inlet concentration,
   cooling water inlet temperature and solution inlet temperature on the
   absorption rate is also investigated. The proposed design provides a
   potential framework for development of highly compact absorption
   refrigeration systems.}},

Abstract = {{The equivalent pore radius (i.e. capillary radius) and contact angle
   determine the capillary pressure generated in a porous medium. The most
   common method to determine these two parameters is through measurement
   of the capillary pressure generated by a test liquid and a reference
   liquid (i.e. a liquid with near-zero contact angle). The rate of rise
   technique commonly used to determine the capillary pressure results in
   significant uncertainties. In this study, we utilize our recently
   developed technique for independent measurement of the capillary
   pressure and permeability to determine the equivalent capillary radii
   and contact angle of water within micropillar wick structures. In this
   method, the experimentally measured dryout threshold of a wick structure
   at different wicking lengths is fit to Darcy's law to extract the
   capillary pressure generated by the test liquid. The equivalent
   capillary radii of different wick geometries are determined by measuring
   the capillary pressures generated using n-hexane as the working fluid.
   It is found that the equivalent capillary radius is dependent on the
   diameter of pillars as well as the spacing between pillars. The
   equivalent capillary radii of micropillar wicks determined using the new
   method are found to be up to 7 times greater than the current
   geometry-based first order estimates. The contact angle subtended by
   water at the walls of the micropillars was determined by measuring the
   capillary pressure generated by water within the arrays and the measured
   capillary radii for the different geometries. This contact angle was
   determined to be 52.7 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue cracking of asphalt mixtures is highly dependent on ageing.
   Using larger amounts of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) presents a
   concern that the resultant mixtures may be prone to fatigue cracking
   because of the aged binder in the RAP. Several studies have indicated
   that asphalt rejuvenators can allow more aged binder to be incorporated
   into asphalt mixtures. The four-point flexural beam fatigue test, HMA
   (hot-mix asphalt) fracture mechanics model, simplified viscoelastic
   continuum damage model, and the semi-circular bending test were used to
   evaluate the effect of ageing on the fatigue characteristics of high RAP
   mixtures modified with rejuvenators. The results from these tests were
   compared to see if they provided similar performance trends. The results
   indicated that the long-term ageing used in this study did not have a
   significant effect on the fatigue characteristics of the high RAP
   mixture with and without rejuvenators. Comparison of the fatigue tests
   did not show universal agreement.}},

   snapshot-weighted proper orthogonal decomposition/discrete empirical
   interpolation. That is, through collected observations, we construct and
   reduce empirical dynamical systems that characterize the evolution of
   the phenomena and determine those locations that can be visited and
   sensed to improve the model quality. To showcase the effectiveness of
   our contributions, we apply them to the tasks of estimating the
   concentration and location of plumes in two-dimensional environments.}},

Abstract = {{A new dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS) is proposed in this
   article to dynamically estimate a concentration plume and to plan
   optimal paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with
   environmental sensors. The proposed DDDAS dynamically incorporates
   measured data from UAVs into an environmental simulation while
   simultaneously steering measurement processes. The main idea is to
   employ a few time-evolving proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes
   to simulate a coupled linear system, and to simultaneously measure plume
   concentration and plume source distribution via a reduced Kalman filter.
   In order to maximize the information gain, UAVs are dynamically driven
   to hot spots chosen based on the POD modes using a greedy algorithm. We
   demonstrate the efficacy of the data assimilation and control strategies
   in a numerical simulation and a field test.}},

Abstract = {{Face occlusion is one of the most challenging problems for robust face
   recognition. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely used
   in local feature extraction for computer vision. However, standard NMF
   is not robust to occlusion. In this paper, we propose a robust
   discriminative representation learning method under nonnegative patch
   alignment, which can take account of the geometric structure and
   discriminative information simultaneously. Specifically, we utilize
   linear reconstruction coefficients to characterize local geometric
   structure and maximize the pairwise fisher distance to improve the
   separability of different classes. The reconstruction errors are
   measured with weighted distance, and the weights for each pixel are
   learned adaptively with our proposed update rule. Experimental results
   on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the learned representation is more
   discriminative and robust than most of the existing methods in occluded
   face recognition.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the microscale physics of heat transfer processes in
   flow boiling of FC-72 in a single microchannel. Experimental results
   discussed in this paper provide new physical insight on the nature of
   heat transfer events. The study is enabled through development of a
   device with a composite substrate that consists of a high thermal
   conductivity material coated by a thin layer of a low thermal
   conductivity material with embedded temperature sensors. This novel
   arrangement enables measurement of local heat flux with a spatial
   resolution of 40-65 mu m and a temporal resolution of 50 mu s. The
   device generates isolated bubbles from a 300 nm in diameter artificial
   cavity fabricated at the center of a pulsed function micro-heater.
   Analysis of the temperature and heat flux data along with synchronized
   images of bubbles show that four mechanisms of heat transfer are active
   as a bubble grows and flows through the channel. These mechanisms of
   heat transfer are 1) microlayer evaporation, 2) interline evaporation,
   3) transient conduction, and 4) micro-convection. The magnitude and time
   period of activation of these mechanisms of heat transfer are determined
   and their characteristics are discussed in details.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, development of a novel system for combined water heating,
   dehumidification, and space cooling is discussed. The system absorbs
   water vapor from an air stream into an absorbent. The latent heat of
   absorption, released into the absorbent, is transferred into the process
   water that cools the absorbent. The solution is regenerated in the
   desorber, where it is heated by a heating fluid. The water vapor
   generated in the desorber is condensed and its heat of phase change is
   also transferred to the process water. The condensed water is then used
   in an evaporative cooling process to cool the dehumidified air exiting
   the absorber. Essentially, this open-absorption cycle collects space
   sensible heat and transfers it to hot water. Another novel feature of
   the cycle is recovery of the heat energy from the solution exiting the
   desorber by heat exchange with process water rather than with the
   solution exiting the absorber. This approach has enabled heating the
   process water from an inlet temperature of 15 degrees C to 57 degrees C
   (conforming to the required DOE building hot water standard) and compact
   fabrication of the absorber, solution heat exchanger, and desorber in
   plate and frame configuration. The system under development currently
   has a water heating capacity of 1.5 kW and a thermal. coefficient of
   performance (COP) of 1.45.}},

Title = {{High-field magnetic resonance imaging of the human temporal lobe}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{58-68}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emerging high-field diffusion weighted MR imaging protocols,
   along with tractography, can elucidate microstructural changes
   associated with brain disease at the sub-millimeter image resolution.
   Epilepsy and other neurological disorders are accompanied by structural
   changes in the hippocampal formation and associated regions; however,
   these changes can be subtle and on a much smaller scale than the spatial
   resolution commonly obtained by current clinical magnetic resonance (MR)
   protocols in vivo.
   Methods: We explored the possibility of studying the organization of
   fresh tissue with a 17.6 Tesla magnet using diffusion MR imaging and
   tractography. The mesoscale organization of the temporal lobe was
   estimated using a fresh unfixed specimen obtained from a subject who
   underwent anterior temporal lobectomy for medically refractory temporal
   lobe epilepsy (TLE). Following ex vivo imaging, the tissue was fixed,
   serial-sectioned, and stained for correlation with imaging.
   Findings: We resolved tissue microstructural organizational features in
   the temporal lobe from diffusion MR imaging and tractography in fresh
   tissue.
   Conclusions: Fresh ex vivo MR imaging, along with tractography, revealed
   complex intra-temporal structural variation corresponding to neuronal
   cell body layers, dendritic fields, and axonal projection systems
   evident histologically. This is the first study to describe in detail
   the human temporal lobe structural organization using high-field MR
   imaging and tractography. By preserving the 3-dimensional structures of
   the hippocampus and surrounding structures, specific changes in anatomy
   may inform us about the changes that occur in TLE in relation to the
   disease process and structural underpinnings in epilepsy-related memory
   dysfunction. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is one of the leading cancers worldwide. Precision
   medicine is a new trend that systematically examines molecular and
   functional genomic information within each patient's cancer to identify
   the patterns that may affect treatment decisions and potential outcomes.
   As a part of precision medicine, computer-aided diagnosis enables joint
   analysis of functional genomic information and image from pathological
   images. In this paper we propose an integrated framework for breast
   cancer staging using image-omics and functional genomic information. The
   entire biomedical imaging informatics framework consists of image-omics
   extraction, feature combination, and classification. First, a robust
   automatic nuclei detection and segmentation is presented to identify
   tumor regions, delineate nuclei boundaries and calculate a set of
   image-based morphological features; next, the low dimensional
   image-omics is obtained through principal component analysis and is
   concatenated with the functional genomic features identified by a linear
   model. A support vector machine for differentiating stage I breast
   cancer from other stages are learned. We experimentally demonstrate that
   compared with a single type of representation (image-omics), the
   combination of image-omics and functional genomic feature can improve
   the classification accuracy by 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Online Social Networks (OSNs), such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+,
   facilitate the interactions and communications among people. However,
   they also make it a fertile land for misinformation to rapidly spread
   out, which may lead to detrimental consequences. Thus it is imperative
   to detect the misinformation propagating through OSNs by placing
   monitors.
   In this paper, we first study a general misinformation detection problem
   and show its equivalence to the influence maximization problem.
   Moreover, in order to prevent misinformation from reaching specific
   users, we define a tau-Monitor Placement problem for cases where the
   partial knowledge of misinformation sources is available. We prove the
   \#P complexity of this problem and additionally propose an efficient
   algorithm to solve it. Extensive experiments on real-world data show the
   effectiveness of our proposed algorithm with respect to minimizing the
   number of monitors.}},

Abstract = {{The relay scheme and the corresponding rate performance are considered
   for a half-duplex relay channel in which the source can only transmit
   information with fixed power. As different relay strategies result in
   different rate performance, we first present a decision criterion for
   selecting between Decode-and-Forward (DF) and Compress-and-Forward (CF)
   strategies by thoroughly analyzing their achievable rate. Based on the
   analysis result, the maximmn of the DF rate and CF rate can be achieved
   by strategy selection procedure. To further obtain a larger rate, we put
   forward a hybrid DF-CF scheme in which the strategy selection between DF
   and CF is combined with active relay power allocation efficiently. It is
   shown that the concave envelope of the maximum of DF rate and CF rate is
   achievable via our new developed hybrid scheme. For the convenience of
   implementation, we also present a suboptimal setting for the hybrid
   DF-CF scheme. Numerical results show that the suboptimal setting can
   achieve a rate approaching the maximal rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present SOBO, a novel hybrid MAC protocol using
   sequentially ordered backoff in wireless LANs. SOBO eliminates packet
   collisions and wasted idle backoff slots by introducing implicit
   resource reservation into 802.11 DCF. In SOBO, the AP divides time into
   repeating cycles by beacon frames. Exploiting the implicit information
   of successful transmission order in every cycle, sequentially ordered
   backoff in a distributed manner during reservation period is achieved
   without extra control packets. In addition, we propose a novel scheme to
   estimate the number of contention stations, and design an adaptive
   contention window algorithm. We also analyze the robustness of SOBO
   against message losses in realistic networks with channel errors. The
   performance of SOBO is verified via extensive simulations with different
   scenarios. Our simulation results show that SOBO achieves a significant
   increase in network throughput compared to the legacy 802.11 DCF.}},

Title = {{Probit-Based Pedestrian Gap Acceptance Model for Midblock Crossing
   Locations}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2519}},
Pages = {{128-136}},
Abstract = {{Pedestrian gap acceptance has not been explored to the same degree as
   vehicle gap acceptance. Although the two are similar in concept, there
   are a variety of pedestrian characteristics and caveats in the
   interaction between the pedestrian and vehicle modes that require
   separate pedestrian gap acceptance models. The objective of this
   research was to analyze empirical observations collected at 27 sites in
   Alabama, Florida, and North Carolina and to develop pedestrian gap
   acceptance models at midblock crossings. Goodness-of-fit tests showed
   that a probit-based, single-lane gap acceptance model, drawn from a
   noncontrolled pedestrian crossing data set, yielded the best results
   (max-rescaled R-2 =.69). This model involved only two parameters: the
   size of the gap length in seconds and a binary variable that
   distinguished between gaps and lag events (first-arriving vehicle,
   without a prior lead vehicle, to open the gap). An increase in gap
   length was associated with an increased probability that a pedestrian
   would cross, whereas a lag event had a negative coefficient, which meant
   that a pedestrian was less likely to accept a lag than a gap, given the
   same length in seconds. Other variables that described crosswalk
   characteristics as well as pedestrian and driver behavior did not emerge
   as significant factors in the model. The research reported in this paper
   offers a new, robust pedestrian gap acceptance model that can be used in
   traffic operational analysis. The model can be incorporated into
   microsimulation packages and thus improve the accuracy of pedestrian
   behavior modeling at midblock crossings in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf dielectric properties influence microwave scattering from a

   function of leaf water content. Understanding the effect of water stress

   water stress detection over agricultural canopies.
   This paper presents in-vivo measurements of leaf dielectric properties.
   Different relationships between leaf water content and leaf dielectric
   properties were found tomato leaves at various heights. The dielectric
   properties of live stressed and unstressed tomato plants were measured
   during a controlled, two-week experiment. A clear difference was found
   between the leaf dielectric properties of stressed and unstressed
   leaves, which can be attributed to increase in water stress.
   This results of this study show changes in plant dynamics due to water
   stress lead to a difference in leaf dielectric properties between

Abstract = {{Human-autonomy sensor fusion is an emerging technology with a wide range
   of applications, including object detection/recognition, surveillance,
   collaborative control, and prosthetics. For object detection, humans and
   computer-vision-based systems employ different strategies to locate
   targets, likely providing complementary information. However, little
   effort has been made in combining the outputs of multiple autonomous
   detectors and multiple human-generated responses. This paper presents a
   method for integrating several sources of human- and autonomy-generated
   information for rapid object detection tasks. Human
   electroencephalography (EEG) and button-press responses from rapid
   serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiments are fused with outputs
   from trained object detection algorithms. Three fusion methods-Bayesian,
   Dempster-Shafer, and Dynamic Dempster-Shafer-are implemented for
   comparison. Results demonstrate that fusion of these human classifiers
   with computer-vision-based detectors improves object detection accuracy
   over purely computer-vision-based detection (5\% relative increase in
   mean average precision) and the best individual computer vision
   algorithm (28\% relative increase in mean average precision). Computer
   vision fused with button press response and/or the XDAWN + Bayesian
   Linear Discriminant Analysis neural classifier provides considerable
   improvement, while computer vision fused with other neural classifiers
   provides little or no improvement. Of the three fusion methods, Dynamic
   Dempster-Shafer Theory (DDST) Fusion exhibits the greatest performance
   in this application.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of large amount of images calls for diverse types of
   features, but employing all possible feature types will create
   unnecessary computation burden, and may result in reduced classification
   accuracy. Selecting feature vectors individually is not a feasible
   solution in this scenario due to the high amount of feature vectors
   needed for reasonable performance. Instead, this paper proposes a
   measure that effectively evaluates the relative significance of a
   feature group, employing the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR)
   feature selection. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) is used for combining
   different feature types in classification, which implicitly also serves
   an alternative way for weighing the feature groups' importance. Results
   show the proposed group feature selection better reflects a feature
   type's importance, and improve upon MKL performance. This study also
   finds that the convolutional neural network (CNN) features have the best
   discriminative power among all features, but it is still possible to
   improve classification accuracy with other well-designed features.}},

Abstract = {{Linear discriminant analysis seeks to find a one-dimensional projection
   of a dataset to alleviate the problems associated with classifying
   high-dimensional data. The earliest methods, based on second-order
   statistics often fail on multi-modal datasets. Information-theoretic
   criteria do not suffer in such cases, and allow for projections to
   spaces higher than one dimension and with multiple classes. These
   approaches are based on maximizing mutual information between the
   projected data and the labels. However, mutual information is
   computationally demanding and vulnerable to datasets with class
   imbalance. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic criterion
   for learning discriminants based on the Euclidean distance divergence
   between classes. This objective more directly seeks projections which
   separate classes and performs well in the midst of class imbalance. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness on real datasets, and provide extensions
   to the multi-class and multi-dimension cases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new statistical concept called directed
   generalized measure of association (dGMA) to quantify the amount of
   association transferred between subsystems in a system evolving in time.
   This paper is an improvement of the previously established method called
   generalized measure of association (GMA) by taking the conditional
   dependence between time-delay representation of subsystems into account.
   Directed-GMA is a rank-based pair-wise measure which can deal with
   dynamic data sets. This is done by calculating the rank permutation in a
   conditional scheme under the framework of conditional causality. In this
   paper we present a bivariate case and assume that the cause-effect
   relationship is one directional, e.g. there is no feedback. The
   preliminary results on the synthetic data sets reveal that the proposed
   method is able to extract nonlinear causal relationship, which cannot be
   extracted by traditional approaches. To further assess the performance
   we compared the results with another rank-based method called symbolic
   transfer entropy (STE). Our approach can be a promising tool to infer
   causal relationship in complex systems, e.g. human brain, to reveal
   their underlying effective connectivity.}},

   both inputs, we name the proposed architecture as Multimodal DPCN
   (MDPCN). Experimental results show that the ``parallel{''} flow between

   unsupervised clustering. We validate the proposed method with a
   multimodal classification task using part of the VIDTIMIT dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Correntropy has been successfully applied in non-Gaussian signal
   processing, but the superior performance achieved is depends on
   appropriate selection of the kernel width. How to select a proper kernel
   width is a crucial problem in correntropy applications. In this paper,

   set at a maximum between the absolute value of instantaneous error
   divided by square root of 2 and a predetermined kernel width. The new
   algorithm involves no extra free parameters and keeps the simplicity and
   robustness of the original maximum correntropy criterion (MCC)
   algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm can

Abstract = {{Kernel methods provide an efficient nonparametric model to produce
   adaptive nonlinear filtering (ANF) algorithms. However, in practical
   applications, standard squared error based kernel methods suffer from
   two main issues: (1) a constant step size is used, which degrades the
   algorithm performance in non-stationary environment, and (2) additive
   noises are assumed to follow Gaussian distribution, while in practice
   the noises are generally non-Gaussian and follow other statistical
   distributions. To address these two issues simultaneously, this paper
   proposes a novel kernel normalized mixed-norm (KNMN) algorithm. Compared
   to the standard squared error based kernel methods, the KNMN algorithm
   extends the linear mixed-norm adaptive filtering algorithms to
   Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and introduces a normalized step
   size as well as adaptive mixing parameter. We also conduct the mean
   square convergence analysis and demonstrate the desirable performance of
   the KNMN algorithm in solving the system identification problem.}},

Abstract = {{Work place engineering problems are recognized as being complex and
   ambiguous. However, most of the problems students are asked to solve
   during their degree programs are classroom problems. Most studies of
   ambiguity in problem solving have defined ambiguity as a characteristic
   of the problems. We are interested in understanding how students
   interpret engineering problems, either creating or resolving ambiguity
   during their problem solving process. The research question that guides
   this study is: How is ambiguity manifested by engineering students as
   they solve problems? This study is part of a larger project examining
   engineering students' engineering problem solving across different types
   of engineering problems. Twenty materials engineering students were
   asked to solve four materials engineering problems during a think-aloud
   session. For the analysis, points of ambiguity during the
   problem-solving process were identified as periods in which the students
   specifically verbalized uncertainty. The points of ambiguity in the
   transcript were then analyzed through script analysis. More specifically
   textual instances of ambiguity were linked with three main periods and
   situational categories: a) the situation that caused the ambiguity, 2)
   what happened during the point of ambiguity, and 3) the reaction of the
   student after reaching the point of ambiguity. Results indicated that
   students experienced points of ambiguity in both closed-and open-ended
   problems. Several motifs were common to both types of problems,
   including confusion over how to use given values, not having necessary
   content knowledge, lack of self-confidence, and difficulty
   conceptualizing the problem. The lack of constraints inherent in the
   open-ended problems also caused additional ambiguity among some
   students. Our findings show that ambiguity can take many forms and is
   not just a function of the problem structure. Students reach points of
   ambiguity (e.g., points where they do not know what to do next), due to
   many factors. Some of these factors represent aspects of their academic
   and epistemological development. Our analysis to date suggests that
   students need more comprehensive training and practice to be prepared in
   facing problems that reflect the work in engineering practice. We are
   currently examining the data further to identify patterns in their
   response to ambiguity, which may help in developing pedagogical
   strategies and tools to support students' ability to successfully solve
   engineering problems}},

Abstract = {{This paper combines the benefits of the Sturdy-MASH delta-sigma
   modulator with the benefits of the noise-shaped integrating quantizer.
   By using the noise-shaped integrating quantizer, the first stage
   quantization error is directly extracted in time-domain without the need
   for any extra hardware. This removes the loading on the first loop
   filter, and allows accurate inter-stage gain scaling. The second loop
   output is also provided in a time-modulated pulse which operates a DAC
   at the front-end of the modulator. With the use of dual-DAC data
   weighted averaging, the mismatch between the front-end DACs is greatly
   suppressed. Detailed Matlab simulation results are provided to prove the
   efficiency of the proposed structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors propose an on-die power supply noise
   measurement system for power integrity characterization using one bias
   supply. The measurement system is operated by the bias voltage provided
   to logical blocks such as Core and 10 block in a microprocessor since
   another supply power rail for the measurement system can create a
   coupling to the existed power rails. The power supply noise is
   repetitive since it is created by repetitive on chip circuit activities.
   The voltage range that can be measured by the system is 25\% of VCC;
   (including noise which exceeds the power supply voltage) and the range
   of the noise measurement frequency is up to 1.5GHz. The proposed
   measurement system is composed of two main sections; one is a sampling
   and detection system and the other is an effective ADC. In addition, the
   proposed system is designed in 90nm CMOS technology and is specified to
   be interacted with system support such as software for a trigger signal
   and JTAG.}},

   This structure converts the analog input signal to a PWM waveform using

Abstract = {{Correct interface pricing is essential to sufficiently reflect the true
   system marginal cost including incremental system dispatch cost or
   decremental system production cost savings. Deficiencies in interface
   pricing would provide wrong price signals to incentivize harmful
   interchange transactions or dis-incentivize beneficial interchange
   transactions between Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) or
   between RTOs and non-market entities, e. g. Tennessee Valley Authority
   (TVA). The inefficient interchange transactions would thus be scheduled
   and be charged more for the export or credited less for the import, or
   vice versa. This paper evaluates the interface pricing from both
   theoretical and practical perspectives. A real-time (RT) conceptual
   example was also developed to analyze and investigate the congestion
   cost allocation of interface price for interchange transactions between
   monitoring RTO (MRTO) and non-monitoring RTO (NMRTO).}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a continuation and extension of our previous research
   where kernel normalized mixed-norm (KNMN) algorithm, a combination of
   the kernel trick with the mixed-norm strategy, was proposed to
   demonstrate superior performance for system identification under
   non-Gaussian environment. Meanwhile, we also introduced a naive adaptive
   mixing parameter (AMP) updating mechanism to make KNMN more robust under
   nonstationary scenarios. The main contributions of this paper are
   threefold: firstly, the l(p)-norm is substituted for the l(4)-norm in
   the cost function, which can be viewed as a generalized version to the
   form of mixed-norms; secondly, instead of using the original AMP
   proposed in our previous work, a novel time-varying AMP is employed to
   provide better tracking behavior to the nonstationarity; and thirdly,
   the mean square convergence analysis is conducted, where the second
   moment behavior of weight error vector is elaborately studied.
   Simulations are conducted on two benchmark system identification
   problems, and different kinds of additive noises are added respectively
   to verify the effectiveness of improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Image-based visual gaze estimation has been widely used in various
   scientific and application-oriented disciplines. However, the high cost
   and tedious calibration procedure impede its generalization in real
   scenarios. In this paper, we develop a low cost yet effective webcam
   based visual gaze estimation system. Different from previous works, we
   aim at minimizing the system cost, and at the same time, making the
   system more flexible and feasible to users. More specifically, only a
   single ordinary webcam is used in our system. Meanwhile, we also
   proposed a novel calibration mechanism which takes account binocular
   feature vectors simultaneously, and uses only four visual target points.
   We compare our system with the state of the art webcam based visual gaze
   estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can
   achieve satisfactory performance without the requirements of dedicated
   hardware or tedious calibration procedure.}},

   contribute to flight safety by preventing mental overloading of the

   Therefore, we adopted a novel, parameter-free method of evaluating the
   cortical connectivity, named Generalized Measure of Association (GMA),
   to assess and discriminate the mental workload of pilots using the
   Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) flight simulation platform. A
   modified version of GMA (Time Series GMA) is applied on the
   pre-processed EEG time series recorded from eight subjects during the
   MATB experiment. Frobenius Norm is used to calculate the Euclidean
   distances between different TGMA series in order to assess the
   discriminability of the cognitive workloads. The results have shown
   clear distinction between the mean values of the inter-task and
   intra-task Euclidean distance series of TGMA matrices, but statistical
   significance is still lacking due to the relatively large standard

   transfer optimal control problems using collocation at
   Legendre-Gauss-Radau points. The method generates an appropriate mesh
   based on a given relative error estimate and the size, shape, and
   orientation of each orbital revolution of a transfer trajectory. The
   mesh is constructed by first dividing each orbital revolution into a
   specific number of segments based on the geometry of the revolution.
   Then, using the arc length of each segment, an appropriate number of
   collocation points is assigned to each segment. Three examples highlight
   various features of the mesh generation and show that the approach is
   more computationally efficient than a variable-order mesh refinement

Abstract = {{With asymmetric switching angle modulation technique, a cascaded modular
   multilevel inverter (CMI) is able to not only control real power flow,
   but also compensate reactive power and selective harmonic currents with
   staircase waveforms and the minimum switching loss. To achieve these
   functions simultaneously, the references of a fundamental active
   current, a reactive current and all concerned harmonic currents must be
   generated. The existing techniques employed in selective harmonic
   elimination calculate solutions offline and store them in a DSP. It
   would take extremely large memory space because of multi-dimensional
   data in asymmetric switching angle modulation. This paper proposes a
   technique to transform a transcendental equation set into a decoupled
   multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear controlled system. Hence
   calculating solutions is transformed from solving the trigonometric
   equation set to achieving the desired response of the controlled system.
   Both DC model and small signal model are developed for the system. The
   integral controller, decoupling controller and a feedforward loop with a
   much smaller look-up table (LUT) than conventional approaches are
   designed to ensure the system to converge to a zero-error steady state.
   A current spectrum feedback loop with FFT block is applied to improve
   the system's robustness.}},

Title = {{Application-Specific Customization of Dynamic Profiling Mechanisms for
   Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{303-322}},
Abstract = {{To reduce the complexity associated with application-specific tuning of
   wireless sensor networks (WSNs), dynamic profiling enables an accurate
   view of an application's runtime behavior, such that the network can be
   reoptimized at runtime in response to changing application behavior or
   environmental conditions. However, the dynamic profiling must be able to
   accurately capture application behavior without incurring significant
   runtime overheads. Since application-and sensor-specific constraints
   dictate the profiling requirements and tolerated overheads, designers
   require design assistance to quickly evaluate and select appropriate
   profiling methodologies. To increase designer productivity, we formulate
   profiling methodology design guidelines based on extensive evaluation
   and analysis of a variety of profiling methodologies suitable for
   dynamically monitoring WSNs with respect to network traffic overhead,
   power, and code impacts associated with each method. While energy
   consumption increases are reasonable, ranging from 0.5\% to 2.6\%,
   network traffic, code size, and computation time overheads can be as
   high as 66.2\%, 75.9\%, and 136.6\%, respectively. Our results show that
   these overhead variations are highly application specific, and a single
   profiling method is not suitable for all types of application behavior,
   thus necessitating, application-specific profiling methodology
   customization. To facilitate rapid development of these profiling
   methodologies, we present a profiler-customization methodology
   consisting of a code generator module, overhead estimation module, and
   profile data management module. Using our profiling-customization
   methodology, designers can rapidly evaluate the overhead of different
   profiling methodologies, and automatically integrate the most
   appropriate methodology into the application at design time.}},

Abstract = {{IC recycling has become a grave problem in today's globalized
   semiconductor industry, with potential impact to critical
   infrastructures. In order to mitigate this problem, various
   Design-for-Anti-Counterfeit (DfAC) measures have been recently proposed.
   In this paper, we look at DfAC strategies based on recycling sensors,
   most notably the ones based on a pair of ring oscillators, which rely on
   integrated circuit aging phenomena to detect usage of ICs in the field.
   We introduce a novel optimization technique that generalizes to most
   recycling sensors suggested so far in literature and gives manufacturers
   exact control over parameters that determine sensor performance, such as
   yield, misprediction and area overhead. A detailed analysis of various
   factors affecting recycling sensor performance is presented and an
   optimization problem is formulated and verified using simulations, in
   order to demonstrate the accuracy of the approach.}},

   development of this state following (StaF) method. In particular an
   explicit uniform number of StaF kernel functions can be calculated to
   ensure good approximation as a state moves through a large compact set.
   An algorithm for gradient descent is demonstrated where a good

Abstract = {{A tensor decomposition approach combined with Chebyshev spectral
   differentiation is developed to solve the transient Fokker-Planck
   equation (FPE) in high dimensional cases. This method drastically
   reduces the degrees of freedom required to maintain accuracy in the
   approximation as dimensionality increases. The transient solution is
   sought in a single CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition form for all times by
   the alternating least squares algorithm. This is accomplished by
   decoupling the spatial dimensions as well as the separation of temporal
   domain from spatial domain. As a result, the transient solution is
   obtained without resorting to expensive time-stepping schemes. In
   addition, a new approach for imposing the vanishing boundary condition
   in the tensor product framework is proposed, improving the quality of
   the approximation. Numerical transient solutions for systems up to 1 4
   dimensional state space are successfully obtained on a regular personal
   computer to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a sufficient condition that guarantees

   continuous-time weighted consensus protocols with acyclic structure.
   Each edge of the underlying network graph G is defined by a constant
   parameter, referred to as the weight of the edge, while each node is
   defined by a scalar state whose dynamics evolve as the weighted linear
   combination of its difference with the states of its neighboring nodes.
   Following the classical definitions of identifiability and
   indistinguishability, we first derive a condition that ensures the
   identifiability of the edge weights of G in terms of the associated
   transfer function. Using this characterization, we propose a sensor
   placement algorithm that guarantees identifiability of the edge weights.

Abstract = {{How can a building Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) system
   vary its real time power consumption to provide ancillary services to
   the power grid without sacrificing occupant comfort? Prior work showed
   how this can be done if the reference power variation is of high
   frequency (seconds to a few minutes) so that the climate control system
   filters out the disturbance. This paper addresses the question of how to
   do that when the reference power variation is of lower frequency, e. g.,
   periods of a few minutes to an hour. We propose a receding horizon
   approach to schedule the baseline cooling and heating power of a
   building based on weather forecasts. A lower level controller is then
   used to track the scheduled baseline plus ancillary service reference
   signal. Periodic updates to the scheduler based on measurements ensure
   quality of service in spite of forecasting errors. The algorithm is
   tested in simulation. Results show that ancillary service in the
   frequency range of f is an element of {[}1/(1 hour), 1/(10 minutes)] can
   be extracted from commercial building HVAC systems while still

Abstract = {{Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a method commonly used
   for rehabilitation whereby an applied electrical stimulus induces muscle
   contractions. NMES can also evoke functional movements; however, a
   fundamental limitation is the early onset of fatigue. Asynchronous
   stimulation is a method that can reduce fatigue by utilizing multiple
   stimulation channels to segregate and switch between different sets of
   motor units. However, one limitation is that switching introduces
   discontinuities since each set of motor units responds differently to
   stimulation. Therefore, there is a need to design a controller which
   considers the switching dynamics and differing muscle response. In
   preliminary work, a control law was developed for asynchronous
   stimulation. However, the previous control design required there to be a
   finite window of time where the control voltage is transitioned from one
   channel to another. Since a transition period is undesirable in practice
   (as it will lead to increased fatigue), a switched systems analysis is
   used in the present work to design a controller that allows for
   instantaneous switching. The developed controller yields semi-global
   exponential tracking of a desired angular trajectory for a person's
   knee-shank complex. The result of the work is promising for the
   implementation of asynchronous stimulation for closed-loop
   rehabilitative procedures and in assistive devices as an approach to
   limit NMES-induced fatigue while tracking a desired trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{This tutorial paper will discuss the development of novel
   state-of-the-art control approaches and theory for complex systems based
   on machine intelligence in order to enable full autonomy. Given the
   presence of modeling uncertainties, the unavailability of the model, the
   possibility of cooperative/non-cooperative goals and malicious attacks
   compromising the security of teams of complex systems, there is a need
   for approaches that respond to situations not programmed or anticipated
   in design. Unfortunately, existing schemes for complex systems do not
   take into account recent advances of machine intelligence. We shall
   discuss on how to be inspired by the human brain and combine
   interdisciplinary ideas from different fields, i.e. computational
   intelligence, game theory, control theory, and information theory to
   develop new self-configuring algorithms for decision and control given
   the unavailability of model, the presence of enemy components and the
   possibility of network attacks. Due to the adaptive nature of the
   algorithms, the complex systems will be capable of breaking or splitting
   into parts that are themselves autonomous and resilient. The algorithms
   discussed will be characterized by strong abilities of learning and
   adaptivity. As a result, the complex systems will be fully autonomous,
   and tolerant to communication failures.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a localized symplectic model reduction technique,
   locally weighted proper symplectic decomposition (LWPSD), is proposed to
   simplify parameterized Hamiltonian systems. Our aim is two-fold. First,
   to achieve computational savings for large-scale Hamiltonian systems
   with parameter variation. Second, to preserve the symplectic structure
   of the original system. As an analogy to the proper orthogonal
   decomposition, the proper symplectic decomposition (PSD) can be used to
   construct a symplectic subspace to fit empirical data, and yield a
   low-order Hamiltonian system on the subspace. Instead of using a global
   basis to construct a global reduced model, the locally weighted approach
   approximates the original system by multiple lower-dimensional
   subspaces. Each local reduced basis is generated by the PSD of a
   weighted snapshot ensemble. Compared with the standard PSD, the LWPSD
   could yield a more accurate solution with a fixed subspace dimension.
   The stability, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed technique are
   illustrated through the numerical simulation of the wave equation.}},

Abstract = {{Widely deployed mHealth systems enable patients to efficiently collect,
   aggregate, and report their Personal Health Records (PHRs), and then
   lower the costs and shorten their response time. The increasing needs of
   PHR monitoring require the involvement of healthcare companies that
   provide monitoring programs for analyzing PHRs. Unfortunately,
   healthcare companies are lack of the computation, storage, and
   communication capability on supporting millions of patients. To tackle
   this problem, they seek for the help from the cloud. However, delegating
   monitoring programs to the cloud may incur serious security and privacy
   breaches because people have to provide their identity information and
   PHRs to the public domain. Even worse, the cloud may mistakenly return
   the incorrect computation results, which will put patients' life in
   jeopardy. In this paper, we propose a verifiable privacy-preserving
   monitoring scheme for cloud-assisted mHealth systems. Our scheme allows
   patients to verify the correctness of computation results from the cloud
   without revealing their PHRs and identity information. In addition, our
   advanced schemes offer efficient PHR updates and PHR computations on
   complex monitoring programs. By detailed performance evaluation, we have
   shown the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In RFID systems, the grouping problem is to efficiently group all tags
   according to a given partition such that tags in the same group will
   have the same group ID. Unlike previous research on the unicast
   transmission from a reader to a tag, grouping provides a fundamental
   mechanism for efficient multicast transmissions and aggregate queries in
   large RFID-enabled applications. A message can be transmitted to a group
   of m tags simultaneously in multicast, which improves the efficiency by
   m times when comparing with unicast. We study fast grouping protocols in
   large RFID systems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first
   attempt to tackle this practically important yet uninvestigated problem.
   We start with a straightforward solution called the Enhanced Polling
   Grouping (EPG) protocol. We then propose a time-efficient FIltering
   Grouping (FIG) protocol that uses Bloom filters to remove the costly ID
   transmissions. We point out the limitation of the Bloom-filter based
   solution due to its intrinsic false positive problem, which leads to our
   final ConCurrent Grouping (CCG) protocol. With a drastically different
   design, CCG is able to outperform FIG by exploiting collisions to inform
   multiple tags of their group ID simultaneously and by removing any
   wasteful slots in its frame-based execution. Simulation results
   demonstrate that our best protocol CCG can reduce the execution time by
   a factor of 11 when comparing with a baseline polling protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Grid addresses the problem of existing power grid's increasing
   complexity, growing demand and requirement for greater reliability,
   through two-way communication and automated residential load control
   among others. These features also makes the Smart Grid a target for a
   number of cyber attacks. In the paper, we study the problem of rate
   alteration attack (RAA) through fabrication of price messages which
   induces changes in load profiles of individual users and eventually
   causes major alteration in the load profile of the entire network.
   Combining with cascading failure, it ends up with a highly damaging
   attack. We prove that the problem is NP-Complete and provide its
   inapproximability. We devise two approaches for the problem, former
   deals with maximizing failure of lines with the given resource and then
   extending the effect with cascading failure while the later takes
   cascading potential into account while choosing the lines to fail. To
   get more insight into the impact of RAA, we also extend our algorithms
   to maximize number of node failures. Empirical results on both IEEE Bus
   data and real network help us evaluate our approaches under various
   settings of grid parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) forward looking ground penetrating
   radar (FLGPR) systems have shown the capability to improve performance
   for landmine detection. By leveraging multiple collocated transmitters
   and receivers, the waveform diversity offered by MIMO FLGPR systems
   provides performance enhancement in target detection, parameter
   identifiability, and increased cross-range resolution. In this paper, we
   introduce a data-dependent image formation algorithm based on the sparse
   learning via iterative minimization (SLIM) approach for high-resolution
   imaging applied to both time-and frequency-domain. In addition, we
   compare time-domain SLIM (TD-SLIM) and frequency-domain SLIM (FD-SLIM)
   with data-independent methods such as delay-and-sum (DAS) and recursive
   sidelobe minimization (RSM), designed by the Army Research Laboratory
   (ARL). These algorithms are applied to data collected by the Synchronous
   Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar developed by
   ARL for landmine detection. When applied to data collected by this 2 by
   16 MIMO radar system, both the TD-SLIM and FD-SLIM algorithms yield
   results with higher resolution than the two conventional methods applied
   to the data. FD-SLIM provides significantly reduced computational time
   compared to TD-SLIM, motivating its application for high-resolution MIMO
   FLGPR imaging.}},

   overpasses the skin effect by cancelling the generated eddy currents
   inside the conductor allowing the current to flow through the whole
   volume of the conductor, resulting in the reduction of the resistive
   loss of the inductor. The inductors are nanomachined and measurement

Abstract = {{Current dry eye treatment includes delivering comfort enhancing agents
   to the eye via eye drops, but low residence time of eye drops leads to
   low bioavailability. Frequent administration leads to incompliance in
   patients, so there is a great need for medical device such as contact
   lenses to treat dry eye. Studies in the past have demonstrated the
   efficacy of hyaluronic acid (HA) in the treatment of dry eyes using eye
   drops. In this paper, we present two methods to load HA in hydrogel
   contact lenses, soaking method and direct entrapment. The contact lenses
   were characterized by studying their optical and physical properties to
   determine their suitability as extended wear contact lenses. HA-laden
   hydrogel contact lenses prepared by soaking method showed release up to
   48 h with acceptable physical and optical properties. Hydrogel contact
   lenses prepared by direct entrapment method showed significant sustained
   release in comparison to soaking method. HA entrapped in hydrogels
   resulted in reduction in \% transmittance, sodium ion permeability and
   surface contact angle, while increase in \% swelling. The impact on each
   of these properties was proportional to HA loading. The batch with
   200-mu g HA loading showed all acceptable values (parameters) for
   contact lens use. Results of cytotoxicity study indicated the safety of
   hydrogel contact lenses. In vivo pharmacokinetics studies in rabbit tear
   fluid showed dramatic increase in HA mean residence time and area under
   the curve with lenses in comparison to eye drop treatment. The study
   demonstrates the promising potential of delivering HA through contact
   lenses for the treatment of dry eye syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a functional electrical stimulation (FES) knee
   bending and stretching system on robust integral of the sign of the
   error (RISE)-based tracking control for human limb. The knee bending and
   stretching motion on rowing exercises is modeled as an Euler Lagrange
   system by using a closed-chain mechanism. Considering the scleronomic
   holonomic constraint, the equation of motion expressed in terms of the
   seat position is obtained. The human thigh model can be divided into
   three pairs of antagonistic muscles. The torque of the thigh consists of
   a combination of torque produced by the Quadriceps and Hamstrings muscle
   groups. The Quadriceps and Hamstrings are contracted by the electrical
   stimulation, and the control of stimulation is designed applying a
   RISE-based control framework. Experiment results are shown on seven
   healthy individuals by using a rowing exercise machine. The results
   confirm that the proposed muscle stimulation method can realize the knee
   bending and stretching motion similar to voluntary tracking.}},

Title = {{Variability of effects of spatial climate data aggregation on regional
   yield simulation by crop models}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Field-scale crop models are often applied at spatial resolutions coarser
   than that of the arable field. However, little is known about the
   response of the models to spatially aggregated climate input data and
   why these responses can differ across models. Depending on the model,
   regional yield estimates from large-scale simulations may be biased,
   compared to simulations with high-resolution input data. We evaluated
   this so-called aggregation effect for 13 crop models for the region of
   North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The models were supplied with climate
   data of 1 km resolution and spatial aggregates of up to 100 km
   resolution raster. The models were used with 2 crops (winter wheat and
   silage maize) and 3 production situations (potential, water-limited and
   nitrogen-water-limited growth) to improve the understanding of errors in
   model simulations related to data aggregation and possible interactions
   with the model structure. The most important climate variables
   identified in determining the model-specific input data aggregation on
   simulated yields were mainly related to changes in radiation (wheat) and
   temperature (maize). Additionally, aggregation effects were systematic,
   regardless of the extent of the effect. Climate input data aggregation
   changed the mean simulated regional yield by up to 0.2 t ha(-1), whereas
   simulated yields from single years and models differed considerably,
   depending on the data aggregation. This implies that large-scale crop
   yield simulations are robust against climate data aggregation. However,
   large-scale simulations can be systematically biased when being
   evaluated at higher temporal or spatial resolution depending on the
   model and its parameterization.}},

Title = {{Effect of weather data aggregation on regional crop simulation for

Journal = {{CLIMATE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{65}},

Pages = {{141-157}},
Abstract = {{We assessed the weather data aggregation effect (DAE) on the simulation
   of cropping systems for different crops, response variables, and
   production conditions. Using 13 process-based crop models and the
   ensemble mean, we simulated 30 yr continuous cropping systems for 2
   crops (winter wheat and silage maize) under 3 production conditions for
   the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The DAE was evaluated for
   5 weather data resolutions (i.e. 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 km) for 3
   response variables including yield, growing season evapotranspiration,
   and water use efficiency. Five metrics, viz. the spatial bias (Delta),
   average absolute deviation (AAD), relative AAD, root mean squared error
   (RMSE), and relative RMSE, were used to evaluate the DAE on both the
   input weather data and simulated results. For weather data, we found
   that data aggregation narrowed the spatial variability but widened the.,
   especially across mountainous areas. The DAE on loss of spatial
   heterogeneity and hotspots was stronger than on the average changes over
   the region. The DAE increased when coarsening the spatial resolution of
   the input weather data. The DAE varied considerably across different
   models, but changed only slightly for different production conditions
   and crops. We conclude that if spatially detailed information is
   essential for local management decision, higher resolution is desirable
   to adequately capture the spatial variability for heterogeneous regions.
   The required resolution depends on the choice of the model as well as
   the environmental condition of the study area.}},

Abstract = {{The risk-aware path planning problem is considered, which aims to locate
   a target in a congested urban environment and facilitate aid in the
   decision making on target interdiction. The target is modeled as a
   ground vehicle moving randomly within a road network and following
   traffic rules. To locate the target, a heterogeneous sensor network
   composed of passive sensors (e.g., static traffic cameras and mobile
   human observers) and active sensors (e.g., a UAV) is tasked to
   cooperatively search for the target. A sample-based Bayesian filter is
   developed to fuse various sensor measurements to estimate the target
   state. To facilitate the decision making on target interdiction, a
   notion of risk is considered, which evaluates the incurred loss of
   target interdiction at certain locations based on incomplete information
   of target state and urban factors (e.g., the proximity to critical areas
   such as populated shopping malls, schools, military, or government
   buildings). As opposed to the static traffic cameras and the randomly
   walking human observers that passively provide target measurements, the
   UAV actively plans its path, based on mutual information, to maximize
   the informativeness of future measurements. In contrast to classical
   target tracking that only focuses on reducing the uncertainty of target
   state, the risk is encoded in the particle weights to guide the motion
   of UAV to improve target state estimation and, ultimately, reduce the
   risk of decision on target interdiction. Simulation results are provided
   to demonstrate the integrated sensing framework and the risk-aware path
   planning algorithm.}},

Title = {{Impact of scanning parameters and breathing patterns on image quality
   and accuracy of tumor motion reconstruction in 4D CBCT: a phantom study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{195-212}},
Abstract = {{Four-dimensional, cone-beam CT (4D CBCT) substantially reduces
   respiration-induced motion blurring artifacts in three-dimension (3D)
   CBCT. However, the image quality of 4D CBCT is significantly degraded
   which may affect its accuracy in localizing a mobile tumor for
   high-precision, image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). The purpose of
   this study was to investigate the impact of scanning parameters
   (hereinafter collectively referred to as scanning sequence) and
   breathing patterns on the image quality and the accuracy of computed
   tumor trajectory for a commercial 4D CBCT system, in preparation for its
   clinical implementation. We simulated a series of periodic and aperiodic
   sinusoidal breathing patterns with a respiratory motion phantom. The
   aperiodic pattern was created by varying the period or amplitude of
   individual sinusoidal breathing cycles. 4D CBCT scans of the phantom
   were acquired with a manufacturer-supplied scanning sequence (4D-S-slow)
   and two in-house modified scanning sequences (4D-M-slow and 4D-M-fast).
   While 4D-S-slow used small field of view (FOV), partial rotation (200
   degrees), and no imaging filter, 4D-M-slow and 4D-M-fast used medium
   FOV, full rotation, and the F1 filter. The scanning speed was doubled in
   4D-M-fast (100 degrees/min gantry rotation). The image quality of the 4D
   CBCT scans was evaluated using contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR),
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and motion blurring ratio (MBR). The
   trajectory of the moving target was reconstructed by registering each
   phase of the 4D CBCT with a reference CT. The root-mean-squared-error
   (RMSE) analysis was used to quantify its accuracy. Significant decrease
   in CNR and SNR from 3D CBCT to 4D CBCT was observed. The 4D-S-slow and
   4D-M-fast scans had comparable image quality, while the 4D-M-slow scans
   had better performance due to doubled projections. Both CNR and SNR
   decreased slightly as the breathing period increased, while no
   dependence on the amplitude was observed. The difference of both CNR and
   SNR between periodic and aperiodic breathing patterns was insignificant
   (p > 0.48). At end-exhale phases, the motion blurring was negligible for
   both periodic and aperiodic breathing patterns; at mid-inhale phase, the
   motion blurring increased as the period, the amplitude or the amount of
   cycle-to-cycle variation on amplitude increased. Overall, the accuracy
   of localizing the moving target in 4D CBCT was within 2 mm under all
   studied cases. No difference in the RMSEs was noticed among the three
   scanning sequences. The 4D-M-fast scans, free of volume truncation
   artifacts, exhibited comparable image quality and accuracy in tumor
   motion reconstruction as the 4D-S-slow scans with reduced imaging dose
   (0.60 cGy vs. 0.99 cGy) due to the use of faster gantry rotation and the
   F1 filter, suggesting its suitability for clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{This article is part of a collection of articles that provides a
   comprehensive description of hydrologic and water quality (H/WQ) model
   calibration and validation concepts and processes. Sensitivity analysis
   (SA), which is often used to quantify the strength of relationships
   between model inputs and outputs, is an essential evaluation of any kind
   of modeling. SA is crucial in H/WQ models due to various aspects
   involved in H/WQ modeling processes, such as empiricism, spatiotemporal
   scales, and complexity, that require an assessment of parameters'
   influence on the model's prediction. This study synthesized SA
   applications for 25 H/WQ models in the special collection on model use,
   calibration, and validation published in 2012 and provides guidance on
   their future applications. Commonly used SA methods are summarized along
   with tools to implement them. While SA was not employed for all 25
   models in the special collection, a wide range of SA methods (from
   partial derivatives to variance-based global methods) and sensitivity
   measures (from scatter plots to variance decomposition measures) were
   used in the literature. Some model parameters were found to be important
   in most sensitivity applications performed for the models; however,
   their relative importance varied from study to study, underscoring the
   necessity of SA for every new model application. Nevertheless,
   summarizing important model parameters can still serve as a starting
   point for model users. Since most studies concentrated on model
   parameters alone; future SA applications in H/WQ modeling should also
   consider other inputs (climate data, boundary conditions, etc.) and
   non-parametric aspects, such as features and processes considered in the
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic and water quality models (HWQMs) are increasingly used to
   support decisions on various environmental issues and policy directions
   for present and future scenarios, at scales varying from watershed to
   continental levels. Uncertainty associated with such models may affect
   the ability of the models to accurately evaluate the response of complex
   systems, leading to misguided assessments and risk management decisions.
   Current well-known HWQMs contain numerous input parameters, many of
   which are not known with certainty, and in other cases model users can
   hardly recognize the genesis of uncertainty. Uncertainty in data, model
   structure, and model parameters can propagate throughout model runs,
   causing the model output to substantially deviate from the expected
   response of the natural system. Various uncertainty assessment methods
   have been used with different HWQMs, creating concerns about an adequate
   approach for handling uncertainty in these models and how such an
   approach can be implemented across various discretization complexities
   and scales. In this article, our primary intention is to review
   uncertainty in the currently used HWQMs and to provide guidance and
   useful information for researchers and investigators. In this regard, we
   explore the genesis of uncertainty in hydrologic and water quality
   modeling (i.e., spatiotemporal scales, model representation, model
   discretization, model parameterization) and provide strategies for
   assessing uncertainty in hydrologic and water quality modeling on local
   and global scales when interpreting the model output.}},

   of CoPt magnets with film thicknesses ranging from 0.5 mu m to 5 mu m

   x 50 mu m arrays) on a (100) Si substrate coated with 10 nm/100 nm Ti/Cu
   adhesion/seed layer. Results show an unexpected reduction in magnetic
   properties for films below 2 mu m thick. This effect is determined to be
   a consequence of metal-silicide reactions at the substrate interface
   during annealing leading to the formation of a non-magnetic layer at the
   interface. Subsequently, a TiN diffusion-barrier layer is added to
   inhibit the silicide reaction and thereby maintain strong magnetic
   properties (Hci similar to 800 kA/m, M-r/M-s = 0.8) in micronthick
   electroplated CoPt layers.}},

Title = {{Older Adults as Cutaway Bus Passengers}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2516}},
Pages = {{27-34}},
Abstract = {{This literature review focuses on human factors issues affecting the
   safe use of cutaway buses (i.e., a bus body carried by a van or truck
   chassis) by older adults. Cutaway buses are often used as shuttles for
   assisted living facilities, in demand-response and paratransit services
   such as dial-a-ride, and in mainstream public transportation and shuttle
   systems. Because of the scarcity of data gathered specifically on the
   subject of U.S. cutaway buses, this review uses international statistics
   on paratransit, demand response, special transportation services, and
   dial-a-ride services as substitutes, because these are the areas of
   public transportation that most frequently use such vehicles. The first
   section of the report takes a user-centered approach in reviewing some
   factors related to older adults' driving cessation and how public
   transportation systems using cutaway buses help make this life change
   easier. Also reviewed are the age-related physiological changes that
   decrease the ability of older adult passengers to withstand a motor
   vehicle crash and that limit the mobility of older adults in boarding or
   alighting the bus and navigating the cabin. The second section reviews
   bus crash statistics to understand what types of injuries and outcomes
   are associated with older passengers in different types of motor vehicle
   crashes. Finally, areas of concern and possible solutions to improve the
   safety of older adults using cutaway buses are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A self-consolidating concrete (SCC) mix was developed to accelerate the

   innovative process involving the use of temporary and reusable precast
   slabs and an SCC mix for construction of replacement slabs to reduce
   construction time and increase contractor production in concrete
   pavement rehabilitation projects. Two requirements were set for the SCC
   mix, high workability and flow rate without segregation, and a minimum
   6-h compressive strength of 2,200 pounds per square inch {[}psi (15
   MPa)] required by the Florida Department of Transportation (DOT). The
   SCC mix incorporated Grade 57 aggregate as well as a combination of
   admixtures, including a high range water reducer, workability retainer,
   water reducer and set retarder, and accelerator. Laboratory trial
   batches were prepared for the proposed mix and tested for workability
   and strength. On the basis of test results of the trial batches, the
   refined SCC mix was developed to achieve the high workability needed for
   faster concrete discharge and finish and to attain the Florida DOT's 6-h
   strength requirement of 2,200 psi (15 M-Pa) for slab replacements.}},

   the regeneration phase. The spent regenerants were more concentrated in
   PO4 than the original urine and anaerobic digester filtrate due to
   recycling of the regeneration solution. Precipitation in the spent
   regenerants and original waste waters (urine and filtrate) yielded
   96.7-99.8\% PO4 recovery as struvite or potassium struvite. Direct
   precipitation in fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine was more efficient

Abstract = {{Morphological characteristics of muscle cells, such as cross-sectional
   areas (CSAs), are critical factors to determine the muscle health.
   Automatic muscle cell segmentation is often the first prerequisite for
   quantitative analysis. In this paper, we have proposed a novel muscle
   cell segmentation algorithm that contains two steps: 1) A structured
   edge detection algorithm that can capture the inherent edge patterns of
   muscle images, and 2) a hierarchical segmentation algorithm. A set of
   nested partitions are first constructed, and a best subset selection
   algorithm is then designed to choose a maximum weighted subset of
   non-overlapping partitions as the final segmentation result. We have
   experimentally demonstrated that the proposed structured edge detection
   based hierarchical segmentation algorithm outperforms other state of the

Abstract = {{Efficient and effective cell segmentation of neuroendocrine tumor (NET)
   in whole slide scanned images is a difficult task due to a large number
   of cells. The weak or misleading cell boundaries also present
   significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a fast, high
   throughput cell segmentation algorithm by combining top-down shape
   models and bottom-up image appearance information. A scalable sparse
   manifold learning method is proposed to model multiple subpopulations of
   different cell shape priors. Followed by a shape clustering on the
   manifold, a novel affine transform-approximated active contour model is
   derived to deform contours without solving a large amount of
   computationally-expensive Euler-Lagrange equations, and thus
   dramatically reduces the computational time. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first report of a high throughput cell
   segmentation algorithm for whole slide scanned pathology specimens using
   manifold learning to accelerate active contour models. The proposed
   approach is tested using 12 NET images, and the comparative experiments
   with the state of the arts demonstrate its superior performance in terms
   of both efficiency and effectiveness.}},

   input image patch, instead of providing a single class label like many
   traditional methods, our algorithm will generate the structured outputs

   exhibit higher values for pixels near cell centers, will then be
   gathered from all testing image patches and fused to obtain the final
   proximity map, where the maximum positions indicate the cell centroids.

Abstract = {{Histopathology is crucial to diagnosis of cancer, yet its interpretation
   is tedious and challenging. To facilitate this procedure, content-based
   image retrieval methods have been developed as case-based reasoning
   tools. Recently, with the rapid growth of histopathological images,
   hashing-based retrieval approaches are gaining popularity due to their
   exceptional scalability. In this paper, we exploit a joint kernel-based
   supervised hashing (JKSH) framework for fusion of complementary
   features. Specifically, hashing functions are designed based on linearly
   combined kernel functions associated with individual features, and
   supervised information is incorporated to bridge the semantic gap
   between low-level features and high-level diagnosis. An alternating
   optimization method is utilized to learn the kernel combination and
   hashing functions. The obtained hashing functions compress
   high-dimensional features into tens of binary bits, enabling fast
   retrieval from a large database. Our approach is extensively validated
   on thousands of breast-tissue histopathological images by distinguishing
   between actionable and benign cases. It achieves 88.1\% retrieval
   precision and 91.2\% classification accuracy within 14.0 ms query time,
   comparing favorably with traditional methods.}},

   positions it votes to, and the corresponding voting confidence (used to
   weight each votes), our model can be viewed as an implicit hough-voting
   codebook. (2) We collect the weighted votes from all the testing patches

   Parzen-window estimation. The final nucleus positions are identified by
   searching the local maxima of the density map. Our method only requires

Abstract = {{Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a promising tool for accurate and

   essential steps for CAD. These tasks are challenging due to variations

   we present a cell detection and segmentation algorithm using the sparse
   reconstruction with trivial templates and a stacked denoising
   autoencoder (sDAE). The sparse reconstruction handles the shape
   variations by representing a testing patch as a linear combination of
   shapes in the learned dictionary. Trivial templates are used to model
   the touching parts. The sDAE, trained with the original data and their
   structured labels, is used for cell segmentation. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first study to apply sparse reconstruction and
   sDAE with structured labels for cell detection and segmentation. The
   proposed method is extensively tested on two data sets containing more
   than 3000 cells obtained from brain tumor and lung cancer images. Our
   algorithm achieves the best performance compared with other state of the

Abstract = {{A cooperative estimation framework is developed allowing robotic agents
   to share inter-agent and environmental measurement information which
   improves the estimation accuracy of the individual cooperating agents.
   This paper describes an extension of traditional monocular simultaneous
   localization and mapping (SLAM) enabling a distributed, networked
   approach. Noisy odometry measurements are available for each agent, and
   monocular cameras provide bearing measurements to unknown features
   observed in the environment. It is assumed that relative range and
   bearing measurements between agents are sometimes available and that
   agents can also communicate recent bearing measurements to the unknown
   features.}},

   electronic properties of 2D materials. Lattice-matching,
   symmetry-matching, substrate surface termination, configuration
   sampling, substrate induced structural distortion and doping estimation
   algorithms are being developed and will be described in this article.
   This computational tool will be employed to identify suitable substrates
   for scores of technologically relevant 2D materials, leading to

   Highway Capacity Manual}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2483}},
Pages = {{91-101}},
Abstract = {{The current version of the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM 2010) gives
   guidance on commercial truck speeds on grade through the use of truck
   speed versus distance grade curves, which are located in the HCM 2010,
   Chapter 11. These curves are designed to allow the analyst to estimate a
   commercial truck's speed after it travels on a known distance of roadway
   with a certain grade. Typically, these curves are used to determine an
   equivalent grade (incline decline and length) that will result in the
   same final speed of commercial trucks as would the series of grades
   making up a composite grade. The HCM 2010 curves were developed as a
   result of studies that used simulation tools. These simulation tools
   used a simple lookup table approach for maximum acceleration versus
   speed and did not account for commercial truck transmission gear
   changing capabilities. These shortcomings, along with changes in truck
   performance over the past 20 years, necessitate an update to the HCM
   2010 speed versus distance grade curves. This study presents the
   development of updated speed versus distance grade curves for commercial
   trucks by using TRUCKSIM. This simulation tool uses a modeling approach
   of full-vehicle dynamics, which ensures that commercial truck
   performance is accurately represented for field conditions. The results
   show that the performance of commercial trucks, as presented in the HCM
   2010, is worse than that currently observed. Therefore, the authors
   recommend that the current speed versus distance grade curves included
   in the HCM be replaced with those presented in this study.}},

Abstract = {{This research evaluated previously published trihalomethane (THM)
   formation models for their statistical robustness to be applied outside
   of their original calibration data set, and be used as a predictive tool
   at the water utility scale. All models predicted THM4 (i.e., the sum of
   the four chlorine- and bromine-containing THM species) based on the
   chlorination of natural waters and were developed using different
   combinations of precursor types (i.e., organic carbon concentration,
   UV-absorbing substances, and bromide concentration) and chlorination
   conditions (i.e., chlorine dose, pH, temperature, and time) as
   explanatory variables. All models were log (base 10) transformed into a
   common format, and were evaluated using a nationally representative
   water quality and THM4 formation data set based on the statistical
   metrics standard error, mean absolute percentage error, R-2, and
   adjusted R-2. The most robust log10(THM4) formation models had standard
   error equal to 0.226-0.262 and adjusted R-2 equal to 0.696-0.783. The
   THM4 formation models that included bromide as an explanatory variable
   tended to under predict THM4 formation as a function of increasing
   bromide concentration. Overall, the results of this research show that
   several previously published THM4 formation models were developed with
   the appropriate explanatory variables and calibrated with a sufficiently
   broad data set such that the models may give a reasonable prediction of
   THM4 formation, depending on the level of accuracy desired, for
   chlorinated water conditions separate from the original calibration data
   set. However, the majority of THM4 formation models were not sensitive
   to changing bromide concentration, and as such, under predicted THM4
   formation at bromide concentrations greater than 500 mu g/L.}},

Abstract = {{This tutorial review considers defect chemistry of TiO2 and its solid
   solutions as well as defect-related properties associated with
   solar-to-chemical energy conversion, such as Fermi level, bandgap,

   in terms of defect reactions and the related charge compensation. Defect
   equilibria are used in derivation of defect diagrams showing the effect
   of oxygen activity and temperature on the concentration of both ionic
   and electronic defects. These defect diagrams may be used for imposition
   of desired semiconducting properties that are needed to maximize the
   performance of TiO2-based photoelectrodes for the generation of solar
   hydrogen fuel using photo electrochemical cells (PECs) and
   photocatalysts for water purification. The performance of the TiO2-based
   semiconductors is considered in terms of the key performance-related
   properties (KPPs) that are defect related. It is shown that defect
   engineering may be applied for optimization of the KPPs in order to
   achieve optimum performance.}},

   N,N'-bis(acryloyl) cystamine (BAC) by reversible addition-fragmentation
   chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Kinetic studies revealed that the
   molecular weight of the resulting poly(NIPAM-co-BAC) gradually increased
   during the polymerization, and control over molecular weight and degree
   of branching was demonstrated. The hyperbranched copolymers showed
   thermo-responsive self-assembly, as determined by dynamic light
   scattering and turbidity measurements. Hyperbranched poly(NIPAM-co-BAC)
   copolymers were further used for the synthesis of star copolymers by
   chain extension with N, N-dimethylacrylamide. The resulting star
   copolymers with hyperbranched cores and linear arms were readily
   degraded under reducing conditions due to the divinyl crosslinker
   containing a redox-sensitive disulfide linkage. Not only did the
   disulfide bonds result in macromolecules with redox-responsive behavior,
   but the ability to cleave and characterize the individual branches of
   the hyperbranch polymer after synthesis allowed us to confirm the
   controlled nature of RAFT polymerization in the presence of divinyl
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The modus operandi for machine learning is to represent data as feature
   vectors and then proceed with training algorithms that seek to optimally
   partition the feature space S subset of R-n into labeled regions. This
   holds true even when the original data are functional in nature, i.e.
   curves or surfaces that are inherently varying over a continuum such as
   time or space. Functional data are often reduced to summary statistics,
   locally-sensitive characteristics, and global signatures with the
   objective of building comprehensive feature vectors that uniquely
   characterize each function. The present work directly addresses
   representational issues of functional data for supervised learning. We
   propose a novel classification by discriminative interpolation (CDI)
   framework wherein functional data in the same class are adaptively
   reconstructed to be more similar to each other, while simultaneously
   repelling nearest neighbor functional data in other classes. Akin to
   other recent nearest-neighbor metric learning paradigms like stochastic
   k-neighborhood selection and large margin nearest neighbors, our
   technique uses class-specific representations which gerrymander similar
   functional data in an appropriate parameter space. Experimental
   validation on several time series datasets establish the proposed
   discriminative interpolation framework as competitive or better in
   comparison to recent state-of-the-art techniques which continue to rely
   on the standard feature vector representation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for VoIP over WLANs, referred
   to as SRPA (Soft Reservation based Prioritized Access). To fully exploit
   the on/off characteristics of conversational speech to improve the VoIP
   capacity, SRPA adopts soft reservation where the reserved channel
   resources of voice users in silence periods can be released to support
   more backlogged voice users in talking periods. SRPA completely
   separates admitted voice users from new voice users, and the admitted
   voice users are given higher priority access to the channel, based on
   the fact that maintaining the QoS requirements of admitted voice calls
   is more important than admitting new voice calls. The dedicated
   contention period for admitted voice users is contention backoff window
   whose size is dynamically adjusted on the basis of estimation of the
   number of contending voice users. In addition, a two-state Markov model
   is derived for the proposed scheme to analyze the VoIP capacity. Both
   analysis and simulation results demonstrate that SRPA significantly
   improves the VoIP capacity while guaranteeing the strict QoS
   requirements of admitted voice calls in WLANs.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution monitoring systems attract much attention recently due to

   resource management scheme, by which the physical resource blocks (PRBs)
   are allocated to the wireless links to minimize the long-term overall
   energy consumption, taking into account the packet priority, size,
   delays as well as the wireless channel state. The resource management
   optimization problem is formulated as a restless bandits model with
   constraints, which is further reformulated as a restless bandits model
   for efficient solutions. Extensive simulation results are also presented

Title = {{Remotely Triggered Activation of TGF-beta With Magnetic Nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Abstract = {{Growth factors or cytokines have demonstrated the potential to alter and
   manipulate the biological activity of cells via binding and activation
   of cell surface receptors. Changes induced by cytokines can range from
   simple changes in the cellular motility and proliferation to more
   complex biological actions, such as stem-cell differentiation.
   Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) exhibits the typical
   functionality of a growth factor, as it is pleiotropic and causes myriad
   responses in a number of cell types. This multifunctional nature gives
   the TGF-beta a great potential for therapeutic applications-particularly
   in regenerative medicine. However, this multifunctionality till now has
   limited its usage in vivo, since upon injection, the cytokine may
   activate nefarious signaling pathways, such as those associated with
   tumor formation. In addition to this problem, the short half-lives of
   cytokines also places constraints on their delivery, as the majority of
   the injected biomolecule will not have a sufficient biological lifetime
   to reach the desired target location. Therefore, the methods of
   targeting the growth factors to specific sites in the body will prove
   crucial to their successful clinical implementation. Here, we describe a
   novel growth-factor targeting and activation strategy based on the
   delivery of energy from external alternating magnetic fields to magnetic
   nanoparticles to which a latent TGF-beta has been conjugated. We
   demonstrate the successful conjugation of a latent TGF-beta to the
   surface of poly(ethylene glycol)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles, and
   subsequent triggered release of an active TGF-beta from its latent
   complex on the application of an external radio frequency magnetic
   field. This preliminary study highlights the potential of magnetic
   activation to remotely control the TGF-beta activity in vivo, reducing
   the dangerous off-target side effects and offering a path to clinical
   implementation of this growth factor for regenerative medicine
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR was applied to measure tortuosity
   factors for carbon dioxide diffusion in the Knudsen and gas regimes
   inside monoliths of a samaria-alumina aerogel catalyst, a high porosity
   material containing micropores in addition to meso- and macropores. The
   apparent tortuosity factor obtained from PFG NMR measurements for the
   Knudsen diffusion in the meso- and macropores of the catalyst has an
   unexpectedly large value of approximately 6 if carbon dioxide adsorption
   in the micropores and other types of surface adsorption sites of the
   catalyst is ignored. At the same time, the corresponding apparent
   tortuosity factor in the gas regime was found to be around 2.
   Application of a proposed model which describes fast molecular exchange
   between the surface adsorption sites and the main pore volume of the
   catalyst yields corrected tortuosity factors which depend only on the
   pore system geometry. Using this model, the corrected tortuosity factors
   were found to be around 2 for both diffusion regimes, in agreement with
   the expectations based on a high porosity of the studied catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Parahydrogen induced polarization using heterogeneous catalysis can
   produce impurity-free hyperpolarized gases and liquids, but the
   comparatively low signal enhancements and limited scope of substrates
   that can be polarized pose significant challenges to this approach. This
   study explores the surface processes affecting the disposition of the
   bilinear spin order derived from parahydrogen in the hydrogenation of
   propyne over TiO2-supported Pt nanoparticles. The hyperpolarized adducts
   formed at low magnetic field are adiabatically transported to high field
   for analysis by proton NMR spectroscopy at 400 MHz. For the first time,
   the stereoselectivity of pairwise addition to propyne is measured as a
   function of reaction conditions. The correlation between partial
   reduction selectivity and stereoselectivity of pairwise addition is
   revealed. The systematic trends are rationalized in terms of a hybrid
   mechanism incorporating non-traditional concerted addition steps and
   well-established reversible step-wise addition involving the formation
   of a surface bound 2-propyl intermediate.}},

   control of VAV terminal units}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{469-480}},
Abstract = {{Results are presented from a nearly week-long experimental evaluation of
   a scalable control algorithm for a commercial building HVAC system based
   on real-time measurements of occupancy obtained from motion detectors.
   The control algorithm decides air flow rate and amount of reheat for
   each variable air volume terminal box based on real-time measurements of
   occupancy and space temperature. It is a rule-based controller, so the
   control computations are simple. The experiments showed that the
   proposed controller resulted in 37\% energy savings over baseline on
   average without sacrificing indoor climate. In contrast to prior work
   that reports energy savings without a careful measure of the effect on
   indoor climate, it is verified that the controller indeed maintains
   indoor climate as well as the building's baseline controller does. This
   verification is performed from measurements of a host of environmental
   variables and analysis of before/after occupant survey results. A
   complete system required to retrofit existing buildings with the
   controller is presented, which includes a wireless sensor network and a
   software execution platform. Two useful observations from this work are:
   (i) considerable energy savings-along with compliance with ASHRAE
   ventilation standards-are possible with simple occupancy-based control
   algorithms that are easy to retrofit; and (ii) these savings are
   attained with binary occupancy measurements from motion detectors that
   do not provide occupancy-count measurements. Results also show that
   there is a large variation in energy savings from zone to zone and from
   day to day.}},

Title = {{Core-Level Modeling and Frequency Prediction for DSP Applications on
   FPGAs}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RECONFIGURABLE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide a promising technology
   that can improve performance of many high-performance computing and
   embedded applications. However, unlike software design tools, the
   relatively immature state of FPGA tools significantly limits
   productivity and consequently prevents widespread adoption of the
   technology. For example, the lengthy design-translate-execute (DTE)
   process often must be iterated to meet the application requirements.
   Previous works have enabled model-based, design-space exploration to
   reduce DTE iterations but are limited by a lack of accurate model-based
   prediction of key design parameters, the most important of which is
   clock frequency. In this paper, we present a core-level modeling and
   design (CMD) methodology that enables modeling of FPGA applications at
   an abstract level and yet produces accurate predictions of parameters
   such as clock frequency, resource utilization (i.e., area), and latency.
   We evaluate CMD's prediction methods using several high-performance DSP
   applications on various families of FPGAs and show an average
   clock-frequency prediction error of 3.6\%, with a worst-case error of
   20.4\%, compared to the best of existing high-level prediction methods,
   13.9\% average error with 48.2\% worst-case error. We also demonstrate
   how such prediction enables accurate design-space exploration without
   coding in a hardware-description language (HDL), significantly reducing
   the total design time.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise applications need sophisticated in-database analytics in
   addition to traditional online analytical processing from a database. To
   meet customers' pressing demands, database vendors have been pushing
   advanced analytical techniques into databases. Most major DBMSes offer
   User-Defined Aggregate (UDA), a data-driven operator, to implement many
   of the analytical techniques in parallel. However, UDAs can not be used
   to implement statistical algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC), where most of the work is performed by iterative transitions
   over a large state that can not be naively partitioned due to data
   dependency. Typically, this type of statistical algorithm requires
   pre-processing to setup the large state in the first place and demands
   post-processing after the statistical inference. This paper presents
   General Iterative State Transition (GIST), a new database operator for
   parallel iterative state transitions over large states. GIST receives a
   state constructed by a UDA, and then performs rounds of transitions on
   the state until it converges. A final UDA performs post-processing and
   result extraction. We argue that the combination of UDA and GIST
   (UDA-GIST) unifies data-parallel and state-parallel processing in a
   single system, thus significantly extending the analytical capabilities
   of DBMSes. We exemplify the framework through two high-profile
   applications: cross-document coreference and image denoising. We show
   that the in-database framework allows us to tackle a 27 times larger
   problem than solved by the state-of-the-art for the first application
   and achieves 43 times speedup over the state-of-the-art for the second
   application.}},

Title = {{A Support Vector Regression Approach for Investigating Multianticipative
   Driving Behavior}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a Support Vector Regression (SVR) approach that can
   be applied to predict the multianticipative driving behavior using
   vehicle trajectory data. Building upon the SVR approach, a
   multianticipative car-following model is developed and enhanced in
   learning speed and predication accuracy. The model training and
   validation are conducted by using the field trajectory data extracted
   from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) project. During the model
   training and validation tests, the estimation results show that the SVR
   model performs as well as IDM model with respect to the model prediction
   accuracy. In addition, this paper performs a relative importance
   analysis to quantify the multianticipation in terms of the different
   stimuli to which drivers react in platoon car following. The analysis
   results confirm that drivers respond to the behavior of not only the
   immediate leading vehicle in front but also the second, third, and even
   fourth leading vehicles. Specifically, in congested traffic conditions,
   drivers are observed to be more sensitive to the relative speed than to
   the gap. These findings provide insight into multianticipative driving
   behavior and illustrate the necessity of taking into account
   multianticipative car-following model in microscopic traffic simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Chilldown or quenching is a complicated process that initiates the
   cryogenic fluid line transport, and it involves unsteady two-phase heat
   and mass transfer. To advance our understanding of this process, we have
   reviewed recent experimental investigations. The chilldown process can
   be generally divided into three regimes: film boiling, transition
   boiling and nucleate boiling, and each regime is associated with a
   different flow pattern and heat transfer mechanism. Under low flow rate
   conditions, it is concluded that the two-phase flow regime is dispersed
   flow in the film boiling regime. The dispersed liquid phase is in the
   form of long filaments as the transport line is chilled down, and the
   vapor phase is generally superheated. Microgravity experiment for line
   chilldown was conducted basically in the film boiling region. Bottom
   wall heat flux was found to decrease under microgravity condition. Under
   the experimental condition, the gravity effect does not show a strong
   dependence on wall temperature and inlet flow rate.}},

Abstract = {{The overall goal of this study was to develop a machine vision system to
   quantify dropped citrus fruits on the ground. Specific objectives were:
   (1) to build a machine vision system suitable for citrus grove field
   conditions, (2) to develop an image enhancement algorithm for varying
   illumination conditions, and (3) to develop an image processing
   algorithm to estimate citrus fruit drop count and mass. The image
   processing algorithm consisted of (1) illumination enhancement using a
   retinex algorithm, (2) classification, (3) segmentation using a
   watershed algorithm with h-minima transform, and (4) ellipse fitting for
   mass estimation. Performances of the algorithms were evaluated in terms
   of correct identification and false positive errors. The average correct
   identification rate was 88.1\%, 83.6\%, and 82.9\% for logistic
   regression, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and Bayesian classifiers,
   respectively. False positive errors were 13.7\%, 40.9\%, and 17.9\% for
   logistic regression, kNN, Bayesian classifiers, respectively. The
   results demonstrate the system's ability to quantify dropped fruits with
   specific geo-referenced location information. Spatially varied fruit
   drop maps plotted from the results can assist growers in finding
   problematic areas in their citrus groves more efficiently while reducing
   inspection and treatment costs. Such maps can also facilitate treatment
   of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) disease in combination with HLB intensity
   data, psyllid counts, fertilization programs, and other block-specific
   management practices.}},

Title = {{OPTIMIZATION OF A CITRUS CANOPY SHAKER HARVESTING SYSTEM: PROPERTIES AND

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a part of the research work for the design and
   optimization of a fruit tree harvesting system using numerical methods.
   The analytical framework for the optimization is formulated based on a
   continuous canopy shaker that harvests citrus crops, primarily Valencia
   oranges ( Citrus sinensis). Tree limbs are modeled analytically in the
   numerical based design optimization of a shaker that requires
   information regarding the limb configuration and properties. The
   objective of this study is to formulate a mathematical model to predict
   the configuration of primary limbs and to determine the properties of
   citrus wood. The tree limbs, thus proposed, are statistical prototypes
   or representations that account for the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th
   percentiles of actual tree limbs from random individual citrus trees.
   Polynomial response surface models were developed to predict sectional
   properties of the statistical model of the tree limbs. The distributions
   of the secondary branches and fruits were also predicted to model their
   effect on the dynamic response of the tree limbs. A three-point bending
   test, specific gravity test, moisture content test, and damping test
   were conducted on freshly cut samples of citrus wood. An elastic modulus
   of 8.5 GPa and modulus of rupture of 67.3 MPa were calculated from a
   load-deflection curve, and a density of 1450.8 kg m-(3), moisture
   content of 42\%, and damping ratio of 10.78 were measured. Although the
   proposed methodology was developed for a canopy shaker, it could be
   easily implemented for other vibratory harvesters, such as limb shakers,
   foliage shakers, and over-the-row harvesters.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5662-5669}},
Abstract = {{The surface-localized hyperthermia of gold nanoparticles under microwave
   irradiation was examined. Gold nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic
   diameter of similar to 6 nm stabilized by polymeric ``thermometers{''}
   were used to gather information on the extent of heating as well as its
   spatial confinements. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer
   polymerization was employed to synthesize well-defined, functional
   polymers of predetermined molecular weights, allowing for estimation of
   the distance between the nanoparticle surface and the polymer chain end.
   The polymers were conjugated with a fluorescent dye separated by a
   thermally-labile azo linkage, and these polymeric ligands were bound to
   gold nanoparticles via gold-thiolate bonds. Conventional heating
   experiments elucidated the relationship between temperature and the
   extent of dye release from the gold nanoparticle using fluorescence
   spectroscopy. The local temperature increase experienced under microwave
   irradiation was calculated using the same methodology. This approach
   indicated the temperature near the surface of the nanoparticle was
   nearly 70 degrees C higher than the bulk solution temperature, but
   decreased rapidly with distance, with no noticeable temperature increase
   when the azo linkage was approximately 2 nm away.}},

Abstract = {{130 nm FeF2 films were deposited on AISI 304 steel substrates by pulsed
   laser deposition for use as cathodes in lithium ion batteries (LIBs).
   Aluminum and steel leads pouch cells as well as coin cell battery
   configurations were used to determine the effect of cell materials on
   galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetry tests. It was observed that there
   is a large increase in measured capacity for FeF2 films cycled using
   pouch cells with steel leads relative to pouch cells using aluminum
   leads. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging showed similar
   microstructural behavior of the cycled FeF2 films irrespective of the
   use of steel leads or aluminum leads. Results of X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and galvanostatic testing on bare stainless steel
   substrates suggest that the increase in capacity for cell configurations
   using steel components is due to the cycling of surface iron oxides and
   this can be avoided through the use of Al leads. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

   Fatigue Endurance Data}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{815-828}},
Abstract = {{The load-life exponents used in the modified life rating equation for
   rolling element bearings were determined by statistical analysis of the
   experimental data generated in the 1940s, following Lundberg and
   Palmgren's seminal work. Based on fracture mechanics arguments, the
   fatigue life is known to be inversely proportional to the square root of
   the size of the nonmetallic inclusions. However, modern high-performance
   vacuum induction melt-vacuum arc remelt (VIMVAR) bearing steels are
   clean and nonmetallic inclusions are no longer the weak link. Fatigue
   life predictions (L-10 life) for modern bearings using the modified
   load-life relations greatly underpredict observed life. Hence, there is
   a need to update parameters of these equations using more recent life
   data. Based on the endurance data reported in Harris and McCool (1),
   validation analysis of the modified life rating equation was performed
   to reevaluate the values of load-life exponent for both ball and
   cylindrical roller bearings. The results from this study indicate that
   the load-life exponent for ball bearings should be 4.1, instead of 3,
   and for roller bearings it should be 5.5, instead of 3.33. Bearing L-10
   life calculated using the corrected load-life exponents values shows
   better agreement with observed life. Details of the sampling technique
   used for reducing epistemic uncertainty in experimental data and the
   process of statistical reevaluation using Bayesian updating are
   discussed in detail. The accuracy of reevaluated results is presented
   using logarithmic plots of the ratio of predicted to actual fatigue
   lives for all data samples.}},

   variations at a regional scale is important for predicting regional crop
   production. In this study, a statistical method was used to quantify the
   relationship between reported shire wheat yields and climate factors
   during the wheat-growing season across the New South Wales (NSW) wheat
   belt in eastern Australia from 1922 to 2000. The results show that
   recent climatic trends have increased wheat yield by 8.5 to 21.2\% in 4
   different climatic regions of NSW over the last few decades: In the
   eastern slopes, growing season maximum and minimum temperatures and
   number of heat stress days (>34 degrees C) were identified as the
   dominant climatic factors affecting wheat yield, accounting for 36\% of
   its variation. The wheat yield variation in the remaining 3 regions were
   as follows: 41\% in the northern region from maximum temperature,
   pre-growing season rainfall (December to April), and number of frost
   days (<2 degrees C); 47\% in the south from rainfall, temperature, and
   number of frost and heat stress days; while in southwest NSW, rainfall
   was the main factor responsible for 31\% of the variation. Frost was
   less important in the eastern slopes because farmers manage frost
   occurrence by sowing late and using late-flowering cultivars. However,
   the opposite occurs in the northern parts of the wheat belt where
   farmers sow earlier and select short-season varieties to avoid heat
   stress, but thereby expose their crops to possible frost conditions.
   Understanding the impact of climate variations on crop yield is
   important for developing sustainable agricultural production under
   future climate change.}},

Abstract = {{A series of poly(p-phenylene alkylene)s with methylene run lengths
   ranging from 8 to 40 were obtained by ADMET polymerization of
   symmetrical alpha,omega-diene monomers and subsequent exhaustive
   hydrogenation. ADMET polymerizations were conducted using dibenzyl
   carbonate as solvent for the first time, providing materials with high
   molecular weights as compared with those obtained in standard
   solvent-free conditions. The thermal properties of both the unsaturated
   and saturated series were investigated. Poly(p-phenylene alkylene)s
   exhibit an unprecedented thermal behaviour when considering the fusion
   temperature as a function of the number of methylene spacers. Solid
   state H-1 MAS and H-1-C-13 correlation experiments demonstrated that the
   melting behavior is marked by the gradual disruption of the ring pi-pi
   interactions with increasing methylene chain length. The higher
   crystallization tendency of longer alkyl chains was detected by the
   characteristic broadening of the corresponding solid-state H-1 NMR
   signals and explains the observed increase in melting temperature with
   the methylene chain length.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{83}},
Pages = {{67971-67978}},
Abstract = {{Bimetal adsorbents attract much attention because of their good sorption
   ability to arsenate (As(V)). In this work, biochar-supported bimetal
   adsorbents were prepared through either direct pyrolysis of Fe and Mn
   ion treated pinewood biomass (FMM) or co-precipitation of Fe and Mn ions
   onto pinewood biochar (FMB). The two Fe-Mn biochar composites were
   characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
   energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) analyses. Characterization results suggest
   that maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) and manganosite (MnO) are the dominant
   metal crystals in FMM, while manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4) is the dominant
   bimetal crystal in FMB. Batch sorption experiments showed that the
   maximal As(V) sorption of FMB and FMM was 3.44 and 0.50 g kg(-1)
   respectively, which are higher than that of the unmodified biochar.
   As(V) sorption by FMM and FMB decreased with increasing solution pH
   (between 3-9). Results of this work suggest that co-precipitation is
   more effective in preparing magnetic Fe-Mn biochar composites for As(V)
   removal.}},

Abstract = {{Foodborne outbreaks caused by Listeria monocytogenes continue to raise
   major public health concerns worldwide. In the United States alone, the
   centers for disease control and prevention have confirmed the occurrence
   of 183 cases of listeriosis with 39 fatalities within the last 3 years.
   Standard methods for the detection of pathogenic strains require up to 7
   days to yield results, thus faster techniques with the same level of
   reliability for bacteria detection are desirable. This study reports on
   the development of a rapid, accurate, and sensitive electrochemical
   biosensor for rapid testing of Listeria spp. based on the selective
   binding of InlA aptamers to internalins in the cell membrane of the
   target bacteria. Hybrid nanomaterial platforms based on reduced graphene
   oxide and nanoplatinum were deposited onto Pt/Ir electrodes for
   enhancing electrochemical transduction during the recognition events.
   InlA aptamers were immobilized onto the nanomaterial platforms via
   metal-thiol adsorption. Aptamer loading onto different platform
   nanostructures was investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The detection mechanism
   was evaluated by recording the electrochemical response to several
   bacterial dilutions in PBS buffer using the non-pathogenic species
   Listeria innocua. These preliminary results show that the aptasensor can
   be tuned for detection of Listeria concentrations as low as 100 CFU/ml
   in less than 3 hours (including incubation time and data analysis). The
   developed aptasensor opens a promising direction for rapid testing of
   Listeria monocytogenes in food products.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of preemptive scheduling in a
   two-stage supply chain framework. The supply chain environment contains
   two stages: production and transportation. In the production stage n
   jobs are processed on a manufacturer's bounded serial batching machine,
   preemptions are allowed, and set-up time is required before a new batch
   is processed. In the transportation stage each batch is delivered to a
   customer by a single vehicle. The objective is to minimize the makespan
   by making decisions for both mutually coordinated stages. Specifically,
   two versions are studied. The first one is that all jobs are available
   to be processed at time zero, and the second one is that jobs have
   different release times. An Omicron(n log n) time algorithm is developed
   for the first version, and we show that it can produce the optimal
   schedule for the entire problem. For the second version, based on some
   useful properties we have designed an Omicron(n log n) time heuristic
   and a novel lower bound. The worst-case performance ratio of our
   algorithm is bounded by 2. Our computational study with random instances
   of different scales shows high-quality solutions for either small-scale
   or large-scale instances returned in a reasonable PC times.}},

Title = {{Parking Reservation for Managing Downtown Curbside Parking}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2498}},
Pages = {{12-18}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses a smartphone-based parking reservation system that
   manages a finite number of curbside parking spaces located at various
   places in a downtown area. Parking reservation schemes are designed to
   minimize the total social cost of parking, which is assumed to be a
   weighted sum of the cruising times for drivers to travel from their
   current locations to allocated parking spaces and the walking times from
   parking places to final destinations. With the assumption of perfect
   information on cruising and walking times, a simple reservation scheme
   to achieve an optimum allocation of parking spaces is presented.
   However, although the locations of drivers can be retrieved from their
   smartphones, it is shown that drivers have an incentive to misreport
   their final destinations for their own benefit, which compromises the
   system benefit. Thus, the Vickrey-Clark-Groves mechanism is applied to
   determine the allocation of parking spaces and parking fees to minimize
   the total social cost while ensuring that all drivers report their final
   destinations truthfully. Last, a revenue redistribution scheme to reduce
   drivers' financial burden further and increase public acceptance of the
   reservation system is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The challenging goal of LISA-Pathfinder in terms of maximum
   non-gravitational forces applied on the test mass poses tight
   constraints on the design of the Gravitational Reference Sensor. In
   particular, large gaps (3-4 mm) must exist between the test mass and its
   housing and any system there located must be either gold coated or made
   of a gold-based material. As a consequence, a significant adhesion may
   arise between the test mass and the mechanism designed to cage it during
   the spacecraft launch and to release it to free-fall. The criticality of
   the latter phase is enhanced by the control force authority exerted to
   the test mass by the surrounding electrodes. Such a force is limited by
   the large gaps (order of mu N). Since the expected adhesion force
   between the test mass and its holding devices is much larger than the
   force authority, a dynamic release must be realized. However, following
   this procedure adhesion converts into test mass velocity, which can be
   controlled by the capacitive force only if it is smaller than 5 mu m/s.
   At the University of Trento (Italy) the Transferred Momentum Measurement
   Facility has been designed and developed to measure the impulse produced
   by metallic adhesion upon quick rupture, in representative conditions of
   the LISA-Pathfinder test mass release to free-fall. Large sets of data
   have been collected and a mathematical model of the in-flight release
   dynamics has been developed, in order to estimate the test mass release
   velocity. A summary of the results is presented, together with an
   overview of the recent developments and a prediction of the in-flight
   performance.}},

Title = {{Self-healing hydrogels containing reversible oxime crosslinks}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{30}},
Pages = {{6152-6161}},
Abstract = {{Self-healing oxime-functional hydrogels have been developed that undergo
   a reversible gel-to-sol transition via oxime exchange under acidic
   conditions. Keto-functional copolymers were prepared by conventional
   radical polymerization of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and diacetone
   acrylamide (DAA). The resulting water soluble copolymers
   (P(DMA-stat-DAA)) were chemically crosslinked with difunctional
   alkoxyamines to obtain hydrogels via oxime formation. Gel-to-sol
   transitions were induced by the addition of excess monofunctional
   alkoxyamines to promote competitive oxime exchange under acidic
   conditions at 25 degrees C. The hydrogel could autonomously heal after
   it was damaged due to the dynamic nature of the oxime crosslinks. In
   addition to their chemo-responsive behavior, the P(DMA-stat-DAA)
   copolymers exhibit cloud points which vary with the DAA content in the
   copolymers. This thermo-responsive behavior of the P(DMA-stat-DAA) was
   utilized to form physical hydrogels above their cloud point. Therefore,
   these materials can either form dynamic-covalent or
   physically-crosslinked gels, both of which demonstrate reversible
   gelation behavior.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY}},

Abstract = {{Characterization is a crucial step in the study of properties of
   nanomaterials to evaluate their full potential in applications. Carbon
   nanotube-based materials have properties that are sensitive to size,
   shape, concentration, and agglomeration state. It is therefore critical
   to quantitatively characterize these factors in situ, while the
   processing takes place. Traditional characterization techniques that
   rely on microscopy are often time consuming and in most cases provide
   qualitative results. Spectroscopy has been studied as an alternative
   tool for identifying, characterizing, and studying these materials in
   situ and in a quantitative way. In this paper, we provide a critical
   review of the spectroscopy techniques used to explore the surface
   properties (e.g., dispersion) characteristics of carbon nanotubes in
   aqueous suspensions during the sonication process.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new stochastic algorithm, namely, the
   stochastic block mirror descent (SBMD) method for solving large-scale
   nonsmooth and stochastic optimization problems. The basic idea of this
   algorithm is to incorporate block coordinate decomposition and an
   incremental block averaging scheme into the classic (stochastic) mirror
   descent method, in order to significantly reduce the cost per iteration
   of the latter algorithm. We establish the rate of convergence of the
   SBMD method along with its associated large-deviation results for
   solving general nonsmooth and stochastic optimization problems. We also
   introduce variants of this method and establish their rate of
   convergence for solving strongly convex, smooth, and composite
   optimization problems, as well as certain nonconvex optimization
   problems. To the best of our knowledge, all these developments related
   to the SBMD methods are new in the stochastic optimization literature.
   Moreover, some of our results seem to be new for block coordinate
   descent methods for deterministic optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogel microparticles are particularly attractive for pulmonary drug
   delivery. Their size can be engineered for efficient delivery into the
   bronchi, where they subsequently swell, avoiding macrophage uptake. In
   this study, enzyme-responsive peptide functionalized poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG) based hydrogel microparticles were synthesized by an
   emulsion polymerization. Here, we demonstrate that these microparticles
   are nontoxic and demonstrated their viability as a drug carrier by
   studying the encapsulation and release of three types of drugs: a
   hydrophobic (dexamethasone), a hydrophilic (methylene blue) and a
   protein (horseradish peroxidase)-based drug. The release of each of
   these three drugs was studied in the presence of varying concentrations
   of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). Each of the three types of drugs were
   able to be encapsulated in the microparticles, and we further showed
   that the protein is still functional after release.}},

   Complex Social Networks}},
Booktitle = {{OPPORTUNISTIC MOBILE SOCIAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Pages = {{37-69}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, social influence is ubiquitous in everyday life, online social
   networks have become a focal point for research in science. Formal
   mathematical models for the analysis of the spread of social influence
   have emerged as a major topic of interest in diverse areas such as
   sociology, economics, and computer science. Empirical studies of
   diffusion on social networks date back to the 1940s. Later on,
   theoretical propagation models were introduced in late 1970s. Then,
   motivated by the design of marketing strategy, and the formal definition
   of the problem of influence maximization, the field of studying social
   influence has received lots of research interest. In particular, the
   rapid growth of online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and
   Google+ has intensified interest in this field, and the past decade has
   seen a burgeoning network literature from the computer community.
   In this chapter, our goal is to provide readers with a comprehensive
   review of this burgeoning literature. We begin with an overview of
   widely used theoretical diffusion models, in which there are three
   families of diffusion models: threshold models, cascading models, and
   epidemic models. Our subsequent discussion mainly focuses on the recent
   algorithmic study and analytical results of the influence maximization
   problem. We end with a discussion of some open problems and challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Power mismatching between supply and demand has emerged as a top issue
   in modern datacenters that are under-provisioned or powered by
   intermittent power supplies. Recent proposals are primarily limited to
   leveraging uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to handle power
   mismatching, and therefore lack the capability of efficiently handling
   the irregular peak power mismatches. In this paper we propose hPower,
   the first heterogeneous energy buffering strategy that incorporates
   supercapacitors into existing datacenters to handle power mismatch. Our
   technique exploits power supply diversity and smart load assignment to
   provide efficiency-aware and emergency-aware power mismatch management.
   We show that hPower could improve energy efficiency by 30 percent,
   extend UPS lifetime by 4.3 x, and reduce system downtime by 36 percent.
   It allows datacenters to adapt themselves to various power supply
   anomalies, thereby improving operational efficiency and resiliency.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, direct numerical simulations of a turbulent free jet (Re
   = 2000), a lazy plume (root Gr = 2000), and a forced plume (Re = 1684,
   Ri = 0.025) are compared. The evolution of the various fluxes and the
   so-called source parameter, Gamma, are examined as a function of
   distance from the source. The first-, second-, and third-order
   statistics of the flows are calculated and discussed. The radial
   profiles of such statistics, as well as that of the turbulent kinetic
   energy balance and other second-order transport equations are examined
   at two axial distances, one axial distance before the flows have
   adjusted to their similarity solution, and the other beyond the
   similarity adjustment length scale. Vortical structures are visualised
   and discussed along with entrainment. The source term Gamma was not
   found to monotonically decrease with axial distance from the source as
   predicted by past researchers. While the mean flow and turbulent
   velocity statistics of the simulated lazy and forced plumes took on
   similar behaviour far from the sources turbulent statistics which
   involve buoyancy did not.}},

Abstract = {{This study shows that revising the reaction rate of NO2 + HO center dot
   -> HNO3 improves simulated nitrogen partitioning and changes the
   simulated radiative effects of several short-lived climate forcers
   (SLCF). Both laboratory and field study analyses have found that the
   reaction rate should be reduced by 13-30\% from current recommendations.
   We evaluate the GEOS-Chem model over North America with and without the
   recommended update using observations from the Intercontinental Chemical
   Transport Experiment - North America (INTEX-NA) Phase A campaign.
   Revising the NO2 + HO center dot -> HNO3 rate coefficient improves model
   performance of oxidized nitrogen partitioning by increasing NOx
   concentrations in the upper troposphere and decreasing HNO3 throughout
   the troposphere. The increase in NOx concentrations has a corresponding
   global increase in O-3 concentrations and local increases in sulfate
   aerosols, causing a perturbation in simulated radiative effects. These
   findings demonstrate the positive influence the mechanism update has on
   the partitioning of oxidized nitrogen species, the benefits it provides
   when compared to aircraft observations, and the simulated radiative
   effects that the reduction induces.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional nanostructures such as nanowires, nanorods, and
   nanotubes with piezoelectric properties have gained interest in the
   fabrication of small scale power harvesting systems. However, the
   practical applications of the nanoscale materials in structures with
   true mechanical strengths have not yet been demonstrated. In this paper,
   piezoelectric ZnO nanowires are integrated into the fiber reinforced
   polymer composites serving as an active phase to convert the induced
   strain energy from ambient vibration into electrical energy. Arrays of
   ZnO nanowires are grown vertically aligned on aramid fibers through a
   low-cost hydrothermal process. The modified fabrics with ZnO nanowires
   whiskers are then placed between two carbon fabrics as the top and the
   bottom electrodes. Finally, vacuum resin transfer molding technique is
   utilized to fabricate these multiscale composites. The fabricated
   composites are subjected to a base excitation using a shaker to generate
   charge due to the direct piezoelectric effect of ZnO nanowires.
   Measuring the generated potential difference between the two electrodes
   showed the energy harvesting application of these multiscale composites
   in addition to their superior mechanical properties. These results
   propose a new generation of power harvesting systems with enhanced
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) microwires with applications in sensors,
   actuators, and energy harvesters are produced using hydrothermal
   synthesis. The synthesized microwires are relatively large with an
   average length of about 450 microns and an average width of 4 microns.
   Each of these individual PZT microwires can be integrated in smart
   systems as an active phase or be used as an independent smart material.
   In this paper, the synthesis procedure and characterization of these
   large microwires is demonstrated. The converse piezoelectric properties
   of the microwires are measured using digital image correlation after
   clamping and adding electrodes at each end of the microwire. It has been
   shown in the literature that digital image correlation can be used as a
   precise tool for rapid characterization of piezoelectric materials.
   Here, it is demonstrated that this technique can be applied to
   characterize the actual response of piezoelectric materials at the
   micron scale.}},

Pages = {{2133-2144}},
Abstract = {{Self-organized landscape patterning can arise in response to multiple
   processes. Discriminating among alternative patterning mechanisms,
   particularly where experimental manipulations are untenable, requires
   process-based models. Previous modeling studies have attributed
   patterning in the Everglades (Florida, USA) to sediment redistribution
   and anisotropic soil hydraulic properties. In this work, we tested an
   alternate theory, the self-organizing-canal (SOC) hypothesis, by
   developing a cellular automata model that simulates pattern evolution
   via local positive feedbacks (i.e., facilitation) coupled with a global
   negative feedback based on hydrology. The model is forced by global
   hydroperiod that drives stochastic transitions between two patch types:
   ridge (higher elevation) and slough (lower elevation). We evaluated
   model performance using multiple criteria based on six statistical and
   geostatistical properties observed in reference portions of the
   Everglades landscape: patch density, patch anisotropy, semivariogram
   ranges, power-law scaling of ridge areas, perimeter area fractal
   dimension, and characteristic pattern wavelength. Model results showed
   strong statistical agreement with reference landscapes, but only when
   anisotropically acting local facilitation was coupled with hydrologic
   global feedback, for which several plausible mechanisms exist.
   Critically, the model correctly generated fractal landscapes that had no
   characteristic pattern wavelength, supporting the invocation of global
   rather than scale-specific negative feedbacks.}},

Title = {{Effects of Dopant Metal Variation and Material Synthesis Method on the
   Material Properties of Mixed Metal Ferrites in Yttria Stabilized
   Zirconia for Solar Thermochemical Fuel Production}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Mixed metal ferrites have shown much promise in two-step
   solar-thermochemical fuel production. Previous work has typically
   focused on evaluating a particular metal ferrite produced by a
   particular synthesis process, which makes comparisons between studies
   performed by independent researchers difficult. A comparative study was
   undertaken to explore the effects different synthesis methods have on
   the performance of a particular material during redox cycling using
   thermogravimetry. This study revealed that materials made via wet
   chemistry methods and extended periods of high temperature calcination
   yield better redox performance. Differences in redox performance between
   materials made via wet chemistry methods were minimal and these
   demonstrated much better performance than those synthesized via the
   solid state method. Subsequently, various metal ferrite samples
   (NiFe2O4, MgFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and MnFe2O4) in yttria stabilized zirconia
   (8YSZ) were synthesized via coprecipitation and tested to determine the
   most promising metal ferrite combination. It was determined that 10
   wt.\% CoFe2O4 in 8YSZ produced the highest and most consistent yields of
   O-2 and CO. By testing the effects of synthesis methods and dopants in a
   consistent fashion, those aspects of ferrite preparation which are most
   significant can be revealed. More importantly, these insights can guide
   future efforts in developing the next generation of thermochemical fuel
   production materials.}},

Abstract = {{Solid block polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for the
   development of high energy density rechargeable lithium metal based
   batteries. All solid-state batteries comprising lithium metal negative
   electrode and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) composite positive
   electrode were assembled. A polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO)
   copolymer doped with a lithium salt was used as the electrolyte. After
   cycling the batteries, the reason for capacity fade and failure was
   determined by imaging the batteries using synchrotron hard X-ray
   microtomography. These experiments revealed partial delamination of the
   lithium foil and the block copolymer electrolyte layer. The void volume
   between the foil and electrolyte layer obtained after 40 to 90 cycles is
   comparable to volume change in the battery during one cycle. A simple
   model to account for the effect of delamination on current density in
   the battery is presented. Capacity fade and battery failures observed in
   our experiments are consistent with this model. No evidence of lithium
   dendrite formation was found. In contrast, cycled lithium-lithium
   symmetric cells with the same polymer electrolyte at the same current
   density failed due to dendrite formation. No evidence of delamination
   was found in these cells. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS. All

Title = {{Improvement Schemes for Indoor Mobile Location Estimation: A Survey}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Location estimation is significant in mobile and ubiquitous computing
   systems. The complexity and smaller scale of the indoor environment
   impose a great impact on location estimation. The key of location
   estimation lies in the representation and fusion of uncertain
   information from multiple sources. The improvement of location
   estimation is a complicated and comprehensive issue. A lot of research
   has been done to address this issue. However, existing research
   typically focuses on certain aspects of the problem and specific
   methods. This paper reviews mainstream schemes on improving indoor
   location estimation from multiple levels and perspectives by combining
   existing works and our own working experiences. Initially, we analyze
   the error sources of common indoor localization techniques and provide
   amultilayered conceptual framework of improvement schemes for location
   estimation. This is followed by a discussion of probabilistic methods
   for location estimation, including Bayes filters, Kalman filters,
   extended Kalman filters, sigma-point Kalman filters, particle filters,
   and hidden Markov models. Then, we investigate the hybrid localization
   methods, including multimodal fingerprinting, triangulation fusing
   multiple measurements, combination of wireless positioning with
   pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), and cooperative localization. Next, we
   focus on the location determination approaches that fuse spatial
   contexts, namely, map matching, landmark fusion, and spatial model-aided
   methods. Finally, we present the directions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Tomographic reconstruction from limited X-ray data is an ill-posed
   inverse problem. A common Bayesian approach is to search for the maximum
   a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the unknowns that integrates the prior
   knowledge, about the nature of biomedical images, into the
   reconstruction process. Recent results on the Bayesian inversion have
   shown the advantages of Besov priors for the convergence of the
   estimates as the discretization of the image is refined. We present a
   spline framework for sparse tomographic reconstruction that leverages
   higher-order basis functions for image discretization while
   incorporating Besov space priors to obtain the MAP estimate. Our method
   leverages tensor-product B-splines and box splines, as higher order
   basis functions for image discretization, that are shown to improve
   accuracy compared to the standard, first-order, pixel-basis.
   Our experiments show that the synergy produced from higher order
   B-splines for image discretization together with the
   discretization-invariant Besov priors leads to significant improvements
   in tomographic reconstruction. The advantages of the proposed Bayesian
   inversion framework are examined for image reconstruction from limited
   number of projections in a few-view setting.}},

Abstract = {{Image quality of Four Dimensional Cone-Beam Computer-Tomography (4DCBCT)
   is severely impaired by highly insufficient amount of projection data
   available for each phase. Therefore, making good use of limited
   projection data is crucial to solve this problem. Noticing that usually
   only a portion of the images is affected by motion, we separate the
   moving part (different between phases) of the images from the static
   part (identical among all phases) with the help of prior image
   reconstructed using all projection data. Then we update the moving part
   and the static part of images alternatively through solving minimization
   problems based on a global (use full projection data) and several local
   (use projection data for respective phase) linear systems. In the other
   word, we rebuild a large over-determined linear system for static part
   from the original under-determined systems and we reduce the number of
   unknowns in the original system for each phase as well. As a result,
   image quality for both static part and moving part are greatly improved
   and reliable 4D CBCT images are then reconstructed.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{4375-4382}},
Abstract = {{If a dilute solution of a polyelectrolyte such as DNA is forced through
   a microcapillary by an electric field, while simultaneously driven by a
   pressure gradient, then the polymer will migrate in directions
   transverse to the field lines. Here we investigate the sharp increase in
   concentration in the center of the channel that arises when the flow and
   electric field drive the polymer in the same direction. We report the
   first systematic investigation of the effects of flow velocity, electric
   field, and ionic strength on the degree of migration. Our experiments
   show that migration increases with increasing shear and electric field
   as predicted by kinetic theory {[}Butler et al., Phys. Fluids, 2007, 19,
   113101], but eventually saturates as suggested by computer simulations
   {[}Kekre et al., Phys. Rev. E: Stat., Nonlinear, Soft Matter Phys.,
   2010, 82, 050803(R)]. The addition of salt reduces the strength of the
   migration, consistent with a screening of longrange hydrodynamic flow
   fields by added salt. However, increasing the ionic strength of a
   Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer solution has much less effect on the degree of
   migration.}},

Abstract = {{Each year in the U.S., 7.4 million surgical procedures involving the
   major vessels are performed. Many of our patients require multiple
   surgeries, and many of the procedures include ``surgical
   exploration{''}. Procedures of this kind come with a significant amount
   of risk, carrying up to a 17.4\% predicted mortality rate. This is
   especially concerning for our target population of pediatric patients
   with congenital abnormalities of the heart and major pulmonary vessels.
   This paper offers a novel approach to surgical planning which includes
   studying virtual and physical models of pulmonary vasculature of an
   individual patient before operation obtained from conventional 3D X-ray
   computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest. These models would provide
   clinicians with a non-invasive, intricately detailed representation of
   patient anatomy, and could reduce the need for invasive planning
   procedures such as exploratory surgery. Researchers involved in the
   AirPROM project have already demonstrated the utility of virtual and
   physical models in treatment planning of the airways of the chest.
   Clinicians have acknowledged the potential benefit from such a
   technology. A method for creating patient-derived physical models is
   demonstrated on pulmonary vasculature extracted from a CT scan with
   contrast of an adult human. Using a modified version of the NIH ImageJ
   program, a series of image-processing functions are used to extract and
   mathematically reconstruct the vasculature tree structures of interest.
   An auto-generated STL file is sent to a 3D printer to create a physical
   model of the major pulmonary vasculature generated from 3D CT scans of
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Proton irradiation from the backside of the samples were employed to
   enhance off-state drain breakdown voltage of AlGaN/GaN high electron
   mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown on Si substrates. Via holes were
   fabricated directly under the active area of the HEMTs by etching
   through the Si substrate for subsequent backside proton irradiation. By
   taking the advantage of the steep drop at the end of proton energy loss
   profile, the defects created by the proton irradiation from the backside
   of the sample could be precisely placed at specific locations inside the
   AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure. There were no degradation of drain current nor
   enhancement of off-state drain voltage breakdown voltage observed for
   the irradiated AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with the proton energy of 225 or 275 keV,
   for which the defects created by the proton irradiations were
   intentionally placed in the GaN buffer. HEMTs with defects placed in the
   2 dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel region and AlGaN barrier using
   330 or 340 keV protons not only showed degradation of drain current, but
   also exhibited improvement of the off-state drain breakdown voltage.
   FLOODS TCAD finite-element simulations were performed to confirm the
   hypothesis of a virtual gate formed around the 2DEG region to reduce the
   peak electric field around the gate edges and increase the off-state
   drain breakdown voltage.}},

Title = {{Across plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria
   thin films}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{12259-12264}},
Abstract = {{A methodology to limit interfacial effects in thin films is proposed and
   explained. The strategy is to reduce the impact of the electrode
   interfaces and eliminate cross grain boundaries that impede ionic
   motion. To this end, highly oriented Nd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (NDC)
   nanocrystalline thin films were grown using pulsed laser deposition
   (PLD) on platinized single crystal a-plane sapphire substrates. High
   resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (HR-XTEM),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) verified
   the films were textured with columnar grains. The average widths of the
   columns were approximately 40 nm and not significantly changed by film
   thickness between 100 and 300 nm. HR-XTEM and XRD determined the \{111\}
   planes of NDC were grown preferentially on top of the \{111\} planes of
   platinum despite the large lattice mismatch between the two planes. From
   the XRD patterns, the out of plane strains on the platinum and NDC
   layers were less than 1\%. This can be explained by the coincident site
   lattice (CSL) theory. Rotating the \{111\} ceria planes 19.11 degrees
   with respect to the \{111\} platinum planes forms a Sigma 7 boundary
   where 1 in 7 cerium lattice sites are coincident with the platinum
   lattice sites. This orientation lowers interfacial energy promoting the
   preferential alignment of those two planes. The across plane ionic
   conductivity was measured at low temperatures (<350 degrees C) for the
   various film thicknesses. It is here shown that columnar grain growth of
   ceria can be induced on platinized substrates allowing pathways that are
   clear of blocking grain boundaries that cause conductivities to diminish
   as film thickness decreases.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to provide a variational interpretation of the
   nonlinear filter in continuous time. A time-stepping procedure is
   introduced, consisting of successive minimization problems in the space
   of probability densities. The weak form of the nonlinear filter is
   derived via analysis of the first-order optimality conditions for these
   problems. The derivation shows the nonlinear filter dynamics may be
   regarded as a gradient flow, or a steepest descent, for a certain energy
   functional with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The second
   part of the paper is concerned with derivation of the feedback particle
   filter algorithm, based again on the analysis of the first variation.
   The algorithm is shown to be exact. That is, the posterior distribution
   of the particle matches exactly the true posterior, provided the filter
   is initialized with the true prior.}},

Abstract = {{In epilepsy it has been challenging to detect early changes in brain
   activity that occurs prior to seizure onset and to map their origin and
   evolution for possible intervention. Besides, preclinical seizure
   experiments need to be conducted in awake animals with images
   reconstructed and displayed in real-time.
   We demonstrate using a rat model of generalized epilepsy that diffuse
   optical tomography (DOT) provides a unique functional neuroimaging
   modality for noninvasively and continuously tracking brain activities
   with high spatiotemporal resolution. We developed methods to conduct
   seizure experiments in fully awake rats using a subject-specific helmet
   and a restraining mechanism.
   For the first time, we detected early hemodynamic responses with
   heterogeneous patterns several minutes preceding the
   electroencephalographic seizure onset, supporting the presence of a
   ``pre-seizure{''} state both in anesthetized and awake rats. Using a
   novel time-series analysis of scattering images, we show that the
   analysis of scattered diffuse light is a sensitive and reliable modality
   for detecting changes in neural activity associated with generalized
   seizure. We found widespread hemodynamic changes evolving from local
   regions of the bilateral cortex and thalamus to the entire brain,
   indicating that the onset of generalized seizures may originate locally
   rather than diffusely. Together, these findings suggest DOT represents a
   powerful tool for mapping early seizure onset and propagation pathways.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{3612-3617}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial biofilms are highly structured, surface associated bacteria
   colonies held together by a cell-generated polymer network known as EPS
   (extracellular polymeric substance). This polymer network assists in
   adhesion to surfaces and generates spreading forces as colonies grow
   over time. In the laboratory and in nature, biofilms often grow at the
   interface between air and an elastic, semi-permeable nutrient source. As
   this type of biofilm increases in volume, an accommodating compression
   of its substrate may arise, potentially driven by the osmotic pressure
   exerted by the EPS against the substrate surface. Here we study Bacillus
   subtilis biofilm force generation by measuring the magnitude and rate of
   deformation imposed by colonies against the agar-nutrient slabs on which
   they grow. We find that the elastic stress stored in deformed agar is
   orders of magnitude larger than the drag stress associated with pulling
   fluid through the agar matrix. The stress exerted by the biofilm is
   nearly the same as the osmotic pressure generated by the EPS, and mutant
   colonies incapable of producing EPS exert much lower levels of stress.
   The fluid flow rate into B. subtilis biofilms suggest that EPS generated
   pressure provides some metabolic benefit as colonies expand in volume.
   These results reveal that long-term biofouling and colony expansion may
   be tied to the hydraulic permeability and elasticity of the surfaces
   that biofilms colonize.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated four sensor technologies (near-infrared (NIR),
   Raman spectroscopy, electro-chemical, and colorimetry) to determine a
   feasible approach for an in-field soil phosphorus (available P)
   measurement system. The dataset consisted of 12 North American
   Proficiency Testing Program (NAPT) soils and 12 wet Kansas soils (P
   range of 5 to 156.0 mg kg(-1)). An NIR spectrometer showed an R-2 >=
   0.43 and a ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) of 1.372, which did
   not reach the goal (RPD = 2 and R-2 >= 0.70). For a Raman spectrometer,
   a partial least squares (PLS) regression and a simple linear regression
   method of calibration were tested; however, both methods showed poor
   results (RPD = 1.21 and R-2 = 0.27 or lower). Customized cobalt
   ion-selective electrodes were tested in Mehlich 3 extraction solutions
   and resulted in poor results (R-2 = 0.44 and RPD = 1.33) for NAPT soils.
   A rapid colorimetric method was developed consisting of a shortened
   extraction (1 min), rapid filtration (syringe filter), and rapid color
   development (1 min with stirring at 50 degrees C), which had an
   excellent R-2 of 0.98 for each change independently. The rapid
   colorimetric method was compared to the standard colorimetric analysis.
   This test resulted in an R-2 of 0.85 and an RPD of 1.94 for all NAPT
   samples, and soils with P < 80 mg kg(-1) had an R-2 of 0.95 and an RPD
   of 4.74. For field soils, the R-2 was 0.85 and the RPD was 1.91 for all
   ranges, and an R-2 of 0.83 and an RPD of 2.12 was found for soils with P
   < 80 mg kg(-1). Considering that it is not necessary to measure soil P
   contents precisely in areas where fertilizer does not need to be
   applied, this rapid colorimetric method would be used for in-field soil
   P measurement systems.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{171-194}},
Abstract = {{The loading problem in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) consider
   several different manufacturing settings and objective functions but
   some crucial aspects of FMS environments, such as flexible process plans
   (FPP), have not yet received adequate attention. FPPs are vital in
   coping with bottlenecks and breakdowns, and decreasing the flow time.
   Modelling FPPs within a loading model, however, increases the problem
   complexity. In this study, we work on the integrated version of FMS part
   type selection and loading problems, and propose two models that
   consider operation allocation at different levels of detail for an FMS
   with FPP. Operation allocation is modelled explicitly along with tool
   loading in our first model, while the second one considers it implicitly
   to obtain a more compact and efficient formulation. Both models show
   remarkable reduction in run time compared to an existing loading model
   proposed for a similar FMS environment.}},

Abstract = {{Earth-abundant and nontoxic sulfur (S) is emerging as a key element for
   developing new materials for sustainable energy. Knowledge gaps,
   however, still remain regarding the fundamental properties of sulfur
   especially on a theoretical level. Here, a comprehensive
   first-principles study has been performed to examine the predicted
   structural, elastic, phonon, thermodynamic, and optical properties of
   alpha-S-8 (alpha-S) as well as energy-related sulfides. A variety of
   exchange-correlation (X-C) functionals and van der Waals corrections in
   terms of the D3 method have been tested to probe the capability of
   first-principles calculations. Comparison of predicted quantities with
   available experimental data indicates that (i) the structural
   information of alpha-S is described very well using an improved
   generalized gradient approximation of PBEsol; (ii) the band gap and
   dielectric tensor of alpha-S are calculated perfectly using a hybrid X-C
   functional of HSE06; (iii) the phonon and elastic properties of alpha-S
   are predicted reasonably well using for example the X-C functionals of
   LDA and PBEsol, and in particular the PBE + D3 and the PBEsol + D3
   method; and (iv) the thermodynamic properties of alpha-S are computed
   accurately using the PBEsol + D3 method. Examinations using Li2S, CuS,
   ZnS, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), SnS, Sn2S3, SnS2, beta-S-8 (beta-S), and
   gamma-S-8 (gamma-S) validate further the crucial role of the van der
   Waals correction, thus suggesting the X-C functionals are PBEsol + D3
   and PBE + D3 (and PBEsol in some cases) for sulfur as well as
   S-containing materials. We also examine the possibility by using the
   Debye model to predict thermodynamic properties of unusual materials,
   for example, alpha-S. In addition, the bonding characteristics and
   non-polar nature of alpha-S have been revealed quantitatively from
   phonon calculations and qualitatively from the differential charge
   density.}},

Abstract = {{The low solubility of cisplatin in aqueous solution limits the treatment
   effectiveness and the application of cisplatin in various kinds of
   drug-eluting devices. Although cisplatin has a high solubility in
   Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the toxicity of cisplatin can be greatly
   reduced while dissolved in DMSO. In this study, the solid powder of
   cisplatin-loaded albumin mesospheres (CDDP/DMSO-AMS), in a size range of
   1 to 10 mu m, were post-loaded with cisplatin and showed high cisplatin
   content (16\% w/w) and effective cytotoxicity to lung cancer cells.
   Cisplatin were efficiently absorbed into the albumin mesospheres (AMS)
   in DMSO and, most importantly, the toxicity of cisplatin was remained at
   100\% after the loading process. This CDDP/DMSO-AMS was designed for the
   intratumoral injection through the bronchoscopic catheter or dry powder
   inhalation (DPI) due to its high stability in air or in solution. This
   CDDP/DMSO-AMS showed a fast cisplatin release within 24 hours. In the in
   vitro study, CDDP/DMSO-AMS showed high effectiveness on killing the lung
   cancer cells including the non-small cell lung cancer (NCL-H23 and
   A549), malignant mesothelioma (CRL-2081) and the mouse lung carcinoma
   (Lewis lung carcinoma) cell lines. The albumin based mesospheres provide
   an ideal loading matrix for cisplatin and other metal-based drugs due to
   the high swelling degree and fast uptake rate in the organic solvents
   with high polarity. In addition, to investigate the effects of
   polysaccharides, such as chitosan and chondroitin, on enhancing loading
   efficiency and lasting cytotoxicity of cisplatin, the
   polysaccharide-modified albumin mesospheres were synthesized and loaded
   with cisplatin in this study.}},

Title = {{Kernel Temporal Differences for Neural Decoding}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{We study the feasibility and capability of the kernel temporal
   difference (KTD)(lambda) algorithm for neural decoding. KTD(lambda) is
   an online, kernel-based learning algorithm, which has been introduced to
   estimate value functions in reinforcement learning. This algorithm
   combines kernel-based representations with the temporal difference
   approach to learning. One of our key observations is that by using
   strictly positive definite kernels, algorithm's convergence can be
   guaranteed for policy evaluation. The algorithm's nonlinear functional
   approximation capabilities are shown in both simulations of policy
   evaluation and neural decoding problems (policy improvement). KTD can
   handle high-dimensional neural states containing spatial-temporal
   information at a reasonable computational complexity allowing real-time
   applications. When the algorithmseeks a propermapping between a monkey's
   neural states and desired positions of a computer cursor or a robot arm,
   in both open-loop and closed-loop experiments, it can effectively learn
   the neural state to action mapping. Finally, a visualization of the
   coadaptation process between the decoder and the subject shows the
   algorithm's capabilities in reinforcement learning brain machine
   interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Solid state electrochemical cells were employed to obtain standard Gibbs
   energy of formation of Ga2Se3 as well as the temperature and enthalpy of
   the alpha to beta-Ga2Se3 transformation in the Ga-Se system. The
   reversible Emfs of the following solid-state electrochemical cells were
   measured: Pt, Ga(l), Ga2O3(s)parallel to YSZ parallel to Ga2O3(s),
   GaSe(s), Liquid1, C, Pt I; Pt, Ga(l), Ga2O3(s)parallel to YSZ parallel
   to Ga2O3(s), GaSe(s), Ga2Se3(s), C, Pt II; Pt, Ga(l), Ga2O3 (s)parallel
   to YSZ parallel to Ga2O3(s), Ga2Se3(s), Liquid2, C, Pt III. The standard
   molar Gibbs energy of formation of Ga2Se3, which was calculated by
   analysis of measured data, is given by: Delta G(f)(o)(Ga2Se3, alpha) +/-
   1.00(kJ/mol) = -442.65 + 0.11816 T(K) (823 - 962 K); Delta
   G(f)(o)(Ga2Se3, beta) +/- 0.48(kJ/mol) = -425.46+ 0.10086 T(K (986 -
   1100 K). The thermodynamic and phase diagram data in the Ga-Se system
   were critically assessed. A self consistent set of thermochemistry and
   phase diagram data was obtained with the help of thermochemical
   measurements. The liquid phase was modeled by the associated solution
   model with two associates of GaSe and Ga2Se3. The alpha-Ga2Se3 phase was
   described by the sublattice model with two sublattices according to the
   formula (Ga,Va)2 (Se,Va)3. The other two intermediate phases, GaSe and
   beta-Ga2Se3 were treated as line compounds. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of efficiently allocating the capacity of a
   number of service facilities (prone to congestion) to a set of users
   with private information regarding their willingness to pay for
   different combinations of throughput versus latency. Auction mechanisms
   can be used to schedule the service capacity of available facilities.
   However, the interdependency of users' valuations implies that simple
   uniform price adjustment processes (e.g., tatonnement) either fail to
   effectively clear or are subject to strategic manipulation. In this
   paper, we propose an iterative auction design and show that (i) it is
   efficient (i.e., the auction closes with the allocation of service that
   maximizes the social welfare) and (ii) it is strategy-proof, that is, it
   is a dominant strategy for users to truthfully reveal their demand for
   service capacity throughout the auction.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel framework, namely, accelerated alternating direction

   of AADMM is better than that of linearized ADMM, in terms of their
   dependence on the Lipschitz constant of the smooth component. Moreover,
   AADMM is capable of dealing with the situation when the feasible region
   is unbounded, as long as the corresponding saddle point problem has a
   solution. A backtracking algorithm is also proposed for practical

Title = {{Ultralow Wear PTFE and Alumina Composites: It is All About
   Tribochemistry}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Over the last decade, researchers have explored an intriguing polymer
   composite composed of granular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) 7C and
   alumina particles. This material is extraordinary because a very small
   amount of alumina additive (<5 wt\%) decreased the wear rate of the PTFE
   composite by over four orders of magnitude. Previous studies have shown
   that this wear resistance was initiated and maintained by the formation
   of a stable, robust, and uniform polymeric transfer film on the surface
   of the countersample. Although its importance to this tribological
   system is clear, the transfer film itself has not been well understood.
   Careful spectroscopic analysis throughout the stages of transfer film
   development revealed that tribochemistry plays a major role in the
   significant wear rate reductions achieved in PTFE and alumina
   composites. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that PTFE chains break due to the
   mechanical stresses at the wear surface and, in the presence of oxygen
   and water in the ambient environment, produce carboxylic acid end
   groups. These carboxylic acid end groups can chelate to the exposed
   metal on the steel surface and nucleate the formation of the transfer
   film. The resulting thin and robust fluoropolymer transfer film protects
   the surface of the steel and changes the sliding interface from polymer
   on steel to polymer on polymer transfer film. These effects keep
   friction coefficients and wear rates low and stable. Ultimately, the
   real mechanisms responsible for the exceptional wear performance of
   these materials are all about the tribochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a solid lubricant known for its low
   friction coefficient and high wear rate. When filled with a low volume
   percent of alumina particles (5 wt\%), its wear rate is decreased over
   four orders of magnitude. The development of a thin, uniform and well
   adhered transfer film during sliding is partially responsible for this
   decrease in wear rate by creating a low shear interface and forming a
   protective layer between the PTFE/alumina sample and metal
   countersample. In this work, a ``striped'' transfer film was generated
   by sliding up to one million reversals over a gradually decreasing
   stroke length. Wear and friction experiments were performed on a
   microtribometer to determine the robustness of the transfer film.
   Interferometry and profilometry were used to measure the height and wear
   of the film. Microscopy was used to investigate the morphology of the
   transfer film over sliding distance.}},

Abstract = {{This work encompasses the thermodynamic characterization and critical
   evaluation of Zr4+ doped ceria, a promising redox material for the
   two-step solar thermochemical splitting of H2O and CO2 to H-2 and CO. As
   a case study, we experimentally examine 5 mol\% Zr4+ doped ceria and
   present oxygen nonstoichiometry measurements at elevated temperatures
   ranging from 1573 K to 1773 K and oxygen partial pressures ranging from
   4.50 x 10(-3) atm to 2.3 x 10(-4) atm, yielding higher reduction extents
   compared to those of pure ceria under all conditions investigated,
   especially at the lower temperature range and at higher pO(2). In
   contrast to pure ceria, a simple ideal solution model accounting for the
   formation of isolated oxygen vacancies and localized electrons
   accurately describes the defect chemistry. Thermodynamic properties are
   determined, namely: partial molar enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free
   energy. In general, partial molar enthalpy and entropy values of Zr4+
   doped ceria are lower. The equilibrium hydrogen yields are subsequently
   extracted as a function of the redox conditions for dopant
   concentrations as high as 20\%. Although reduction extents increase
   greatly with dopant concentration, the oxidation of Zr4+ doped ceria is
   thermodynamically less favorable compared to pure ceria. This leads to
   substantially larger temperature swings between reduction and oxidation
   steps, ultimately resulting in lower theoretical solar energy conversion
   efficiencies compared to ceria under most conditions. In effect, these
   results point to the importance of considering oxidation thermodynamics
   in addition to reduction when screening potential redox materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the Florida Soils Characterization Database (FSCD,
   http://flsoils.ifas.ufl.edu/) was used as source of physical and
   chemical soil parameters for the development of a soils characteristics
   data set to be used for crop growth models. Because this database has
   missing soil parameters within the various soil horizons, a study was
   undertaken to fill in missing data using statistical estimation
   procedures. Three main objectives of this study were to: (i) develop
   procedures to extract soil characteristics data from available soil data
   sources; (ii) convert soil profile data into a format usable by
   simulation models; and (iii) create and evaluate multiple regression
   models to simulate missing soil parameters. We used the conditional
   distribution model to investigate empirical relationships within the
   available measured soil data. A multiregression model is a valuable tool
   that can be used to fill singular or multiple missing soil data in the
   incomplete list of the FSCD. Statistical indexes such as the RMSE and
   the RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) were used to test
   the behavior of a multiregression model in simulating missing soil
   values in the 0- to 20-cm horizon. The results showed that silt, clay,
   organic C, cation exchange capacity, bulk density, and sand could be
   predicted with a model performance that ranged from very good to
   satisfactory. However, pH and saturated hydraulic conductivity were not
   simulated with satisfactory performance levels. The approach taken in
   this study to simulate missing soil parameters is universal, meaning
   that it can be developed anywhere having available a representative
   source of measured soil data of the study area.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{A geostatistical method was applied to optimize an existing
   groundwater-level monitoring network in the Upper Floridan aquifer for
   the South Florida Water Management District in the southeastern United
   States. Analyses were performed to determine suitable numbers and
   locations of monitoring wells that will provide equivalent or better
   quality groundwater-level data compared to an existing monitoring
   network. Ambient, unadjusted groundwater heads were expressed as
   salinity-adjusted heads based on the density of freshwater, well screen
   elevations, and temperature-dependent saline groundwater density. The
   optimization of the numbers and locations of monitoring wells is based
   on a pre-defined groundwater-level prediction error. The newly developed
   network combines an existing network with the addition of new wells that
   will result in a spatial distribution of groundwater monitoring wells
   that better defines the regional potentiometric surface of the Upper
   Floridan aquifer in the study area. The network yields groundwater-level
   predictions that differ significantly from those produced using the
   existing network. The newly designed network will reduce the mean
   prediction standard error by 43 \% compared to the existing network. The
   adoption of a hexagonal grid network for the South Florida Water
   Management District is recommended to achieve both a uniform level of
   information about groundwater levels and the minimum required accuracy.
   It is customary to install more monitoring wells for observing
   groundwater levels and groundwater quality as groundwater development
   progresses. However, budget constraints often force water managers to
   implement cost-effective monitoring networks. In this regard, this study
   provides guidelines to water managers concerned with groundwater
   planning and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates an effective test strategy for structural
   failure criterion characterization. The goals include identification of
   potential failure modes and a better approximation of failure boundary,
   e.g., failure load mapping with respect to geometry and load conditions.
   We typically replicate and test the same structural configuration
   several times in order to deal with noisy observation. However, our
   study shows that replication is not necessarily needed, because of the
   smoothing effect of surrogate models, and we show that exploring with as
   many different configurations as possible is more important. We
   illustrate the failure criterion characterization with two structural
   examples with various surrogate models, including polynomial response
   surface (PRS), support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process
   regression (GPR). We also examine the treatment of replicated test data
   for surrogate fitting. While fitting to all replicated test data works
   well for GPR, fitting only to the mean values of the replicated data
   helps a not-well-tuned surrogate (SVR in this paper) by compensating for
   the proneness to overfitting. When the noise level is significant as
   compared to the error due to surrogate modeling, a denser matrix might
   be prone to overfitting for GPR and SVR.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are important tools in the
   modelling process: they assign confidence to model results, can aid in
   focusing monitoring and preservation efforts, and can be used in model
   simplification. A weakness of global sensitivity and uncertainty
   analysis methodologies is the often subjective definition of prior
   parameter probability distributions, especially in data-poor areas. We
   apply Monte Carlo filtering in conjunction with quantitative
   variance-based global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques to
   address this weakness and define parameter probability distributions in
   the absence of measured data. This general methodology is applied to a
   reservoir model of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. In addition to
   providing a methodology for setting prior parameter distributions,
   results show that the use of Monte Carlo filtering reduces model
   uncertainty and produces simulations that better represent the
   calibrated ranges. Thus, Monte Carlo filtering increases the accuracy
   and precision of parametric model uncertainty. Results also show that
   the most important parameters in our model are the volume thresholds,
   the reservoir area/volume coefficient, floodplain porosity, and the
   island extinction coefficient. The reservoir representing the central
   part of the wetland, where flood waters separate into several
   independent distributaries, is a keystone area within the model. These
   results identify critical areas and parameters for monitoring and
   managing, refine and reduce input/output uncertainty, and present a
   transferable methodology for developing parameter probability
   distribution functions, especially when using empirical models in
   data-scarce areas.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels have become increasingly popular as immobilization materials
   for cells, enzymes and proteins for biosensing applications. Enzymatic
   biosensors that utilize hydrogel as an encapsulant have shown
   improvements over other immobilization techniques such as cross linking
   and covalent bonding. However, to date there are no studies which
   directly compare multiple hydrogel-graphene nanocomposites using the
   same enzyme and test conditions. This study compares the performance of
   four different hydrogels used as protein encapsulants in a mediator-free
   biosensor based on graphene-nanometalenzyme composites. Alcohol oxidase
   (AOx) was encapsulated in chitosan poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAAM),
   silk fibroin or cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) hydrogels, and then spin
   coated onto a nanoplatinum- graphene modified electrode. The
   transduction mechanism for the biosensor was based on AOx-catalyzed
   oxidation of methanol to produce hydrogen peroxide. To isolate the
   effect(s) of stimulus response on biosensor behavior, all experiments
   were conducted at 25 degrees C and pH 7.10. Electroactive surface area
   (ESA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), sensitivity to
   methanol, response time, limit of detection, and shelf life were
   measured for each bionanocomposite. Chitosan and PNIPAAM had the highest
   sensitivity (0.46 +/- 0.2 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 mu A mM(-1), respectively) and
   electroactive surface area (0.2 +/- 0.06 and 0.2 +/- 0.02 cm(2),
   respectively), as well as the fastest response time (4.3 +/- 0.8 and 4.8
   +/- 1.1 s, respectively). Silk and CNC demonstrated lower sensitivity
   (0.09 +/- 0.02 and 0.15 +/- 0.03 mu A mM(-1), respectively), lower
   electroactive surface area (0.12 +/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.03 cm(2),
   respectively), and longer response time (8.9 +/- 2.1 and 6.3 +/- 0.8 s,
   respectively). The high porosity of chitosan, PNIPAAM, and silk gels led
   to excellent transport, which was significantly better than CNC
   bionanocomposites. Electrochemical performance of CNC bionanocomposites
   were relatively poor, which may be linked to poor gel stability. The
   differences between the Chitosan/PNIPAAM group and the Silk/CNC group
   were statistically significant (p < 0.05) based on ANOVA. Each of these

   literature, while some attributes were significantly improved (namely
   response time and shelf life). The main advantages of these hydrogel
   composites over other devices is that only one enzyme is required, all
   materials are non-toxic, the sensor does not require
   mediators/cofactors, and the shelf life and response time are
   significantly improved over other devices.}},

Abstract = {{Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening is a bacterial infection which is
   spread by a citrus psyllid. No effective cure for this disease has been
   reported yet, and the HLB-infected tree will eventually die. Therefore,
   the infected tree must be detected and removed immediately to stop the
   spread of the disease. One of the symptoms of HLB is the accumulation of
   starch which creates blotchy mottles in an asymmetrical pattern on
   infected citrus leaves. These blotchy mottles symptoms may be confused
   with the deficiency of certain nutrients such as zinc or magnesium. We
   showed in a previous study that the unique capability of starch to
   rotate the polarization planar of light can be employed to identify the
   HLB-infected citrus leaves and differentiate them from zinc or magnesium
   deficiency. In this study, a vision sensor was developed for the purpose
   of real-time HLB detection for use under field conditions. The sensor
   included a highly sensitive monochrome camera, narrow band high power
   LEDs, and polarizing filters. The sensor was first tested and calibrated
   in a simulated field condition in a laboratory. Then, it was tested in a
   citrus grove. Two simple image descriptors; mean and standard deviation
   of gray values, were used for the purpose of classification. The results
   showed that the sensor clearly highlighted the starch accumulation in
   the HLB-infected leaf and differentiated it from visually analogous
   symptoms of zinc deficiency. HLB detection accuracies which ranged from
   95.5\% to 98.5\% were achieved during the laboratory and field
   experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extra-cellular molecules trigger a response inside the cell by
   initiating a signal at special membrane receptors (i.e., sources), which
   is then transmitted to reporters (i.e., targets) through various chains
   of interactions among proteins. Understanding whether such a signal can
   reach from membrane receptors to reporters is essential in studying the
   cell response to extra-cellular events. This problem is drastically
   complicated due to the unreliability of the interaction data. In this
   paper, we develop a novel method, called PReach (Probabilistic
   Reachability), that precisely computes the probability that a signal can
   reach from a given collection of receptors to a given collection of
   reporters when the underlying signaling network is uncertain. This is a
   very difficult computational problem with no known polynomial-time
   solution. PReach represents each uncertain interaction as a bi-variate
   polynomial. It transforms the reachability problem to a polynomial
   multiplication problem. We introduce novel polynomial collapsing
   operators that associate polynomial terms with possible paths between
   sources and targets as well as the cuts that separate sources from
   targets. These operators significantly shrink the number of polynomial
   terms and thus the running time. PReach has much better time complexity
   than the recent solutions for this problem. Our experimental results on
   real data sets demonstrate that this improvement leads to orders of
   magnitude of reduction in the running time over the most recent methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates collaborative task execution between a mobile
   device and a cloud clone for mobile applications under a stochastic
   wireless channel. A mobile application is modeled as a sequence of tasks
   that can be executed on the mobile device or on the cloud clone. We aim
   to minimize the energy consumption on the mobile device while meeting a
   time deadline, by strategically offloading tasks to the cloud. We
   formulate the collaborative task execution as a constrained shortest
   path problem. We derive a one-climb policy by characterizing the optimal
   solution and then propose an enumeration algorithm for the collaborative
   task execution in polynomial time. Further, we apply the LARAC algorithm
   to solving the optimization problem approximately, which has lower
   complexity than the enumeration algorithm. Simulation results show that
   the approximate solution of the LARAC algorithm is close to the optimal
   solution of the enumeration algorithm. In addition, we consider a
   probabilistic time deadline, which is transformed to hard deadline by
   Markov inequality. Moreover, compared to the local execution and the
   remote execution, the collaborative task execution can significantly
   save the energy consumption on the mobile device, prolonging its battery
   life.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The development of micro aerial vehicles has been hindered by a poor
   understanding of the flight dynamics associated with the unique
   aerodynamic regime. This study experimentally estimates the aerodynamic
   damping derivatives of flat-plate wings with aspect ratios less than 3
   at a Reynolds number of 7.5 x 10(4); when combined with previously
   published results detailing the lateral and longitudinal static loads, a
   dynamic model is developed for low-aspect-ratio wings. The
   initial-condition response of the linear equations of motion shows that
   the loading created by roll stall results in purely aerodynamic lateral
   modes which, unlike conventional aircraft, are not attributed to
   geometric features, such as the vertical tail; this response was
   favorably compared with the integration of the full nonlinear equations.
   The mode is manifested by divergent, high-amplitude perturbations in
   sideslip, bank angle, and roll rate; furthermore, it is seen to be
   affected by angle of attack variations, which significantly alter the
   instantaneous value of the roll stability derivative L-beta. If the
   input frequency of the angle of attack oscillations is close to the
   natural frequency of the pure lateral mode, the bank angle is seen to
   drift away from its equilibrium value due to an attenuated restoring
   roll moment. This represents a previously unconsidered stability mode,
   referred to as roll-resonance, which couples the lateral and
   longitudinal stability axes for small perturbations from equilibrium
   flight conditions.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{231-240}},

Abstract = {{Magnetization relaxation mechanisms strongly influence how magnetic
   nanoparticles respond to high-frequency fields in applications such as
   magnetic hyperthermia. The dominant mechanism depends on the mobility of
   the particles, which will be affected in turn by their microenvironment.
   In this study AC susceptometry was used to follow the in situ magnetic
   response of model systems of blocked and superparamagnetic
   nanoparticles, following their cellular internalization and subsequent
   release by freezethaw lysis. The AC susceptibility signal from
   internalized particles in live cells showed only Neel relaxation,
   consistent with measurements of immobilized nanoparticle suspensions.
   However, Brownian relaxation was restored after cell lysis, indicating
   that the immobilization effect was reversible and that nanoparticle
   integrity was maintained in the cells. The results presented demonstrate
   that cellular internalization can disable Brownian relaxation, which has
   significant implications for designing suitable nanoparticles for
   intracellular hyperthermia applications. Further to this, the results
   highlight the possibility that particles could be released in reusable
   form from degrading cells following hyperthermia treatment, and
   subsequently reabsorbed by viable cells.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{1601-1619}},
Abstract = {{Uncertain photolysis rates and emission inventory impair the accuracy of
   state-level ozone (O-3) regulatory modeling. Past studies have
   separately used satellite-observed clouds to correct the model-predicted
   photolysis rates, or satellite-constrained top-down NOx emissions to
   identify and reduce uncertainties in bottom-up NOx emissions. However,
   the joint application of multiple satellite-derived model inputs to
   improve O-3 state implementation plan (SIP) modeling has rarely been
   explored. In this study, Geostationary Operational Environmental
   Satellite (GOES) observations of clouds are applied to derive the
   photolysis rates, replacing those used in Texas SIP modeling. This
   changes modeled O-3 concentrations by up to 80 ppb and improves O-3
   simulations by reducing modeled normalized mean bias (NMB) and
   normalized mean error (NME) by up to 0.1. A sector-based discrete Kalman
   filter (DKF) inversion approach is incorporated with the Comprehensive
   Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx)-decoupled direct method (DDM)
   model to adjust Texas NOx emissions using a high-resolution Ozone
   Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 product. The discrepancy between OMI and
   CAMx NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) is further reduced by
   increasing modeled NOx lifetime and adding an artificial amount of NO2
   in the upper troposphere. The region-based DKF inversion suggests
   increasing NOx emissions by 10-50\% in most regions, deteriorating the
   model performance in predicting ground NO2 and O-3, while the
   sector-based DKF inversion tends to scale down area and nonroad NOx
   emissions by 50 \%, leading to a 2-5 ppb decrease in ground 8 h O-3
   predictions. Model performance in simulating ground NO2 and O-3 are
   improved using sector-based inversion-constrained NOx emissions, with
   0.25 and 0.04 reductions in NMBs and 0.13 and 0.04 reductions in NMEs,
   respectively. Using both GOES-derived photolysis rates and
   OMI-constrained NOx emissions together reduces modeled NMB and NME by
   0.05, increases the model correlation with ground measurement in O-3
   simulations, and makes O-3 more sensitive to NOx emissions in the O-3
   non-attainment areas.}},

Abstract = {{The induction of hyperthermia using nanoparticles, known as magnetic
   fluid hyperthermia (MFH) in combination with anti-cancer drugs is an
   attractive method because of the potential for enhanced anticancer
   effects. Recent studies have shown that cells treated with MFH are more
   sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BZ) than cells treated
   by hot water hyperthermia (HWH) under the same temperature conditions.
   We hypothesized that enhanced proteotoxic stress, caused by a
   combination of microtubule damage and an increase in the amount of
   aggregated proteins, may be partially responsible for this observation.
   To test this hypothesis MCF-7 cells were exposed to hyperthermic
   treatment (MFH or HWH) at 43 degrees C or 45 degrees C for 30 minutes.
   Then, aggresome formation and microtubule disruption studies at 30
   minutes or 2.5 hours of recovery time were performed to evaluate the
   progressive effects induced by the two treatments. Cell viability at
   short and long times was evaluated. Aggresome formation and microtubule
   disruption results suggested that one of the mechanisms by which MFH
   enhances BZ cytotoxicity is the formation and subsequent accumulation of
   aggregated proteins in the cytosol due to the interruption of their
   transport to the perinuclear area through microtubules. Our data show
   evidence that MFH induces a more toxic and unmitigated proteotoxic
   stress than HWH under similar temperature conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the stepwise addition of octanuclear iron units into
   mammalian ferritin, a ``stop-and-go{''} synthesis strategy was used to
   prepare two microporous (Langmuir surface area, 490 m(2) g(-1);

   \{{[}Fe-8(mu(4)-O)(4)(mu-4-Me-pz) Cl-12(0.4)(mu-O)(1.8)\}(n) (2), which
   are new members of the EO2 family of polymeric materials (E = C, Si and
   Ge). The secondary building units (SBUs) E =
   {[}Fe-8(mu(4)-O)(4)(mu(4)-R-pz)(12)] (Fe-8) are nanoscale
   pseudo-spherical clusters, rather than single atoms, forming mu-oxo
   Fe-O-Fe linkages between Fe-8-SBUs. The characteristic Fe-O-Fe
   asymmetric stretching mode in the infrared (IR) spectra of these
   compounds appearing at around 800 cm(-1) suggest the formation of
   approximately linear mu-oxo Fe-O-Fe linkages between Fe-8-SBUs in 1 and
   2. We employ the concept of continuous random network (CRN) to describe
   for the first time the framework features of a Fe-8-based amorphous
   materials, in which the average connecting numbers of each Fe-8-cluster
   are similar to 3.7 and similar to 3.6 for 1 and 2, respectively.
   Fe-57-Mossbauer spectroscopic analysis provides insights to the
   intercluster connectivity of 1 and 2 on one hand and to their magnetic
   properties on the other, evident by a magnetic split sextet below 30 K.
   The combination of Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetism measurements
   reveals a spin-glass behavior with T-g of similar to 30 K. The
   hierarchical porous materials 1 and 2 straddle the gap between metal
   oxides and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). This study may open an
   alternative way for the development of multifunctional materials based
   on high nuclearity metal clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of high quality WNxCy barrier films at very low temperature
   using aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) is reported.
   The single-source tungsten nitrido complex, WN(NEt2)(3), was designed to
   reduce the temperature required for WNxCy film deposition in an effort
   to minimize thermal stresses on neighboring layers in device structures.
   Using either pyridine or heptane as a solvent, WNxCy films were
   successfully deposited at temperatures from 100 to 650 degrees C. Film
   growth in pyridine and heptane at low temperature (100-350 degrees C and
   125-550 degrees C, respectively) showed weak temperature dependence
   consistent with mass-transfer limited growth. At higher temperature the
   growth rate decreased rapidly with apparent activation energy of 0.375
   +/- 0.057 eV. The effects of solvent choice on film properties including
   composition, crystallinity, density, and surface roughness are
   discussed. Films deposited at low temperature (<350 degrees C) were
   highly smooth, amorphous and with a stoichiometry approaching W2NC;
   characteristics desirable for diffusion barrier applications. In Cu
   diffusion barrier tests, Cu (similar to 100 nm)/WNxCy (similar to 5.5
   nm)/Si stacks subjected to a 500 degrees C anneal for 30 min showed no
   indication of Cu diffusion or intermixing of layers, as verified by XRD,
   4-point probe, SEM etch-pit test, and TEM. (C) The Author(s) 2014.

Journal = {{ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{Q21-Q25}},
Abstract = {{AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are desirable for
   space applications because of their relative radiation hardness.
   Predictive modeling of these devices is therefore desired; however,
   physics-based models accounting for radiation-induced degradation are
   incomplete. In this work, we show that a partially ionized impurity
   scatteringmobility model can explain the observed reduction in mobility.
   Electrostatic changes can be explained by confinement of negative charge
   near the 2DEG in the GaN buffer layer. Simulation results from FLOODS (a
   TCAD simulator) demonstrate that partial ionization of donor traps is
   responsible for this phenomenon. Compensation of the acceptor traps by
   the ionized donors in the GaN confine the acceptor traps (negative space
   charge) to a thin layer near the AlGan/GaN interface. The simulation
   results show that near equal concentrations of acceptor traps and donor
   traps of 1 x 10(17) cm(-3) can account for the performance degradation
   of HEMTs given 5MeV proton radiation at a fluence of 2 x 10(14) cm(-2).
   Our results imply that device performance can be accurately simulated by
   simultaneously accounting for mobility and electrostatic degradation in
   TCAD solvers using the presented approach. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe goal of this work is to establish a new dual-modal
   brain-mapping technique based on diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and
   electroencephalographic source localization (ESL) that can
   chronically/intracranially record optical/electroencephalography (EEG)
   data to precisely map seizures and localize the seizure-onset zone and
   associated epileptic brain network.
   MethodsThe dual-modal imaging system was employed to image seizures in
   an experimental acute bicuculline methiodide rat model of focal
   epilepsy. Depth information derived from DOT was used as constraint in
   ESL to enhance the image reconstruction. Groups of animals were compared
   based on localization of seizure foci, either at different positions or
   at different depths.
   ResultsThis novel imaging technique successfully localized the
   seizure-onset zone in rat induced by bicuculline methiodide injected at
   a depth of 1, 2, and 3mm, respectively. The results demonstrated that
   the incorporation of the depth information from DOT into the ESL image
   reconstruction resulted in more accurate and reliable ESL images.
   Although the ESL images showed a horizontal shift of the source
   localization, the DOT identified the seizure focus accurately. In one
   case, when the bicuculline methiodide (BMI) was injected at a site
   outside the field of view (FOV) of the DOT/ESL interface, ESL gave
   false-positive detection of the focus, while DOT showed negative
   detection.
   SignificanceThis study represents the first to identify seizure-onset
   zone using implantable DOT. In addition, the combination of DOT/ESL has
   never been documented in neuroscience and epilepsy imaging. This
   technology will enable us to precisely measure the neural activity and
   hemodynamic response at exactly the same tissue site and at both
   cortical and subcortical levels.}},

Abstract = {{Air injected into an aquifer during air sparging normally flows upward
   according to the pressure gradients and buoyancy, and the direction of
   air flow depends on the natural hydrogeologic setting. In this study, a
   new method for controlling air flow paths in the saturated zone during
   air sparging processes is presented. Two hydrodynamic parameters,
   viscosity and surface tension of the aqueous phase in the aquifer, were
   altered using appropriate water-soluble reagents distributed before
   initiating air sparging. Increased viscosity retarded the travel
   velocity of the air front during air sparging by modifying the viscosity
   ratio. Using a one-dimensional column packed with water-saturated sand,
   the velocity of air intrusion into the saturated region under a constant
   pressure gradient was inversely proportional to the viscosity of the
   aqueous solution. The air flow direction, and thus the air flux
   distribution was measured using gaseous flux meters placed at the sand
   surface during air sparging experiments using both two-, and
   three-dimensional physical models. Air flow was found to be influenced
   by the presence of an aqueous patch of high viscosity or suppressed
   surface tension in the aquifer. Air flow was selective through the
   low-surface tension (46.5 dyn/cm) region, whereas an aqueous patch of
   high viscosity (2.77 cP) was as an effective air flow barrier. Formation
   of a low-surface tension region in the target contaminated zone in the
   aquifer, before the air sparging process is inaugurated, may induce air
   flow through the target zone maximizing the contaminant removal
   efficiency of the injected air. In contrast, a region with high
   viscosity in the air sparging influence zone may minimize air flow
   through the region prohibiting the region from de-saturating. (C) 2014

   interfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The flow within a liquid droplet steadily translating along an
   axisymmetric microtube is investigated experimentally and compared with
   a model to predict the invariants of the flow, that is circulation,
   hydrodynamic impulse, and kinetic energy. The model is based on pipe
   Poiseuille flow and allows for variable aspect ratio, AR. The invariants
   are computed from the velocity fields, which are measured with micro
   digital particle image velocimetry. The non-dimensionalized experimental
   invariants show negligible dependence on the Reynolds number, within the
   small range investigated (similar to 1.5-13), which also agrees with the
   model. The effect of introducing a fluid interface is found to increase
   the observed magnitude of invariants in low-AR droplets above those in
   continuous flow. Also increased are the average rates at which
   invariants are advected across a hypothetical flux plane within the
   tube. The increase in these rates above continuous flow goes as AR(-1).
   The momentum flux is similarly increased for low-AR and is mainly
   attributed to the converging/diverging radial velocities near the
   trailing/leading interfaces. The momentum flux is also compared with
   available synthetic jet data. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The production of Portland cement (PC) can result in the release of
   trace amounts of mercury (Hg) in stack emissions. As a means of
   controlling Hg stack emissions at Portland cement kiln operations, some
   facilities have instituted a process known as dust shuttling, where
   baghouse filter dust (BFD), a partially calcined byproduct, is collected
   and blended with PC as an inorganic process addition, instead of
   returning the material to the kiln pyro-process. In response to
   questions raised regarding environmental impacts of recycling BFD into
   concrete products, research was performed to investigate the chemical
   composition of BFD and to assess the potential for leaching of trace
   metals from concrete products amended with BFD. Leaching of monolithic
   concrete under submerged conditions was examined as a function of time;
   concentrations of detected elements were found to be below applicable
   risk thresholds. Despite elevated Hg in the BFD relative to the PC, no
   elevated Hg risk was observed. Leachates from raw BFD did exceed
   risk-based thresholds for Se and V. However, leaching of size-reduced
   BFD-amended concrete did not show concentrations of these elements above
   applicable risk based thresholds. The results of this study suggest that
   the use of BFD as an inorganic process addition, within the percentages
   currently allowed by US industry standards, does not pose any additional
   risk with respect to direct human hazard or leaching of trace metals to
   water supplies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tests on a single active degree of freedom flapping platform are used to
   investigate the relationship between span-wise/chord-wise stiffness and
   hovering performance. The intended application is to establish
   constraints in a multi-objective optimization (thrust-power) that avoid
   selection of wings that perform poorly. It can also have utility as an
   alternative engine for identifying favorable performance. The procedure
   used to make the stiffness measurements is detailed along with the
   post-processing approach. Twelve wing designs, adapted from a previous
   study, were tested in both directions to extract a figure of merit that
   combines both stiffness values into a non-dimensional parameter
   (SCratio). The wings were also tested for thrust performance and current
   consumption across three different flapping frequencies (20, 25, and 30
   Hz). A comparison is provided that identifies the added benefit of
   considering power consumption when selecting a wing for favorable
   performance. The data for 20 and 25 Hz flapping frequencies suggest a
   decrease in efficiency with increased SCratio, while the 30 Hz flapping
   frequency data was unimodal. This suggests the presence of a point or
   region on the spectrum of SCratio that provides optimum efficiency.}},

Title = {{Polymerization-induced thermal self-assembly (PITSA)}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{1230-1236}},
Abstract = {{Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) is a versatile technique to
   achieve a wide range of polymeric nanoparticle morphologies. Most
   previous examples of self-assembled soft nanoparticle synthesis by PISA
   rely on a growing solvophobic polymer block that leads to changes in
   nanoparticle architecture during polymerization in a selective solvent.
   However, synthesis of block copolymers with a growing stimuli-responsive
   block to form various nanoparticle shapes has yet to be reported. This
   new concept using thermoresponsive polymers is termed
   polymerization-induced thermal self-assembly (PITSA). A reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of
   N-isopropylacrylamide from a hydrophilic chain transfer agent composed
   of N, N-dimethylacrylamide and acrylic acid was carried out in water
   above the known lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm). After reaching a certain chain
   length, the growing PNIPAm self-assembled, as induced by the LCST, into
   block copolymer aggregates within which dispersion polymerization
   continued. To characterize the nanoparticles at ambient temperatures
   without their dissolution, the particles were crosslinked immediately
   following polymerization at elevated temperatures via the reaction of
   the acid groups with a diamine in the presence of a carbodiimide. Size
   exclusion chromatography was used to evaluate the unimer molecular
   weight distributions and reaction kinetics. Dynamic light scattering and
   transmission electron microscopy provided insight into the size and
   morphologies of the nanoparticles. The resulting block copolymers formed
   polymeric nanoparticles with a range of morphologies (e.g., micelles,
   worms, and vesicles), which were a function of the PNIPAm block length.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a direct double-frequency ripple current control in
   a single-phase high-power fuel cell converter that can achieve
   low-frequency ripple-free input current without using large electrolytic
   capacitors. To eliminate the double-frequency ripple current disturbance
   introduced by the single-phase inverter load, a proportional-resonant
   controller is developed to achieve an extra high control gain at
   designed resonant frequency. This high gain can be viewed as the virtual
   high impedance for blocking the double-frequency ripple energy
   propagation from inverter load to fuel cell stack. More particularly,
   the proposed control system can realize the utilization of all
   capacitive ripple energy sources in the system by regulating all the
   capacitors to have large voltage swing. In addition, this voltage swing
   is synchronized to keep real-time balancing of the transformer
   primary-and secondary-side voltages. As a result, the
   zero-voltage-switching operation for all switching devices in the dc-dc
   stage can be guaranteed. The controller design guidelines are derived
   based on the system small-signal model. The experimental results are
   presented to validate the theoretical analysis and proposed technology.}},

Abstract = {{With silicon optical technology moving toward maturity, the use of
   photonic networks-on-chip (NoCs) for global chip communication is
   emerging as a promising solution to the communication requirements of
   future many core processors. It is expected that photonic NoCs will play
   an important role in alleviating current power, latency, and bandwidth
   constraints. However, photonic NoCs are sensitive to ambient temperature
   variations because their basic constituents, ring resonators, are
   themselves sensitive to those variations. Since ring resonators are
   basic building blocks for photonic modulators, switches, multiplexers,
   and demultiplexers, variations of on-chip temperature pose serious
   challenges to the proper operation of photonic NoCs. Proposed methods
   that mitigate the effects of temperature at the device level are either
   difficult to use in CMOS processes or not suitable for large scale
   implementation. In this paper, we propose Aurora, a thermally resilient
   photonic NoC architecture design that supports reliable and low bit
   error rate (BER) on-chip communications in the presence of large
   temperature variations. Our proposed architecture leverages cross-layer
   solutions at the device, architecture, and operating system (OS) layers
   that individually provide considerable improvements and synergistically
   provide even more significant improvements. To compensate for small
   temperature variations, our design varies the bias current through ring
   resonators. For larger temperature variations, we propose
   architecture-level techniques to reroute messages away from hot regions,
   and through cooler regions, to their destinations. We also propose a
   thermal/congestion-aware coscheduling algorithm at the OS level to
   further lower BER by reorganizing the thermal profile of the chip. Our
   simulation results show that Aurora provides a robust architectural
   solution to handle temperature variation effects on future photonic
   NoCs. For instance, average BER and message error rate are reduced by
   96\% and 85\%, respectively, when the combined thermal optimization
   scheme {[}shortest path first + OS] is applied. From the perspective of
   power efficiency, Aurora is also superior to conventional photonic NoC
   architectures by as much as 37\%.}},

Title = {{Impact of vacancy ordering on thermal transport in crystalline
   phase-change materials}},
Journal = {{REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Controlling thermal transport in solids is of paramount importance for
   many applications. Often thermal management is crucial for a device's
   performance, as it affects both reliability and power consumption. A
   number of intricate concepts have been developed to address this
   challenge, such as diamond-like coatings to enhance the thermal
   conductivity or low symmetry complex super-structures to reduce it.
   Here, a different approach is pursued, where we explore the potential of
   solids with a high yet controllable degree of disorder. Recently, it has
   been demonstrated that an unconventionally high degree of structural
   disorder characterizes a number of crystalline phase-change materials
   (PCMs). This disorder strongly impacts electronic transport and even
   leads to disorder induced localization (Anderson localization). This
   raises the question how thermal transport is affected by such
   conditions. Here thermal transport in highly disordered crystalline
   Ge-Sb-Te (GST) based PCMs is investigated. Glass-like thermal properties
   are observed for several crystalline PCMs, which are attributed to
   strong scattering by disordered point defects. A systematic study of
   different compounds along the pseudo-binary line between GeTe and Sb2Te3
   reveals that disordered vacancies act as point defects responsible for
   pronounced phonon scattering. Annealing causes a gradual ordering of the
   vacancies and leads to a more `crystal-like' thermal conductivity. While
   both vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom are affected by
   disorder, the consequences differ for different stoichiometries. This
   opens up a pathway to tune electrical and thermal transport by
   controlling the degree of disorder. Materials with tailored transport
   properties may not only help to improve power efficiency and scaling in
   upcoming phase-change memories but are also of fundamental interest in
   the field of thermoelectric materials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the dynamic traffic assignment problem on a
   two-alternative network with one alternative subject to a dynamic
   pricing that responds to real-time arrivals in a system optimal way.
   Analytical expressions for the assignment, revenue and total delay in
   each alternative are derived as a function of the pricing strategy. It
   is found that minimum total system delay can be achieved with many
   different pricing strategies. This gives flexibility to operators to
   allocate congestion to either alternative according to their specific
   objective while maintaining the same minimum total system delay. Given a
   specific objective, the optimal pricing strategy can be determined by
   finding a single parameter value in the case of HOT lanes. Maximum
   revenue is achieved by keeping the toll facility at capacity with no
   queues for as long as possible. Guidelines for implementation are
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Monitoring ABC-assisted deep inspiration breath hold for left-sided
   breast radiotherapy with an optical tracking system}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Recent knowledge on the effects of cardiac toxicity warrants
   greater precision for left-sided breast radiotherapy. Different
   breath-hold (BH) maneuvers (abdominal vs thoracic breathing) can lead to
   chest wall positional variations, even though the patient's tidal volume
   remains consistent. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of
   using optical tracking for real-time quality control of active breathing
   coordinator (ABC)-assisted deep inspiration BH (DIBH).
   Methods: An in-house optical tracking system (OTS) was used to monitor
   ABC-assisted DIBH. The stability and localization accuracy of the OTS
   were assessed with a ball-bearing phantom. Seven patients with
   left-sided breast cancer were included. A free-breathing (FB) computed
   tomography (CT) scan and an ABC-assisted BH CT scan were acquired for
   each patient. The OTS tracked an infrared (IR) marker affixed over the
   patient's xiphoid process to measure the positional variation of each
   individual BH. Using the BH within which the CT scan was performed as
   the reference, the authors quantified intra-and interfraction BH
   variations for each patient. To estimate the dosimetric impact of BH
   variations, the authors studied the positional correlation between the
   marker and the left breast using the FB CT and BH CT scans. The
   positional variations of 860 BHs as measured by the OTS were
   retrospectively incorporated into the original treatment plans to
   evaluate their dosimetric impact on breast and cardiac organs {[}heart
   and left anterior descending (LAD) artery].
   Results: The stability and localization accuracy of the OTS was within
   0.2 mm along each direction. The mean intrafraction variation among
   treatment BHs was less than 2.8 mm in all directions. Up to 12.6 mm
   anteroposterior undershoot, where the patient's chest wall displacement
   of a BH is less than that of a reference BH, was observed with averages
   of 4.4, 3.6, and 0.1 mm in the anteroposterior, craniocaudal, and
   mediolateral directions, respectively. A high positional correlation
   between the marker and the breast was found in the anteroposterior and
   craniocaudal directions with respective Pearson correlation values of
   0.95 and 0.93, but no mediolateral correlation was found. Dosimetric
   impact of BH variations on breast coverage was negligible. However, the
   mean heart dose, mean LAD dose, and max LAD dose were estimated to
   increase from 1.4/7.4/18.6 Gy (planned) to 2.1/15.7/31.0 Gy (delivered),
   respectively.
   Conclusions: In ABC-assisted DIBH, large positional variation can occur
   in some patients, due to their different BH maneuvers. The authors'
   study has shown that OTS can be a valuable tool for real-time quality
   control of ABC-assisted DIBH. (c) 2015 American Association of

Abstract = {{Sea-level rise is expected to affect natural and urban areas by shifting
   habitats and inundating infrastructure. To plan for a sustainable
   future, it is important to identify both human and ecological
   vulnerabilities to sea-level rise. Here, we simulate impacts to urban,
   developed lands and environmental systems from sea-level rise by
   analyzing land cover (surface cover) and land use (land purpose) in the
   Matanzas River study area in NE Florida. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes
   Model (SLAMM) simulated land-cover change through wetland migration
   under three sea-level rise scenarios. Parcel data, including land use
   classification and land valuation, was overlaid on the simulated, future
   land cover. Our analysis describes a 2- to 5-km-wide longitudinal band
   along the NE coast of Florida of expected land-cover change where
   sea-level rise will likely cause inundation and wetland migration. Under
   a 0.9-m scenario by 2100, 5,332 ha of land (5\% of the study area) will
   be threatened by some type of land-cover change, and inundation was
   estimated to affect approximately US\$177 million in present property
   value. The migration of wetlands out of current areas and into new areas
   is of particular concern because (1) those wetlands will have to keep
   pace with sea-level rise, and (2) accommodation space must be available
   for new wetlands to move into. Developed lands have the possibility of
   hindering up to 6\% of the area that wetlands may migrate into. These
   methods and findings are important for sustainable planning under future
   climate change.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has indicated increased functional connectivity
   between subthalamic nucleus (STN) and sensorimotor cortex in
   off-medication Parkinson's disease (PD) compared with control subjects.
   It is not clear if the increase in functional connectivity between STN
   and sensorimotor cortex occurs in de novo PD, which is before patients
   begin dopamine therapy. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging was carried out in 20 de novo (drug naive) patients with PD
   (Hoehn and Yahr stage: I-II), 19 patients with moderate PD (Hoehn and
   Yahr stage: II-III), and 19 healthy controls. The functional
   connectivity analysis in de novo and moderate PD patients focused on the
   connectivity of the more affected STN and the sensorimotor cortex. Using
   resting-state functional connectivity analysis, we provide new evidence
   that people with de novo PD and off-medicated moderate PD have increased
   functional connectivity between the more affected STN and different
   regions within the sensorimotor cortex. The overlapping sensorimotor
   cortex found in both de novo and moderate PD had functional connectivity
   values that correlated positively with the Unified Parkinson's Disease
   Rating Scale part III. This key finding suggests that changes in
   functional connectivity between STN and sensorimotor cortex occur early
   in the disease following diagnosis and before dopamine therapy. (C) 2015
